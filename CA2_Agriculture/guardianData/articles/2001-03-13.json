Crozier, a Scot and also the Football Association's chief executive, admits that the chances of resurrecting a tournament involving the four home countries are slim but remains optimistic about the chances of reviving the world's oldest international fixture, with the teams facing each other every two years. \"Both sides are looking at it positively, but the congested fixture calendar is a problem,\" Crozier said. \"There is a will to revive the fixture but it's a question of logistics.\" Scotland and England first met in 1872, a 0-0 draw in Glasgow, and the match became an annual event until 1989 when persistent crowd trouble led to the respective FAs deciding to call time on it. The Wales manager Mark Hughes has named Cardiff's Andy Legg, 34, who last played for his country three years ago, and Nottingham Forest's Christian Edwards, who has one cap but has not figured since moving from Swansea two years ago, in his squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers with Armenia and Ukraine four days later. Huddersfield's full-back Steve Jenkins joins them along with Robbie Savage. Although the Leicester midfielder is banned for the match in Yerevan on March 24 he can play when Ukraine visit Cardiff four days later. Wales squad: Jones (Soton), Freestone (Swansea), Crossley (N Forest), Ward (N County), Delaney (A Villa), Jenkins (Huddersfield), Barnard (Barnsley), Roberts (Tranmere), Edwards (N Forest), Legg (Cardiff), Melville, Symons (both Fulham), Page (Watford), Robinson (Charlton), Johnson (N Forest), Jones, Savage (both Leicester), Pembridge (Everton), Robinson (Wolves), Speed (Newcastle), Saunders (Bradford), Roberts (Norwich), Bellamy, Hartson (both Coventry), Blake (Blackburn), Giggs (Man Utd).",

Having got through immigration, we had to haul all our bags off the bus for inspection by customs. The officials are pretty keen to catch locals trying to smuggle in South African goods without paying the duty. I couldn't see any likely looking smugglers amongst our little group but there was a palpable air of nervousness as we waited with our belongings. This was catching and even I began to feel worried.

I almost felt like clapping as we crossed the border.</p> <p>14 hours after we'd started out I arrived in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city. I spent a few days there and liked it a lot. I wandered down the big wide streets and stopped for lunch in noisy, greasy-spoon cafes. I visited the local arts and crafts centre and watched the students carving new pieces. There was also a small gallery of established work in an old colonial building which was very interesting. I stayed just south of the centre at a lovely place called the Travellers' Guesthouse. It was empty except for me. In fact, I've seen very few tourists - the current poltical uncertainties seem to be keeping them away. While this is quite refreshing for me, it's a disaster for the local economy.</p> <p>Leaving Bulawayo, I caught the overnight train to Victoria Falls. I had booked a sleeper compartment which I shared with a pleasant young Zimbabwean called Muny. Muny was very chatty, telling me about his job (he repaired electronic scales), his girlfriend problems (he had two), and his deep longing to buy a motorcycle. Finally, with the night slipping by and a thunderstorm building on the horizon, we clambered up into our narrow bunks and went to sleep.</p> <p>I remember waking in the early hours to sound of cowbells and children calling to each other. I peeked out the window and in the moonlight I saw we had stopped at a station on the edge of the jungle. Dark shapes were moving along the horizon. The local boys were runinng a taxi service to the nearby town using donkey-carts to whisk their passengers away. I went back to sleep as the train continued its excruciatingly slow progress.</p> <p>We reached Victoria Falls seven hours late - which wasn't too bad, apparently. Dumping my rucksack at the hostel, I went straight down to the Falls themselves. I have seen literally hundreds of waterfalls on my travels, but this was the mother of them all.

They had an unusual way of getting people back up. A little chap (who must win the award for the job with the best view in the world) was winched down to grab the jumper, and then they were both pulled back up to the bridge.</p> <p>Tomorrow, I'm going white water rafting on the mighty Zambezi below the Falls.

The move could be manager Jean Tigana's first step in a rebuilding programme as he prepares his his side for the Premiership next season. Managing director Michael Fiddy said in a club statement: \"The club is looking forward to welcoming Alain to Fulham, once he has completed a medical. \"His record has been proven at both domestic and international levels and we are sure he will become a great asset to the team for the rest of the season and for years to come. \"Alain's signing is indicative of the ambition of the football club to achieve the chairman's vision of both Premiership and European honours in the future.\" Goma joined Newcastle for \u00a34.7million in July 1999 after spending 10 years with French outfit Auxerre.",

If anything, he went the other way, urging Mr Blair to deflect the issue from himself. But Downing Street couldn't let that happen. The weight of the cabinet secretary's word isn't what it used to be. Blair had no time for the rules of natural justice, nor for the patience that some were counselling.

If anything, he went the other way, urging Mr Blair to deflect the issue from himself. But Downing Street couldn't let that happen. The weight of the cabinet secretary's word isn't what it used to be. Blair had no time for the rules of natural justice, nor for the patience that some were counselling.

      "bodyText": "Keith Vaz yesterday became the second minister in months to be criticised by Parliament's most powerful watchdog committee for frustrating a \"sleaze\" inquiry into his affairs and being less than candid in answering questions. The criticism of the behaviour of the Foreign Office minister follows a damning attack from the watchdog committee on John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, who was found to have put pressure on a witness giving evidence to Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner. Mr Vaz was largely cleared by the Commons standards and privileges committee of breaching the MPs' code of conduct or Parliament's registration procedures but the report reveals intimidation and threats by Labour party activists. It said: \"This inquiry has taken far too long. If Mr Vaz and other witnesses whom the commissioner asked for information had answered her questions fully and promptly, the commissioner would have been able to complete her report in a much shorter time.\" It singles out Colin Hall, chairman of Mr Vaz's Leicester East Labour party, for particular criticism. It says his threat to put legal and disciplinary pressure on one of the witnesses, Mustapha Kamal, is \"a serious contempt\". Two other officers of the local party, Piara Singh Clair and John Thomas, are condemned for a \"consistently unhelpful attitude ... intended to frustrate the commissioner's investigation.\" Mr Vaz ended up refusing to answer any of Ms Filkin's questions and is chastised by the committee for breaking the code of conduct in not cooperating with her. On the one charge which is upheld - the recommending of an honour for Sarosh Zaiwalla, a City lawyer, without disclosing that he was a Labour donor - Ms Filkin is particularly scathing. She accuses him of initially denying he had accepted two small donations until she had documentary proof - and then refusing to disclose the finances of his family firm, Mapesbury Communications. Ms Filkin was also unable to complete her inquiries into eight allegations because Mr Vaz, his family and Labour party officials declined to co-operate. On his family company, she says: \"Mr Vaz could and should have been more forthcoming in answering my questions about Mapesbury Communications ... given the role of Mr Vaz's wife as director and sole shareholder, it appears beyond doubt that Mr Vaz had direct access to the relevant information.\" Mr Vaz yesterday condemned the 13-month inquiry: \"Whilst I fully support the need to ensure that MPs maintain the highest possible standards of probity, the present procedures give too much latitude to the purveyors of lies and malice,\" he said. His lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman, said: \"I don't think it is right to say he did not cooperate.

With backbench MPs voicing concern about the ability of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to cope with the crisis, a former government vet who helped to deal with the last outbreak in 1967 called for a radical reappraisal of tactics.

At the same time, a former chief economist at the National Farmers' Union argued that the government might soon have to consider reopening tracts of the countryside to prevent a collapse of the rural economy.

The criticism of the behaviour of the Foreign Office minister follows a damning attack from the watchdog committee on John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, who was found to have put pressure on a witness giving evidence to Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner. Mr Vaz was largely cleared by the Commons standards and privileges committee of breaching the MPs' code of conduct or parliament's registration procedures. But it said: \"If Mr Vaz and other witnesses whom the commissioner asked for information had answered her questions fully and promptly, the commissioner would have been able to complete her report in a much shorter time.\" It singles out Colin Hall, chairman of Mr Vaz's Leicester East Labour party, for particular criticism. It says his threat to put legal and disciplinary pressure on one of the witnesses, Mustapha Kamal, is \"a serious contempt\". Two other officers of the local party, Piara Singh Clair and John Thomas, are condemned for a \"consistently unhelpful attitude ... intended to frustrate the commissioner's investigation\". Mr Vaz ended up refusing to answer any of Ms Filkin's questions and is chastised by the committee for breaking the code of conduct in not cooperating with her. On the one charge which is upheld - the recommending of an honour for Sarosh Zaiwalla, a City lawyer, without disclosing that he was a Labour donor - Ms Filkin is particularly scathing. Ms Filkin could not complete her inquiries into eight allegations because Mr Vaz, his family and Labour officials declined to co-operate. Mr Vaz condemned the 13-month inquiry: \"Whilst I fully support the need to ensure that MPs maintain the highest possible standards of probity, the present procedures give too much latitude to the purveyors of lies and malice.\" Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"He is quite unfit to represent Britain.

      "body": "<p>Our announcement last December that we would mount a legal challenge to the Act of Settlement of 1701 caused near paroxysm in some circles. Long-faced columnists queued up in the more monarchically-inclined papers to defend the rather outdated law which bars from the royal succession all those who are not the legitimately conceived Protestant heirs of Queen Sophia of Hanover. \"What we read in the Guardian yesterday,\" intoned one, \"we may one day read in the very last Queen's Speech.\"</p> <p>But away from the quaint pages of the Daily Telegraph there was a more reasonable acceptance that this was an issue deserving of serious attention. In Scotland, for instance, it is a subject which unites rightwing Tories and fervent nationalists. The Scottish assembly voted unanimously (but fruitlessly) to ask for the act to be rescinded. Courtiers quietly admit that Buckingham Palace does not seek to defend the act. Prince Charles is happier to talk of defending faiths than defending one particular faith.</p> <p>Now another significant voice has been added to those who wish to see the Act of Settlement abolished - that of the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn.

      "bodyText": "Our announcement last December that we would mount a legal challenge to the Act of Settlement of 1701 caused near paroxysm in some circles. Long-faced columnists queued up in the more monarchically-inclined papers to defend the rather outdated law which bars from the royal succession all those who are not the legitimately conceived Protestant heirs of Queen Sophia of Hanover. \"What we read in the Guardian yesterday,\" intoned one, \"we may one day read in the very last Queen's Speech.\" But away from the quaint pages of the Daily Telegraph there was a more reasonable acceptance that this was an issue deserving of serious attention. In Scotland, for instance, it is a subject which unites rightwing Tories and fervent nationalists. The Scottish assembly voted unanimously (but fruitlessly) to ask for the act to be rescinded. Courtiers quietly admit that Buckingham Palace does not seek to defend the act. Prince Charles is happier to talk of defending faiths than defending one particular faith. Now another significant voice has been added to those who wish to see the Act of Settlement abolished - that of the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn. In an interview - by pleasing irony, in the Telegraph itself - Lord Williams conceded that the act was discriminatory and argued that it should be amended. As a member of the Church in Wales, which was disestablished in the 1920s, he is not at all alarmed by the prospect that the repeal of the Act of Settlement could lead to the uncoupling from the state of the Church of England. Lord Williams's calm acceptance of the inevitable is welcome. Now all he has to do is repeal the equally objectionable Treason Felony Act of 1848, another archaic law which makes it a crime to call for the abolition of the monarchy, even by peaceful means.

      "body": "<p>Suddenly things are only getting worse - considerably worse for farmers.</p> <p>This time last week the foot and mouth outbreak was still being reported as less serious than the 1967 epidemic; this week it looks worse. Last week all sides were agreed that it was still under control; this week farmers are disputing the ministry's assertions. In the first three weeks of the outbreak, 155,000 animals have already been earmarked for slaughter; in the eight months of the 1967 outbreak, only 433,000 were slaughtered. And yesterday the possibility of slaughtering 500,000 sheep currently being kept in lowland winter quarters was raised, rather than risk spreading the disease by taking them back to their hill farms.</p> <p>Things are getting worse for ministers, too. Last week they were still earning high marks for the way they were handling the disease; this week the headlines have turned. First came complaints from the non farming rural community, like the hotel and tourist industry which is suffering even bigger losses than farmers without any compensation so far. Then came yesterday's splash headline in the Telegraph - Foot and mouth 'is spinning out of control' - with equally negative stories in other papers following accusations by an Irish minister that Britain had mishandled the outbreak. What happens if food shortages return? What happens if schools have to be closed because of the outbreak? Then there is the spectre of 1,000 schools being disrupted by the current dispute over teacher shortages. Suddenly, May 3 does not look like quite such a certain date.</p> <p>Downing Street's response yesterday was to give an even clearer unofficial steer that May 3 was the selected election date. They do not want to be budged, particularly if things look as though they can only get worse. They will have been encouraged by an ICM poll for the BBC showing 63% of those questioned believed the election should go ahead on that day no matter what the status of the foot and mouth outbreak - with even 58% of Tory supporters agreeing.</p> <p>The calmest voice in the political maelstrom belongs to Jim Scudamore, the government's chief vet. He knows it is serious. He acknowledges it has spread further and faster than first envisaged. There was far more movement and mixing of animals than officials had estimated at the start of the outbreak. But what they are doing now is right. Quarantine restrictions have been extremely strict but necessary. Ministers have not been totally inflexible: they were right to relax the rules to allow farmers to gather sheep that were ready to lamb.</p> <p>Slaughter has been right too - as farmers, slaughter houses and the opposition concede - but the delays in disposing of the carcasses has been unfortunate. What the public has failed to understand is that although there were more cases in 1967, the outbreaks this time have involved far more animals as farms have got bigger. Some flocks have numbered over 1,000 animals. These delays are now being tackled. The fleet of trucks now taking carcasses for rendering have been extensively tested and found safe. The opposition has called for the army to be called in. Surely it is better to use experienced contractors, of which there are many thanks to BSE, rather than inexperienced personnel?</p> <p>It is too early to say the ministry has lost control. All currently identified cases can still be traced back to the first outbreak. Once the outbreak is over, there are several modern farming issues to be resolved. But the chief vet - and ministers - are right to remain cool and continue with their present strategy.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

The Leicester East MP was found to have broken the MPs' code of conduct by not declaring a small financial interest with a City lawyer when he recommended him for a political honour. No action will be taken against him for this breach of rules. Mr Vaz also broke Commons rules by failing to disclose a Leicester property in the MPs' register. But the committee decided to allow Mr Vaz to register it without incurring any penalty or criticism. Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards and the Commons standards and privileges committee, rejected nine complaints that Mr Vaz failed to disclose cash donations of thousands of pounds to his office and charities which he supported. Eight other complaints could not be properly investigated by Ms Filkin after witnesses and Mr Vaz refused to cooperate or answer any other questions by the commissioner about them. The standards committee ignored advice from Ms Filkin to demand the production of more documentary evidence or insist witnesses appear and give evidence to MPs on oath. Instead the committee decided that it could not uphold the complaints. The committee found that Mr Vaz broke the MPs' code of conduct by not revealing his dealings with Sarosh Zaiwalla when he recommended the lawyer for an honour in 1997. The lawyer had made a \u00a3250 donation to the minister's constituency office and paid \u00a3250 for an advert on a calendar \"associated with Mr Vaz\", the committee report said. It added that Mr Vaz did not want to disclose the recommendation for an honour because it broke the confidentiality rules surrounding the honours system. The MPs and the commissioner threw out a string of complaints about other donations, including an allegedly undeclared \u00a310,000 donation from the Sikh community to his 1997 election campaign; \u00a33,000 in donations from Mr Zaiwalla to his office; and making misleading entries in the MPs' register of interests. Other inquiries that could not be completed reveal a picture of claim and counter-claim inside Leicester East Labour party. Colin Hall, the constituency chairman, apologised after threatening one of the witnesses with disciplinary and legal action for talking to Ms Filkin. Another allegation that was never fully investigated said Mr Vaz solicited and received payments from a Leicester businessman, Jaffer Kapasi, in return for help in obtaining building sites and planning permission to construct religious buildings and a mosque. Mr Kapasi, a deputy lieutenant of Leicestershire, told journalists that Mr Vaz had received payments from him. But in evidence on oath before the committee later, he retracted the allegations, claiming he had been put under pressure by journalists.

But it also found that officers of the Labour party in Mr Vaz's Leicester East constituency had shown a \"consistently unhelpful attitude\" towards Ms Filkin in a bid to \"frustrate the commissioner's investigation\".

      "body": "<p>As far as the environment went, the Budget sent messages of varying hue. Motorists, including hauliers, benefited from a \u00a31.7bn package. Middle and higher income households gained most from the cuts in fuel duty, while low-income households, especially rural ones, gained more from the extension of the \u00a355 cut in road tax (vehicle excise duty) to cars up to 1,549cc.</p> <p>The reason for the distribution of impacts is that richer households consume more fuel but road tax is a flat payment and car ownership is higher in rural areas. The chart shows some of these effects.</p> <p>As for the environment: cuts in fuel duty will result in more traffic and more pollution, in particular more of the carbon dioxide emissions that are the main cause of climate change. The cut in road tax is likely to have a negligible environmental impact, making car ownership slightly more affordable but encouraging the ownership of smaller, less gas-guzzling cars.</p> <p>As David Begg, chair of the commission for integrated transport, noted on this page last week, one of the factors behind the very small increase in road traffic last year was the hike in petrol prices. In defence of cutting fuel duty, the government would argue that oil price rises have ensured that the price of petrol is now about the same as it would have been if Gordon Brown had not stepped off the fuel duty escalator in November 1999. The logic of this position is that if and when oil prices come down again, the chancellor should put his foot back on.</p> <p>If the chancellor's cuts in diesel and petrol duty are at best environmentally dubious, a lower rate of duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol (ULSP) than on conventional unleaded petrol is more soundly based. There will be a 3p per litre differential when the temporary cut in duty on unleaded petrol is undone in mid-June, after independent retailers have had a chance to secure supplies of ULSP.</p> <p>Cars using ULSP emit fewer nitrogen oxides and other pollutants that contribute to poor air quality and can exacerbate cardiovascular illnesses. ULSP is also needed for direct fuel injection engine technology, which burns fuel more efficiently and produces less carbon dioxide than conventional combustion.</p> <p>The Budget also cut the rates of duty on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) to maintain the differential between these cleaner fuels and petrol and diesel, and promised not to increase them before 2004. However, for buses the effect is negated by the 80% rebate on diesel duty that bus operators now receive, worth \u00a3330m last year. The Budget offered no extra for the programme run by the Energy Saving Trust that provides grants to help purchase clean fuel vehicles, including electric and hybrid vehicles as well as those running on CNG or LPG.</p> <p>In the November pre-Budget report, Brown launched the \"green fuels challenge\" to promote the long-term development and use of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and others produced from renewable sources. From next year, Biodiesel produced from vegetable oils will have a duty rate 20p per litre lower than that on ultra-low sulphur diesel produced from fossil fuels. Pilot projects for hydrogen, methanol, bioethanol and biogas will also be supported with further duty reductions or exemptions.</p> <p>The halving of road tax rates for lorries will harm the environment by making road haulage less expensive in comparison with rail and ensuring that it pays less of its environmental and social costs of pollution, noise and road wear. It is unlikely to do much to reduce competition from overseas. There is no domestic competition from foreign hauliers, since more than 99.9% of deliveries made from and to places within the UK are by UK hauliers.</p> <p>More defensible is the announcement on how some of the \u00a3100m haulage modernisation fund will be spent. Some \u00a330m is for fitting older lorries operating in areas of poor air quality with emissions reduction devices, such as particulate traps. Another \u00a315m is for advice on saving fuel. From December 2001, the new lower road tax rates for lorries will be rationalised into seven bands according to size and emissions standards. The government is also consulting on the introduction of a \"Britdisc\" charged on both foreign and UK lorries.</p> <p>The Budget introduced modest measures to promote green commuting and business travel, such as cycling, works buses and car sharing subsidised by employers. These include an increase in the tax-free mileage rate for cycling to 20p per mile and the introduction of a new tax-free car passenger rate of 5p per mile from April next year. However, the government is sending mixed messages on business car mileage by levelling the authorised mileage rates for all cars to 40p per mile and 25p per mile above a set distance in the tax year but increasing the threshold from 4,000 to 10,000 miles.</p> <p>Overall, the government might be excused for its concessions to motorists in the face of the protests last year and in an election year. Though its actions could have been more socially progressive and more environmentally sustainable it has managed to do some good as well as some harm. It has yet to grasp the full magnitude of the climate change impacts of road transport, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>\u0095 Tony Grayling is at the Institute for Public Policy Research <br><br><a href=\"mailto&quot;t.graying@ippr.org.uk&quot;\">t.grayling@ippr.org.uk</a></p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

Some of the younger patients did improve, but for 15% of those who received the implants, the outcome was worse than the disease.</p> <p>After a year of apparently doing well, these patients began to writhe, jerk their heads uncontrollably and throw their arms about involuntarily as the foetal brain cells that were intended to produce dopamine, the chemical that is depleted in Parkinson's sufferers, went into overdrive. The cells appear to have grown too well and are producing excessive amounts of the chemical. The scientists have no way bringing the dopamine levels back down.</p> <p>Paul Greene, a neurologist from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, who was one of the researchers, said the results were \"absolutely devastating\" for the five patients who cannot control their movements.</p> <p>\"They chew constantly, their fingers go up and down, their wrists flex and distend,\" he told the New York Times. \"It was tragic, catastrophic. And we can't selectively turn it off.\"</p> <p>One man now has to be fed through a tube because he can no longer eat while another periodically becomes unintelligible during the day when the side effects, which in his case come and go, set in.</p> <p>Dr Greene says the technique must go back to the laboratory. \"No more foetal transplants,\" he said. \"We are absolutely and adamantly convinced that this should be considered for research only. And whether it should be research in people is an open question.\"</p> <p>The shocking results of the study are a setback for the scientists who hope that research into stem cells - the basic cells formed by the splitting of a fertilised human egg - may lead to cures for degenerative brain diseases.</p> <p>While scientists cultivating stem cells will have a much clearer idea of the quality and quantity of the material they have than those using foetal tissue, the theory behind the implantation technique - to \"seed\" the brain and encourage regeneration - is the same.</p> <p>The foetal tissue technique has not been used in the UK since an outcry over the use of aborted foetuses put a stop to such research in the 1980s. Brain cells that produce dopamine are extracted from the foetus and cultured.

      "bodyText": "Hopes of an early cure for Parkinson's disease by the implantation of foetal cells into the brain have been dashed by the devastating results of the first full trial of the technique, which found that a number of the patients were left with tragic side effects which cannot be undone. The results of the trial will dismay Parkinson's sufferers around the world who had hoped the controversial treatment, which has been available in experimental form since the 1980s, might eventually spell an end to the crippling disease. The American scientists who conducted the research found the therapy did not benefit patients over the age of 60 at all. Some of the younger patients did improve, but for 15% of those who received the implants, the outcome was worse than the disease. After a year of apparently doing well, these patients began to writhe, jerk their heads uncontrollably and throw their arms about involuntarily as the foetal brain cells that were intended to produce dopamine, the chemical that is depleted in Parkinson's sufferers, went into overdrive. The cells appear to have grown too well and are producing excessive amounts of the chemical. The scientists have no way bringing the dopamine levels back down. Paul Greene, a neurologist from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, who was one of the researchers, said the results were \"absolutely devastating\" for the five patients who cannot control their movements. \"They chew constantly, their fingers go up and down, their wrists flex and distend,\" he told the New York Times. \"It was tragic, catastrophic. And we can't selectively turn it off.\" One man now has to be fed through a tube because he can no longer eat while another periodically becomes unintelligible during the day when the side effects, which in his case come and go, set in. Dr Greene says the technique must go back to the laboratory. \"No more foetal transplants,\" he said. \"We are absolutely and adamantly convinced that this should be considered for research only. And whether it should be research in people is an open question.\" The shocking results of the study are a setback for the scientists who hope that research into stem cells - the basic cells formed by the splitting of a fertilised human egg - may lead to cures for degenerative brain diseases. While scientists cultivating stem cells will have a much clearer idea of the quality and quantity of the material they have than those using foetal tissue, the theory behind the implantation technique - to \"seed\" the brain and encourage regeneration - is the same. The foetal tissue technique has not been used in the UK since an outcry over the use of aborted foetuses put a stop to such research in the 1980s. Brain cells that produce dopamine are extracted from the foetus and cultured. The tissue strands that result are implanted into the areas of the brain that are supposed to produce the chemical. The US trial was the first to be properly controlled. Forty patients, aged from 34 to 75, were randomly assigned to receive either the foetal cells or nothing. To ensure that the results were due to the treatment and not a placebo effect, all the patients underwent surgery - four holes were drilled in the brain, whether foetal cells were put in or not. The outcome, reported in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, will force a rethink over the treatment. Gerald Fischbach who was director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke which funded the study, said that this was the first time a technique which some neurosurgeons promoted as miraculous had been thoroughly evaluated. \"Ad hoc reports of spectacular results can always occur,\" he said. \"But if you do these studies systematically, this is the result you get.\" The surgery in the study was carried out at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, while the evaluation was done in New York. Robert Meadowcroft, director of policy and research at the Parkinson's Disease Society in the UK, said the results were disappointing but did not, in his view, spell the end of any attempt to \"seed\" the brain with either foetal cells or, in the future, stem cells. \"We need to learn how to switch these cells off once they have done their work,\" he said. Within a couple of years, there may be trials of techniques to implant stem cells into the brains of people suffering from degenerative diseases in this country, following the decision by parliament to allow stem cell research. Martin Edwards, chief executive of Reneuron, a UK company working on developing stem cell lines for medical treatment, said he believed the problem with using foetal cells was that nobody could be sure how much dopamine-producing tissue was being implanted. But he said he was convinced that scientists would eventually succeed in helping patients with these distressing brain diseases. \"There are some upsides. The cells have survived and a proportion of patients benefited. I interpret this with cautious optimism.\"",

Her father died shovelling coal on the open hearth at the local steel works. She was fiercely proud of her working class origins and Irish-Catholic roots, and her sense of being an outsider - Catholics were educationally deprived in a state system heavily weighted in favour of Protestants - meant she forged abiding friendships with similar individuals, irrespective of race or nationality.</p> <p>After primary and secondary education by Dominican nuns, Anna briefly taught music - and represented New South Wales in basketball and swimming.

Every year, laden with a huge rucksack of new books, she would trudge along Charing Cross Road, calling in at various bookshops to sell a copy here and there. It did her back in, but there was something of the martyr in her. She loved books in all their stages - from the editing of manuscripts to the supervision of printing and the placement with the bookseller.</p> <p>In later years, the constant struggle to access small grants to subsidise her books or conferences wore Anna down. She began to suffer from physical ailments, and then severe depression. She resigned from Aarhus and wandered the world disconsolately, ending up at Warwick University in 1998 as a visiting fellow.</p> <p>Finally, she returned to a flat overlooking Nobby's Beach, Newcastle, a place of beloved childhood memories. She had been slowly recovering but died suddenly in her sleep, at a friend's house in Sydney.</p> <p>Anna Rutherford, academic and publisher, born November 27 1932; died February 21 2001</p>",

Anna was born in Mayfield, Newcastle, which she once described as \"the industrial working class city of Australia\". Her father died shovelling coal on the open hearth at the local steel works. She was fiercely proud of her working class origins and Irish-Catholic roots, and her sense of being an outsider - Catholics were educationally deprived in a state system heavily weighted in favour of Protestants - meant she forged abiding friendships with similar individuals, irrespective of race or nationality. After primary and secondary education by Dominican nuns, Anna briefly taught music - and represented New South Wales in basketball and swimming. She then studied literature as a mature student at Newcastle University. The Canadian writer Gerry Turcotte once described her as a \"combination of Muhammad Ali and a great white shark\". But Anna's fierce presence disguised a gentleness and generosity which she lavished upon new writers, publishing their poetry in beautiful volumes, and often bearing the cost from her own pocket. It was her love for the finely produced book, and her disdain for the slick commercialism of the publishing industry, that attracted writers to her small press. Every year, laden with a huge rucksack of new books, she would trudge along Charing Cross Road, calling in at various bookshops to sell a copy here and there. It did her back in, but there was something of the martyr in her. She loved books in all their stages - from the editing of manuscripts to the supervision of printing and the placement with the bookseller. In later years, the constant struggle to access small grants to subsidise her books or conferences wore Anna down. She began to suffer from physical ailments, and then severe depression. She resigned from Aarhus and wandered the world disconsolately, ending up at Warwick University in 1998 as a visiting fellow. Finally, she returned to a flat overlooking Nobby's Beach, Newcastle, a place of beloved childhood memories. She had been slowly recovering but died suddenly in her sleep, at a friend's house in Sydney. Anna Rutherford, academic and publisher, born November 27 1932; died February 21 2001",

      "bodyText": "The third degree \u0095 A survey by virginstudent.com has revealed students are not the rampant sexual beasts the public thought. Of 2,600 students surveyed, one in five men and one in 10 women are still virgins. Most of the remainder have had fewer than five partners, almost half believing their current love interest will be there for life. Politics and economics students have the poorest sex lives with 28% staying celibate for their whole time at university. Medical students were most pessimistic of lifelong happiness with their lover, only a third believing it would endure. \u0095 No organisation was more often attacked than the Quality Assurance Agency, education minister Tessa Blackstone told a reception at the Commons to launch its annual report. It wasn't clear if this was a compliment or a new performance target for the agency to stick to. Incidentally, QAA chief John Randall's promised \"light touch\" certainly applies to the THES - they got one invitation compared to the Guardian's four. Not that he loathes the Murdoch publication, you understand. \u0095 Bolton Institute is basking in post TQA glory - one of only 11 institutions to win three 24s from the agency last year (all the rest were old universities) for its departments of psychology, nursing and subjects allied to medicine.

The departure of two eminent philosophers from King's College London to the University of Texas at Austin announced last week will affect the world rankings of philosophy departments, predicts Brian Leiter, who compiles The Philosophical Gourmet Report. www.blackwellpublishersco.uk/gourmet/default.htm.

This is part of a wider remit of the NUJ to ensure that the highest standards are being maintained in the training of journalists.\" </p> <p>It has put forward a motion to the union's annual conference at the end of this month, noting that the course was not accredited by the National Council for the Training of Journalists or the Broadcast Journalism Training Council and instructing the national executive to ask the university \"for a full written explanation as to why the course collapsed, and why it was not accredited\". The motion claims the course does not represent value for its fees of nearly \u00a35,000. </p> <p>Johnny Gutteridge has been unemployed since leaving Europe's first MA of its kind in November last year. He speaks of \"an element of disappointment in the course\". </p> <p>The course was launched in a blaze of publicity three years ago, boasting celebrity guest lecturers Jon Snow, Sue MacGregor and Roger Cook, although they are primarily attached to the BA course. </p> <p>The MA attracted Gutteridge, then working as a press officer for a prominent British charity. He enrolled, hoping to develop some journalistic skills to further his career and possibly move into journalism. </p> <p>\"I wanted to come out of it feeling I had some real professional skills. When I got there, I heard from previous students that they didn't feel they'd come out strong as journalists,\" he said. Hardly surprising when one of the teaching sessions apparently involved the postgrads having to rip'n'read radio bulletins. </p> <p>To add to Gutteridge's unemployment problems, there is the matter of a large debt to the bank for course fees. The university charges a minimum of \u00a34,995 to its students, some of whom are from overseas. </p> <p>\"You're paying all that money and there isn't even a copy of a newspaper there to read,\" confided one of the remaining students, Zoe Hardy. </p> <p>One former student has found a job in publishing. \"It's not what I want,\" she says. After finishing the course, she spent a demoralising year having her story ideas either turned down or pinched by newspaper editors, whom she didn't feel equipped to deal with. </p> <p>But it is not the first time students who have registered dissatisfaction. Postgrads on the very first intake three years ago submitted a complaint to the university listing their concerns. Yet when he asked the course leader, Julian Ives (a former investigative TV journalist), for a copy of the complaint, Gutteridge, like other students who tried, was told he couldn't see it. To this day, the university claims to be \"looking into it\". </p> <p>Before going on leave due to stress, Ives refused to comment on the course, referring enquiries to the university press officer, Jennifer Spencer. \"We did receive a complaint from about half a dozen students but we don't disclose anything about it,\" said Spencer. \"Our corporate complaints process is confidential. The complaint is in the process of being resolved.\" </p> <p>Which is not much help to Gutteridge. \"It's not been a great year for confidence-building,\" he says. </p> <p>And yet the course has strengths. Situated in the heart of Nottingham Trent's successful Centre for Broadcasting and Journalism, it benefits from some of the excellent, experienced lecturers who teach the BJ degree course and has good links with the BBC. But it raises expectations from two types of applicant - those who want to gain professional journalistic skills, and those who wish to study the concept of journalism as an academic subject. It appears to fall between those two stools. </p> <p>\"The students are being promised something that is not being delivered,\" says Zoe Hardy, a part-time media studies teacher and journalist. \"What are not discussed are ideas. I hoped there would be some progression, a chance to study the media critically in greater depth. Some lessons we do I teach at A-level.\" </p> <p>The students aren't the only ones who are leaving. Hugo de Burgh is author of the huge tome, Investigative Journalism, and until recently a lecturer on one of the core modules. He has now taken a post at a London college. </p> <p>\"I've never taught investigative journalism,\" he said. \"I don't know if you can teach it. What I teach is the context and the environment in which it takes place, what has been done and what is being done. Some students (at Nottingham Trent) were very happy and some were not.\" </p> <p>Can investigative journalism be taught? The Nottingham Trent course entry requirements state that \"applicants should have a good undergraduate degree and/or experience of journalism\". The failure to stipulate previous journalistic work is a problem, thinks media studies lecturer Andy Harrison. \"The idea that the students on an MA can be coming cold to the subject is outrageous.\" </p> <p>Gardian investigative journalist David Hencke is convinced that you learn on the job. He edited his university student magazine and worked on a local paper, before doing a \"basic training\" including writing skills, law and shorthand. </p> <p>\"You can't come in as a high-flying reporter, you have to start with the parish fetes, the youth club and the magistrates court. I still make mistakes, but it's better to make the bog standard mistakes at a level where you can't cause too much damage.\" </p> <p>Journalist Paul Foot agrees. \"It's a side of journalism you only really pick up when you are a journalist. People only become 'investigative' journalists when they're established in their own fields. First you have to lie low and do your job, before you can say to your editor, 'Have you ever thought about looking at this?'\" Angela Phillips, who trains journalists at Goldsmiths College, is adamant that the subject can and should be taught at college. \"Journalists always say you can't teach journalism. It's the built-in arrogance of the profession.\" </p> <p>John Pilger, one of the best known reporters of the enquiring kind, doesn't believe in an MA in investigative journalism. \"I hate the term. Why is investigative journalism declared exotic? All journalism should be investigative, from football to cookery. A lot of university courses like this turn out elite groups who get jobs which are quite removed from the real job of journalism.\" </p> <p>The way Pilger learned his trade in Australia, being indentured to a newspaper for four years, hardly exists in Britain today. Getting a full-time place anywhere in the media as an apprentice or trainee is a scoop in itself. Even the BBC, as a public service broadcaster, has only one trainee a year in the whole of the East Midlands. </p> <p>Andy Harrison, a representative for the lecturers' union Natfhe at a Nottingham further education college, blames the culture of funding in education for the temptation to use \"sexy\" and potentially misleading course titles. </p> <p>\"It's the same cycle of problems everywhere,\" he says. \"They take on more courses to get more funding, the staff and resources are overstretched and the standards drop.\" </p> <p>There's also a feeling with media studies that futher education does the work and higher education reaps the results in the form of undergraduates. \"I've had a lot of feedback from my former students in recent years suggesting that they go to university and start out at a lower level from when they finished college,\" says Harrison. </p> <p>The NUJ is among those trying to keep track of the explosion of media courses in Britain. It has pledged to put together a list of courses and monitor the amount and standard of journalistic content. It's now possible to do a solid nine years of media training in the course of a normal academic career: a GCSE, followed by a BND, leading to an HND, converting to a degree and polishing it off with an MA. And your future employer won't have to pay for it. </p> <p>Despite the complaints about the MA, Nottingham's advertisement for next year's course is out in the media press this week. It is still called investigative journalism but with the more modest claim to \"equip students with the skills needed for research work in factual television programmes\". </p> <p>The course title - \"slightly elitist\" in John Pilger's view - should be changed, says Natfhe's Harrison, to \"researching for television, if that's what it is\". </p> <p>And the NUJ view? Nottingham branch secretary Kevin Stanley sums it up: \"I just want students to know what they're letting themselves in for.\"</p>",

The failure to stipulate previous journalistic work is a problem, thinks media studies lecturer Andy Harrison. \"The idea that the students on an MA can be coming cold to the subject is outrageous.\" Gardian investigative journalist David Hencke is convinced that you learn on the job. He edited his university student magazine and worked on a local paper, before doing a \"basic training\" including writing skills, law and shorthand. \"You can't come in as a high-flying reporter, you have to start with the parish fetes, the youth club and the magistrates court. I still make mistakes, but it's better to make the bog standard mistakes at a level where you can't cause too much damage.\" Journalist Paul Foot agrees. \"It's a side of journalism you only really pick up when you are a journalist. People only become 'investigative' journalists when they're established in their own fields. First you have to lie low and do your job, before you can say to your editor, 'Have you ever thought about looking at this?'\" Angela Phillips, who trains journalists at Goldsmiths College, is adamant that the subject can and should be taught at college. \"Journalists always say you can't teach journalism. It's the built-in arrogance of the profession.\" John Pilger, one of the best known reporters of the enquiring kind, doesn't believe in an MA in investigative journalism. \"I hate the term. Why is investigative journalism declared exotic? All journalism should be investigative, from football to cookery. A lot of university courses like this turn out elite groups who get jobs which are quite removed from the real job of journalism.\" The way Pilger learned his trade in Australia, being indentured to a newspaper for four years, hardly exists in Britain today. Getting a full-time place anywhere in the media as an apprentice or trainee is a scoop in itself. Even the BBC, as a public service broadcaster, has only one trainee a year in the whole of the East Midlands. Andy Harrison, a representative for the lecturers' union Natfhe at a Nottingham further education college, blames the culture of funding in education for the temptation to use \"sexy\" and potentially misleading course titles. \"It's the same cycle of problems everywhere,\" he says. \"They take on more courses to get more funding, the staff and resources are overstretched and the standards drop.\" There's also a feeling with media studies that futher education does the work and higher education reaps the results in the form of undergraduates. \"I've had a lot of feedback from my former students in recent years suggesting that they go to university and start out at a lower level from when they finished college,\" says Harrison. The NUJ is among those trying to keep track of the explosion of media courses in Britain. It has pledged to put together a list of courses and monitor the amount and standard of journalistic content. It's now possible to do a solid nine years of media training in the course of a normal academic career: a GCSE, followed by a BND, leading to an HND, converting to a degree and polishing it off with an MA. And your future employer won't have to pay for it. Despite the complaints about the MA, Nottingham's advertisement for next year's course is out in the media press this week. It is still called investigative journalism but with the more modest claim to \"equip students with the skills needed for research work in factual television programmes\". The course title - \"slightly elitist\" in John Pilger's view - should be changed, says Natfhe's Harrison, to \"researching for television, if that's what it is\". And the NUJ view? Nottingham branch secretary Kevin Stanley sums it up: \"I just want students to know what they're letting themselves in for.\"",

The results of further ballots in Leicester, Middlesbrough, Nottingham, Southampton and Portsmouth are due this week.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett said: \"I'm seriously concerned that any teacher should want to take action that increases pressure on their colleagues, that diminishes the chance of high achievement in tests and in GCSEs by students this summer, and actually diminishes the growing commitment of the public to teaching.

      "bodyText": "Simmering tensions between the government and the teaching unions over staff shortages broke out into open warfare yesterday, after union leaders dismissed threats by the education secretary, David Blunkett, that he would take a tough line against teachers taking part in industrial action as \"emotional claptrap\". Speaking on the eve of potentially damaging industrial action close to the general election, a defiant Mr Blunkett accused members of the National Union of Teachers and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers of abandoning their pupils and putting their education at risk. But the unions counter attacked, dismissing Mr Blunkett's comments as \"emotional claptrap and blackmail\" which would only stiffen their resolve and encourage more teachers to support their action. Mr Blunkett was speaking during a visit with Tony Blair to Southfields community college in Wandsworth, south-west London, where he announced the details of a \u00a3200m package designed to ease problems of teacher recruitment and retention. From this week, pupils at up to 1,000 schools in Greater London and Doncaster could be forced into part time schooling as members of the unions stop covering unfilled posts and absences for more than three days. The results of further ballots in Leicester, Middlesbrough, Nottingham, Southampton and Portsmouth are due this week. Mr Blunkett said: \"I'm seriously concerned that any teacher should want to take action that increases pressure on their colleagues, that diminishes the chance of high achievement in tests and in GCSEs by students this summer, and actually diminishes the growing commitment of the public to teaching. I could understand better what they were doing if we weren't taking action to help.\" Refusing to be drawn on what sanctions he might impose, he said: \"I'm just sending a message to the teacher unions. We are moving up to the teacher conferences and they also know there is going to be a general election. I think it would be very remiss of them to believe this is a time when the government is simply going to roll over. Our job is to get teachers in the classroom, not simply to jump every time the unions bang the drum.\" Mr Blunkett said he appreciated many teachers had had to cover for colleagues, but insisted the new measures he was putting in place would reduce their workload and ensure an adequate supply of teachers in the longer term.

      "bodyText": "Two primary school headteachers have been suspended amid allegations that \"ghost pupils\" are being added to school rolls to secure more funding and resources from a local authority. Scotland's biggest education authority launched an inquiry after a whistleblower revealed that a Glasgow primary school had 20 more pupils on its roll than were actually attending the school. It is alleged that two additional teaching posts, worth a total of around \u00a350,000, were granted to the school on the basis of the inaccurate pupil count. The headteacher of that school was suspended two weeks ago. But a second headteacher was also suspended last weekend after auditors discovered pupils on her roll who had long since left the school. It is not yet known if that school benefited financially. There are now fears that Glasgow may have a significant problem with \"phantom pupils\" and the city council is checking all its 203 primary schools. If the problem is shown to be prevalent in Glasgow, it is likely to lead to authorities across the country checking schools with a worried eye on funding levels. The first headteacher to be suspended, Lesley Dalgleish, 46, of Mount Florida primary school, Glasgow, will appear before a hearing shortly. The second headteacher, Maire Whitehead, 60, of St Mirin's Roman Catholic school in King's Park, Glasgow, was suspended last Friday. Ms Whitehead is vice president of the Association of Headteachers in Scotland, and it is alleged that nine pupils were kept on her school's roll despite not having attended St Mirin's for some time. Ken Corsar, director of education services at Glasgow city council, said: \"It is very serious for an education authority not to have accurate details of the number of pupils present at any school, and their names, on any given day. \"We are also clearly concerned that we are targeting the resources we have towards real children with real educational needs.\" Ann Hill, chief executive of the Scottish School Boards' Association, said the cases called into question the whole issue of school funding. \"If the teachers have falsified rolls to obtain more funding, the only motive can be to get a better standard for the children. It is a breach of trust and we would certainly not condone it, but I could understand it.\" Although the sums of money involved are relatively small - with each pupil being listed at a cost of around \u00a33,000 a year, it would amount, in these cases, to \u00a3100,000 - the extra resources could help headteachers cut class sizes and employ extra teachers to free more senior staff for other work. However, Jim Smith, general secretary of AHS, said he believed any discrepancies would prove to be merely administrative oversights. \"There are all sorts of reasons why there could be errors in the roll - from Asian children going on lengthy home visits with their families to parents taking their children from school without telling you,\" he said. \"If you are saying the headteacher deliberately left additional pupils on a school roll, you are saying teachers were also complicit in the deception, and I simply don't believe that would happen.\" Shortly before she was suspended, Ms Whitehead publicly defended Ms Dalgleish. \"If Lesley has done it, there was no personal gain for her, it could only be for her pupils.

      "body": "<p>I suppose it was inevitable really. At the first hint of an emergency, the government is generally quick to announce its plans to send in the troops to mop up the floods or drive the ambulances and fire-engines. So the only surprise is that it is has taken this long for the army to be sent into schools.</p> <p>After successful trials in Norfolk and Newcastle, the government last week confirmed that it was planning to spend a further \u00a3600,000 to hire members of the armed forces to work with 14- to 16-year-olds in schools in Manchester, Merseyside, Leicester, Bristol, the West Midlands and London. The scheme, called Skill Force, which is targeted at those teenagers who are already disaffected or perceived to be at risk of becoming so, aims to work with the school system to reduce truancy and disruption by teaching practical and vocational skills at KS4 instead of a modern foreign language and a science subject.</p> <p>Put the words army and school in the same sentence and you automatically think Willie Whitelaw, \"short, sharp shocks\" and boot-camp discipline. And when I arrive at Methwold High School, one of the three Norfolk schools taking part in the project, that looks exactly what's on offer. Eighty pupils - some from Methwold High, the rest from the other two schools taking part, Hamond's High School in Swaffham and Wayland Community High School in Watton - are gathered in the hall while two soldiers in combat fatigues patrol the front of the stage waiting for an army recruitment video to begin.</p> <p>\"Er, it's unfortunate that you've come today,\" says Captain Brett Jarvis, the course leader who is dressed in civvies and looking every inch the teacher. \"I know it looks terribly militaristic, but it isn't really. Part of the Skill Force course involves potential employers giving a presentation to students about what they do and what sort of people they are looking for. Today it's the army's turn.\"</p> <p>But it's no coincidence that two of the half dozen or so employers to have made presentations so far are the navy and the Royal Air Force. The Ministry of Defence is supplying the trainers for the course, recruitment levels are down and any quid pro quo is gratefully received. For their part, the children are completely unfazed by any military overtones. Some are planning to enlist on leaving school anyway, and those who aren't seem to reckon that anything is better than sitting in classes. \"I thought it was going to be all marching when I signed up for this option,\" says Richard Mather, a year 10 student at Wayland, \"but I didn't mind as I don't like foreign languages.\"</p> <p>Marching isn't on the menu, and PT is the closest anyone gets to basic training. \"It can't be a military operation,\" jokes Capt Jarvis, \" as the transport doesn't turn up two hours late.\" What is on offer are basic key skills incorporated into the bronze and silver Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Networks (Asdan) syllabuses, together with the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh's award, the St John's lifesaver awards and some outdoor environmental experience.</p> <p>Were Alastair Campbell to set foot in Wayland Community High School, he would no doubt immediately declare it a \"bog standard comprehensive\". It has the usual range of abilities and social groupings; its GCSE attainment levels are slightly above the national average but, like most schools, it has its fair share of problems - including disaffected and disruptive pupils. For the school, the relaxation at KS4 that allows the national curriculum to be disapplied under certain circumstances has been something of a godsend, and when it was approached to join in the army's pilot scheme it responded enthusiastically.</p> <p>At all three schools in the Norfolk project, the pupils were given the final say on their participation, but in all cases it seems that a fair degree of social engineering was involved in deciding who should be offered the option in the first place. Methwold took the route of asking for volunteers from those who were lacking in self-confidence and were unlikely to cope with the GCSE syllabus, Hamond's opted for a mix of the non-academic and those with behavioural difficulties, while according to Brett Jarvis, Wayland went the whole hog and put forward 22 of their most disruptive kids.</p> <p>Chris Dix, Wayland's headteacher, is slightly defensive at this suggestion. \"We followed the guidelines that were put forward by the army,\" he says. \"We chose from across a range of academic abilities those who were disaffected or in danger of becoming so. I would accept, though, that some of the students are quite challenging.\"</p> <p>Dix need not have been so protective of his students' sensibilities; they wouldn't see their behaviour as challenging so much as the stuff of nightmares. \"I'd been suspended twice for swearing at teachers and messing around in class and was regularly picking up four detentions a week,\" admits Mather. \"My parents were starting to have a real struggle getting me to go to school in the morning.\" Mather's was a familiar story. \"I'd been suspended at least twice for swearing and talking back to teachers,\" says Barry Ford. And so on. Martin Gisborne had been in constant trouble for fighting and backchatting. \"The school split me up from the group I used to hang around with and put me in isolation,\" he says. \"It just frustrated me even more so I started messing around even worse.\"</p> <p>The point is, though, that after six months on the course they all claim - and the school agrees - that their behaviour has improved beyond all recognition. \"I've only had one detention and I haven't felt like bunking off,\" says Mather. \"I thought it was about time I sorted myself out,\" says Gisborne. There has also been a further knock-on benefit of improvements in their GCSE curricular work. So what is the secret?</p> <p> Brett Jarvis acknowledges that it was an uphill struggle for the first few months as the kids pushed the limits to see what they could get away with, but believes that it was their interest in what they were doing and the strength of the relationships that he and the two sergeants, Tony Shuttleworth and Bertie Burtenshaw, were able to forge that proved the clinching factor. \"I think they liked the fact that we didn't come across in the same way as the teachers they have known,\" says Jarvis. \"The two sergeants have proved to be extremely effective role models. Neither were particularly academic at school, but by applying the very principles we are teaching here, have gone on to be successful.\"</p> <p>The kids see it slightly differently. They enjoy the work - \"less boring, more useful\" - and the sanction of being slung off the course is a great deal more effective than being banned from maths, but what they really seem to appreciate is being treated as adults. \"If you get wound up and think you're going to lose your temper they let you take five minutes out,\" says Matthew Balls. \"A teacher would think you were trying to skive off if you asked for time out.\" \"They don't say 'Do this' or 'Do that',\" says Mather. \"They tell you what's expected and let you get on with it. If you need help they'll give it but they let you complete the work to your standard, not some curriculum standard. So you feel like putting more effort in.\"</p> <p>Skill Force is no panacea. Some of those on the course have a reading age of seven, many are statemented and some are on medication for behavioural problems, and the course does not replace all the usual pastoral measures to cope with disruption. What it does do at the very least is contain the problem. The pressure on teachers' time is horrendous at the best of times and disruptive kids take up more time than most. With the disaffected channelled into something that interests them, teachers are free to give their time to the 28 kids who want to learn rather than the two who don't.</p> <p>There is a danger that such schemes will introduce a two-tier system at KS4 and Mather acknowledges that his father had reservations about him dropping Double Science. But Dix thinks such worries are an irrelevance. \"The students will still be doing GCSEs,\" he says, \"but in any case there always was a two-tier system. Kids are very quick to identify their levels of ability, and many of the less able quickly recognised that they weren't going to be able to cope with the curricular work early in year 10 and identified themselves as failures. With Skillforce we are providing a course at which they can succeed and thereby raise their self-esteem.\"</p> <p>Endorsements for the scheme have come from all quarters. Allan Rimmer, the administrator for the Association of Workers for Children with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties, is pleased that the course recognises the importance of continuing to teach key skills, such as numeracy and literacy. \"Disruptive children need the curriculum, too, and we welcome anything that finds an effective way of teaching it,\" he says. </p> <p>Jenny Mosley, one of those at the forefront of introducing Circle Time into school, is also in favour. \"You can't underestimate the importance of team-building and leadership in helping those with emotional difficulties,\" she says. \"What I would want to make sure is that there was time included in the course for reflection. Experiences are often very immediate, and you only get to understand the processes involved by thinking about them at a later date. That is very often where the learning takes place.\"</p> <p>The one dark cloud on the horizon is money. Despite the new funding, no one seems to have worked out that if you want to continue the scheme it will involve running two parallel groups. Wayland plans to continue the current course when the year 10s move into year 11, but has a queue of year 9 punters eager to sign up for the autumn. \"The army is trying to accommodate us by offering us more time,\" says Dix, \"but even so it would involve an overall reduction in the time each year group would get. We think this sends out all the wrong messages to the students.\"</p> <p>Joined-up government only goes so far, it seems.</p>",

Eighty pupils - some from Methwold High, the rest from the other two schools taking part, Hamond's High School in Swaffham and Wayland Community High School in Watton - are gathered in the hall while two soldiers in combat fatigues patrol the front of the stage waiting for an army recruitment video to begin. \"Er, it's unfortunate that you've come today,\" says Captain Brett Jarvis, the course leader who is dressed in civvies and looking every inch the teacher. \"I know it looks terribly militaristic, but it isn't really. Part of the Skill Force course involves potential employers giving a presentation to students about what they do and what sort of people they are looking for. Today it's the army's turn.\" But it's no coincidence that two of the half dozen or so employers to have made presentations so far are the navy and the Royal Air Force. The Ministry of Defence is supplying the trainers for the course, recruitment levels are down and any quid pro quo is gratefully received. For their part, the children are completely unfazed by any military overtones. Some are planning to enlist on leaving school anyway, and those who aren't seem to reckon that anything is better than sitting in classes. \"I thought it was going to be all marching when I signed up for this option,\" says Richard Mather, a year 10 student at Wayland, \"but I didn't mind as I don't like foreign languages.\" Marching isn't on the menu, and PT is the closest anyone gets to basic training. \"It can't be a military operation,\" jokes Capt Jarvis, \" as the transport doesn't turn up two hours late.\" What is on offer are basic key skills incorporated into the bronze and silver Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Networks (Asdan) syllabuses, together with the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh's award, the St John's lifesaver awards and some outdoor environmental experience. Were Alastair Campbell to set foot in Wayland Community High School, he would no doubt immediately declare it a \"bog standard comprehensive\". It has the usual range of abilities and social groupings; its GCSE attainment levels are slightly above the national average but, like most schools, it has its fair share of problems - including disaffected and disruptive pupils. For the school, the relaxation at KS4 that allows the national curriculum to be disapplied under certain circumstances has been something of a godsend, and when it was approached to join in the army's pilot scheme it responded enthusiastically. At all three schools in the Norfolk project, the pupils were given the final say on their participation, but in all cases it seems that a fair degree of social engineering was involved in deciding who should be offered the option in the first place. Methwold took the route of asking for volunteers from those who were lacking in self-confidence and were unlikely to cope with the GCSE syllabus, Hamond's opted for a mix of the non-academic and those with behavioural difficulties, while according to Brett Jarvis, Wayland went the whole hog and put forward 22 of their most disruptive kids. Chris Dix, Wayland's headteacher, is slightly defensive at this suggestion. \"We followed the guidelines that were put forward by the army,\" he says. \"We chose from across a range of academic abilities those who were disaffected or in danger of becoming so. I would accept, though, that some of the students are quite challenging.\" Dix need not have been so protective of his students' sensibilities; they wouldn't see their behaviour as challenging so much as the stuff of nightmares. \"I'd been suspended twice for swearing at teachers and messing around in class and was regularly picking up four detentions a week,\" admits Mather. \"My parents were starting to have a real struggle getting me to go to school in the morning.\" Mather's was a familiar story. \"I'd been suspended at least twice for swearing and talking back to teachers,\" says Barry Ford. And so on. Martin Gisborne had been in constant trouble for fighting and backchatting. \"The school split me up from the group I used to hang around with and put me in isolation,\" he says. \"It just frustrated me even more so I started messing around even worse.\" The point is, though, that after six months on the course they all claim - and the school agrees - that their behaviour has improved beyond all recognition. \"I've only had one detention and I haven't felt like bunking off,\" says Mather. \"I thought it was about time I sorted myself out,\" says Gisborne. There has also been a further knock-on benefit of improvements in their GCSE curricular work. So what is the secret? Brett Jarvis acknowledges that it was an uphill struggle for the first few months as the kids pushed the limits to see what they could get away with, but believes that it was their interest in what they were doing and the strength of the relationships that he and the two sergeants, Tony Shuttleworth and Bertie Burtenshaw, were able to forge that proved the clinching factor. \"I think they liked the fact that we didn't come across in the same way as the teachers they have known,\" says Jarvis. \"The two sergeants have proved to be extremely effective role models. Neither were particularly academic at school, but by applying the very principles we are teaching here, have gone on to be successful.\" The kids see it slightly differently. They enjoy the work - \"less boring, more useful\" - and the sanction of being slung off the course is a great deal more effective than being banned from maths, but what they really seem to appreciate is being treated as adults. \"If you get wound up and think you're going to lose your temper they let you take five minutes out,\" says Matthew Balls. \"A teacher would think you were trying to skive off if you asked for time out.\" \"They don't say 'Do this' or 'Do that',\" says Mather. \"They tell you what's expected and let you get on with it. If you need help they'll give it but they let you complete the work to your standard, not some curriculum standard. So you feel like putting more effort in.\" Skill Force is no panacea. Some of those on the course have a reading age of seven, many are statemented and some are on medication for behavioural problems, and the course does not replace all the usual pastoral measures to cope with disruption. What it does do at the very least is contain the problem. The pressure on teachers' time is horrendous at the best of times and disruptive kids take up more time than most. With the disaffected channelled into something that interests them, teachers are free to give their time to the 28 kids who want to learn rather than the two who don't. There is a danger that such schemes will introduce a two-tier system at KS4 and Mather acknowledges that his father had reservations about him dropping Double Science. But Dix thinks such worries are an irrelevance. \"The students will still be doing GCSEs,\" he says, \"but in any case there always was a two-tier system. Kids are very quick to identify their levels of ability, and many of the less able quickly recognised that they weren't going to be able to cope with the curricular work early in year 10 and identified themselves as failures. With Skillforce we are providing a course at which they can succeed and thereby raise their self-esteem.\" Endorsements for the scheme have come from all quarters. Allan Rimmer, the administrator for the Association of Workers for Children with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties, is pleased that the course recognises the importance of continuing to teach key skills, such as numeracy and literacy. \"Disruptive children need the curriculum, too, and we welcome anything that finds an effective way of teaching it,\" he says. Jenny Mosley, one of those at the forefront of introducing Circle Time into school, is also in favour. \"You can't underestimate the importance of team-building and leadership in helping those with emotional difficulties,\" she says. \"What I would want to make sure is that there was time included in the course for reflection. Experiences are often very immediate, and you only get to understand the processes involved by thinking about them at a later date. That is very often where the learning takes place.\" The one dark cloud on the horizon is money. Despite the new funding, no one seems to have worked out that if you want to continue the scheme it will involve running two parallel groups. Wayland plans to continue the current course when the year 10s move into year 11, but has a queue of year 9 punters eager to sign up for the autumn. \"The army is trying to accommodate us by offering us more time,\" says Dix, \"but even so it would involve an overall reduction in the time each year group would get. We think this sends out all the wrong messages to the students.\" Joined-up government only goes so far, it seems.",

      "body": "<p>Is this the start of a beautiful friendship? Something odd is happening to the teacher trade unions. They appear to be getting on with each other. </p> <p>Take two events in the last week alone. First the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the Association of University Teachers launched a strategic alliance that is likely to lead to eventual merger. Peter Smith, the ATL's general secretary, described it as \"the most serious attempt yet by unions within the notoriously factious education world to collaborate rather than compete\". A few days afterwards it emerged that the ATL, the National Union of Teachers, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, and the Welsh union UCAC, for the first time are presenting joint motions threatening to take industrial action to limit teachers' working time to 35 hours a week. Of all the main rank-and-file teaching unions in England and Wales, only the no-strike Professional Association of Teachers has not signed up to it. </p> <p>\"Brilliant,\" says Hank Roberts, organising secretary of Professional Unity 2000, a group of teachers campaigning for their unions to merge. \"They are realising that they have got to act and pull together.\" These are just the latest signs that the alphabet soup of teacher trade unionism may eventually rationalise into something more manageable and - arguably - more powerful. No other sector has so many large, competing unions. Polls in the past have shown that teachers want their unions to unite; and it suits the government if they stay divided. </p> <p>But the last year has been a \"historic period\" for teacher organisation, says NUT general secretary Doug McAvoy. The ATL's affiliation to the Trades Union Congress has made it easier for the three unions to work together. The big three have put two joint motions to the TUC congress, and a joint submission to the School Teachers' Review Body on pay and conditions. The TUC's general secretary, John Monks, has been actively encouraging the unions to work towards alliance and eventual merger. Though the NUT has some headteacher members, the prospect of one union for the whole school sector looks implausible. But two - one for heads, another for classroom teachers - is a feasible goal. </p> <p>Last June the NUT and the NASUWT came together to launch a campaign against teacher workload, and again this year to announce joint industrial action on teacher shortages. McAvoy and his NASUWT counterpart, Nigel de Gruchy, are holding joint press conferences so often that they have agreed to take turns in going first. Significantly, Peter Smith has complained to the TUC that his union wasn't asked to join the action. McAvoy concedes that was a mistake and has apologised. </p> <p>\"The more teachers can be seen to be working together, the better for teachers and the better the message gets out to government that there is a problem to be dealt with,\" McAvoy says. This is more than flirtation: this looks like a relationship. </p> <p>Sweetness and light, then? Hardly. These union leaders are old hands with big memberships and have egos on the large side, too. Things have improved since the nadir of the mid-1980s, when then NUT general secretary Fred Jarvis, writing to NASUWT oppo Terry Casey, began his letters \"Dear Casey\". But relations are still awkward, as they have been ever since the National Association of Schoolmasters was formed in 1919 in opposition to NUT support for equal pay for women teachers. </p> <p>It's only a few months ago that de Gruchy demanded a public apology from McAvoy for an \"outrageous accusation\" over performance-related pay, and the two unions were at loggerheads when the NUT took the government to court over the issue (PRP). There have been times before now when unions have collaborated, only to separate again. </p> <p>Michael Barber recalls in his book The Learning Game how, as an NUT official in the early 1990s, he drafted \"more statements on behalf of all unions than - I guess - any official in the history of education. It was a tortuous business, and depended, above all, on careful drafting and phoning the various general secretaries in the right order. The key was to leave the most doubtful of the six to last, and then shame them into signing by informing them that the other five had signed up.

      "bodyText": "Is this the start of a beautiful friendship? Something odd is happening to the teacher trade unions. They appear to be getting on with each other. Take two events in the last week alone. First the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the Association of University Teachers launched a strategic alliance that is likely to lead to eventual merger. Peter Smith, the ATL's general secretary, described it as \"the most serious attempt yet by unions within the notoriously factious education world to collaborate rather than compete\". A few days afterwards it emerged that the ATL, the National Union of Teachers, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, and the Welsh union UCAC, for the first time are presenting joint motions threatening to take industrial action to limit teachers' working time to 35 hours a week. Of all the main rank-and-file teaching unions in England and Wales, only the no-strike Professional Association of Teachers has not signed up to it. \"Brilliant,\" says Hank Roberts, organising secretary of Professional Unity 2000, a group of teachers campaigning for their unions to merge. \"They are realising that they have got to act and pull together.\" These are just the latest signs that the alphabet soup of teacher trade unionism may eventually rationalise into something more manageable and - arguably - more powerful. No other sector has so many large, competing unions. Polls in the past have shown that teachers want their unions to unite; and it suits the government if they stay divided. But the last year has been a \"historic period\" for teacher organisation, says NUT general secretary Doug McAvoy. The ATL's affiliation to the Trades Union Congress has made it easier for the three unions to work together. The big three have put two joint motions to the TUC congress, and a joint submission to the School Teachers' Review Body on pay and conditions. The TUC's general secretary, John Monks, has been actively encouraging the unions to work towards alliance and eventual merger. Though the NUT has some headteacher members, the prospect of one union for the whole school sector looks implausible. But two - one for heads, another for classroom teachers - is a feasible goal. Last June the NUT and the NASUWT came together to launch a campaign against teacher workload, and again this year to announce joint industrial action on teacher shortages. McAvoy and his NASUWT counterpart, Nigel de Gruchy, are holding joint press conferences so often that they have agreed to take turns in going first. Significantly, Peter Smith has complained to the TUC that his union wasn't asked to join the action. McAvoy concedes that was a mistake and has apologised. \"The more teachers can be seen to be working together, the better for teachers and the better the message gets out to government that there is a problem to be dealt with,\" McAvoy says. This is more than flirtation: this looks like a relationship. Sweetness and light, then? Hardly. These union leaders are old hands with big memberships and have egos on the large side, too. Things have improved since the nadir of the mid-1980s, when then NUT general secretary Fred Jarvis, writing to NASUWT oppo Terry Casey, began his letters \"Dear Casey\". But relations are still awkward, as they have been ever since the National Association of Schoolmasters was formed in 1919 in opposition to NUT support for equal pay for women teachers. It's only a few months ago that de Gruchy demanded a public apology from McAvoy for an \"outrageous accusation\" over performance-related pay, and the two unions were at loggerheads when the NUT took the government to court over the issue (PRP). There have been times before now when unions have collaborated, only to separate again. Michael Barber recalls in his book The Learning Game how, as an NUT official in the early 1990s, he drafted \"more statements on behalf of all unions than - I guess - any official in the history of education. It was a tortuous business, and depended, above all, on careful drafting and phoning the various general secretaries in the right order. The key was to leave the most doubtful of the six to last, and then shame them into signing by informing them that the other five had signed up. Sometimes one had to stretch the facts slightly . . .\" De Gruchy, for one, believes the current era of cooperation could just as easily collapse as continue. \"It's far too early to say. I just take things a step at a time. Where there are genuine differences of view it is no good pretending there is a spurious unity.\" He regards the NASUWT's longstanding cooperation with the Secondary Heads Association as more significant than the AUT/ATL link up. He points out that the ATL and AUT are not in serious competition for members. He favours ad hoc alliances on issues where the unions agree, rather than merger.

The parents may need to work out a timetable for time spent outside school and allocate time to activities; and if there's homework involved, such as practising scales, see how much time the children can realistically set aside. It may be a question of time rather than their commitment. </p> <p>If the children are saying they don't want to do things because they're too much effort, they need to have something in their home life that is an effort - such as sweeping up leaves. Having something that is your responsibility and that you have to do even if you sometimes don't feel like it is a tremendous life skill. </p> <p>The parents also need to help them to recognise that it doesn't matter if something is hard. They need to learn that you don't simply abandon things that are hard. And something else that's a hobby-horse of mine is doing something for somebody else: helping to clear a park, or a community-based project, where you can see the results and feel proud that you've helped. </p> <p><strong> Jean Robb </strong> <br> Co-author with Hilary Letts of several books about children </p> <p>Creating Kids Who Can, Creating Kids Who Can Concentrate, and Succeed In Exams, Triumph in Tests, all by Jean Robb and Hilary Letts, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. </p> <p> It sounds as though this parent is doing a great job helping the children to try things out. It's very healthy to have children who want to try different activities. I can see where this parent is coming from and it can be difficult to juggle the family timetable, but I'm not sure that wanting to try out lots of activities is bad news. </p> <p>At that age, children should be supported by their parents in trying new things. At Sport England we believe children in the younger age groups need a range of experiences to develop a healthy and active lifestyle later on. Who knows what sport they'll eventually home in on? But a healthy grounding will stand them in good stead in later life. </p> <p>Sport England is running a scheme that encourages primary schools to promote physical activity by giving them an award called Activemark. This doesn't just mean official sports lessons, but schemes like encouraging the children to walk to school. Some schools have been quite innovative, running after-school skipping sessions, or inviting grandparents in to teach the children the games they used to play. Promoting exercise is so important; this parent should be pleased and encouraged. </p> <p><strong> Dave Renshaw </strong> <br>Head of the Active Schools programme at Sport England </p> <p> Children today have information fed to them so fast, they want to be constantly excited and they want everything to be bite-sized and extreme. The laborious discipline that's needed to master a musical instrument is difficult and children need to be introduced to music in a way they will enjoy. Playing an instrument is a skill, and you don't get the benefits without commitment; the majority of children who begin to learn do give up. </p> <p>At the Voices Foundation, we believe passionately in singing as the first exposure to music. Everyone has a voice, you don't need to practise, and instruments can follow later when the foundations of musicianship have been laid. My inspiration for the foundation came when I was travelling in Hungary, where music education was recognised by the whole community for the development of the child. Children who develop musical thinking also do very well at other subjects like maths and languages, and it extends their communication and listening skills. When we surveyed primary schools nationwide, we found that many teachers just didn't have the confidence, skills and resources to deliver the classes. We address this through teacher training in primary schools. The children quickly develop a musical ear; then they can apply themselves to learning an instrument. </p> <p><strong> Susan Digby </strong><br>Founder and principal of The Voices Foundation, a music education charity </p> <p><strong> Coming next </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> My 15-year-old son was a chatty little boy, but is now more interested in his computer than anything else.

      "bodyText": "Children need to practise being in different situations, but these two may actually want to be at home. The parents may need to work out a timetable for time spent outside school and allocate time to activities; and if there's homework involved, such as practising scales, see how much time the children can realistically set aside. It may be a question of time rather than their commitment. If the children are saying they don't want to do things because they're too much effort, they need to have something in their home life that is an effort - such as sweeping up leaves. Having something that is your responsibility and that you have to do even if you sometimes don't feel like it is a tremendous life skill. The parents also need to help them to recognise that it doesn't matter if something is hard. They need to learn that you don't simply abandon things that are hard. And something else that's a hobby-horse of mine is doing something for somebody else: helping to clear a park, or a community-based project, where you can see the results and feel proud that you've helped. Jean Robb Co-author with Hilary Letts of several books about children Creating Kids Who Can, Creating Kids Who Can Concentrate, and Succeed In Exams, Triumph in Tests, all by Jean Robb and Hilary Letts, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. It sounds as though this parent is doing a great job helping the children to try things out. It's very healthy to have children who want to try different activities. I can see where this parent is coming from and it can be difficult to juggle the family timetable, but I'm not sure that wanting to try out lots of activities is bad news. At that age, children should be supported by their parents in trying new things. At Sport England we believe children in the younger age groups need a range of experiences to develop a healthy and active lifestyle later on. Who knows what sport they'll eventually home in on? But a healthy grounding will stand them in good stead in later life. Sport England is running a scheme that encourages primary schools to promote physical activity by giving them an award called Activemark. This doesn't just mean official sports lessons, but schemes like encouraging the children to walk to school. Some schools have been quite innovative, running after-school skipping sessions, or inviting grandparents in to teach the children the games they used to play. Promoting exercise is so important; this parent should be pleased and encouraged. Dave Renshaw Head of the Active Schools programme at Sport England Children today have information fed to them so fast, they want to be constantly excited and they want everything to be bite-sized and extreme. The laborious discipline that's needed to master a musical instrument is difficult and children need to be introduced to music in a way they will enjoy. Playing an instrument is a skill, and you don't get the benefits without commitment; the majority of children who begin to learn do give up. At the Voices Foundation, we believe passionately in singing as the first exposure to music. Everyone has a voice, you don't need to practise, and instruments can follow later when the foundations of musicianship have been laid. My inspiration for the foundation came when I was travelling in Hungary, where music education was recognised by the whole community for the development of the child. Children who develop musical thinking also do very well at other subjects like maths and languages, and it extends their communication and listening skills. When we surveyed primary schools nationwide, we found that many teachers just didn't have the confidence, skills and resources to deliver the classes. We address this through teacher training in primary schools. The children quickly develop a musical ear; then they can apply themselves to learning an instrument. Susan Digby Founder and principal of The Voices Foundation, a music education charity Coming next My 15-year-old son was a chatty little boy, but is now more interested in his computer than anything else. He is doing well academically, but is quiet in general and I'm worried that he has no friends. Do you have a problem with your child's education? Is something bothering you about his or her school?

Presentation of success rates as percentages implies that 100% success is a possibility. In reality, as the report recognises, students fail to complete their courses for many reasons. Some find the teaching inadequate, or the material irrelevant. Many others are interested only in a part of the skills and knowledge contained in a course and leave when they have what they need. Others are offered a job while studying and take it rather than stay until the end. Yet others drop out because of financial or domestic pressures. Not all of these withdrawals can be laid at the door of colleges. Some cases - for example, those leaving for employment - would in other circumstances be judged a success. </p> <p>Not all students will achieve the level of skills and knowledge to satisfy awarding bodies.

      "body": "<p>The company which owns the largest lecturing agency in the country, Education Lecturing Services (ELS), purchased one of the tangled web of companies set up by the troubled Barnsley College, where the Further Education Funding Council is to conduct a forensic audit. In August last year, just before two other companies run by Barnsley College went into liquidation, a third company was sold to Protocol Associates, which owns ELS. </p> <p>A bewildering array of companies was set up under the direction of college chief executive David Eade. Eade has been off work for several months following a serious operation, and last week the college stated that it terminated his contract because of his illness. </p> <p>By last summer, the companies were beginning to prove a serious embarrassment to the college. Their investments included \u00a321,000 to set up a surfing magazine run by Eade's stepchildren, and \u00a31.3m in Barnsley-based Sheldale Water, which produces bottled water. </p> <p>Barnsley College is one of ELS's biggest customers. About a third of Barnsley's courses are taught by ELS-supplied teachers - one of the highest proportions of ELS teachers of any college in the country. The company which the college sold to ELS's parent company is Barnsley-based Step Direct, which offers training in retail skills. This makes it, at least potentially, a competitor to Barnsley College. It means that Protocol owns one company which supplies a third of all Barnsley College's teaching hours; and it owns another company which competes directly with Barnsley College. This does not seem to be a good deal for the publicly-funded college. Getting your staff from your main competitor is not normally considered clever commercial practise, since your main competitor does not have a vested interest in your success. But Protocol denies that it has any conflict of interest, because \"ELS and our training division, which includes Step Direct, are entirely separate companies\" according to Protocol's Richard Eve. </p> <p>The college expects a \u00a36m shortfall in its budget this year. The liquidators of one of its companies are to claim about \u00a31.5m from the college. To offset against this, the liquidators believe the bankrupt company owes the college \u00a3256,000. The funding council will be claiming \u00a35.9m which the college is said to have overclaimed. </p> <p>Nonetheless, some of the money from the sale seems to have gone into the creation of yet more companies, even though the previous companies had failed and the college was piling up debts. Late last year the college set up Axion Services with \u00a350,000, and Axion's managing director Allan Child, a former college employee, has told Natfhe officials that Axion is buying one of the college's bankrupt companies from the liquidator for \u00a360,000. Over the last five years the college has put at least \u00a310m of public money through its various companies. </p> <p>Sergeant Mick Dransfield of the South Yorkshire CID says: \"A number of allegations have been made to us about the college and its associated companies and we are awaiting the result of the forensic audit.\" He had hoped that the forensic audit would be completed by now, but the funding council is still in the process of tendering for a company to conduct it. The company will be appointed within the next two weeks. </p> <p>The college's acting chief executive, Michelle Squires, and another senior manager were suspended on February 5, and the funding council has told the governors to bring in an experienced principal from another college to sort the college out in the short term. In principal the governors can choose whomever they like. In practice the funding council will make sure a safe pair of hands is appointed. </p> <p>Branch secretary Paul Heggie is furious about the delay in the appointment of an acting chief executive and the forensic audit. </p> <p>Natfhe general secretary Paul Mackney says Barnsley College fits a pattern. Eade's \u00a3101,000 salary was the second highest of any college principal in Britain, and the college had said it could not meet in full the lecturers' pay rise. </p> <p>\"Sadly, in further education four things often go together: feline obesity at the top, no pay rise for staff, heavy use of agency staff, and commercial ventures which display a cavalier attitude to public money.\" </p> <p>Mr Eade is unavailable for comment and the college had no comment to make.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anthea Turner is facing a second eviction ordeal after being nominated again for removal from the Celebrity Big Brother house. The former GMTV presenter will have to endure another public popularity contest, according to the programme's website. Four contestants remain in the house following Vanessa Feltz's eviction, which viewers can see on Channel 4 and BBC 1 tonight. Turner was nominated by Boyzone hunk Keith Duffy and grumpy comedian Jack Dee. But she will be vying with Duffy and Dee for eviction - the popstar was the least favourite in the house with three votes while Dee received two nominations - one of them from Turner. Brookside's Claire Sweeney received just one nomination and is now favourite to be the winner in the Comic Relief grand finale on Friday. Although the latest round of nominations took place last night, the three celebrities will have to wait until tomorrow night to hear which one of them will follow former daytime TV host Vanessa out of the Celebrity Big Brother house. The phone lines will be open for 24 hours from 9.30pm tonight. Viewers will not know of Anthea's latest ordeal until the programme is screened tonight. So far the eviction phone lines have raised \u00a3224,000 for Comic Relief. Turner may survive on a public sympathy vote. She has already been nominated for eviction and looked on the verge of tears when she learned the news. In the event her rival Chris Eubank received more votes from the 750,000 calls made to the eviction line on the first night. Last night, Dee survived his first eviction nomination when Feltz was voted out. Prior to the announcement of her eviction, viewers saw the strain getting to Ms Feltz, who burst into tears and scribbled the words \"incarcerated\" and \"frustrated\" on a table in chalk. She appeared at the end of the her tether and was then summoned into the house diary room where she told Big Brother to \"fuck off\". Once in the diary room, Ms Feltz told the cameras: \"I don't think I can possibly endure the mass humiliation of everybody hating me so much - however many people voted and said 'fuck off Vanessa'.\" Following the announcement of Feltz's eviction, Jack Dee visited the diary room and asked if the next vote could be fixed so he could leave the Big Brother house.

His rallying cry comes as PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's largest professional services company, prepares to enter the PR arena by training its staff to offer PR advice to clients. \"Increasingly accountants and management consultants are set to move into the territory currently occupied by public relations professionals,\" said Mr Wright. \"They will do so by expanding their own operations, but they will also do so by acquisition. \"It is almost certain that in the next few months at least one - and probably more - of the consultancy networks will be acquired by a leading accountancy practice. \"When that happens our business will change forever,\" added Mr Wright. He calls for the industry to present a united front under the IPR, the Public Relations Consultants Association and non-industry body members. Mr Wright is IPR president for 2001. Prior to joining Diageo, he was director of communications for Boots the Chemist. He also acted as press spokesperson to Paddy Ashdown during the 1997 general election and 1999 European election campaigns.",

Pressure has been building on the highly unpopular prime minister to step down soon amid the nation's economic turmoil, and a member of his ruling coalition said he was willing to leave office within a month. Mr Mori told a convention of his ruling Liberal Democratic party in Tokyo today that an election for party president would be held sooner than the previously scheduled one in September. In a short speech, he said: \"We will move up the party presidential election. We are discussing the timing and the way in which we will carry out that election.\" Mr Mori has not said whether he would run for re-election as party president. Due to the party's power in parliament, the LDP party president is usually elected prime minister. If the election is moved, a vote could take place as soon as next month. Mr Mori's support ratings are below 10%, and some LDP members are worried his unpopularity could hurt the party in upper house elections in July. Meanwhile, Japan's media continued today with their calls for Mr Mori to quit. \"We can't afford a political blank at a time when a deflationary crisis looms and the economy is in a crucial situation,\" the nation's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri, said in an editorial. The party convention took place hours after opposition groups submitted an unsuccessful censure motion against the scandal-prone premier. Kozo Tanaka, an LDP member and member of the Tokyo city assembly, said: \"Mori has lost support within the party and naturally he should resign.\" Mr Mori has said he wants to see the budget for the current fiscal year through parliament.

Party stalwart Hiromu Nonaka is seen as a strong candidate, but has said he will not seek the office.

The princess was fined \u00a3400, ordered to pay \u00a330 costs and given five penalty points on her driving licence. In her written evidence to the magistrates court, the Princess Royal said she thought the police cars on her tail were providing her with an escort. She said she had been on her way to an official engagement when she was caught in a line of slow-moving traffic on the A417 dual carriageway near Brockworth. She said she had pulled out and accelerated to a clear part of the road so the officers could see her. When a police car pulled out behind her and flashed its blue light, Princess Anne said she thought this was a sign acknowledging that the car was following her and carried on speeding. The chairman of the bench, Graham Sacker, said: \"We have taken into account Her Royal Highness's immediate guilty plea. \"This was an offence of average seriousness by a person of high means.\" He added that the princess's clean driving licence had also been taken into account when considering a penalty.

In a statement today, the company claims revenues may have been overstated by around \u00a31.7m over a two-year period. The results of the initial investigation, which was released to the Stock Exchange, alleged that documents claiming the company was making money were forged. Initial reports claim that while the company's financial statements claimed revenues of \u00a3781,571 for the 17 months to the end of 1999, figures obtained from agents selling advertising suggest the actual figure was just \u00a398,000. There were also conflicting figures for the first half of last year. Unaudited accounts report sales of just over \u00a31m. \"Based solely on information obtained from the sales agencies during the investigation, these revenues were approximately \u00a332,000,\" e-district said. The company added there appeared to be a \"substantial overstatement of registered users, page impressions and revenues\". The investigation follows just weeks after the sacking of chief executive Steven Laitman, who owns 44 % of the e-district shares. Mr Laitman's assets have been frozen by the company but he is expected to contest the order. He was not available for comment. Internal figures suggested the company had 89,429 users in February and page impressions of 56.8m. However, between May and June last year, page impressions fell from 150m to less than 9m. As yet the company cannot explain the drastic drop. The company has launched a civil action against Mr Laitman and said today it had reported its continuing investigations to the Metropolitan Police fraud squad.",

      "bodyText": "Channel 5's new gameshow Touch the Truck has crashed in the ratings. After just one night, the reality game show fronted by Dale Winton is struggling with just 500,000 viewers and a miserly 2% of the audience. It launched on Channel 5 on Sunday night with 1m viewers. But up against EastEnders last night audience levels halved. Channel 5 executives nevertheless hope it will take off in the ratings tonight. The show, which has been adapted from an American shopping mall game, has intrigued and baffled viewers and critics alike. In a competition reminiscent of the children's favourite \"first-one-to-blink\", it involves 20 contestants battling to keep their hands on a truck longest. The last person touching the truck wins the vehicle. Contestants are allowed food and toilet breaks but do not get time off for sleep. All 20 participants survived to the second show. But overnight and this morning eight contestants have fallen. The first to go was Sophie Braka, a lawyer turned dancer who knocked off her bottle of water and in a lapse of concentration removed her hand from the \u00a333,000 truck. Another of the eight was forced to retire because he needed an unscheduled toilet break. Colyn Caffrey was forced to take his hand off the truck to run to the toilet. The Kent service engineer was told he was not allowed to relieve himself in a bowl or wet himself. \"I was busting for a pee for about 10 to 15 minutes,\" he said. \"It's sickening to leave that truck behind me but I couldn't hold out anymore.\" Another contestant has been eliminated after doctors found he had dangerously high blood pressure. Favourite Tim Ashby said he could quite easily have continued but judges forced him to quit after medical advice. The station has scheduled the programme until Thursday but will continue if the battle continues into Friday. Useful link Touch the Truck website",

It is now used to describe an ambitious 20-year project to narrow the gap between these areas and the rest of the country.</p> <p>Within a few months of coming to power in 1997 the Labour government launched the social exclusion unit to first analyse problems in the 1,300 most deprived neighbourhoods. The unit, a small group of civil servants and seconded external experts, was set up within the cabinet office. Its first report, launched by the prime minister and deputy prime minister on an estate in Hackney, attacked the way that central and local government had failed these neighbourhoods in the past. Too much emphasis had been placed on physical regeneration and not enough on the communities themselves, the report found. It also claimed that previous efforts and funds had been wasted because of a lack of co-ordination centrally and locally.</p> <p>A further 18 policy action teams were set up to analyse specific problems in these areas from housing management to the lack of financial services. Each team was given a \"ministerial champion\", in the words of prime minister Tony Blair, to \"galvanise government as never before\". New Labour's persistent use of the phrase \"joined up thinking\" is most prevalent in this area.</p> <p>The work of these 18 teams forms the basis for the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal launched in January 2001. This involves a series of targets across Whitehall to improve the figures on employment, crime, health, education and the physical environment in the poorest neighbourhoods. It aims to ensure that spending across the public sector is used to tackle these problems. But there is also a \u00a3800m neighbourhood renewal fund for the 88 most deprived areas.</p> <p>A number of specific initiatives are associated with the strategy. Local strategic partnerships (LSP) are to be set up at district level. The idea is that these bodies will bring together different agencies to ensure that initiatives are co-ordinated rather than contradictory. LSPs will be expected to give a stronger voice to people within the various communities involved. Neighbourhood managers are to be appointed at a level below LSPs, who will act as visible figureheads, charged with taking responsibility at the sharp end.</p> <p>At a national level a neighbourhood renewal unit head by Joe Montgomery has been set up to co-ordinate efforts in Whitehall. The unit will work closely with neighbourhood renewal teams set up in each region.</p> <p>If reality is to match rhetoric from ministers then Whitehall departments and local bureaucrats will have to abandon traditional rivalries and become more flexible than in the past. </p> <p>But concerns remain about how the neighbourhood managers system will work locally. Some managers have said that their efforts could be frustrated unless they are given genuine powers and resources. There is also a worry that parachuting in highly paid managers may cause resentment among the local communities.</p>",

New Labour's persistent use of the phrase \"joined up thinking\" is most prevalent in this area. The work of these 18 teams forms the basis for the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal launched in January 2001. This involves a series of targets across Whitehall to improve the figures on employment, crime, health, education and the physical environment in the poorest neighbourhoods. It aims to ensure that spending across the public sector is used to tackle these problems. But there is also a \u00a3800m neighbourhood renewal fund for the 88 most deprived areas. A number of specific initiatives are associated with the strategy. Local strategic partnerships (LSP) are to be set up at district level. The idea is that these bodies will bring together different agencies to ensure that initiatives are co-ordinated rather than contradictory. LSPs will be expected to give a stronger voice to people within the various communities involved. Neighbourhood managers are to be appointed at a level below LSPs, who will act as visible figureheads, charged with taking responsibility at the sharp end. At a national level a neighbourhood renewal unit head by Joe Montgomery has been set up to co-ordinate efforts in Whitehall. The unit will work closely with neighbourhood renewal teams set up in each region. If reality is to match rhetoric from ministers then Whitehall departments and local bureaucrats will have to abandon traditional rivalries and become more flexible than in the past. But concerns remain about how the neighbourhood managers system will work locally. Some managers have said that their efforts could be frustrated unless they are given genuine powers and resources. There is also a worry that parachuting in highly paid managers may cause resentment among the local communities.",

      "bodyText": "A flagship Labour council that has pioneered the local government modernisation agenda is set to face strong criticism of its services in an independent report due for release later this year. A preliminary presentation by inspectors from the local government Improvement and Development Agency (Idea) says \"poor service delivery\" is undermining Brighton and Hove city council's credibility. It adds that access for local people to some services is \"poor\" and, ultimately, that the authority \"needs to live up to the expectations it has helped set\". Sources close to the inspection team have confirmed that the report will be embarrassing for the council's Labour administration, formerly headed by Home Office minister Lord Bassam. Brighton and Hove piloted best value, the government's service improvement regime, and was an early adopter of Westminster-style council cabinets, which were introduced in May 1999. Conservative group leader Geoffrey Theobald said the findings backed up his criticisms of the council: \"What we've been saying for some time is that council tax payers have been paying an enormous increase and we've seen a reduction in services and poor service delivery.\" The inspectors did, however, praise the council for boosting its national reputation with a range of new initiatives that have also helped to bring more funding into the city. They also say that Brighton and Hove, a unitary council created in 1997, has done a good job of bringing the services of its predecessor authorities into one organisation. Chief executive Glynn Jones said: \"A number of messages from this review seem to me very clear. One is that we have achieved a lot in a short time Brighton and Hove council provides a tremendous range of services. We do some of these brilliantly, we do some of these averagely and frankly we don't do some of them very well at all.\" He also admitted that the council needed to reconnect with communities and focus more clearly on the expectations of residents. The criticisms come at a difficult time for the Labour administration, which was last month hit by a humiliating backbench revolt when rebels voted with opposition parties to defeat the council's plans for a referendum on a directly elected mayor. Brighton and Hove had hoped to be the first authority in the country to take this step, and was planning to hold the poll on May 3. The defeat also infuriated ministers, who argued that the vote was an attempt to deny local people their right to choose how the council is led. Council leader Lynette Gwyn-Jones has since announced that she will stand down in April, although it is not clear whether her decision is linked to the defeat. The inspectors were invited in by Brighton and Hove as part of Idea's peer review programme, which puts together teams of local government professionals and politicians to assess the performance of councils and help them improve.",

      "bodyText": "BBC new media chief Ashley Highfield, has told programme-makers that from now on the BBC will only commission shows that come with online and interactive elements attached. \"The days of commissioning programmes are over, we are now only commissioning projects that have levels of interactivity,\" Mr Highfield said at the Production Show in London this morning. \"It's no longer viable to take programmes pitches without interactive elements such as SMS, internet or interactive TV,\" he added Mr Highfield added the BBC was also looking to include interactive rights in negotiations over the terms of new commissions. \"Programmes without interactive TV rights just won't be acquired,\" he said. Earlier this year, Mr Highfield described how frustrating it was to find the BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs had no internet aspect attached to it. \"Getting near the end of a four-year production and then, two months before finishing, asking the new media people to do a website is not how you do it,\" he said. He also revealed that around 75% of his new media budget would go on narrowband internet projects this year. A further 20% will be invested in interactive TV development and the remaining 5% on broadband. The BBC spent around \u00a370m on new media last year but Mr Highfield has not revealed how much the figure will increase this year. He said the BBC was planning to launch a broadband portal before the end of 2001. But he added the biggest advances in his department this year were likely to come from interactive TV. In order to achieve its aims, Mr Highfield said the BBC would forge deals with commercial partners, including internet portals and independent TV production companies. Mr Highfield was also critical of telecoms regulator Oftel for not forcing the pace of broadband network roll-out. \"The main thing holding back broadband progress was the indecisiveness of Oftel, he said. \"As broadcasters we need to collectively press the regulator speed up roll-out.\" Related story Feb 12: Working with dinosaurs",

As beef, pork and lamb wholesalers protested around the country at a catastrophic fall in meat consumption triggered by French fears about BSE, the agriculture minister Jean Glavany warned that more cases of the highly infectious foot and mouth disease could be expected soon. There seems no doubt that British animals were the cause of the outbreak. The 114-strong herd of French cattle that was slaughtered last night and will be incinerated today belonged to a farm bordering one that imported a flock of British sheep in February. Along with dozens of other farms in the north-western Mayenne region, that farm - in the small village of La Baroche-Gondouin - had already been put on high alert against the spread of foot and mouth. \"The neighbouring farm that imported the British sheep was placed under quarantine on 27 February, and strict protection and surveillance perimeters were set up,\" the agriculture ministry said. \"The British sheep, as well as all animals that had come into contact with them, were destroyed from that date onwards.\" France has so far ordered the destruction of 20,000 sheep imported from Britain after 1 February, as well as 30,000 French sheep that had contact with them.

      "body": "<p>If David Beckham has become increasingly fraught in recent weeks, the Manchester United midfielder should console himself with the notion that even the most stout-hearted of men are affected by passing moments of insecurity. </p> <p>In the late 20s a young right-half by the name of Matthew Busby, struggling to make the grade at Manchester City, wrote to his fiancee Jean and included the revealing line: \"I feel out of my sphere in this game.\" This future doyen of footballing excellence was so ridden by self-doubt that he nearly returned to the Lanarkshire pits. </p> <p>For all the pontificating about Beckham's recent spell of peripheral activity, he should also remember the slogan Ian Botham sported on a T-shirt during one lean spell: \"Form is temporary, class is permanent\". </p> <p>In football, however, patience is seldom afforded to those at Beckham's level and, with the Champions League knockout stages attainable tonight even with a 1-0 defeat by visiting Sturm Graz, United are reaching the point where they cannot afford Beckham to remain in hibernation. </p> <p>Whenever the England captain is scrutinised, of course, there is a tendency to exaggerate the situation. Unless this malaise drags on, it would be surprising if he were not nominated alongside his team-mates Teddy Sheringham and Fabien Barthez for the Professional Footballers' Association's player of the year award. </p> <p>Yet there is no disputing that there have been times recently when the foot-loose and fancy-free Beckham of earlier in the season has played as though in a straitjacket. </p> <p>Coming, as it has, as the England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson experiments with his options, the timing could hardly be worse and, while Beckham has yet to confront the issue publicly, he has felt compelled to seek advice. </p> <p>\"No one is more concerned than David,\" said United's assistant manager Steve McClaren. \"It's the job of all the coaching staff to speak to the players, David included, but maybe there are times, when world-class players like him go through a dip in form, that only they can find the answer. He is one of the best players in the world but, yes, he is going through a dip.\" </p> <p>What exactly is causing the problem remains a cloudy issue. That every player has to endure the occasional slump in form is not just an excuse conveniently wheeled out for the benefit of those in the game. And it is conceivable, though merely speculation, that, given United's talent for keeping things in-house, something may have happened behind the scenes. </p> <p>Yet the most likely explanation is that, slowly but surely, opposition defenders are cottoning on to Beckham's strengths and weaknesses. </p> <p>Undeniably his greatest asset has always been an uncanny knack of receiving the ball, nudging it forward and spearing a whipped ball into telling areas without needing to beat his marker. He does not have the trickery to spin past defenders but 30, 40 or 50 yards from goal, his right boot can be an instrument of torture. </p> <p>To combat this Roberto Carlos forced Beckham either backwards or inside when Real Madrid beat the Premiership champions last season, and now it seems that others have grown wise to similar containment ploys. </p> <p>In particular he seems to struggle whenever Ryan Giggs is missing. Rather than being fretful of the Welshman's potency on the left, opposing defenders have started doubling up on Beckham on the right, particularly in Europe. So the news that Giggs will miss tonight's game, having recovered from a hamstring problem only to catch flu, is a damaging blow to Beckham. </p> <p>\"When Ryan is out it definitely makes it easier for whoever we are playing against to deal with David; there's no doubt about it,\" Sir Alex Ferguson said yesterday. \"It changes the focus of their defending but we will have to find a way round that. Even though he's right-footed, maybe we need to bring in Luke Chadwick to give us the pace and penetration that Giggsy can provide.\" </p> <p>The question has popped up so frequently recently that the next person who inquires about Beckham's form to Ferguson should expect to have his eyebrows singed by a hot blast of the \"hairdryer\". </p> <p>Rather than focusing on individuals, United's manager prefers to deal in the collective. But there is no doubt his No7 was among those he was referring to when he added \"too many players have not been reaching their capabilities in the last few weeks. </p> <p>\"Those players have decent self-regard, they know they have been letting down the team and pride should come into it now. I'm sure they want to do something about it.\" </p> <p>Form, however, cannot be guaranteed. \"It is like a bird that passes by,\" Ruud Gullit once said. \"Sometimes you have it around you all the time, sometimes it just flies away and you don't know what the reason is.\" Beckham must hope that it flies back sooner rather than later. </p> <p> <strong> Manchester United</strong> (possible, 4-4-2): Barthez; G Neville, Brown, Stam, Silvestre; Beckham, Scholes, Keane, Chadwick; Yorke, Cole. </p> <p><strong> Sturm Graz</strong> (possible, 3-5-2): Sidorczuk; Neukirchner, Ibertsberger, Strafner; Schopp, Schupp, Fleurquin, Korsos, Minavand; Haas, Vastic </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : V Ivanov (Russia).</p>",

      "bodyText": "If David Beckham has become increasingly fraught in recent weeks, the Manchester United midfielder should console himself with the notion that even the most stout-hearted of men are affected by passing moments of insecurity. In the late 20s a young right-half by the name of Matthew Busby, struggling to make the grade at Manchester City, wrote to his fiancee Jean and included the revealing line: \"I feel out of my sphere in this game.\" This future doyen of footballing excellence was so ridden by self-doubt that he nearly returned to the Lanarkshire pits. For all the pontificating about Beckham's recent spell of peripheral activity, he should also remember the slogan Ian Botham sported on a T-shirt during one lean spell: \"Form is temporary, class is permanent\". In football, however, patience is seldom afforded to those at Beckham's level and, with the Champions League knockout stages attainable tonight even with a 1-0 defeat by visiting Sturm Graz, United are reaching the point where they cannot afford Beckham to remain in hibernation. Whenever the England captain is scrutinised, of course, there is a tendency to exaggerate the situation. Unless this malaise drags on, it would be surprising if he were not nominated alongside his team-mates Teddy Sheringham and Fabien Barthez for the Professional Footballers' Association's player of the year award. Yet there is no disputing that there have been times recently when the foot-loose and fancy-free Beckham of earlier in the season has played as though in a straitjacket. Coming, as it has, as the England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson experiments with his options, the timing could hardly be worse and, while Beckham has yet to confront the issue publicly, he has felt compelled to seek advice. \"No one is more concerned than David,\" said United's assistant manager Steve McClaren. \"It's the job of all the coaching staff to speak to the players, David included, but maybe there are times, when world-class players like him go through a dip in form, that only they can find the answer. He is one of the best players in the world but, yes, he is going through a dip.\" What exactly is causing the problem remains a cloudy issue. That every player has to endure the occasional slump in form is not just an excuse conveniently wheeled out for the benefit of those in the game. And it is conceivable, though merely speculation, that, given United's talent for keeping things in-house, something may have happened behind the scenes. Yet the most likely explanation is that, slowly but surely, opposition defenders are cottoning on to Beckham's strengths and weaknesses. Undeniably his greatest asset has always been an uncanny knack of receiving the ball, nudging it forward and spearing a whipped ball into telling areas without needing to beat his marker. He does not have the trickery to spin past defenders but 30, 40 or 50 yards from goal, his right boot can be an instrument of torture. To combat this Roberto Carlos forced Beckham either backwards or inside when Real Madrid beat the Premiership champions last season, and now it seems that others have grown wise to similar containment ploys. In particular he seems to struggle whenever Ryan Giggs is missing. Rather than being fretful of the Welshman's potency on the left, opposing defenders have started doubling up on Beckham on the right, particularly in Europe. So the news that Giggs will miss tonight's game, having recovered from a hamstring problem only to catch flu, is a damaging blow to Beckham. \"When Ryan is out it definitely makes it easier for whoever we are playing against to deal with David; there's no doubt about it,\" Sir Alex Ferguson said yesterday. \"It changes the focus of their defending but we will have to find a way round that. Even though he's right-footed, maybe we need to bring in Luke Chadwick to give us the pace and penetration that Giggsy can provide.\" The question has popped up so frequently recently that the next person who inquires about Beckham's form to Ferguson should expect to have his eyebrows singed by a hot blast of the \"hairdryer\". Rather than focusing on individuals, United's manager prefers to deal in the collective. But there is no doubt his No7 was among those he was referring to when he added \"too many players have not been reaching their capabilities in the last few weeks. \"Those players have decent self-regard, they know they have been letting down the team and pride should come into it now. I'm sure they want to do something about it.\" Form, however, cannot be guaranteed. \"It is like a bird that passes by,\" Ruud Gullit once said. \"Sometimes you have it around you all the time, sometimes it just flies away and you don't know what the reason is.\" Beckham must hope that it flies back sooner rather than later. Manchester United (possible, 4-4-2): Barthez; G Neville, Brown, Stam, Silvestre; Beckham, Scholes, Keane, Chadwick; Yorke, Cole. Sturm Graz (possible, 3-5-2): Sidorczuk; Neukirchner, Ibertsberger, Strafner; Schopp, Schupp, Fleurquin, Korsos, Minavand; Haas, Vastic Referee : V Ivanov (Russia).",

Aegis chief executive Doug Flynn said the media group was looking to bolster its market research business by acquiring European companies following the \u00a311.3m acquisition of US marketing consultancy Copernicus. \"We intend to make appropriate acquisitions in Europe and the likelihood is that we will make multiple acquisitions rather than one large one,\" said Mr Flynn. He said UK companies will be potential targets. Aegis recently bought Pegram Walters Market Research Group, its first European market research acquisition. Aegis is consolidating its Market Facts in the US, Asia Market Intelligence in Asia and PW in the UK under the Aegis Research banner to provide a consistent set of services and products worldwide. Mr Flynn said the downturn in the advertising market showed advertising spend returning to more consistent levels in line with steady growth shown over the past 15-20 years. It was not, he said, an indicator of long-term problems. Aegis is predicting a global advertising spend growth of 5.7%, broadly in line with other forecasts. It expects US advertising spend to grow at 4.5%, down from last year's 8% and puts European growth at 6.4% and Asia at 6.3%. But Deutsche Bank analysts believe that Aegis's forecasts may be subject to downward revision. The bank says advertising giant WPP is budgeting for a 2-3% growth in advertising spend this year. Aegis's media buying network Carat is reaping cost savings from companies consolidating accounts across Europe. However, Mr Flynn said account consolidation on a global level will not happen in earnest until 2003. \"Because of the logistics - technology, management structures and the way companies operate - global consolidation will happen in two or three steps over the next couple of years,\" he said. Aegis chief financial officer Jeremy Hicks said investment in 2001 on property, people and systems will be slightly less than the \u00a326.9m spent in 2000. This figure increased from \u00a313.1m capital expenditure in 1999. Related story Mar 13: Aegis bullish in face of slump",

      "bodyText": "Leeds and Man Utd will battle it out for full-back Michael Ball this summer. The Mirror quotes a source \"close\" to the \u00a36m-rated England man as saying: \"Those two clubs have made it clear that they will be in the bidding for Michael in the summer.\" Leeds would be prepared to offer Danny Mills or Jason Wilcox as part of any deal. Gianluca Vialli could become the coach at Serie A Udinese, according to the Mirror. Current coach Luigi De Canio has presided over a terrible run of results recently, and Vialli is seen as the man to sort it out. Fulham midfielder Fabrice Fernandes looks set for a move to Rangers. Fernandes, who is on loan at Craven Cottage from French club Rennes, said: \"I have spoken to David Murray and Dick Advocaat and they have impressed me very much, I have now set my heart on joiniing them. It may only be a loan deal until the end of the season but I know when I get up there I will be one of the best players in Scotland. I can convince Rangers the deal should be permanent.\" Tranmere star Jason Koumas will move to Fulham, say the Mirror, as soon ass Tranmere's battle to avoid relegation is over. The 21-year-old, who is also the subject of an international tug-of-war between Wales and Cyprus, would cost \u00a33m. Rangers, Chelsea and Newcastle are all interested in signing Southampton's Hassan Kachlou when his contract expires at the end of the season. Walter Smith has been in Copenhagen to check out AB pair Brian Steen Nilsen and Martin Albrechtsen, according to the Daily Express. Nilsen, a midfielder, played for Denmark in Euro 2000, while centre-half Albrechtsen, 20, is tipped for great things. Danny Dichio wants to leave Sunderland because he is fed up of being second choice to Niall Quinn. The Daily Express suggests that Ipswich, Derby and Crystal Palace have all watched the striker in recent weeks.",

The strategic rail authority (SRA) criticised Railtrack, beleaguered by recent rail tragedies, and signalled a downscaling of its role in funding major projects. An agenda put forward by the SRA suggested that what was required was fewer and stronger franchises on the railways, which are currently broken down into 25 separate train operating companies. It states: \"Public resentment of overcrowded, dirty and unreliable public services, particularly when some train operators benefit from large public subsidies, is very understandable and carries within it a backlash\". The authority described the railways as \"an ageing network facing a conflict of priorities\". Sir Alastair Morton, the SRA's chairman, warned passengers not to expect improvements overnight and that it was the growth in passengers, unforeseen at the time of privatisation, that had \"brought great pressure onto an ageing, under-invested system\". He said the document was neither a call for re-nationalisation nor for revolutionary structural change, but \"a call to the industry for a radical improvement in management, in operations, in method and performance and in service culture in the railway\". Of Railtrack, the SRA said the company had to \"rebuild confidence in its capabilities\" and that it had \"for so long resisted a proactive approach to accommodating modern trains on its frequently erratic, often unmeasured infrastructure\". The agenda has been drawn up against a government wish to invest \u00a360bn in the railways over the next 10 years. Around half this money will have to come from the private sector. Today, the SRA published a huge list of possible rail projects to be started over the next few years. The report said: \"There is now a consensus that Railtrack ... does not have sufficient financial and management capability simultaneously to monopolise this second business.\" Instead, the SRA is suggesting a rail modernisation fund - public funding managed by the SRA - to provide a flexible approach to developing enhancement projects on the network. However, Sir Alastair said it was \"highly unlikely\" that all the projects would be completed and there was no commitment or date for delivery of all the projects.

      "body": "<p>The town has been almost uncannily quiet for more than a week. It's not exactly the height of the tourist season, but even at this time of year we expect a constant stream of traffic heading west into the Cotswolds. Some of it passes straight through, but a fair proportion of travellers pause to explore our beautiful little market town.</p> <p>The passing trade is important for local shops and caterers, but these days they seem to be barely ticking over. Worse, the hotels and guesthouses have lost the annual fillip of the Gold Cup meeting at Cheltenham, which is just forty minutes drive away.</p> <p><b>The restaurateur</b></p> <p>Brian Galbraith, who runs Stones restaurant-bar in the heart of the town, has taken a double hit in recent days. Not only is the restaurant uncomfortably quiet, but his other business - a chauffeur service using Brian's own and his clients' cars - has been clobbered by the Cheltenham postponement.</p> <p>\"Normally this week accounts for up to a quarter of all our annual business. We have some really good clients who are prepared to spend a lot of money at Cheltenham. We knew that the Irish and the French probably wouldn't come, but we were still hoping for a good week. As it is, we can only hope that it will take place later,\" he said.</p> <p>The story of the restaurant is almost as gloomy. Although Stones has a growing local reputation and a loyal band of regulars, its central location in a striking old stone building normally guarantees it a handsome passing trade. The only problem is, not many people are passing now.</p> <p>On Sunday, Brian and partner Jan Blackburn normally expect to serve around 60 lunches. On one exceptional day just two weeks ago, they managed to serve 93. This Sunday, it was down to 20.</p> <p>\"It's really bad. Most of the people we had in on Sunday were locals, not passersby. There seem to be fewer and fewer people around as this thing goes on. The fact is, people are seeing now that the crisis is not going to go away. They're not seeing it as a thing that is going to go away in five minutes,\" said Brian.</p> <p>Jan, meanwhile, is having to cope with steadily increasing prices in the kitchen where she produces homecooked meals - for the most part from locally supplied produce. The price of bacon, for example, has gone up around 40% in the past week. The chances are that Stones will have one fewer waitress next weekend, as Brian and Jan struggle to contain costs.</p> <p><b>The butcher</b></p> <p>The meat served at Stones comes from John Kench the butcher, on the other side of the main street. The wholesale price of bacon rose sharply last week, and chicken is also more expensive. But meat prices in general have remained remarkably stable in view of public uncertainties about availability. John's supplies in fact have been virtually unaffected. He buys premium beef from Scotland, and top quality lamb and beef from Orkney.</p> <p>Both suppliers are still delivering weekly, and the shop is well stocked. Pigs were more problematic in the first week of the crisis, but now John is getting what he needs from local suppliers. Interestingly, demand is picking up, with more new customers coming into the small shop.</p> <p>\"I get the impression that this crisis has made people more aware of quality, which is just what I want. I may be wrong, but I think a lot of the new customers are supermarket shoppers who are thinking more now about what they are eating,\" said John.</p> <p><b>The supermarket</b></p> <p>The town's Co-op is also well supplied, with no sign of the panic buying which has gripped some supermarkets last week. Pork, beef and lamb are all available, and prices have not shifted in the past week. The Coop manager, Tony Hatch, has been warning that special offers would be suspended, but today the shelves are dotted with little yellow labels announcing \"low low prices\" on some meat lines.</p> <p>The Co-op has an advantage over other chains, as apart from retailing it is also Britain's biggest commercial farmer and thus, to a large extent, its own supplier. Even so, the restrictions on animal movements have taken their toll. A new notice on the meat shelves tells customers that the Co-op's policy is to support British meat producers, but that in present circumstances it has had to look for overseas supplies.</p> <p>Already, New Zealand lamb is prominently on offer, and pork is being brought in from Spain and Belgium.</p> <p><b>The farmer</b></p> <p>The very idea of importing meat is anathema for many farmers. Marilyn Ivings of Mill Farm at Church Enstone, is more concerned about the double standards in the regulation of the food industry which, she says, imposes unfair burdens on domestic producers.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency, she points out, has no jurisdiction whatever over imports, except on specific health issues. Thus chickens are being legally brought in from places like Brazil and Thailand, where they are given growth promoters which are banned in Britain.</p> <p>Marilyn also laughs scornfully at the notion that intensive farming methods, coupled with overuse of chemicals, antibiotics and other animal drugs, have contributed to the present crisis.</p> <p>\"People should realise how unintensive most farms really are. We had to give antibiotics to one of our cows last week, because she had mastitis. It was the second entry in our medicine book since the beginning of last year - that's just twice in 13 months.\"</p> <p>The other widespread public assumption which tends to make Marilyn say \"don't get me going on that one\" is that farmers affected by the foot and mouth outbreak get automatic compensation.</p> <p>\"People will keep saying that the farmers are reimbursed. Well, those who have livestock slaughtered are reimbursed, but the people whose farms are prevented from working, who cannot move their animals or sell them - they don't get any compensation. It's not as clear cut as some people seem to think,\" she said.</p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/gallery/0,7366,451184,00.html  \">Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

I'm on record as saying that I want this next Bond to be the most surprising and realistic of any I've done. I don't know why that frightens the studio and the producers so much.\"</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Eastwood,+Clint\">Clint Eastwood</a> is to bring the bestselling thriller Mystic River to the silver screen. Eastwood will produce and direct the story of three childhood friends who split up after a tragic incident, but who meet years later when they get involved in a murder investigation.</p> <p>\u0095 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences might have to go to trial to prove that tickets to Oscar night are non-transferable, after a three-judge panel ruled that the California Court of Appeal was wrong last year to prohibit the company World Sports Group from buying and selling Academy Award tickets. Academy spokesman John Pavlik said, \"The Academy will continue to prosecute this case until it is resolved.\" The Academy pressed charges after the 1998 Oscar bash, when it learned that company chief Rey Olsen was selling tickets to the event. On Oscar night, a couple, who had won tickets sold by a former member of the Academy in a radio contest, were asked to leave. The latest hitch for Oscar organisers comes a week after they attempted to force website Taketoauction.com to stop its auction of tickets to the movie beanfeast (see earlier <a href=\"/Film/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,449077,00.html\">story</a>). </p> <p>\u0095 Recently retired footballer Stan Collymore wants to follow <a href=\"/Film/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,45396,00.html\">Vinnie Jones</a>' example by becoming a Hollywood star.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Pierce Brosnan has been making provocative noises about the next Bond film, which is in development. \"We finally have a script now,\" reports the Irish smoothie. \"So we'll be forging ahead with the next film. I'm on record as saying that I want this next Bond to be the most surprising and realistic of any I've done. I don't know why that frightens the studio and the producers so much.\" \u0095 Clint Eastwood is to bring the bestselling thriller Mystic River to the silver screen. Eastwood will produce and direct the story of three childhood friends who split up after a tragic incident, but who meet years later when they get involved in a murder investigation. \u0095 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences might have to go to trial to prove that tickets to Oscar night are non-transferable, after a three-judge panel ruled that the California Court of Appeal was wrong last year to prohibit the company World Sports Group from buying and selling Academy Award tickets. Academy spokesman John Pavlik said, \"The Academy will continue to prosecute this case until it is resolved.\" The Academy pressed charges after the 1998 Oscar bash, when it learned that company chief Rey Olsen was selling tickets to the event. On Oscar night, a couple, who had won tickets sold by a former member of the Academy in a radio contest, were asked to leave. The latest hitch for Oscar organisers comes a week after they attempted to force website Taketoauction.com to stop its auction of tickets to the movie beanfeast (see earlier story). \u0095 Recently retired footballer Stan Collymore wants to follow Vinnie Jones' example by becoming a Hollywood star. Amid press reports claiming that the wayward striker has already had offers from film companies, Collymore's agent Ian Monk told the Daily Star, \"He's had a couple of offers which we haven't looked at in detail yet.

      "body": "<p>An air hostess who needed 18 stitches after being stabbed and slashed with a broken vodka bottle by a drunken passenger yesterday admitted she was now scared of flying and announced plans to sue the Airtours charter airline.</p> <p>Air hostess Fiona Weir, 32, of Wimbledon, south-west London, gave a Spanish court a horrific account of the Airtours flight from Gatwick to Malaga with a drunken passenger, Steven Handy, in October 1998.</p> <p>\"He nearly took my life. He has practically ruined it,\" she said after testifying against Handy, 39, at Malaga's provincial court.</p> <p>\"The airlines need to make sure that there is safety for everyone.\"</p> <p>Ms Weir said Handy, who admitted drinking almost a litre of vodka, had been allowed on to the flight although he had obviously already been drinking.</p> <p>\"I had my reservations so I informed the supervisor,\" she told the court.</p> <p>Handy was told to sit at the back of the plane away from other passengers beside an emergency exit. The cabin crew were ordered not to serve him alcohol. He began to shout at the hostesses as soon as the aircraft doors were shut. Soon after take-off he disappeared into the toilet and smoked a cigarette. Ms Weir said that when she told him not to smoke again he shouted: \"I am not smoking, you fucking bitch.\"</p> <p>Handy would only calm down when approached by the male cabin staff, but as soon as they disappeared he would become abusive again.</p> <p>He also beat his head against the seat in front of him, trying to make himself sick, before dropping into an alcoholic slumber. \"The passengers were petrified. We had children crying,\" said Ms Weir.</p> <p>Ms Weir said none of the crew noticed that Handy continued drinking during the two and a half hour flight from a vodka bottle hidden in his hand baggage.</p> <p>She complained to her supervisor several times during the flight and eventually told the captain she thought Handy should be arrested at Malaga. When the aircraft landed the captain announced over the tannoy to the passengers that they were waiting for police. This started other passengers swearing at Handy.</p> <p>Ms Weir stepped in to try and calm everyone down. Suddenly, Handy swung the bottle at her head. \"He smashed a litre bottle on my head and I raised my arm to protect my face. He continued smashing the jagged bottle down.\"</p> <p>Fellow hostess Nicola Costalas told how Handy pulled the broken bottle from Ms Weir's arm and then plunged it into her back as she lay huddled in the aisle.</p> <p>Ms Weir said she eventually ran out of the emergency exit and on to the tarmac, where she collapsed. \"I received a cut to the left hand side of my head, on the temple, and injuries with lacerations on my right arm and hand,\" she said. She was still seeing a psychiatrist in an attempt to get over the trauma. Aircraft now gave her claustrophobia and she did not like to go to places where people were drinking. She had worked for a year for another airline but had to stop last February.</p> <p>Handy, who pleaded guilty to the attack, yesterday appeared in court with a crucifix hanging from his neck and claimed he was a born-again Christian. \"I deserve a bit of punishment,\" he said after he was led handcuffed into court. \"I was totally drunk at the time. I remember hitting someone but I don't know why I did it.\"</p> <p>Spanish prosecutors yesterday demanded that Handy should receive a six-year prison sentence for attacking Ms Weir and a police officer at a Malaga hospital. The case was adjourned until April 5.</p> <p>Handy, who fled Spain after the attack, was extradited to Malaga from Britain last year.</p> <p>Airtours spokeswoman Deborah Sadler said yesterday the airline had not received formal notification of any action by Ms Weir. But Ms Weir's spokeswoman, Caroline Latta, said her lawyers were in contact with Airtours.</p>",

Air hostess Fiona Weir, 32, of Wimbledon, south-west London, gave a Spanish court a horrific account of the Airtours flight from Gatwick to Malaga with a drunken passenger, Steven Handy, in October 1998. \"He nearly took my life. He has practically ruined it,\" she said after testifying against Handy, 39, at Malaga's provincial court. \"The airlines need to make sure that there is safety for everyone.\" Ms Weir said Handy, who admitted drinking almost a litre of vodka, had been allowed on to the flight although he had obviously already been drinking. \"I had my reservations so I informed the supervisor,\" she told the court. Handy was told to sit at the back of the plane away from other passengers beside an emergency exit. The cabin crew were ordered not to serve him alcohol. He began to shout at the hostesses as soon as the aircraft doors were shut. Soon after take-off he disappeared into the toilet and smoked a cigarette. Ms Weir said that when she told him not to smoke again he shouted: \"I am not smoking, you fucking bitch.\" Handy would only calm down when approached by the male cabin staff, but as soon as they disappeared he would become abusive again. He also beat his head against the seat in front of him, trying to make himself sick, before dropping into an alcoholic slumber. \"The passengers were petrified. We had children crying,\" said Ms Weir. Ms Weir said none of the crew noticed that Handy continued drinking during the two and a half hour flight from a vodka bottle hidden in his hand baggage. She complained to her supervisor several times during the flight and eventually told the captain she thought Handy should be arrested at Malaga. When the aircraft landed the captain announced over the tannoy to the passengers that they were waiting for police. This started other passengers swearing at Handy. Ms Weir stepped in to try and calm everyone down. Suddenly, Handy swung the bottle at her head. \"He smashed a litre bottle on my head and I raised my arm to protect my face. He continued smashing the jagged bottle down.\" Fellow hostess Nicola Costalas told how Handy pulled the broken bottle from Ms Weir's arm and then plunged it into her back as she lay huddled in the aisle. Ms Weir said she eventually ran out of the emergency exit and on to the tarmac, where she collapsed. \"I received a cut to the left hand side of my head, on the temple, and injuries with lacerations on my right arm and hand,\" she said. She was still seeing a psychiatrist in an attempt to get over the trauma. Aircraft now gave her claustrophobia and she did not like to go to places where people were drinking. She had worked for a year for another airline but had to stop last February. Handy, who pleaded guilty to the attack, yesterday appeared in court with a crucifix hanging from his neck and claimed he was a born-again Christian. \"I deserve a bit of punishment,\" he said after he was led handcuffed into court. \"I was totally drunk at the time. I remember hitting someone but I don't know why I did it.\" Spanish prosecutors yesterday demanded that Handy should receive a six-year prison sentence for attacking Ms Weir and a police officer at a Malaga hospital. The case was adjourned until April 5. Handy, who fled Spain after the attack, was extradited to Malaga from Britain last year. Airtours spokeswoman Deborah Sadler said yesterday the airline had not received formal notification of any action by Ms Weir. But Ms Weir's spokeswoman, Caroline Latta, said her lawyers were in contact with Airtours.",

      "bodyText": "Ethnic Albanian guerrillas occupying southern Serbia signed a ceasefire yesterday, hours after Nato agreed to allow Yugoslav troops to enter the disputed buffer zone. Shefret Miliu, the rebel commander, ordered a 20-day halt to attacks from one minute past midnight, easing fears that the Yugoslavs' arrival would escalate the conflict, which has destabilised the Balkans. Pieter Feith, the Nato special envoy who mediated the truce, hailed it as a big step towards ending the guerrillas' attempt to make the Presevo valley, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, part of a greater Kosovo. The Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, known by its Albanian initials UCPMB, has killed 34 people since moving into the three-mile buffer zone set up in June 1999 keep the Yugoslav army away from Kosovo. Only lightly armed Serb police were allowed into the strip, putting them at the mercy of about 2,000 rebels armed with mortars, Kalashnikovs and mines. Covering less than 180 sq km (70 square miles), the zone was turned into a training ground, supply depot and smuggling route for Albanian extremists who now also threaten neighbouring Macedonia. Under yesterday's accord, Yugoslavia is expected to deploy the 7th Battalion of the Yugoslav 2nd Army into a 16 sq km patch of land adjoining Serbia's border with Macedonia. Nato and Macedonia are to also step up their patrols. There are big doubts about the ceasefire, however. At least four factions of the clan-based UCPMB are known to exist, and at some points their trenches are less than 200 metres from Serb positions, putting the rebels' anti-tank rockets easily within range. Commander Miliu, who only two days ago vowed to fight to the last man, reportedly added a clause saying he could not guarantee the safety of Yugoslav units. \"My commanders and I cannot accept responsibility for spontaneous actions of local Albanian elements in [the buffer zone].\" Many guerrillas say they will continue to oppose any political settlement that may now be on the cards. But the news of the ceasefire was greeted at their headquarters in the village of Koncul with celebratory shooting into the air. Most of the men in black fatigues cradling Chinese-made Kalashnikovs believed it to be a welcome break rather than a lasting accord. \"A happy day, for now,\" a grinning soldier called Valdet said. Mr Feith asked the rebels to exercise restraint. Lieutenant-General Carlo Cabigiosu, commander of the Nato-led force in Kosovo, K-For, said the aim of the accord with Belgrade was to allow the legitimate authorities to exercise their authority in the area. \"I hope that Albanians in the Presevo and Bujanovac area will understand that this is the time to move from armed conflict to peace.\" he said. The Serbian deputy prime minister Nebojsa Covic signed the accord near the Merdare border crossing. Fearing casualties, Washington has rebuffed British suggestions that the US troops who guard that part of the border should enter Serbia to squeeze the rebels. Yesterday soldiers consulted hand-held satellite positioning systems to ensure that they stayed inside Kosovo. It is thought that the Yugoslavs will have to operate without armoured vehicles, rocket-launchers and anti-tank weapons, although mortars and artillery stationed behind the zone may be permitted. How long they are to stay in the zone and the number of troops to be deployed is unknown. Meanwhile just 30 miles from Presevo, Macedonian police and soldiers exchanged gunfire with the UCPMB's sister group, the National Liberation Army, while advancing on Tanusevci, a village near the border. The insurgencies in southern Serbia and Macedonia are linked by demands for more rights for ethnic Albanians, who form majorities in the two adjoining regions.",

Now the drive-by shootings, murders and attacks are back. More than 40 people have been killed in the past two weeks alone in fighting between extremists from the Sunni and Shia Muslim sects. Pakistan is a largely Sunni nation and most live happily side-by-side with the Shia minority, who make up 20% of the 140m population. Extremist groups from both sects, however, are heavily armed and intent on murder. Nine Sunnis saying evening prayers in a mosque in Lahore yesterday were shot dead and another 11 people were injured. On Sunday gunmen ambushed a bus in Parachinar, in the North West Frontier, and shot dead seven Sunnis. The two attacks appear to be retaliation for the murders last week of 12 people in a Shia community in Sheikhupura, in the Punjab. Police blamed the Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi for the Sheikhupura attack, which they believe was in turn revenge for the execution earlier this month of a Sunni extremist convicted of the murder of an Iranian diplomat a decade ago. Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, a member of Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), or the Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet, was found guilty of murdering Sadiq Ganji, the director of the Iranian cultural centre, in Lahore in December 1990. Jhangvi lost his final appeal earlier this year and was hanged at dawn on February 29. The next day 14 Sunnis and Shias were killed in a daylight gun battle in the bazaar in Hangu, a small town in the North West Frontier. In the days before the execution, police had arrested at least 900 SSP members fearing a wave of revenge killings. Now the regime has again warned it will take action against the extremists. \"I want to say this very categorically that anyone who has indulged in such killings and whosoever is behind these killings will be taken to task sternly,\" Pakistan's military ruler General Pervez Musharraf said. But some doubt the government's ability to get to the heart of this problem. Attempts in the past year to ban illegal weapons have come to little, other policies appear limited. In the wake of the latest attacks, the Punjab government banned pillion passengers riding on motorcycles and outlawed the scribbling of slogans in chalk on walls. Both steps, it said, would help prevent such drive-by killings. Tehrik-e-Jafria, the largest Shia party, said it will launch a protest movement this week to demand the resignation of the Punjab governor for failing to protect their community. The threat comes ahead of the Shia religious festival Muharram, on March 26, which is often a time of sectarian tension. Last month Pakistan's interior minister, Moinuddin Haider, banned fundraising by militant groups fighting against the Indian army in Kashmir.

This seismic development in the history of humour was noted here a while ago in a survey of the Octavia 4x4 - the former communist company's first and celebrated attempt at a four-wheel drive vehicle - and we will have cause to make the point again now in considering the brand new Fabia estate. </p> <p>Ten years into their association with VW, which brought this seemingly knackered Czech company into revivifying contact with brilliant western innovations such as switches that worked and doors that both opened and closed, Skoda is quite rightly celebrating one of the greatest image turnarounds since Sting remodelled himself as someone with a warm and self-deprecating sense of humour. </p> <p>Nevertheless, even as one stands to applaud this unlikely recasting, one might have a little difficulty swallowing the use by the company, in some literature regarding the new Fabia, of the phrase \"Skoda's traditional values\". </p> <p>It is, after all, a mere decade since Skodas were routinely associated with litter bins. Unless you were going to obliterate history altogether (and there was certainly, for a while, a vogue for that, where Skoda come from), Skoda's \"traditional values\" would have to include crumbly welding, cow-like sluggishness and a commitment to the tea-chest as a source of aesthetic inspiration.

      "bodyText": "The point has been made on this page before (and with due ruefulness) that the golden age of the Skoda joke is over. This seismic development in the history of humour was noted here a while ago in a survey of the Octavia 4x4 - the former communist company's first and celebrated attempt at a four-wheel drive vehicle - and we will have cause to make the point again now in considering the brand new Fabia estate. Ten years into their association with VW, which brought this seemingly knackered Czech company into revivifying contact with brilliant western innovations such as switches that worked and doors that both opened and closed, Skoda is quite rightly celebrating one of the greatest image turnarounds since Sting remodelled himself as someone with a warm and self-deprecating sense of humour. Nevertheless, even as one stands to applaud this unlikely recasting, one might have a little difficulty swallowing the use by the company, in some literature regarding the new Fabia, of the phrase \"Skoda's traditional values\". It is, after all, a mere decade since Skodas were routinely associated with litter bins. Unless you were going to obliterate history altogether (and there was certainly, for a while, a vogue for that, where Skoda come from), Skoda's \"traditional values\" would have to include crumbly welding, cow-like sluggishness and a commitment to the tea-chest as a source of aesthetic inspiration. The company has definitely been excitingly reborn, but \"traditional values\"? There's no need to get cocky. Needless to say, the Fabia estate doesn't reflect Skoda's traditional values at all. Rather it stands as a shining, silver (in the case of the one that I drove) testament to the company's modern values, which include comfort, roominess, a modicum of unforced style and - even if the days of buying a Skoda for a loaf of bread and a pat of butter are now behind us - extraordinary value for money.

The group reported a 21.4% before-tax increase in profits to \u00a378.4m for 2000, at the lower end of market expectations. But the parent company of media buying network Carat remains optimistic about the group's prospects for the year ahead, despite an expected downturn in the advertising market. The group also announced the \u00a311.3m acquisition of US marketing consultancy Copernicus by its market research arm Market Facts. Aegis's turnover was up 19.2% to \u00a35.7bn and the company said it was upping its full-year dividend by 15% to \u00a31.15p per share. The group won \u00a32bn-worth of new business over the year, including contracts with Warner Lambert, Vodafone, Bertelsmann, Renault and luxury brands BMW and LVMH. It claims it is benefitting from brands consolidating media accounts on a pan-European and global basis. The group's large slice of European business will help protect the company from the US advertising slowdown. Less than a quarter of its business comes from the US. Aegis chief executive Doug Flynn said he was optimistic about the group's prospects. \"Carat Europe remains very much the driver of Aegis's growth in 2000 due to our strong regional presence and the increasing trend toward consolidation of media accounts to a regional agency of choice,\" he said. The group is consolidating its market research operations, which account for 32% of the group's revenues, into one global business, Aegis Research. The acquisition of Copernicus is part of the group's strategy to expand the business by building a global positioning in complementary areas of media and market research.

But now a new weapon has emerged which threatens not just to spike a few intrusive expos\u00e9s, but to change the face of tabloid journalism. If it succeeds, a judge was told in a private hearing this month, it will \"turn the Sun into a parish gazette\". </p> <p>A judgment delivered last week to no publicity at Lambeth county court in south London has caught news-paper executives on the hop and sent them scurrying to media lawyers for urgent advice. The senior judge at Lambeth, Judge Roger Cox, ruled that inflammatory and strident newspaper articles can amount to harassment, giving their victims the right to sue under the Protection Against Harassment Act 1997, the law designed to tackle stalkers. </p> <p>Esther Thomas, 29, a former civilian clerk with City of London police, is suing the Sun over stories about a complaint she made of racist behaviour against four police officers. The incident, involving a Somali asylum seeker, led to the demotion of two sergeants and a fine against a constable. </p> <p>The young Somali woman arrived at the police station penniless, claiming she had been robbed by the man who brought her to Britain. Thomas later told a disciplinary hearing - and another police officer backed her up - that the officers had been reluctant to take her to the Elephant and Castle in south London to catch a bus to the asylum centre in Croydon. </p> <p>According to Thomas, one officer said: \"What is this country coming to? We let everyone in,\" to which a second riposted: \"They should be shot. That's the quick and easy way to get rid of them.\" The third added: \"She found her own way here from Somalia; why can't she find her own way back?\" Despite an order from a senior officer to take the woman to the Elephant and Castle, she was taken only to London Bridge and left with only the \u00a32 Thomas had given her. She never arrived at Croydon and has never been traced. </p> <p>The Sun tells it a little differently. The story last July, headed \"Beyond a joke - fury as police sarges are busted after refugee jest\", claims that one officer said: \"She found her way 8,000 miles here from Somalia. Surely she can find her way four miles to Croydon.\" In the paper's version, Thomas, described as \"a black clerk\", tells the second officer: \"You'd like to shoot us all,\" and he replies: \"I'd have you shot if you don't get on with your work.\" </p> <p>A \"fellow cop\" is quoted: \"It was essentially light-hearted banter in private and the Somali never heard it. This is political correctness gone mad.\" No mention is made of the failure to comply with the senior officer's order or the asylum seeker's fate. </p> <p>Two of the officers were demoted from sergeant to PC, the Sun told readers. One, a \"dad of two\", had lost \u00a354,000 in salary and pension, the other \u00a334,000. The third was ordered to pay a \u00a3700 fine. And all because a \"black clerk\" reported a \"private remark\" to her bosses. </p> <p>Readers were not told that a white police officer, who had overheard the incident and made an entry about it in his pocketbook, backed Thomas up at the disciplinary hearing. </p> <p>A week later the paper published 12 letters under the slogan \"The Big Issue\". \"You were furious about our story about two police sergeants demoted for racism after joking about a Somali woman who wanted help getting to an asylum centre,\" read the introduction. Readers said they were \"shocked\" and \"disgusted\" and branded Thomas's action as \"diabolical\". Race-hate mail addressed to Thomas arrived at the police station. </p> <p>Two days later the Sun ran a third story, reporting that officers who tried to organise a whip-round to pay the constable's \u00a3700 fine had been told that they could face the sack for doing so, and inviting readers to send a cheque to the Fine Fund. </p> <p>Thomas, who had not been asked to give her version of events, learned of the initial story's publication when a colleague phoned her as she was getting ready to leave for work. \"I was absolutely terrified. I knew what was going to happen - I was going to be targeted. I was easily recognisable. People walk into the police station and the first person they see is me.\" </p> <p>The letters were taken away and Thomas was never shown their contents. One turned out to have a DNA fingerprint on it that matched DNA on a letter sent to Mo Mowlam. \"When I was leaving the station one day, one of the detective sergeants who had read the letters stopped me and said, 'Really, be careful, because they weren't very nice, take care of yourself.' For someone to do that - and it's not a person I normally speak to - they must have been quite horrific.\" </p> <p>She was at \"rock bottom\" when she read the readers' letters in the Sun a few days later. \"In the article they named me, said I was a black clerk and named the station where I worked. It was almost as if they were singling me out, saying, 'Yes, get her.' When they published the letters it only added fuel to a fire that was already burning vigorously.\" </p> <p>Already feeling vulnerable because of reaction at the station to her complaint against the four officers - \"I would walk down the corridor and conversations would stop\" - she left her job and now works elsewhere in the city. \"I just felt very vulnerable. I was in a front-line role. At any time somebody could come in and leap over the counter. If I called for urgent assistance and a particular group or groups or particular people were on duty, I didn't know that they were going to come running to my aid.\" </p> <p>The London Race Discrimination Unit, part of Lambeth Law Centre, took on her case. What gave Lawrence Davies, a senior solicitor with the unit, the idea of using the Protection against Harassment Act? \"It was just a moment of inspiration. Sometimes when you're desperate to find a remedy for your client things just pop into your head.\" </p> <p>In a private preliminary hearing, the Sun argued that her case was hopeless and had no legal basis, and asked the judge to strike it out or enter judgment for the paper. The Sun's counsel admitted that the articles were \"strident, aggressive and inflammatory\" but denied that they were racist. But the judge said that adjective, too, was justified. The colour of Thomas's skin had no bearing on the matters reported, he added, unless the paper was implying that she took the action she did because of her race. </p> <p>The Sun argued that the Protection against Harassment Act could cover doorstepping by reporters, but not the articles they wrote. Its counsel claimed that a ruling to the effect that the act covered newspaper reports would transform media law. He cited a statement by Lord Hoffmann, the law lord, that apart from the established exceptions or new ones enacted by parliament, freedom of speech was \"a trump card which always wins\". </p> <p>But the judge ruled that the act was just such an exception. It required a \"course of conduct\", so a single article would not be enough; and harassment included causing alarm or distress. \"Thus in my judgment the act does give the claimant a right to protection from harassment by all the world including the press,\" the judge concluded. The paper would have a defence if it could show that its conduct was reasonable. </p> <p>The Sun is taking the case to the court of appeal. It could go all the way to the House of Lords. Lawrence Davies hopes that some celebrities, who could have a new and simpler route open to them if the ruling stands up on appeal, will contribute to a fighting fund for Thomas. She has no legal aid and could be liable for substantial costs if the Sun wins on appeal. </p> <p>\"It was so inevitable that she would receive race-hate mail as a result of that article,\" says Davies. \"This paper has a circulation of 3m and is read by up to 12m people.

      "body": "<p>A judge has held that victims of media reports which cause \"alarm or distress\" can sue for damages for harassment, in an unprecedented judgment that opens a new route of redress against newspapers. </p> <p>The Sun is appealing against the unpublicised ruling, won last week by Esther Thomas, a civilian clerk for the City of London police, who sued the paper under the Protection Against Harassment Act. </p> <p>The act was brought into force in 1997 to protect the victims of stalkers but it does not spell out what behaviour amounts to harassment. It simply says that speech is covered, that there must be a \"course of conduct\" and that the conduct must cause the victim alarm or distress. </p> <p>For celebrities and others, it could open an easier and simpler means of redress than the privacy law emerging under the Human Rights Act, whose limits are still undefined. </p> <p>Geoffrey Bindman, a media solicitor who acts for Keith Vaz, Anna Ford and other high profile clients, said: \"It's very good news. It is highly desirable that there should be a remedy for innocent people who are hounded by the media and whose lives are seriously damaged by media harassment.\" </p> <p>In a private hearing at Lambeth county court in south London, the Sun asked Judge Roger Cox, the senior judge at Lambeth, to strike out the action or enter judgment in its favour. It argued that the case was hopeless and had no legal basis. But the judge ruled last week: \"The act does give to the claimant a right to protection from harassment by all the world, including the press.\" </p> <p>The articles reported that a complaint by Ms Thomas, who is black, against four officers over their behaviour when a Somali asylum seeker sought help had led to the demotion of two sergeants and a \u00a3700 fine for a PC. </p> <p>In the first article, under the headline Beyond a joke: Fury as police sarges are busted after refugee jest, the paper quoted a \"fellow cop\" as saying: \"It was essentially light hearted banter in private and the Somali never heard. This is political correctness gone mad.\" </p> <p>Ms Thomas, who was named in the article and described as a \"black clerk\", received race hate mail at the police station. The following week the paper published a selection of readers' letters attacking her for making the complaint and ruining the sergeants' careers. These were followed by a story seeking readers' contributions to pay the PC's fine. </p> <p>The Sun admitted the pieces were \"strident, aggressive and inflammatory\", but denied they were racist. The judge said that in his opinion the description \"racist\" was justified. </p> <p>The ruling is not limited to racial harassment, but covers anything causing alarm or distress if at least two articles are published. If only one was published it would not satisfy the requirement for a \"course of conduct\". </p> <p>The judgment has alarmed newspaper executives, who are seeking legal advice on its implications. The Sun's counsel, Matthew Nicklin, told the judge that if newspaper reports were covered by the act it would turn the Sun into a \"parish gazette\" and transform media law in Britain. The case is expected to go to the court of appeal later this year. </p> <p>Lawrence Davies, Ms Thomas's solicitor at the London Race Discrimination Unit, said: \"I think it will go all the way to the House of Lords.\" </p> <p>Robert Clinton of Farrer &amp; Co, the Sun's solicitors, said: \"It's effectively a brand new course of action. It would be an extraordinary further string to the bow of potential claimants. Any investigative journalism you do now that amounts to more than one article could make you liable under the act.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A judge has held that victims of media reports which cause \"alarm or distress\" can sue for damages for harassment, in an unprecedented judgment that opens a new route of redress against newspapers. The Sun is appealing against the unpublicised ruling, won last week by Esther Thomas, a civilian clerk for the City of London police, who sued the paper under the Protection Against Harassment Act. The act was brought into force in 1997 to protect the victims of stalkers but it does not spell out what behaviour amounts to harassment. It simply says that speech is covered, that there must be a \"course of conduct\" and that the conduct must cause the victim alarm or distress. For celebrities and others, it could open an easier and simpler means of redress than the privacy law emerging under the Human Rights Act, whose limits are still undefined. Geoffrey Bindman, a media solicitor who acts for Keith Vaz, Anna Ford and other high profile clients, said: \"It's very good news. It is highly desirable that there should be a remedy for innocent people who are hounded by the media and whose lives are seriously damaged by media harassment.\" In a private hearing at Lambeth county court in south London, the Sun asked Judge Roger Cox, the senior judge at Lambeth, to strike out the action or enter judgment in its favour. It argued that the case was hopeless and had no legal basis. But the judge ruled last week: \"The act does give to the claimant a right to protection from harassment by all the world, including the press.\" The articles reported that a complaint by Ms Thomas, who is black, against four officers over their behaviour when a Somali asylum seeker sought help had led to the demotion of two sergeants and a \u00a3700 fine for a PC. In the first article, under the headline Beyond a joke: Fury as police sarges are busted after refugee jest, the paper quoted a \"fellow cop\" as saying: \"It was essentially light hearted banter in private and the Somali never heard. This is political correctness gone mad.\" Ms Thomas, who was named in the article and described as a \"black clerk\", received race hate mail at the police station. The following week the paper published a selection of readers' letters attacking her for making the complaint and ruining the sergeants' careers. These were followed by a story seeking readers' contributions to pay the PC's fine. The Sun admitted the pieces were \"strident, aggressive and inflammatory\", but denied they were racist. The judge said that in his opinion the description \"racist\" was justified. The ruling is not limited to racial harassment, but covers anything causing alarm or distress if at least two articles are published. If only one was published it would not satisfy the requirement for a \"course of conduct\". The judgment has alarmed newspaper executives, who are seeking legal advice on its implications. The Sun's counsel, Matthew Nicklin, told the judge that if newspaper reports were covered by the act it would turn the Sun into a \"parish gazette\" and transform media law in Britain. The case is expected to go to the court of appeal later this year. Lawrence Davies, Ms Thomas's solicitor at the London Race Discrimination Unit, said: \"I think it will go all the way to the House of Lords.\" Robert Clinton of Farrer &amp; Co, the Sun's solicitors, said: \"It's effectively a brand new course of action. It would be an extraordinary further string to the bow of potential claimants. Any investigative journalism you do now that amounts to more than one article could make you liable under the act.\"",

      "body": "<p>I looked at my pictures today and tried to see the bad things in them that other people have seen. But I can't. Some are describing them as pornographic, others are accusing me of exploiting my children's innocence. I don't understand how you can see anything but the purity of childhood. When the exhibition opened eight weeks ago, the Observer's art critic, Laura Cumming, wrote that I had succeeded in capturing the way that a child would look at the world, almost as though I was a child myself. The exhibition got great press, and the whole experience has been positive - until last Thursday, when I went to the gallery to do an interview and found the police waiting for me. I was completely blown away. I even started joking around with the officers because I simply couldn't believe it was happening. I don't see sex in any of those prints, and if someone else reads that into them, then surely that is their issue, not mine.</p> <p>I have been documenting my family through pictures for over two years, and I take snapshots of everyday life. I think that the pictures are incredibly innocent and totally unsexual. I don't crop them, I don't retouch, and the shots are never staged. I might introduce an element, like a mask, to a given situation, but I would never insist that the child put it on. The photograph of my little boy naked on a pedestal, for example, happened completely spontaneously. My mother-in-law was going to a wedding, and she came over to the pool to say goodbye to my son, who was splashing about naked. He ran up on to the pillar and looked down at her. I happened to have my camera there, and I took the picture. That's how all these pictures come into being.</p> <p>My kids - Emilee, who is seven years old, and Michael, who is four - are everything to me. Some people have asked whether I worry that they will have problems with the pictures as they get older. But I don't think they will be embarrassed because I have never made them feel ashamed of their bodies, or of their nudity. If you are raised in an open environment, and taught to have confidence in yourself and your self-image, then it's fine. As for the suggestion that these photographs represent an invasion of my children's privacy, I would counter that I've done it to myself, and to my entire family, too. And if I had had any doubts, then my kids' pride in the exhibition immediately dispelled them.</p> <p>I never went to art school, and have no formal training in photography. After spending five years as a model followed by another five years working as a fashion photographer, I was thoroughly bored with the whole fashion industry. I had got married and had my two children, and was beginning to ask a lot of questions about myself. Becoming a mother is a major step for any woman: that transition from a single person doing your own thing to a person with responsibility for other human beings inevitably leads you to question your identity. Out of the blue, about two years ago, an art director friend of mine called up. He encouraged me to start documenting my family as a personal project.</p> <p>About a year ago, Kay Saatchi, whom I know through mutual friends, asked me to donate one of my photographs to an auction she was organising for the children's charity, Tommy's Campaign. Then I donated another photograph to a charity exhibition raising funds for the homeless, and somebody bought it. I didn't discover until two months later that that someone was Charles Saatchi.</p> <p>In April last year, I took my kids on a road trip across the States, visiting family along the way. I took more pictures, and showed the results to Charles when I returned. It was then that he decided to include my work in I Am a Camera.</p> <p>I was amazed. I had had no intention of exhibiting on that scale - I had thought that perhaps I would publish a book in 20 years' time. The fact that I was showing pictures of my family in public didn't hit me until the exhibition opened and I saw those massive prints hanging on the wall. But if I had ever had any doubts, they were completely dispelled at the opening. My dad flew over from New York, my brother came with his four- year-old son, and my two children would take strangers by the hand and point out to them their favourite pictures. It was such a special moment. My kids were so proud of me and of themselves.</p> <p>I would never exploit my children. They are such a huge part of my life, and I am always very honest with them. I would never take their photograph unless they felt OK with it. Some would argue: \"How do you know that they really feel OK? Don't they just want to please you?\" Of course I am aware of those issues. For example, when I took the photograph of my son peeing in the snow, he registered that this was something that pleased me and made me laugh. He started posing and peeing at every opportunity: \"Hey, mom, I'm peeing, take a picture!\" Of course I didn't, because I'm aware that there is a danger of your child doing things to please you rather than because they feel comfortable doing it. Similarly, my daughter is an incredibly sensuous little girl, and will sometimes strike poses that are rather erotic, as most little girls do. Again, I would never take a picture of her like that and exhibit it, because I wouldn't want to go there.</p> <p>Of course, there is a place for censorship in our society, and I find it amazing the amount that the authorities do let slip by. But this is nothing compared to that. This is art. This is kids in masks doing a silly pose. I don't go out of my way to take pictures of them while nude. These are six images out of a show of 15, and those 15 make up a tiny proportion of the photos I have taken over a lifetime.</p> <p>I find it hard to fathom why the police have picked on these particular shots in this particular exhibition. Sally Mann's portraits of her daughter, for example, are far more sexualised than mine. My pictures are about a captured moment, rather than about the person. They are about a feeling, and to that extent they preserve my children's anonymity. They are disguised somehow. I'm showing a moment of life, not part of their personality, and to that extent they could be anyone. Compare the pictures with Richard Billingham's work, where you really get to know his family. After seeing my shots, you have no idea of what my kids are about.</p> <p>I have been completely taken aback by the reaction over the weekend. I appreciate that this is a difficult subject, about which people have complex and mixed feelings, but the level of reaction has surprised me.</p> <p>Essentially, this is all a question of perception. It's like this: someone shows another person a blot of ink and asks them what they see. They reply: \"I see a German shepherd dog.\" Then they show them another blot, and they see a springer spaniel, then another and they see a doberman. The first person exclaims: \"Say, you sure do have an obsession with dogs.\" And the second replies: \"You're the one who keeps showing dog pictures.\"</p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee8019b\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,450901,00.html\">Polly Toynbee: the voyeurs have won</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,450866,00.html\">Matt Seaton on Tierney Gearon's real crime</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/child/\">Special report: child protection</a></p>",

It was such a special moment. My kids were so proud of me and of themselves. I would never exploit my children. They are such a huge part of my life, and I am always very honest with them. I would never take their photograph unless they felt OK with it. Some would argue: \"How do you know that they really feel OK? Don't they just want to please you?\" Of course I am aware of those issues. For example, when I took the photograph of my son peeing in the snow, he registered that this was something that pleased me and made me laugh. He started posing and peeing at every opportunity: \"Hey, mom, I'm peeing, take a picture!\" Of course I didn't, because I'm aware that there is a danger of your child doing things to please you rather than because they feel comfortable doing it. Similarly, my daughter is an incredibly sensuous little girl, and will sometimes strike poses that are rather erotic, as most little girls do. Again, I would never take a picture of her like that and exhibit it, because I wouldn't want to go there. Of course, there is a place for censorship in our society, and I find it amazing the amount that the authorities do let slip by. But this is nothing compared to that. This is art. This is kids in masks doing a silly pose. I don't go out of my way to take pictures of them while nude. These are six images out of a show of 15, and those 15 make up a tiny proportion of the photos I have taken over a lifetime. I find it hard to fathom why the police have picked on these particular shots in this particular exhibition. Sally Mann's portraits of her daughter, for example, are far more sexualised than mine. My pictures are about a captured moment, rather than about the person. They are about a feeling, and to that extent they preserve my children's anonymity. They are disguised somehow. I'm showing a moment of life, not part of their personality, and to that extent they could be anyone. Compare the pictures with Richard Billingham's work, where you really get to know his family. After seeing my shots, you have no idea of what my kids are about. I have been completely taken aback by the reaction over the weekend. I appreciate that this is a difficult subject, about which people have complex and mixed feelings, but the level of reaction has surprised me. Essentially, this is all a question of perception. It's like this: someone shows another person a blot of ink and asks them what they see. They reply: \"I see a German shepherd dog.\" Then they show them another blot, and they see a springer spaniel, then another and they see a doberman. The first person exclaims: \"Say, you sure do have an obsession with dogs.\" And the second replies: \"You're the one who keeps showing dog pictures.\" What do you think?

Anthea, Claire and Keith, what John Cleese calls celebrity pond life, were gambolling in the celebrity pond, a hot tub in the garden. Only Dee was hacking away at the earth with a light rake, perhaps with vague memories of POWs concealing soil in their trousers.

      "body": "<p>Britain faced a precautionary mass cull of sheep yesterday as the foot-and-mouth virus spread further through the country.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, revealed that up to 500,000 ewes might have to be slaughtered to halt the outbreak, as the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed 19 more cases, taking the total to 183.</p> <p>Tony Blair promised to begin a series of talks tomorrow with farmers and others hit by the outbreak.</p> <p>Officials were making it a priority to discover how the virus spread to the West Midlands, which reported its first case in a herd of cattle at a farm in Little Wyrley, Pelsall, near Walsall.</p> <p>The disease has now been found in 23 counties, although most cases are clustered around Devon, Cumbria and Northumberland.</p> <p>Jim Scudamore, the government's chief veterinary officer, said that the cases identified so far had been spread as a result of livestock movements through Longtown market in Cumbria and a sheep dealer in Devon.</p> <p>So far around 120,000 animals have been killed and a further 40,000 await slaughter.</p> <p>Farmers reacted angrily to the proposals for mass slaughter of sheep. The ewes need to be moved from winter quarters for the lambing season, and to free pastures for cattle in the spring, but could spread infection if moved.</p> <p>\"This plan is absolutely ridiculous,\" said Anthony Gibson, director of the National Farmers Union in the West Country. \"I can understand why they do not want sheep being brought back to home farms but the sensible thing is for them to give birth where they are.</p> <p>\"A lot of farmers have already made arrangements to do this. It is sometimes inconvenient, but sheep have been giving birth to lambs unaided for thousands of years.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown admitted yesterday that the outbreak was of a \"different order\" than previously thought, but continued to insist it was under control.</p> <p>He added: \"There has been a tremendous amount of disease incubating in the national flock. We are now dealing with the problem which is on a different scale to the one it was three weeks ago.\"</p> <p>New regulations to fight the disease came into force at the weekend after the European commission ordered that the tyres of vehicles leaving the UK must be disinfected.</p> <p>Mr Scudamore said that the current movement ban in infected areas - 30 days after slaughter and initial disinfection - could be extended.</p> <p>But there was fresh criticism from Ireland as another minister attacked Britain's handling of the crisis.</p> <p>\"There are new areas with outbreaks all the time. They don't seem to have got it under control, and that is of major concern to us here, because what happens in Britain could have disastrous consequences for this country,\" said junior agriculture minister Eamon O'Cuiv.</p> <p>Stormont minister Brid Rodgers confirmed that department of agriculture vets were investigating a suspected case in a sheep in Augher, Co Tyrone, which had been taken to an abattoir in Dungannon.</p> <p>There has only been one confirmed case in Ulster, on a farm in Meigh, south Armagh, which is believed to have orig inated from a market near Carlisle where almost 300 sheep were bought and taken to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>But Mrs Rodgers said the consignment might have been larger than previously thought and some animals could have been smuggled into the Irish Republic, which so far remains clear of the disease.</p> <p>The republic has introduced emergency legislation to crack down on illegal dealing and police and soldiers have mounted a massive operation at the border to prevent the spread of the virus. Major events have been cancelled, including this Saturday's St Patrick's Day parades in Dublin and Belfast.</p> <p>Mr Brown said: \"It is not right to say that we are not dealing with it correctly. The important thing is that we stick together. The whole of the European Union has a vested interest in eradicating this disease in Britain.\"</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "bodyText": "Britain faced a precautionary mass cull of sheep yesterday as the foot-and-mouth virus spread further through the country. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, revealed that up to 500,000 ewes might have to be slaughtered to halt the outbreak, as the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed 19 more cases, taking the total to 183. Tony Blair promised to begin a series of talks tomorrow with farmers and others hit by the outbreak. Officials were making it a priority to discover how the virus spread to the West Midlands, which reported its first case in a herd of cattle at a farm in Little Wyrley, Pelsall, near Walsall. The disease has now been found in 23 counties, although most cases are clustered around Devon, Cumbria and Northumberland. Jim Scudamore, the government's chief veterinary officer, said that the cases identified so far had been spread as a result of livestock movements through Longtown market in Cumbria and a sheep dealer in Devon. So far around 120,000 animals have been killed and a further 40,000 await slaughter. Farmers reacted angrily to the proposals for mass slaughter of sheep. The ewes need to be moved from winter quarters for the lambing season, and to free pastures for cattle in the spring, but could spread infection if moved. \"This plan is absolutely ridiculous,\" said Anthony Gibson, director of the National Farmers Union in the West Country. \"I can understand why they do not want sheep being brought back to home farms but the sensible thing is for them to give birth where they are. \"A lot of farmers have already made arrangements to do this. It is sometimes inconvenient, but sheep have been giving birth to lambs unaided for thousands of years.\" Mr Brown admitted yesterday that the outbreak was of a \"different order\" than previously thought, but continued to insist it was under control. He added: \"There has been a tremendous amount of disease incubating in the national flock. We are now dealing with the problem which is on a different scale to the one it was three weeks ago.\" New regulations to fight the disease came into force at the weekend after the European commission ordered that the tyres of vehicles leaving the UK must be disinfected. Mr Scudamore said that the current movement ban in infected areas - 30 days after slaughter and initial disinfection - could be extended. But there was fresh criticism from Ireland as another minister attacked Britain's handling of the crisis. \"There are new areas with outbreaks all the time. They don't seem to have got it under control, and that is of major concern to us here, because what happens in Britain could have disastrous consequences for this country,\" said junior agriculture minister Eamon O'Cuiv. Stormont minister Brid Rodgers confirmed that department of agriculture vets were investigating a suspected case in a sheep in Augher, Co Tyrone, which had been taken to an abattoir in Dungannon. There has only been one confirmed case in Ulster, on a farm in Meigh, south Armagh, which is believed to have orig inated from a market near Carlisle where almost 300 sheep were bought and taken to Northern Ireland. But Mrs Rodgers said the consignment might have been larger than previously thought and some animals could have been smuggled into the Irish Republic, which so far remains clear of the disease. The republic has introduced emergency legislation to crack down on illegal dealing and police and soldiers have mounted a massive operation at the border to prevent the spread of the virus. Major events have been cancelled, including this Saturday's St Patrick's Day parades in Dublin and Belfast. Mr Brown said: \"It is not right to say that we are not dealing with it correctly. The important thing is that we stick together. The whole of the European Union has a vested interest in eradicating this disease in Britain.\" What's going on?

The ewes are marked according to the number of lambs they carry. When lambing starts we find it much easier to match up ewes with only one lamb with a spare lamb from a ewe with three.

      "body": "<p>British Horseracing Board chairman, Peter Savill, yesterday strongly defended the decision to carry on racing in the face of the present foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>Savill made his comments, his first public utterances on the subject, at Plumpton where he is also chairman and which had come under fire from angry local farmers for its decision to go ahead with the meeting.</p> <p>Savill's blunt message was that despite a great deal of emotion on the decision to carry on, racing's heart should not rule its head.</p> <p>He said: \"The outbreak is a concern not just for the farming fraternity but to the whole of the country. The outbreak is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt in my mind that if they believed that there was any risk whatsoever of racing continuing and adding to the dangers of spreading the outbreak then they would have come to the decision that racing should not continue. They would have instructed us to introduce a ban.</p> <p>\"As long as the ministry is happy for racing to continue we have a responsibility to our own industry and not to put the 100,000 or so people employed in racing at risk. It is a huge industry, and the seven- day break we have had already showed what damage a ban could do.\"</p> <p>Savill likened the outbreak to the HIV virus some years ago. \"When people thought that being in the same room as a sufferer put you at risk. Of course, that was not true, but the public was not ready to accept the medical evidence put before them and I fear we may have the same situation here. I have to leave the emotional side out of it and go by the scientific evidence of the ministry.\"</p> <p>When asked why Ireland had banned racing and Britain had not, he replied: \"When should we say we will be governed by another country's decision? Our government is the British government and therefore we must be guided by what they say.</p> <p>\"But of course we understand the emotional pressure a lot of farmers are under in their daily fears when inspecting their stock. I know that generally throughout the farming community there is a strong feeling that they would prefer racing not to take place. However, farmers and rural people are the backbone of the National Hunt sport.</p> <p>\"Look at the entries in hunter chases which are farm-based - there is still strong support for that type of race. If the decision to carry on racing had been the reverse, how many people would we have in our own industry who would be up in arms?\"</p> <p>Savill pinpointed how betting turnover was dramatically down in the week-long break which proved that British racing was fundamental to the betting industry, and added: \"I think we have set an example as a sport to other sports in the way we have dealt with this.</p> <p>\"On the Irish decision - and I live in Ireland a lot of the time - that country is much more rural and agriculturally based than ours. They make their own rules, but I fear that if they stay closed for a long time they will come under fire.\"</p> <p>The threats of roadblocks and the course being ploughed up by irate farmers failed to materialise. There was a strong police presence in surrounding lanes but the only action reported was that road signs to the circuit had been turned round to point in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Yet there could not have been a more ironic result to the first race when Leggies Legacy, trained by Lawrence Wells, who runs a 100-head long-haired Ireland cattle herd alongside his stables at Billinghurst in West Sussex, romped in at 20-1.</p> <p>Wells was embarrassed by the win. \"I would have preferred that racing would have been off. This is a very touchy subject and I know all my farming friends think we should not be racing.</p> <p>\"I think the BHB should have called the sport off altogether earlier and not resumed.

      "bodyText": "British Horseracing Board chairman, Peter Savill, yesterday strongly defended the decision to carry on racing in the face of the present foot and mouth crisis. Savill made his comments, his first public utterances on the subject, at Plumpton where he is also chairman and which had come under fire from angry local farmers for its decision to go ahead with the meeting. Savill's blunt message was that despite a great deal of emotion on the decision to carry on, racing's heart should not rule its head. He said: \"The outbreak is a concern not just for the farming fraternity but to the whole of the country. The outbreak is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture. \"There is no doubt in my mind that if they believed that there was any risk whatsoever of racing continuing and adding to the dangers of spreading the outbreak then they would have come to the decision that racing should not continue. They would have instructed us to introduce a ban. \"As long as the ministry is happy for racing to continue we have a responsibility to our own industry and not to put the 100,000 or so people employed in racing at risk. It is a huge industry, and the seven- day break we have had already showed what damage a ban could do.\" Savill likened the outbreak to the HIV virus some years ago. \"When people thought that being in the same room as a sufferer put you at risk. Of course, that was not true, but the public was not ready to accept the medical evidence put before them and I fear we may have the same situation here. I have to leave the emotional side out of it and go by the scientific evidence of the ministry.\" When asked why Ireland had banned racing and Britain had not, he replied: \"When should we say we will be governed by another country's decision? Our government is the British government and therefore we must be guided by what they say. \"But of course we understand the emotional pressure a lot of farmers are under in their daily fears when inspecting their stock. I know that generally throughout the farming community there is a strong feeling that they would prefer racing not to take place. However, farmers and rural people are the backbone of the National Hunt sport. \"Look at the entries in hunter chases which are farm-based - there is still strong support for that type of race. If the decision to carry on racing had been the reverse, how many people would we have in our own industry who would be up in arms?\" Savill pinpointed how betting turnover was dramatically down in the week-long break which proved that British racing was fundamental to the betting industry, and added: \"I think we have set an example as a sport to other sports in the way we have dealt with this. \"On the Irish decision - and I live in Ireland a lot of the time - that country is much more rural and agriculturally based than ours. They make their own rules, but I fear that if they stay closed for a long time they will come under fire.\" The threats of roadblocks and the course being ploughed up by irate farmers failed to materialise. There was a strong police presence in surrounding lanes but the only action reported was that road signs to the circuit had been turned round to point in the opposite direction. Yet there could not have been a more ironic result to the first race when Leggies Legacy, trained by Lawrence Wells, who runs a 100-head long-haired Ireland cattle herd alongside his stables at Billinghurst in West Sussex, romped in at 20-1. Wells was embarrassed by the win. \"I would have preferred that racing would have been off. This is a very touchy subject and I know all my farming friends think we should not be racing. \"I think the BHB should have called the sport off altogether earlier and not resumed. Yet I have owners who want to race and I've got to listen to them. I can't just sit at home.\" What's going on?

      "body": "<p>I suppose it was inevitable really. At the first hint of an emergency, the government is generally quick to announce its plans to send in the troops to mop up the floods or drive the ambulances and fire-engines. So the only surprise is that it is has taken this long for the army to be sent into schools.</p> <p>After successful trials in Norfolk and Newcastle, the government last week confirmed that it was planning to spend a further \u00a3600,000 to hire members of the armed forces to work with 14- to 16-year-olds in schools in Manchester, Merseyside, Leicester, Bristol, the West Midlands and London. The scheme, called Skill Force, which is targeted at those teenagers who are already disaffected or perceived to be at risk of becoming so, aims to work with the school system to reduce truancy and disruption by teaching practical and vocational skills at KS4 instead of a modern foreign language and a science subject.</p> <p>Put the words army and school in the same sentence and you automatically think Willie Whitelaw, \"short, sharp shocks\" and boot-camp discipline. And when I arrive at Methwold High School, one of the three Norfolk schools taking part in the project, that looks exactly what's on offer. Eighty pupils - some from Methwold High, the rest from the other two schools taking part, Hamond's High School in Swaffham and Wayland Community High School in Watton - are gathered in the hall while two soldiers in combat fatigues patrol the front of the stage waiting for an army recruitment video to begin.</p> <p>\"Er, it's unfortunate that you've come today,\" says Captain Brett Jarvis, the course leader who is dressed in civvies and looking every inch the teacher. \"I know it looks terribly militaristic, but it isn't really. Part of the Skill Force course involves potential employers giving a presentation to students about what they do and what sort of people they are looking for. Today it's the army's turn.\"</p> <p>But it's no coincidence that two of the half dozen or so employers to have made presentations so far are the navy and the Royal Air Force. The Ministry of Defence is supplying the trainers for the course, recruitment levels are down and any quid pro quo is gratefully received. For their part, the children are completely unfazed by any military overtones. Some are planning to enlist on leaving school anyway, and those who aren't seem to reckon that anything is better than sitting in classes. \"I thought it was going to be all marching when I signed up for this option,\" says Richard Mather, a year 10 student at Wayland, \"but I didn't mind as I don't like foreign languages.\"</p> <p>Marching isn't on the menu, and PT is the closest anyone gets to basic training. \"It can't be a military operation,\" jokes Capt Jarvis, \" as the transport doesn't turn up two hours late.\" What is on offer are basic key skills incorporated into the bronze and silver Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Networks (Asdan) syllabuses, together with the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh's award, the St John's lifesaver awards and some outdoor environmental experience.</p> <p>Were Alastair Campbell to set foot in Wayland Community High School, he would no doubt immediately declare it a \"bog standard comprehensive\". It has the usual range of abilities and social groupings; its GCSE attainment levels are slightly above the national average but, like most schools, it has its fair share of problems - including disaffected and disruptive pupils. For the school, the relaxation at KS4 that allows the national curriculum to be disapplied under certain circumstances has been something of a godsend, and when it was approached to join in the army's pilot scheme it responded enthusiastically.</p> <p>At all three schools in the Norfolk project, the pupils were given the final say on their participation, but in all cases it seems that a fair degree of social engineering was involved in deciding who should be offered the option in the first place. Methwold took the route of asking for volunteers from those who were lacking in self-confidence and were unlikely to cope with the GCSE syllabus, Hamond's opted for a mix of the non-academic and those with behavioural difficulties, while according to Brett Jarvis, Wayland went the whole hog and put forward 22 of their most disruptive kids.</p> <p>Chris Dix, Wayland's headteacher, is slightly defensive at this suggestion. \"We followed the guidelines that were put forward by the army,\" he says. \"We chose from across a range of academic abilities those who were disaffected or in danger of becoming so. I would accept, though, that some of the students are quite challenging.\"</p> <p>Dix need not have been so protective of his students' sensibilities; they wouldn't see their behaviour as challenging so much as the stuff of nightmares. \"I'd been suspended twice for swearing at teachers and messing around in class and was regularly picking up four detentions a week,\" admits Mather. \"My parents were starting to have a real struggle getting me to go to school in the morning.\" Mather's was a familiar story. \"I'd been suspended at least twice for swearing and talking back to teachers,\" says Barry Ford. And so on. Martin Gisborne had been in constant trouble for fighting and backchatting. \"The school split me up from the group I used to hang around with and put me in isolation,\" he says. \"It just frustrated me even more so I started messing around even worse.\"</p> <p>The point is, though, that after six months on the course they all claim - and the school agrees - that their behaviour has improved beyond all recognition. \"I've only had one detention and I haven't felt like bunking off,\" says Mather. \"I thought it was about time I sorted myself out,\" says Gisborne. There has also been a further knock-on benefit of improvements in their GCSE curricular work. So what is the secret?</p> <p> Brett Jarvis acknowledges that it was an uphill struggle for the first few months as the kids pushed the limits to see what they could get away with, but believes that it was their interest in what they were doing and the strength of the relationships that he and the two sergeants, Tony Shuttleworth and Bertie Burtenshaw, were able to forge that proved the clinching factor. \"I think they liked the fact that we didn't come across in the same way as the teachers they have known,\" says Jarvis. \"The two sergeants have proved to be extremely effective role models. Neither were particularly academic at school, but by applying the very principles we are teaching here, have gone on to be successful.\"</p> <p>The kids see it slightly differently. They enjoy the work - \"less boring, more useful\" - and the sanction of being slung off the course is a great deal more effective than being banned from maths, but what they really seem to appreciate is being treated as adults. \"If you get wound up and think you're going to lose your temper they let you take five minutes out,\" says Matthew Balls. \"A teacher would think you were trying to skive off if you asked for time out.\" \"They don't say 'Do this' or 'Do that',\" says Mather. \"They tell you what's expected and let you get on with it. If you need help they'll give it but they let you complete the work to your standard, not some curriculum standard. So you feel like putting more effort in.\"</p> <p>Skill Force is no panacea. Some of those on the course have a reading age of seven, many are statemented and some are on medication for behavioural problems, and the course does not replace all the usual pastoral measures to cope with disruption. What it does do at the very least is contain the problem. The pressure on teachers' time is horrendous at the best of times and disruptive kids take up more time than most. With the disaffected channelled into something that interests them, teachers are free to give their time to the 28 kids who want to learn rather than the two who don't.</p> <p>There is a danger that such schemes will introduce a two-tier system at KS4 and Mather acknowledges that his father had reservations about him dropping Double Science. But Dix thinks such worries are an irrelevance. \"The students will still be doing GCSEs,\" he says, \"but in any case there always was a two-tier system. Kids are very quick to identify their levels of ability, and many of the less able quickly recognised that they weren't going to be able to cope with the curricular work early in year 10 and identified themselves as failures. With Skillforce we are providing a course at which they can succeed and thereby raise their self-esteem.\"</p> <p>Endorsements for the scheme have come from all quarters. Allan Rimmer, the administrator for the Association of Workers for Children with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties, is pleased that the course recognises the importance of continuing to teach key skills, such as numeracy and literacy. \"Disruptive children need the curriculum, too, and we welcome anything that finds an effective way of teaching it,\" he says. </p> <p>Jenny Mosley, one of those at the forefront of introducing Circle Time into school, is also in favour. \"You can't underestimate the importance of team-building and leadership in helping those with emotional difficulties,\" she says. \"What I would want to make sure is that there was time included in the course for reflection. Experiences are often very immediate, and you only get to understand the processes involved by thinking about them at a later date. That is very often where the learning takes place.\"</p> <p>The one dark cloud on the horizon is money. Despite the new funding, no one seems to have worked out that if you want to continue the scheme it will involve running two parallel groups. Wayland plans to continue the current course when the year 10s move into year 11, but has a queue of year 9 punters eager to sign up for the autumn. \"The army is trying to accommodate us by offering us more time,\" says Dix, \"but even so it would involve an overall reduction in the time each year group would get. We think this sends out all the wrong messages to the students.\"</p> <p>Joined-up government only goes so far, it seems.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I suppose it was inevitable really. At the first hint of an emergency, the government is generally quick to announce its plans to send in the troops to mop up the floods or drive the ambulances and fire-engines. So the only surprise is that it is has taken this long for the army to be sent into schools. After successful trials in Norfolk and Newcastle, the government last week confirmed that it was planning to spend a further \u00a3600,000 to hire members of the armed forces to work with 14- to 16-year-olds in schools in Manchester, Merseyside, Leicester, Bristol, the West Midlands and London. The scheme, called Skill Force, which is targeted at those teenagers who are already disaffected or perceived to be at risk of becoming so, aims to work with the school system to reduce truancy and disruption by teaching practical and vocational skills at KS4 instead of a modern foreign language and a science subject. Put the words army and school in the same sentence and you automatically think Willie Whitelaw, \"short, sharp shocks\" and boot-camp discipline. And when I arrive at Methwold High School, one of the three Norfolk schools taking part in the project, that looks exactly what's on offer. Eighty pupils - some from Methwold High, the rest from the other two schools taking part, Hamond's High School in Swaffham and Wayland Community High School in Watton - are gathered in the hall while two soldiers in combat fatigues patrol the front of the stage waiting for an army recruitment video to begin. \"Er, it's unfortunate that you've come today,\" says Captain Brett Jarvis, the course leader who is dressed in civvies and looking every inch the teacher. \"I know it looks terribly militaristic, but it isn't really. Part of the Skill Force course involves potential employers giving a presentation to students about what they do and what sort of people they are looking for. Today it's the army's turn.\" But it's no coincidence that two of the half dozen or so employers to have made presentations so far are the navy and the Royal Air Force. The Ministry of Defence is supplying the trainers for the course, recruitment levels are down and any quid pro quo is gratefully received. For their part, the children are completely unfazed by any military overtones. Some are planning to enlist on leaving school anyway, and those who aren't seem to reckon that anything is better than sitting in classes. \"I thought it was going to be all marching when I signed up for this option,\" says Richard Mather, a year 10 student at Wayland, \"but I didn't mind as I don't like foreign languages.\" Marching isn't on the menu, and PT is the closest anyone gets to basic training. \"It can't be a military operation,\" jokes Capt Jarvis, \" as the transport doesn't turn up two hours late.\" What is on offer are basic key skills incorporated into the bronze and silver Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Networks (Asdan) syllabuses, together with the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh's award, the St John's lifesaver awards and some outdoor environmental experience. Were Alastair Campbell to set foot in Wayland Community High School, he would no doubt immediately declare it a \"bog standard comprehensive\". It has the usual range of abilities and social groupings; its GCSE attainment levels are slightly above the national average but, like most schools, it has its fair share of problems - including disaffected and disruptive pupils. For the school, the relaxation at KS4 that allows the national curriculum to be disapplied under certain circumstances has been something of a godsend, and when it was approached to join in the army's pilot scheme it responded enthusiastically. At all three schools in the Norfolk project, the pupils were given the final say on their participation, but in all cases it seems that a fair degree of social engineering was involved in deciding who should be offered the option in the first place. Methwold took the route of asking for volunteers from those who were lacking in self-confidence and were unlikely to cope with the GCSE syllabus, Hamond's opted for a mix of the non-academic and those with behavioural difficulties, while according to Brett Jarvis, Wayland went the whole hog and put forward 22 of their most disruptive kids. Chris Dix, Wayland's headteacher, is slightly defensive at this suggestion. \"We followed the guidelines that were put forward by the army,\" he says. \"We chose from across a range of academic abilities those who were disaffected or in danger of becoming so. I would accept, though, that some of the students are quite challenging.\" Dix need not have been so protective of his students' sensibilities; they wouldn't see their behaviour as challenging so much as the stuff of nightmares. \"I'd been suspended twice for swearing at teachers and messing around in class and was regularly picking up four detentions a week,\" admits Mather. \"My parents were starting to have a real struggle getting me to go to school in the morning.\" Mather's was a familiar story. \"I'd been suspended at least twice for swearing and talking back to teachers,\" says Barry Ford. And so on. Martin Gisborne had been in constant trouble for fighting and backchatting. \"The school split me up from the group I used to hang around with and put me in isolation,\" he says. \"It just frustrated me even more so I started messing around even worse.\" The point is, though, that after six months on the course they all claim - and the school agrees - that their behaviour has improved beyond all recognition. \"I've only had one detention and I haven't felt like bunking off,\" says Mather. \"I thought it was about time I sorted myself out,\" says Gisborne. There has also been a further knock-on benefit of improvements in their GCSE curricular work. So what is the secret? Brett Jarvis acknowledges that it was an uphill struggle for the first few months as the kids pushed the limits to see what they could get away with, but believes that it was their interest in what they were doing and the strength of the relationships that he and the two sergeants, Tony Shuttleworth and Bertie Burtenshaw, were able to forge that proved the clinching factor. \"I think they liked the fact that we didn't come across in the same way as the teachers they have known,\" says Jarvis. \"The two sergeants have proved to be extremely effective role models. Neither were particularly academic at school, but by applying the very principles we are teaching here, have gone on to be successful.\" The kids see it slightly differently. They enjoy the work - \"less boring, more useful\" - and the sanction of being slung off the course is a great deal more effective than being banned from maths, but what they really seem to appreciate is being treated as adults. \"If you get wound up and think you're going to lose your temper they let you take five minutes out,\" says Matthew Balls. \"A teacher would think you were trying to skive off if you asked for time out.\" \"They don't say 'Do this' or 'Do that',\" says Mather. \"They tell you what's expected and let you get on with it. If you need help they'll give it but they let you complete the work to your standard, not some curriculum standard. So you feel like putting more effort in.\" Skill Force is no panacea. Some of those on the course have a reading age of seven, many are statemented and some are on medication for behavioural problems, and the course does not replace all the usual pastoral measures to cope with disruption. What it does do at the very least is contain the problem. The pressure on teachers' time is horrendous at the best of times and disruptive kids take up more time than most. With the disaffected channelled into something that interests them, teachers are free to give their time to the 28 kids who want to learn rather than the two who don't. There is a danger that such schemes will introduce a two-tier system at KS4 and Mather acknowledges that his father had reservations about him dropping Double Science. But Dix thinks such worries are an irrelevance. \"The students will still be doing GCSEs,\" he says, \"but in any case there always was a two-tier system. Kids are very quick to identify their levels of ability, and many of the less able quickly recognised that they weren't going to be able to cope with the curricular work early in year 10 and identified themselves as failures. With Skillforce we are providing a course at which they can succeed and thereby raise their self-esteem.\" Endorsements for the scheme have come from all quarters. Allan Rimmer, the administrator for the Association of Workers for Children with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties, is pleased that the course recognises the importance of continuing to teach key skills, such as numeracy and literacy. \"Disruptive children need the curriculum, too, and we welcome anything that finds an effective way of teaching it,\" he says. Jenny Mosley, one of those at the forefront of introducing Circle Time into school, is also in favour. \"You can't underestimate the importance of team-building and leadership in helping those with emotional difficulties,\" she says. \"What I would want to make sure is that there was time included in the course for reflection. Experiences are often very immediate, and you only get to understand the processes involved by thinking about them at a later date. That is very often where the learning takes place.\" The one dark cloud on the horizon is money. Despite the new funding, no one seems to have worked out that if you want to continue the scheme it will involve running two parallel groups. Wayland plans to continue the current course when the year 10s move into year 11, but has a queue of year 9 punters eager to sign up for the autumn. \"The army is trying to accommodate us by offering us more time,\" says Dix, \"but even so it would involve an overall reduction in the time each year group would get. We think this sends out all the wrong messages to the students.\" Joined-up government only goes so far, it seems.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC is set to secure the TV rights to England's autumn home rugby union internationals from BSkyB. ITV has decided against bidding and it is thought the Rugby Football Union is close to sealing a deal with the corporation. If the deal goes through it will provide a much-needed morale boost to the BBC sports department, which has been battered by a series of devastating losses over the past five years. Negotiations are still continuing with the Rugby Football Union for a range of TV rights to England rugby union internationals and club fixtures. These will be part of a three-year package estimated to be worth around \u00a3150m in total. But BBC Sport insiders are privately confident they will win back rights to the three Twickenham internationals. The matches are held before Christmas each year against southern hemisphere opposition such as New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. BSkyB snatched the rights to all England's home international fixtures, including the autumn matches and post-Christmas Five - now Six - Nations games and domestic club rugby in an \u00a387.5m deal three years ago. The satellite broadcaster's international contract runs for another season but the club rights are up for grabs from the end of this season. The RFU came in for much criticism within the sport for entering into the exclusive deal with BSkyB. Dissenting voices argued that by signing up for satellite TV, which draws lower audiences than terrestrial coverage, rugby union's profile was diminished along with the revenue earning potential from sponsorship. Now it is thought the RFU is looking favourably on the BBC's bid to win back exclusive live rights to the England internationals. The BBC's confidence will also have been boosted by the knowledge that ITV, its main terrestrial rival, is not bidding. ITV did not submit a bid before the RFU's January 31 deadline, arguing the autumn internationals were not worth having without live Six Nations coverage. The commercial broadcaster is understood to have reassessed its commitment to rugby union. It is also not expected to bid for the Six Nations or the 2003 World Cup when the rights come up. ITV will concentrate instead on its existing portfolio of live Champions League football, Premier League highlights and live Formula One motor racing.

Every single person in the house had voted for Eubank's eviction. Never again would he upstage the lot of them by whizzing across the room on a scooter in his kaftan. He left with his customary swagger, swinging his whangee cane. If it wasn't a whangee cane, you feel it should have been. </p> <p>Well, you never miss your mother till she's buried 'neath the clay. As he left, Jack Dee said \"He's the most entertaining man I've ever met.\" And that night he left too. </p> <p><strong> 2.59am:</strong> Vanessa was in bed, free in sleep from the daily worry about her hair extensions turning up in the soup. Anthea, Claire and Keith, what John Cleese calls celebrity pond life, were gambolling in the celebrity pond, a hot tub in the garden. Only Dee was hacking away at the earth with a light rake, perhaps with vague memories of POWs concealing soil in their trousers. You would think that Big Brother, whose sole claim to fame is that he watches you, might have smelled a rat. Very few people garden in the dark, except Lady Dorothy Macmillan, who used to beaver away wearing a miner's helmet. The rest are burying relatives. </p> <p><strong> 3.11am:</strong> Dee found a back gate open and went. \"Security is immediately alerted.\" Shot of bloke in fluorescent jacket running about a bit. </p> <p><strong> 3.31am:</strong> \"Security still haven't found Jack.\" Shot of guard dog looking confused. </p> <p><strong> 3.43am:</strong> \"Jack is discovered crouching behind a security hut in the Big Brother compound and is immediately returned to the house.\" Shot of Jack escorted by two guards like Eugene Aram. (That is one of the things I will miss about Chris Eubank, his habit of laying decomposing old poems and rotten bits of philosophy confidently at your feet like a cat.) </p> <p>The hot tubbers greeted Dee like a litter of puppies. His face was blackened with mud. He was not in merry mood but, then, how can you tell with Dee. He had, he gruffed, got to Stratford. \"But I've come back. It's for Comic Relief. I just wanted to get out.\" And he shot a look of loathing at the camera. </p> <p>Bow to Stratford is a grim yomp. On one side lie Hackney marshes, famous for being visible wiv a ladder and some glasses if it wasn't fer the 'ouses in between. On the other, the Thames. Put it this way, a man with a blackened face in a black sweater can walk from Bow to Stratford in the small hours without anyone expressing interest or surprise. </p> <p>Celebrity Big Brother's psychologist (of course it has a psychologist) identified Dee at once as the alpha male, apparently on his ability to open a bottle of champagne, but the show's bookmaker, assessing the odds, noted \"Jack Dee can't contain his indifference.\" In other words, he could win but he can't be bothered. In any prisoner of war film, Jack would be the one who got shot for saluting sarcastically. If he is voted out on a Free Willy wave of pity, we will be left with minnows. </p> <p>In the gold rush to find a mother lode as rich as Inspector Morse, BBC1 has come up with <strong> The Inspector Lynley Mysteries</strong> . </p> <p>Elizabeth George, who wrote them, is clearly familiar with Dorothy Sayers. Her detective is the eighth Earl of Asherton. This is flung in his face so often you are reminded of Alec Douglas Home's only known witticism that, if he was the 14th Earl, then Harold Wilson was the 14th Mr Wilson. </p> <p>In the book Lynley is described as having \"A Grecian face that bore the unmistakable stamp of aristocracy.\" You have to clutch at a passing peer not to fall about. Lacking anyone of this superior stamp, we settle for the darkly presentable Nathaniel Parker, son of the former chairman of British Rail.

      "bodyText": "Palestinians advanced behind a bulldozer yesterday in an attempt to cross the trenches dug on Ariel Sharon's orders around their premier academic institution, the Bir Zeit University outside Ramallah. One man was killed and 40 injured when the Israeli forces fired teargas and sporadic live rounds as they marched on the two deep trenches sealing off Ramallah from the university and villages where 65,000 people live. The protesters flung handfuls of earth into the trenches in a vain attempt to lift the siege of the West Bank city, imposed as one of Mr Sharon's first acts as prime minister. Dozens of stranded villagers and students tried to make their way home along the roadside. They included Hiam Ferris, who was released from hospital yesterday morning with her day-old daughter Nadine bundled in a blanket. \"God only knows how I am going to get home,\" she said, after a taxi dropped her at the edge of the trench and left her to walk to her village, Deyr Jareer, on the far side. The army strengthened the siege by heaping earth on the last of the unpaved roads still accessible to motorists. The Ramallah siege is the first concrete manifestation of Mr Sharon's strategy for dealing with the Palestinian uprising, which began five months ago. It prompted Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo yesterday to urge the UN security council to call an emergency session to discuss Israel's \"escalating aggression\" against the Palestinians. They also asked the council to approve the immediate deployment of an international force to provide protection for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza. Although the US is likely to block a security council condemnation of Israel, the Arab leaders wanted to send a clear message to Mr Sharon that they would stand firm against him using further on the Palestinians and turning the West Bank and Gaza into apartheid-like cantons. According to Israeli newspapers, the government is about to unveil a \"divide and conquer\" plan in which the army will carve the West Bank into 60 isolated cantons, cut off from the outside world by ditches and barricades. Palestinians say the strategy is turning the West Bank into a prison and their cities into isolated cell blocks. \"They have transformed the country into a cluster of prisons,\" said Mustafa Barghouti, director of the Palestinian medical relief committee. Under the Oslo peace agreements, Israel controls all the roads to the West Bank cities, enabling it to impose the blockade which has crippled the Palestinian economy. It has reinforced the Palestinians' sense that, six years after they achieved limited self-rule, they remain under military occupation. Yesterday's demonstration was the first mass civilian protest for weeks. \"Even people like me who are not involved politically are going to be involved soon,\" said a doctor in Bethlehem. \"You are checked every 100 metres, and humiliated at every checkpoint. It is an insult to any human being.\"",

On the first day of a four-day summit in the Kremlin, President Putin and President Mohammed Khatamialso announced a decision to expand cooperation on nuclear energy. Russia will help Iran to complete the Bushehr reactor, a project which Washington fears could help Iran develop nuclear weapons. The visit represents a clear strengthening of Russo-Iranian relations as Mr Putin pursues an assertive new foreign policy, restoring ties with allies of the former USSR's and states regarded with suspicion by Washington. In November Russia warned the US that it was withdrawing from a secret 1995 pact designed to phase out the sale of weapons to Iran, which Washington classifies as a rogue state. Mr Putin argued yesterday that Iran had the right to defend itself and that Russia needed the business. Moscow hopes to revive its huge and under-used arms industry by selling more abroad. The Iranian ambassador to Moscow said recently that Tehran could spend up to $7bn on Russian weapons over the next few years. It was not said what kind of arms Russia will supply, nor the cost, but officials have indicated that Iran is interested in buying S-300 air defence missiles, fighter jets, helicopters and patrol boats. Mr Putin stressed that Russia would not sell weapons banned by international laws designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear and missile technology. Officials have dismissed America's fear that the technology being shared to complete the Bushehr reactor could be used to develop nuclear weapons, saying that it can only be used for civilian purposes. The US has repeatedly demanded that Russia cancel its $800m contract to build the plant. With an implicit nod to US disapproval, Mr Khatami said that both Russia and Iran had the right to \"decide what is in our benefit and what is not\". The two countries signed an agreement opposing the construction of pipelines under the Caspian Sea, an indirect reference to US attempts to persuade Kazakhstan to ship oil across the sea and through Turkey, bypassing Russia and Iran. But they failed to resolve a long-standing dispute over who has the right to exploit the oil resources under the seabed.",

After days of wrangling with the UN about his visit, the government surprised Mr Annan on Sunday night by saying it could not guarantee his safety if he went to the Jalozai camp, 18 miles south of Peshawar in North-West Frontier province, where Afghans have sought refuge from fighting and drought. UN officials suspect the government was afraid that the many journalists accompanying Mr Annan would focus on its harsh treatment of the refugees. Mr Annan, speaking yesterday at Shamshatoo, another camp 30-minutes' drive away, expressed disappointment that he had not made the visit. He told the refugees: \"I had wished to go to Jalozai, but for operational and other reasons I was not able to go there.\" After providing a haven for more than 2m Afghan refugees, the Pakistani government decided in November that it had had enough and closed its borders, in contravention of international legal obligations towards refugees. Tens of thousands have been camped in the open since January and the government has refused to let the UN High Commissioner for Refugees provide basic amenities for the new arrivals. The UNHCR said that more than 80,000 were squatting in squalid conditions on a strip of land at Jalozai, and more were arriving each day. The camp is known to aid workers as \"Plastic City\", because of the cheap plastic bags being used as tents. Faced with its overflowing latrines and limited drinking water, the refugees, particularly the children, are dying almost daily, and conditions are deteriorating. Yusuf Hassan, a UNHCR officer accompanying Mr Annan, said: \"Children are dying of preventable diseases but mainly from the cold. \"It is a dreadful place. They fled Afghanistan hoping they would get help.\" He shuddered to think what would happen in the coming months. Part of the underlying problem is that sympathy for the Afghans has waned in the international community; the Taliban regime's destruction of the giant Buddha statues at Bamiyan has only accentuated this.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Doing away with the double jeopardy rule and allowing defendants previously acquitted to be tried again, if compelling new evidence comes to light, is right and sensible. But I can't understand why the Law Commission proposes to limit it to murder. Its report emphasises the uniqueness and seriousness of the crime, but I don't see the point of that argument. In particular, I don't understand why rape is excluded. If we're talking about virtually irrefutable evidence that X committed the crime, DNA provides it. The identity of rapists is often proved by such evidence. Yet, according to the commission's proposal, if an acquitted rapist is later shown by undisputed DNA evidence - or by his own confession - to have done it, nothing can be done. Rapists are wrongly acquitted far more often than murderers are; why should we let them get away with crimes that we can prove they committed?</p> <p>\u0095 I hear that Anna Ford has decided to start judicial review proceedings against the press complaints commission to test our new privacy laws. Geoffrey Robertson QC will be acting for her. The PCC recently ruled that the Daily Mail had not infringed Ford's right to privacy by publishing secretly taken snaps of her and her partner, astronaut David Scott, on holiday in Majorca. There are legal hurdles to overcome - including whether or not the PCC is a \"public authority\" subject to judicial review - but if she wins, the case will have a huge effect on the privacy rights of celebrities.</p> <p>\u0095 The Office of Fair Trading's report on competition in the legal profession is not an impressive document, even if it reached some correct conclusions. The bar, predictably, moaned and complained extravagantly. I'm no apologist for lawyers, as you know, but on this one I think the bar has some justification. Its main defence to demands for the dismantling of some of its traditional restrictive practices is that they operate in the public interest. That is a totally legitimate point to raise and - without going into specific arguments - the bar has some reasonable arguments to put.</p> <p>But neither the OFT report nor the consultants' survey on which the OFT based its conclusions had looked at the public-interest aspect. It wasn't part of the remit. To me, it seems absurd to reach a conclusion that this or that practice is uncompetitive and to stop there, without going on to assess the public interest argument. I know it is not in the OFT's terms of reference, but the omission seems to me to make the process unfair.</p> <p>I'm not defending the QC system, nor many of the other traditions and practices criticised by the OFT; I'm merely saying that even barristers deserve a bit of justice.</p> <p>\u0095 My innocent little item last week about the derivation of the late George Carman's nickname has become the subject of fierce controversy. I suggested that he was called Gorgeous George after the American wrestler of that name. Not so, according to an avalanche of letters, emails and phone calls, unanimous in claiming that the source was more likely to be the elegant French boxer of the first world war period, Georges Carpentier, whose memorable fight in 1921 against Jack Dempsey for the world heavyweight championship produced the first million-dollar gate. I watched a film of it recently. Carpentier, really a light-heavyweight, giving away 25lb, nearly knocked out the champion in the second round, probably broke his hand in the attempt and was then knocked out in the fourth.</p> <p>Yes, he was sometimes called Gorgeous Georges (with that final \"s\", which, of course, Carman didn't have) though he was more often described as the Orchid Kid (or Orchid Man) from his habit of wearing the flower in his buttonhole. But, quite apart from the evidence of the extra \"s\", who, a decade ago, could possibly have remembered Carpentier and decided to saddle Carman with the same label? Apart, of course, from me and my angry correspondents.</p> <p>\u0095 An apology. This column will be hit hard, as will your pockets, by the absence of next week's horse-racing festival at Cheltenham. This is traditionally the race meeting at which horses with legal tinges to their names perform with vigour and stamina. My job over the years has been to bring those contestants to your attention; yours to rush to your nearest turf financial broker and place a judicious investment.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Doing away with the double jeopardy rule and allowing defendants previously acquitted to be tried again, if compelling new evidence comes to light, is right and sensible. But I can't understand why the Law Commission proposes to limit it to murder. Its report emphasises the uniqueness and seriousness of the crime, but I don't see the point of that argument. In particular, I don't understand why rape is excluded. If we're talking about virtually irrefutable evidence that X committed the crime, DNA provides it. The identity of rapists is often proved by such evidence. Yet, according to the commission's proposal, if an acquitted rapist is later shown by undisputed DNA evidence - or by his own confession - to have done it, nothing can be done. Rapists are wrongly acquitted far more often than murderers are; why should we let them get away with crimes that we can prove they committed? \u0095 I hear that Anna Ford has decided to start judicial review proceedings against the press complaints commission to test our new privacy laws. Geoffrey Robertson QC will be acting for her. The PCC recently ruled that the Daily Mail had not infringed Ford's right to privacy by publishing secretly taken snaps of her and her partner, astronaut David Scott, on holiday in Majorca. There are legal hurdles to overcome - including whether or not the PCC is a \"public authority\" subject to judicial review - but if she wins, the case will have a huge effect on the privacy rights of celebrities. \u0095 The Office of Fair Trading's report on competition in the legal profession is not an impressive document, even if it reached some correct conclusions. The bar, predictably, moaned and complained extravagantly. I'm no apologist for lawyers, as you know, but on this one I think the bar has some justification. Its main defence to demands for the dismantling of some of its traditional restrictive practices is that they operate in the public interest. That is a totally legitimate point to raise and - without going into specific arguments - the bar has some reasonable arguments to put. But neither the OFT report nor the consultants' survey on which the OFT based its conclusions had looked at the public-interest aspect. It wasn't part of the remit. To me, it seems absurd to reach a conclusion that this or that practice is uncompetitive and to stop there, without going on to assess the public interest argument. I know it is not in the OFT's terms of reference, but the omission seems to me to make the process unfair. I'm not defending the QC system, nor many of the other traditions and practices criticised by the OFT; I'm merely saying that even barristers deserve a bit of justice. \u0095 My innocent little item last week about the derivation of the late George Carman's nickname has become the subject of fierce controversy. I suggested that he was called Gorgeous George after the American wrestler of that name. Not so, according to an avalanche of letters, emails and phone calls, unanimous in claiming that the source was more likely to be the elegant French boxer of the first world war period, Georges Carpentier, whose memorable fight in 1921 against Jack Dempsey for the world heavyweight championship produced the first million-dollar gate. I watched a film of it recently. Carpentier, really a light-heavyweight, giving away 25lb, nearly knocked out the champion in the second round, probably broke his hand in the attempt and was then knocked out in the fourth. Yes, he was sometimes called Gorgeous Georges (with that final \"s\", which, of course, Carman didn't have) though he was more often described as the Orchid Kid (or Orchid Man) from his habit of wearing the flower in his buttonhole. But, quite apart from the evidence of the extra \"s\", who, a decade ago, could possibly have remembered Carpentier and decided to saddle Carman with the same label? Apart, of course, from me and my angry correspondents. \u0095 An apology. This column will be hit hard, as will your pockets, by the absence of next week's horse-racing festival at Cheltenham. This is traditionally the race meeting at which horses with legal tinges to their names perform with vigour and stamina. My job over the years has been to bring those contestants to your attention; yours to rush to your nearest turf financial broker and place a judicious investment. It has worked spectacularly in the past; many fortunes have been created. Alas, not this year.",

      "body": "<p>By age 10 their skills are already evident. Their mothers are shrieking on the sidelines. Talent scouts are offering advice. By age 15 they are in a football college. Sensing they are destined for glory, they go to bed early, dreaming of the turf at the San Siro, at the Olimpico. On the telephone Mamma and Pappa urge them on. Their few old friends urge them on. They don't drink and they don't smoke. Their diet is controlled. The training is exhausting. No sacrifice is too great.</p> <p>By 17 or 18 they are playing in Serie C, or sitting on the bench in Serie B. Solemn men in heavy coats gamble on their future. They are bought and sold. A billion lire this year, five the next. They are shunted up and down the length of the bel paese : Treviso, Taranto, Palermo, Turin. They know no one outside the world of football now. They hardly know what to say to a person who is not a player or a manager or a journalist. Or at least a fan.</p> <p>They haven't studied. When they do their military service, it is in a special barracks for sportsmen. They train all day and return to their teams before the weekend. They haven't had time for a social life. Always supervised, they haven't had time to develop a character. They are fined if they are late for training. They are fined if their telefonino rings when the mister (coach) is speaking. Yearning to be picked for the game, what can they do but agree with everything the mister says? What can they do but carry out his every wish? Picked, they are proud and relieved; left out, they suffer all kinds of anguish.</p> <p>Dreading injury, they become hypersensitive and hypochondriac. What is this twitch in my calf? The team doctor examines them, the team masseur revives them. Yearning to be adored, they are afraid people want their company only because they are famous. They watch pornography in anonymous hotels. When they win, they are worshipped. Standing, arms raised, beneath the curva , they are drenched in glory, their faces resplendent. When they lose, they are spat on. The whistles are deafening. They make for the tunnel with their head down. Lonely, they marry young. An old girlfriend, perhaps; or perhaps a young model, as lost and vain as themselves.</p> <p>Waking with a headache in the middle of the night, they have to call the team doctor before they can take anything. There are dope tests. They cannot put drops in a stuffy nose. They cannot inhale Vicks. With amazement, they read about players in other countries who drink and smoke and smash up restaurants and aeroplanes. How can they do this? What would the Gazzetta dello Sport say? Italy is a Catholic country. This kind of behaviour isn't countenanced. They read that English players check the horse-racing results at half time, that they are more interested in betting than football. They do not believe it. It cannot be so.</p> <p>Like Spartan soldiers, they are truly themselves only on the field of battle. Only when they run out through the players' tunnel into the big green stadium can they unleash all their pent-up emotion. Only before a huge crowd can they at last behave appallingly. They clutch their opponent's shirt. They crash into his legs before he reaches a scoring position. The crowd applaud: pull him down! Barely touched, they themselves collapse and writhe in agony. They deny the most evident truths, pretending they didn't touch a ball when everybody has seen that they did, claiming a ball didn't go out when everybody has seen that it has.</p> <p>They are simultaneously infantile and mature, petulant and courageous. When they score, they lose all sense of control. They tear off their shirts, they go wild. When their opponents score, they collapse on the ground in dismay. They protest vigorously. They kick the goalposts. Interviewed after the game, they are cautious and conformist: we did our best, our compliments to the other side, we must work hard to improve, we must be humble. Next day they buy all the papers. Each sports reporter gives each player a score from one to 10. How am I doing? Will I still be in Serie A next year? Will I be playing, will I be on the bench? Immensely privileged, they are hope lessly deprived, for they have no ordinary life. Above all, they are paid huge salaries.</p> <p>That, more or less, was what I thought of the Italian footballer, until I travelled with the squad of Hellas Verona for their away game at Lecce on the southernmost shores of the Adriatic. Was I right? Yes and no. What I hadn't foreseen was how pleasant, how sensible, how absolutely tame the players might be, despite the feverish world they lived in. All dressed alike in the club tracksuit, they did crossword puzzles on the plane, fidgeted with their telefonini in the foyer of the hotel, explained to me with charming sincerity that modern football is now so fast and physical you are constantly in danger of being overwhelmed. Buried in a Ken Follett novel, coach Attilio Perotti wasn't eager to talk. \"We can't afford to lose this game,\" he conceded. \"We can't afford to lose.\"</p> <p>The squad were two days in Lecce. I think I and the acting managing director were the only ones to walk out of the hotel and take a look at the marvellous pale yellow baroque of the old city centre. The players trained and were in bed by 9.30pm.</p> <p>In the stadium on the Sunday, Verona scored first using a free-kick routine I had watched them practise the day before without success. I was sitting high in the stands with the Verona staff, who leapt to their feet but couldn't exult because we were surrounded by furious Lecce fans. These excellent southern folk did not return the courtesy when Verona were torn apart in the second half. Destroyed. Pathetic. As we conceded the fourth goal, Verona club owner Giambattista Pastorello, immaculate in pale suit and bright tie, jumped up and fled. Abandoning the team and his plane ticket, he drove the 1,000km back to Verona, arriving in the dead of night with, as he later told me, a high fever and a stabbing pain in his leg.</p> <p>All the other bottom clubs had won. Verona are deep in the relegation zone. The players were close to tears as they came out of the dressing room. They stood in corners, whispering into their mobiles: \"No, Mamma. Miserable.\" In the airport, they had to suffer the smug commiserations of the general public. \"Don't worry, ha ha, we were just better than you on the day!\" The Hellas boys were admirably polite in their gloom.</p> <p>Changing flights in Rome, we ran into other players from other teams also changing flights. It seems this is a weekly ritual. Half the Italian football world changes flights at Fiumicino on a Sunday evening. There were salutes and embraces. Old friends said never mind. Things began to cheer up. At last, towards midnight, we were back in Verona and the boys could disappear into the fog-bound city, where mothers and girlfriends were no doubt waiting up for them.</p> <p>In the end, I reflected, peering through a frozen windscreen, these young men had earned, on average, a few thousand pounds each for two days in a nice hotel and a game of football.

      "bodyText": "By age 10 their skills are already evident. Their mothers are shrieking on the sidelines. Talent scouts are offering advice. By age 15 they are in a football college. Sensing they are destined for glory, they go to bed early, dreaming of the turf at the San Siro, at the Olimpico. On the telephone Mamma and Pappa urge them on. Their few old friends urge them on. They don't drink and they don't smoke. Their diet is controlled. The training is exhausting. No sacrifice is too great. By 17 or 18 they are playing in Serie C, or sitting on the bench in Serie B. Solemn men in heavy coats gamble on their future. They are bought and sold. A billion lire this year, five the next. They are shunted up and down the length of the bel paese : Treviso, Taranto, Palermo, Turin. They know no one outside the world of football now. They hardly know what to say to a person who is not a player or a manager or a journalist. Or at least a fan. They haven't studied. When they do their military service, it is in a special barracks for sportsmen. They train all day and return to their teams before the weekend. They haven't had time for a social life. Always supervised, they haven't had time to develop a character. They are fined if they are late for training. They are fined if their telefonino rings when the mister (coach) is speaking. Yearning to be picked for the game, what can they do but agree with everything the mister says? What can they do but carry out his every wish? Picked, they are proud and relieved; left out, they suffer all kinds of anguish. Dreading injury, they become hypersensitive and hypochondriac. What is this twitch in my calf? The team doctor examines them, the team masseur revives them. Yearning to be adored, they are afraid people want their company only because they are famous. They watch pornography in anonymous hotels. When they win, they are worshipped. Standing, arms raised, beneath the curva , they are drenched in glory, their faces resplendent. When they lose, they are spat on. The whistles are deafening. They make for the tunnel with their head down. Lonely, they marry young. An old girlfriend, perhaps; or perhaps a young model, as lost and vain as themselves. Waking with a headache in the middle of the night, they have to call the team doctor before they can take anything. There are dope tests. They cannot put drops in a stuffy nose. They cannot inhale Vicks. With amazement, they read about players in other countries who drink and smoke and smash up restaurants and aeroplanes. How can they do this? What would the Gazzetta dello Sport say? Italy is a Catholic country. This kind of behaviour isn't countenanced. They read that English players check the horse-racing results at half time, that they are more interested in betting than football. They do not believe it. It cannot be so. Like Spartan soldiers, they are truly themselves only on the field of battle. Only when they run out through the players' tunnel into the big green stadium can they unleash all their pent-up emotion. Only before a huge crowd can they at last behave appallingly. They clutch their opponent's shirt. They crash into his legs before he reaches a scoring position. The crowd applaud: pull him down! Barely touched, they themselves collapse and writhe in agony. They deny the most evident truths, pretending they didn't touch a ball when everybody has seen that they did, claiming a ball didn't go out when everybody has seen that it has. They are simultaneously infantile and mature, petulant and courageous. When they score, they lose all sense of control. They tear off their shirts, they go wild. When their opponents score, they collapse on the ground in dismay. They protest vigorously. They kick the goalposts. Interviewed after the game, they are cautious and conformist: we did our best, our compliments to the other side, we must work hard to improve, we must be humble. Next day they buy all the papers. Each sports reporter gives each player a score from one to 10. How am I doing? Will I still be in Serie A next year? Will I be playing, will I be on the bench? Immensely privileged, they are hope lessly deprived, for they have no ordinary life. Above all, they are paid huge salaries. That, more or less, was what I thought of the Italian footballer, until I travelled with the squad of Hellas Verona for their away game at Lecce on the southernmost shores of the Adriatic. Was I right? Yes and no. What I hadn't foreseen was how pleasant, how sensible, how absolutely tame the players might be, despite the feverish world they lived in. All dressed alike in the club tracksuit, they did crossword puzzles on the plane, fidgeted with their telefonini in the foyer of the hotel, explained to me with charming sincerity that modern football is now so fast and physical you are constantly in danger of being overwhelmed. Buried in a Ken Follett novel, coach Attilio Perotti wasn't eager to talk. \"We can't afford to lose this game,\" he conceded. \"We can't afford to lose.\" The squad were two days in Lecce. I think I and the acting managing director were the only ones to walk out of the hotel and take a look at the marvellous pale yellow baroque of the old city centre. The players trained and were in bed by 9.30pm. In the stadium on the Sunday, Verona scored first using a free-kick routine I had watched them practise the day before without success. I was sitting high in the stands with the Verona staff, who leapt to their feet but couldn't exult because we were surrounded by furious Lecce fans. These excellent southern folk did not return the courtesy when Verona were torn apart in the second half. Destroyed. Pathetic. As we conceded the fourth goal, Verona club owner Giambattista Pastorello, immaculate in pale suit and bright tie, jumped up and fled. Abandoning the team and his plane ticket, he drove the 1,000km back to Verona, arriving in the dead of night with, as he later told me, a high fever and a stabbing pain in his leg. All the other bottom clubs had won. Verona are deep in the relegation zone. The players were close to tears as they came out of the dressing room. They stood in corners, whispering into their mobiles: \"No, Mamma. Miserable.\" In the airport, they had to suffer the smug commiserations of the general public. \"Don't worry, ha ha, we were just better than you on the day!\" The Hellas boys were admirably polite in their gloom. Changing flights in Rome, we ran into other players from other teams also changing flights. It seems this is a weekly ritual. Half the Italian football world changes flights at Fiumicino on a Sunday evening. There were salutes and embraces. Old friends said never mind. Things began to cheer up. At last, towards midnight, we were back in Verona and the boys could disappear into the fog-bound city, where mothers and girlfriends were no doubt waiting up for them. In the end, I reflected, peering through a frozen windscreen, these young men had earned, on average, a few thousand pounds each for two days in a nice hotel and a game of football. I myself had travelled entirely free thanks to the inexplicable generosity of Hellas Verona football club, whom I now take this opportunity to thank. But in the middle of the night I woke up and almost screamed: \"I would have paid all my expenses twice over to see some decent football and WIN!\" \u0095 Tim Parks is writing a book about following Hellas Verona.

Six months ago he was striking the ground with his hoe when he hit a BLU-26 anti-personnel cluster bomb. It exploded on impact, leaving Teng blinded in both eyes and with most of his left hand blown away. Still in trauma, the boy talks of his long, empty days filled with regret.</p> <p>The BLU-26, the most commonly found cluster bomb in Laos, is a tennis ball-shaped bomblet designed for maximum damage. Children who have seen these relics made into lamps, table legs or even cowbells find them irresistible to play with, and often die or are maimed as a result.</p> <p>\"Landmines just upset me,\" says Wilson, who is travelling in Laos with the charity Landmine Action. \"The idea that they're aimed at an innocent population to maim and drain the economy is a putrid idea. How can people go to bed at night knowing they've produced them, or bought shares in armament companies?\"</p> <p>His purpose here is to focus attention on the cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance. Between 9m and 27m unexploded cluster bomblets are \"seeded\" throughout the country, a pernicious reminder of America's mass bombing of Laos during the Vietnam war - an assault kept secret from the rest of the world. A quarter of a century later, people's lives are still being ripped apart by it. Innocent pastimes, such as hoeing a field, throwing stones into a river or lighting a fire, can have fatal consequences. Since 1973, 12,000 Laotians have been killed or maimed. \"The problem,\" says Wilson, \"is that no one will take responsibility. The Americans spent over $2m a day on the bombing of Laos, now they're only spending $2m a year to help clear it up.\"</p> <p>Even in the furthest outreach of the backpackers' trail in Phonsavan, the dusty capital of Xieng Khouang (the most bomb- saturated province of Laos), Wilson can't get away from the business of celebrity. In the bustling Sangah restaurant - frequented by expats, travellers and roving Chinese road builders - an English student approaches, sheepishly: \"Am I right in thinking . . . ?\" \"Yes, you are indeed right,\" Wilson replies, slowly and deliberately. Later the man returns with 13,000 kip (\u00a31.30) from his depleted budget: a donation to Landmine Action.</p> <p>Overseas charity trips seriously test tempers. There are endless briefings, long journeys on punishingly uneven roads, few or no creature comforts and ever changing itineraries. I had assumed that by travelling for eight days with Wilson, I would come away with some compelling insights into the 65-year-old actor. However, Wilson is so contained, restrained and mindful of the slightest indiscretion (always followed by a quick \"off the record\") that my most staggering revelation involves his partiality to cold baked beans, which he keeps in his fridge ready to liven up a salad.</p> <p>He is prepared to answer questions on any of the following subjects: politics (he is a strong Labour supporter); theatre (he is an associate director of the Royal Court, for whom he directs one play a year); youth (he was rector of Glasgow University in the late 90s and an ambassador for VSO); the royal family (he is not a fan); the supernatural (he dismisses the notions of ghosts, horoscopes and UFOs), religion (he can't believe how intelligent people join the clergy). But he never asks questions back, and has a knack of moving the focus of the conversation to the middle distance.</p> <p>Baked beans aside, Wilson doesn't see any inconsistency between his socialism and his predilection for the high life. He likes to travel first class, hires limousines for the day and has a masseuse come to his house once a week. \"I'm not particularly proud that I enjoy these things, but why not?\"</p> <p>In Laos, the curmudgeonly Victor Meldrew only occasionally puts in an appearance, and always with irony - for instance when he hands out a packet of mints to the dry-mouthed assembled group and everyone takes one. \"Well, that was a mistake,\" he says, cocking an eyebrow at his suddenly three-quarters-empty packet.</p> <p>He is game for almost anything. When it turns out that we have to fly on a dodgy Chinese plane which lurches from Phonsavan to Vientiane instead of the spanking new French model, he shrugs. \"I'm not usually scared of flying, but I was then,\" he later admits.

Steve McQueen suffers beatings, starvation, solitary and scurvy, and keeps coming back for more. It's lushly photographed by Fred Koenekamp, and McQueen finds a touching foil in Dustin Hoffman's doddery Dega: a screen bonding that overcomes Schaffner's inability to decide whether he's directing an outraged indictment or pure adventure. </p> <p><strong> Andrei Rublev </strong> (Andrei Tarkowsky, 1966) 12.30am, FilmFour <br>Rublev (played by Anatoli Solonitsyn) was a minor icon painter of medieval Russia, and Tarkowsky's historical epic traces his life through eight episodes. It's a long, compelling, at times obtuse study of faith and cruelty in barbarous times - Russia was suffering at the hands of the Tartars - that had added depths in the cold war- era Soviet Union. Among many stunning images, the final glorious montage of Rublev's work is extraordinary. </p> <p><strong> Sports</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Champions League football</strong> 7pm, ONsport2 It's the last week of the Champions League and time to decide the quarter-finalists. This means that this week's matches are all either a) completely irrelevant as both teams already know their fates (as in Leeds v Lazio tomorrow), or b) vital. Manchester United know that they could fail to progress if they lose to Sturm Graz tonight, but they could top their group should they win. </p>",

But this is a quieter, slower movie than Polanski's. Papillon (Franklin J Schaffner, 1973) 10pm, FilmFour Superior prison drama based on Henri Charri\u00e8re's allegedly autobiographical book about escaping the savage French regime on Devil's Island. Steve McQueen suffers beatings, starvation, solitary and scurvy, and keeps coming back for more. It's lushly photographed by Fred Koenekamp, and McQueen finds a touching foil in Dustin Hoffman's doddery Dega: a screen bonding that overcomes Schaffner's inability to decide whether he's directing an outraged indictment or pure adventure. Andrei Rublev (Andrei Tarkowsky, 1966) 12.30am, FilmFour Rublev (played by Anatoli Solonitsyn) was a minor icon painter of medieval Russia, and Tarkowsky's historical epic traces his life through eight episodes. It's a long, compelling, at times obtuse study of faith and cruelty in barbarous times - Russia was suffering at the hands of the Tartars - that had added depths in the cold war- era Soviet Union. Among many stunning images, the final glorious montage of Rublev's work is extraordinary. Sports Champions League football 7pm, ONsport2 It's the last week of the Champions League and time to decide the quarter-finalists. This means that this week's matches are all either a) completely irrelevant as both teams already know their fates (as in Leeds v Lazio tomorrow), or b) vital. Manchester United know that they could fail to progress if they lose to Sturm Graz tonight, but they could top their group should they win.",

By now, I had seen enough television pictures of people in the Yakutia and Primorsky regions, to the north and east of Irkutsk, shivering in flats with cold radiators.</p> <p>Admittedly, the insides of my windows were coated with ice-sheets so thick that I could see nothing out of them at all. I recall celebrating my arrival by quietly opening a bottle of something called Russian champagne, which then exploded all over the walls and ceiling, leaving barely a thimbleful in the bottom of the bottle.</p> <p>Out in the streets, though, I found a certain pleasure in the extreme cold. Every passer-by wore a vast hat and went about enveloped in a personal cloud of steam. Exotic tapestries of frost hung from trees, walls and balconies.

In the centre of town, I found an ice-chute: the children (alongside their elegant mothers in long fur coats with waists and pleats and Duchess of Windsor hats) spent their Saturdays hurtling down it on their bums with their feet in the air.</p> <p>A fortnight after my arrival, we were informed on the news about the imminent invasion of more outlandish temperatures. Minus 40 and below loomed. \"Have you heard?\" people kept asking me, in excitement. \"Are you ready for it?\" Now when I went to market I found women with their faces wrapped to the eyeballs, standing behind piles of congealed fish, bent and frozen stiff. Ice-cream was sold in unpackaged, naked blobs. For a few days we went around with hats and collars covered in hoar frost.</p> <p>In these bitterest days, I heard no word in the tram-stations or the bus-stops, just the sound of crunching snow and silence. For a Siberian to admit to feeling cold is as difficult as for an Italian man to admit that he is no good with women. \"What?\" they would shout. \"If you're cold, drink more vodka!\"</p> <p>But we all knew that Irkutsk, unlike Vladivostok, was not suffering from energy shortages. \"If our flats are warm and we can make ourselves cups of tea,\" one woman said, \"what do we have to worry about?\"</p> <p>Some people did worry. In the local theatre, I heard of a troupe having to practise their dance movements in giant felt boots.

But one teacher told me she liked the cold: \"It keeps the delinquents off the streets.\"</p> <p>Otherwise, suffering went on in silence. Walking home through the town centre one night with the temperature at -38, I came across a cluster of old women attempting to sell sunflower seeds from little paper cups. They had built a fire from cardboard boxes, which had attracted a few squabbling down-and-outs. Some of these people could not have had a life expectancy of more than a few hours.</p> <p>But stories of alcoholics found frozen to death on public benches arouse little sympathy in Russia. Daily survival here in wintertime is joyless. If the peace and quiet that I came to find in Siberia was turning out (for a few winos) to be the quiet of the grave, it was hard to find people who cared. I remember wandering home that same evening in my down jacket and ski trousers, admiring the glitter of the snow under brilliant stars.</p> <p>And now? Here we are already well into March. Daytime temperatures sometimes reach zero degrees and the ice on my windows is gone. Outside, long fur coats are being replaced by short ones. The pavement snow is slowly turning grey and reverting to stones and grit, and I'm still sitting here writing my book.

Because of the camera angle, which looks up at her (what was I doing on the floor?), there is nothing to see of her nakedness other than her bare legs. No genitals; no excreta. It's silly and charming and quite disposable, just another family snap.</p> <p>That particular picture has not made it into any of the family albums; it sits in a huge, unsorted stack inside a shoebox-sized tin on a shelf. It's not that either myself or my daughter is sensitive about its content. For a while, the photo used to sit on top of the piano.</p> <p>But there are pictures in the tin I would be less casual about. I wonder how many other parents felt the same lurch in the pit of their stomach when they heard that newsreader Julia Somerville and her partner had been arrested when they went to Boots to collect some snaps that showed their daughter naked in the bath. I had certainly taken pictures of my children's mother, and she had taken pictures of me, with the children in the bath. Those pictures were for us. We didn't order copies for the grandparents - but that was because of our nudity, not the children's. Embarrassing they might be; pornographic they weren't.</p> <p>Every parent must have photographs like that. Bathtime snaps, bedtime snaps, beach snaps. Not fit for a gallery wall on purely aesthetic grounds, these photographs recall private moments: moments of carefree intimacy and fun. In these pictures, we are celebrating the \"golden moments\" that - we would like to believe - comprise by far the largest portion of our family life. Of course, the reality is not all like that; but we need to nurture the fantasy. The idea of childhood innocence - often signified in pictures by children's unselfconscious nakedness - is a convenient myth that we parents need in order to maintain that image of ourselves as members of a contented, loving family, without the usual undercurrents of conflict, competition, jealousy and anger.</p> <p>Nudity often figures in these snaps. It is generic, almost, thematic: because we delight in their lack of self-consciousness, like cherubs or Christ-children in Renaissance paintings, our unclothed children are required to signify an ideal of innocence, a perfect pre-lapsarian purity. Sexuality within the family is felt to be dangerous and threatening, but you don't need to be a shrink to see the Oedipal complex at work - you only need to have been the parent of a three- or four-year-old boy. Any boy. Or any girl, come to that. Their innocence is our construction.</p> <p>And it is a construction that we put upon them: the unconscious drama behind these \"innocent\" family snaps involves the parents recruiting their infant children to play a role which, by denying their sexuality, is also about denying our own. I doubt that those who complain about Tierney Gearon's pictures of her children would have any problem with my bathtime pictures, but in a subterranean way, they do represent a type of exploitation. Gearon's \"crime\" is that she makes us think about it.</p> <p>On Saturday morning a package arrived from an American friend which included a copy of the celebrated annual Swimwear issue of Sports Illustrated. Our five-year-old son promptly pounced on it.</p> <p>\"I can't wait till 'latency',\" sighed my wife, referring to Freud's notion of the period between infancy and puberty when children's sexuality becomes submerged.</p> <p>Our son is fascinated by sex and nudity. Of course, he is innocent - if we mean inexperienced - but we don't feel his interest is anything other than normal, and certainly not something he should be made to feel guilty about. But what the censorship lobby wants innocence to mean is not inexperience, but ignorance. He should not have a sexuality at his age; and, by implication, it is our duty as parents to repress it.</p> <p>I suppose there may be a point during her adolescence (post-latency!) when our daughter will decide that the picture of her on the potty will belong to the class of things that are hideously embarrassing, to be denied or suppressed at all costs. But, by then, so will I. It's only natural.</p>",

The idea of childhood innocence - often signified in pictures by children's unselfconscious nakedness - is a convenient myth that we parents need in order to maintain that image of ourselves as members of a contented, loving family, without the usual undercurrents of conflict, competition, jealousy and anger. Nudity often figures in these snaps. It is generic, almost, thematic: because we delight in their lack of self-consciousness, like cherubs or Christ-children in Renaissance paintings, our unclothed children are required to signify an ideal of innocence, a perfect pre-lapsarian purity. Sexuality within the family is felt to be dangerous and threatening, but you don't need to be a shrink to see the Oedipal complex at work - you only need to have been the parent of a three- or four-year-old boy. Any boy. Or any girl, come to that. Their innocence is our construction. And it is a construction that we put upon them: the unconscious drama behind these \"innocent\" family snaps involves the parents recruiting their infant children to play a role which, by denying their sexuality, is also about denying our own. I doubt that those who complain about Tierney Gearon's pictures of her children would have any problem with my bathtime pictures, but in a subterranean way, they do represent a type of exploitation. Gearon's \"crime\" is that she makes us think about it. On Saturday morning a package arrived from an American friend which included a copy of the celebrated annual Swimwear issue of Sports Illustrated. Our five-year-old son promptly pounced on it. \"I can't wait till 'latency',\" sighed my wife, referring to Freud's notion of the period between infancy and puberty when children's sexuality becomes submerged. Our son is fascinated by sex and nudity. Of course, he is innocent - if we mean inexperienced - but we don't feel his interest is anything other than normal, and certainly not something he should be made to feel guilty about. But what the censorship lobby wants innocence to mean is not inexperience, but ignorance. He should not have a sexuality at his age; and, by implication, it is our duty as parents to repress it. I suppose there may be a point during her adolescence (post-latency!) when our daughter will decide that the picture of her on the potty will belong to the class of things that are hideously embarrassing, to be denied or suppressed at all costs. But, by then, so will I. It's only natural.",

More than that, I imagined I had a rare ability to communicate with horses; I was a sort of prepubescent horse whisperer, who could subdue the most difficult creature and make him do exactly as I pleased. The more mundane reality was life in the suburbs where my contact with horses was limited to a weekly foray into the green belt to bounce around for an hour on the back of a saggy, shaggy hack at Miss Whitfield's riding school.</p> <p>The thing about my horsey childhood was that my dreams were so much better than anything reality offered. I never had my own real horse - it was beyond my parents' means. But I had a whole garden shedful of imaginary ones that I used to groom, feed and exercise. I still have notebooks, filled with wildly varying handwriting, that record my horses' names, their breed, their temperament and even imaginary conversations I used to have with them. I'd lead them out of the shed after tacking up, then I'd mount; my legs became their legs, my head their head, tossing and whinnying.</p> <p>At one point my parents became concerned because I couldn't stop walking like a horse, even when my horses were locked away in the shed.

With them you rearrange the world to your liking.\" Maybe.</p> <p>\"Flying along the surface of the earth is a simple pleasure, irreducible and without peer . . . To borrow the power of another to achieve something so near to pure freedom without its becoming final death is an intoxication.\" And at another point: \"But all love is at base sexual, or at base social, or perhaps even deeper at base the social is sexual, and since we don't know where these things begin and end in our daily life, we are not about to demarcate them when it comes to girls and horses either.\"</p> <p>Was it sexual for me? I don't think so, though I did worry for a while that I would lose my virginity to a particularly broad-backed gelding called Bits&amp;Pieces, in the same way that other girls thought they might lose it to a bicycle saddle.</p> <p>But why women and not men? \"For one thing, [horses] are a lot like children; we know how to take care of children - it's in our genes,\" Pierson writes. \"We don't have anything to prove; we don't need to fix things in order to feel good. We're more patient, and horses respond best to patience. You can't use force on a horse and when many men discover that, they're out of there.\"</p> <p>Is it what she calls \"anticipatory coping\"? In other words, girls practising for the real thing - boys? Is it the \"impossible mixture of power and delicacy, size and fragility\"?</p> <p>I don't know whether it's about nurturing or sex, power or passion. For me, it was about the imagination. It was a brilliant fantasy world I inhabited for probably 10 years of my life. Had I won that WH Smith competition (did anyone ever? I doubt it), my horsey dream world would have been shattered. Who needs the harsh realities of keeping a horse - the expense, the time, the effort, the injuries - when your garden shed is full of Red Rum-like creatures who adore you, who talk to you and require attention only when you feel like giving it to them?</p> <p>I still dream I might have my own horse one day. What will he or she be like? Maybe an ageing thoroughbred, who once had her own glittering future, competing over hurdles, but she threw her rider, causing them serious injury. Maybe I'll save her from the knacker's yard; I'll teach her to trust humans again, I'll be the only person she allows on her back.</p> <p>Long live fantasy.</p> <p>\u0095 Dark Horses &amp; Black Beauties: Animals, Women, A Passion by Melissa Holbrook Pierson is published by Granta on March 22 at \u00a312.99.</p>",

With them you rearrange the world to your liking.\" Maybe. \"Flying along the surface of the earth is a simple pleasure, irreducible and without peer . . . To borrow the power of another to achieve something so near to pure freedom without its becoming final death is an intoxication.\" And at another point: \"But all love is at base sexual, or at base social, or perhaps even deeper at base the social is sexual, and since we don't know where these things begin and end in our daily life, we are not about to demarcate them when it comes to girls and horses either.\" Was it sexual for me? I don't think so, though I did worry for a while that I would lose my virginity to a particularly broad-backed gelding called Bits&amp;Pieces, in the same way that other girls thought they might lose it to a bicycle saddle. But why women and not men? \"For one thing, [horses] are a lot like children; we know how to take care of children - it's in our genes,\" Pierson writes. \"We don't have anything to prove; we don't need to fix things in order to feel good. We're more patient, and horses respond best to patience. You can't use force on a horse and when many men discover that, they're out of there.\" Is it what she calls \"anticipatory coping\"? In other words, girls practising for the real thing - boys? Is it the \"impossible mixture of power and delicacy, size and fragility\"? I don't know whether it's about nurturing or sex, power or passion. For me, it was about the imagination. It was a brilliant fantasy world I inhabited for probably 10 years of my life. Had I won that WH Smith competition (did anyone ever? I doubt it), my horsey dream world would have been shattered. Who needs the harsh realities of keeping a horse - the expense, the time, the effort, the injuries - when your garden shed is full of Red Rum-like creatures who adore you, who talk to you and require attention only when you feel like giving it to them? I still dream I might have my own horse one day. What will he or she be like? Maybe an ageing thoroughbred, who once had her own glittering future, competing over hurdles, but she threw her rider, causing them serious injury. Maybe I'll save her from the knacker's yard; I'll teach her to trust humans again, I'll be the only person she allows on her back. Long live fantasy. \u0095 Dark Horses &amp; Black Beauties: Animals, Women, A Passion by Melissa Holbrook Pierson is published by Granta on March 22 at \u00a312.99.",

      "body": "<p>For all the talk about psychologically important index levels, the fact remains that the men and women who control the bulk of the money swirling around the London market do not know when the FTSE 100 is going to bottom out. And they are very nervous. </p> <p>When the blue chip index regained the \"important\" 6,000 level last week after Goldman Sachs' revered investment strategist, Abby Cohen, advised her US clients to increase their exposure to equities, there was a feeling that, at last, it was safe to go back in the water. </p> <p>On yesterday's showing, it clearly is not. </p> <p>From the outset, the omens were not good. Traders arrived at their desks having to digest the implications of Friday's late news from Cisco, the internet equipment maker, that it would cut 11% of its workforce in response to the slowing US economy. </p> <p>On top of that there was the awful performance of Prudential to deal with. The share price of the life assurer went into reverse after it surprised the market with the $22.3bn (\u00a315bn) acquisition of US rival American General. </p> <p>With the Nasdaq falling below 2,000 for the first time since December 1998 London's misery was almost complete - although it was left to Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson to deliver the last rites. </p> <p>After Ericsson announced that first quarter sales would be lower than forecast and predicted a pretax loss of $400 to $500m, the FTSE backtracked to a level last seen in February 1999. </p> <p>Thanks to shenanigans in the end of day auction process the FTSE 100 managed to finish off its lows, but was still down 90.8 points at 5,826.5 - its worst close in two years. </p> <p>Elsewhere, things were no better.

      "bodyText": "For all the talk about psychologically important index levels, the fact remains that the men and women who control the bulk of the money swirling around the London market do not know when the FTSE 100 is going to bottom out. And they are very nervous. When the blue chip index regained the \"important\" 6,000 level last week after Goldman Sachs' revered investment strategist, Abby Cohen, advised her US clients to increase their exposure to equities, there was a feeling that, at last, it was safe to go back in the water. On yesterday's showing, it clearly is not. From the outset, the omens were not good. Traders arrived at their desks having to digest the implications of Friday's late news from Cisco, the internet equipment maker, that it would cut 11% of its workforce in response to the slowing US economy. On top of that there was the awful performance of Prudential to deal with. The share price of the life assurer went into reverse after it surprised the market with the $22.3bn (\u00a315bn) acquisition of US rival American General. With the Nasdaq falling below 2,000 for the first time since December 1998 London's misery was almost complete - although it was left to Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson to deliver the last rites. After Ericsson announced that first quarter sales would be lower than forecast and predicted a pretax loss of $400 to $500m, the FTSE backtracked to a level last seen in February 1999. Thanks to shenanigans in the end of day auction process the FTSE 100 managed to finish off its lows, but was still down 90.8 points at 5,826.5 - its worst close in two years. Elsewhere, things were no better. The FTSE Techmark 100 slid to its lowest finish to date - falling 81.37 points, or 3.5%, to 2,227.37, with the likes of Scoot.com , down 8.5p to 27p, Bookham Technology , off 83p to 361p, and Kewill Systems , 39p weaker at 188p, hit by what dealers described as panic selling. \"So many people have tried to call the bottom of this market so many times, but no one has succeeded. \"Confidence must be at its lowest level in a decade,\" one dealer said. With a lack of corporate stories doing the rounds, all traders could do was sit back and watch the rout of tech and telecom stocks. Marconi , which competes against Cisco, and ARM , which licenses its chip designs to Ericsson, bore the brunt of the selling, falling 34p to 447p and 29.5p to 302p respectively. Autonomy , 104p worse at \u00a312.05, Colt Telecom , off 84p to \u00a311.40, and BT , 21.5p weaker at 533.5p, were also hit. Even biotechnology company Celltech , 130p poorer at \u00a311.70, was affected by the chill wind blowing from across the Atlantic. Nevertheless, Prudential was the worst blue chip performer, surrendering 125p to 772p, as the City digested its all-paper acquisition of American General.

      "bodyText": "Glyndebourne may have some way to go to match the blood and gore of Covent Garden's internal politics, but the East Sussex opera house did manage to raise a tremor last night with its appointment of David Pickard as its third general director in two years. At 40, Pickard - who began to make his mark with the late, lamented Kent Opera - will head the youngest team running a major opera house in Euorpe alongside 28-year-old musical director Vladimir Jurowski. Glyndebourne's executive chairman, Gus Christie, is a venerable 36. Despite his eight highly successful years in charge of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, one of the mainstays of Glyndebourne's summer festival, the choice of Pickard as a replacement for the older, but much more radical Nicholas Snowman, who left suddenly three months ago, came as a surprise. Elaine Padmore from Covent Garden, Welsh National Opera's dynamic leader Anthony Freud and a trio of continental opera house managers were thought more likely contenders. Snowman's decision to \"spend more time with my family\" came out of the blue with both he and the Christie dynasty, who own the opera house, stressing that there had been no falling out. Rumours had been rife that the relationship was strained by Snowman's wish to break Glyndebourne's fairly rigid pay scale and his desire for more spectacular productions. Sir George Christie, now president of Glyndebourne Productions, said Pickard was chosen as much for his artistic flair as his business sense. \"David Pickard comes straight from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment where he has had extraordinary success, not just financially, but particularly in artistic achievement. With his appointment, at the age of 40, together with those of our new music director, Vladimir Jurowski, and Gus Christie as executive chairman, the company looks forward to a new and rejuvenated future.\"",

FSA to beef up leak rules The financial services authority said yesterday it is preparing a new offensive on the leaking to newspapers of market sensitive corporate information. A spokesman for the FSA said revised guidelines would underline the fact that the unofficial release of information was against its rulebook. The FSA is updating its rules, partly to reflect technological change since they were published five years ago.

      "bodyText": "Efforts to persuade Yugoslavia's fledgling government to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the Hague were given a symbolic boost yesterday when a former mayor accused of crimes against humanity gave himself up to the court. Blagoje Simic, 41, is the first citizen of Yugoslavia proper to surrender to the court for crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. The court's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, has lobbied Belgrade hard in recent months to get the cooperation of President Vojislav Kostunica in arresting people such as Slobodan Milosevic, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. But to the disappointment of many in the west Mr Kostunica has all but refused to help track down and arrest the \"big fish\" wanted by the court. His foot-dragging has exasperated Mrs Del Ponte and angered Washington, which has warned the Yugoslav nationalist that his country may face US economic sanctions by the end of this month unless he begins to cooperate. Mr Simic's surrender is seen in some quarters as a sign that Mr Kostunica may now be preparing to soften his stance. \"We asked them [Yugoslavia] to give a concrete sign of cooperation ... That's good if it's the beginning of the process,\" Mrs Del Ponte's spokeswoman, Florence Hartmann, said yesterday. \"If Simic is the beginning of the list and at the end we have Mladic, Karadzic and Milosevic, it's very good.\" Belgrade also said yesterday that it would for the first time send a government delegation to the Hague to discuss future collaboration. Mrs Del Ponte said Mr Simic's surrender was \"the first encouraging signal from Belgrade\", but made it clear that she expected further action. Mr Simic is charged with committing crimes in 1992, when he was mayor of Bosanski Samac, in Bosnia. He vigorously protests his innocence. He was the official in charge in April of that year when the town was overrun by Serb forces, and he remained in that post until the end of the war three years later. Half the town's population of about 17,000 people were Croat or Muslim at the beginning of the war. By 1995 there were only 300 non-Serbs left: the rest had been thrown into Serb-run concentration camps, where many were murdered, tortured and sexually assaulted. Mr Simic, who was indicted in 1995, is also answerable for the acts of murder and torture which are said to have been carried out by his then chief of police. Speaking at Belgrade airport before flying to the Hague yesterday, Mr Simic said he had nothing to fear. \"I'm absolutely convinced of my innocence and I'm sure I'll prove it. I want to clear my name and that of my family, as well as that of the Yugoslav and Serbian people,\" he said. He is likely to make his first court appearance this week.",

I suspect that the altruism of Guardian readers would readily embrace this more efficient and more expensive approach to lessening the plight of the poorest.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On London's Holborn, and so half way between the City and the West End, stands what is commonly known as the Prudential building. This is a serious piece of Gothic renaissance knocked up by Sir Alfred Waterhouse, who had already built Manchester town hall and the Natural History Museum by the time he got round to designing this red brick extravaganza in 1879. </p> <p>It remains an imposing, listed, piece of the capital's skyline - all magnificent, narrow arches and clean red spires. And it smacks of pomposity, fraudulently promoting a Victorian claim that thrift (in the form of insurance premiums, in this case) was somehow close to Godliness. </p> <p>The point about mentioning it here, attractive as the building might be, is that it is no longer called the Prudential building. It now goes by the name of Holborn Bars, victim to some or other estate agent's spin and pitched in its refurbished state to attract a hotch-potch of office space renters seemingly ready to pay a premium for the cachet of sitting close by London's legal community. Chancery Lane and Lincoln's Inn are close by. </p> <p>Two years ago (almost to the day) the Pru, along with its art collection, decamped to an altogether less imposing home off a sidestreet in the heart of the Square Mile. This new building is clean and light, with white walls. It is modern and functional, with an air of efficiency - a suitable sort of place from which to launch the most eye-grabbing overseas takeover attempted by a member of the British financial community. </p> <p>Out of the blue (there were no leaks or false leads or massages in the Sunday press), the Pru's fresh-faced chief executive, Jonathan Bloomer, has tabled a \u00a330bn-plus merger with its dust-free Texan rival American General, on all-paper terms that give the British company executive control. </p> <p>In typically British style, this piece of adventure capitalism drew immediate castigation.

      "bodyText": "On London's Holborn, and so half way between the City and the West End, stands what is commonly known as the Prudential building. This is a serious piece of Gothic renaissance knocked up by Sir Alfred Waterhouse, who had already built Manchester town hall and the Natural History Museum by the time he got round to designing this red brick extravaganza in 1879. It remains an imposing, listed, piece of the capital's skyline - all magnificent, narrow arches and clean red spires. And it smacks of pomposity, fraudulently promoting a Victorian claim that thrift (in the form of insurance premiums, in this case) was somehow close to Godliness. The point about mentioning it here, attractive as the building might be, is that it is no longer called the Prudential building. It now goes by the name of Holborn Bars, victim to some or other estate agent's spin and pitched in its refurbished state to attract a hotch-potch of office space renters seemingly ready to pay a premium for the cachet of sitting close by London's legal community. Chancery Lane and Lincoln's Inn are close by. Two years ago (almost to the day) the Pru, along with its art collection, decamped to an altogether less imposing home off a sidestreet in the heart of the Square Mile. This new building is clean and light, with white walls. It is modern and functional, with an air of efficiency - a suitable sort of place from which to launch the most eye-grabbing overseas takeover attempted by a member of the British financial community. Out of the blue (there were no leaks or false leads or massages in the Sunday press), the Pru's fresh-faced chief executive, Jonathan Bloomer, has tabled a \u00a330bn-plus merger with its dust-free Texan rival American General, on all-paper terms that give the British company executive control. In typically British style, this piece of adventure capitalism drew immediate castigation. Attempts by UK banks or insurance companies to move into the American market have invariably ended in tears, it was stated. And if Mr Bloomer has managed to pull off a deal recommended by the go-go Texans, then he must have paid too much, chimed the sceptics. Yesterday morning, as proof, everyone was pointing to the Pru's share price, down an uncomfortable 14% in London. There are, of course, reasons to be sceptical (as opposed to cynical).

Similarly, the Pru is proposing a make-or-break deal in a climate of absolute uncertainty in the world's biggest economy - at the apparent end of a record-setting bull run where no one can now predict the severity or speed of the downturn. What is more, there were one or two presentation hiccups yesterday. Issuing \u00a318bn of new equity and tying up top-line management time for two or three years in order to achieve \u00a385m of an nual cost savings was never going to get the City's juices going.

      "bodyText": "Since the dome's closure, pundits and politicians have been lecturing us sternly. \"This fiasco must end soon.\" Their solutions vary: it should be demolished; it should be integrated into worthy urban regeneration; it should have \"meaningful\" exhibitions. But all agree on one point. The dome was a disaster because it had no brand. That's where they are wrong. The dome has a clear brand and that brand is Disaster. It cries out to be exploited as a grand folly, an emblem of muddle, hype and plain foolishness with enormous entertainment potential. Only one person is in a position to build this dome brand. P-Y Gerbeau has a natural claim to running it on the simple grounds that he is already a recognisable national figure of fun, automatically linked in people's minds with the place. How many people would recognise Lord Falconer in the street? Or would want to? P-Y, though, with his mad haircut and manic enthusiasm is a public figure. There's no need for Mickey Mouse in the dome when there's a Mickey Mouse Frenchman to run it. Who cares if he was the car park supremo at Euro Disney? He obviously learnt a lot about entertaining the customers. The main positive aspect of P-Y's project for the dome is to keep its fundamental structure in tact. He likes it. And so, it turns out, do we, now that we might lose it. We've become fond of the building we love to hate, the great folly, with all the entertainment it has provided stumbling from crisis to disaster. People who opposed it for environmental damage and shameful waste now realise demolition would be worse, creating just another naff business park, wasting some of the more decent infrastructure that rundown London has to offer.

The timbre was gravelly, the accent one-hundred-percent American. More un-BBC you could not be. He was known worldwide. Arabists loathed him, less for the way he reported events than for the bad news - as they saw it - that he was always bringing. Yet this Zionist American Jew was always his own man. He stayed eternally independent. He had a powerful sense of justice.</p> <p>Elkins scooped the world in the six-day war of June 1967. In those days, he was a stringer for the BBC, for the CBS radio network and for the magazine Newsweek. It was the third Arab-Israeli war. President Nasser of Egypt, along with the Syrians and Jordanians, had grievously miscalculated. Elkins, on day one, reported an Israeli victory. He had bumped into a politician he knew, who directed him post-haste to the war-room. The Arab air forces had been destroyed on the ground.</p> <p>Israel's military censors held up his copy. Elkins proposed a deal. When you release the story, he told them, give me priority. They played ball. Our correspondent put the electrifying news out to the BBC and CBS. The BBC aired his report, though nervously because he was on his own. CBS watched the wires, waiting for confirmation of the Elkins dispatch. None came. They panicked, and sent him a terse one-liner - \"You alone with Israeli victory. You'd better be right.\" He was, but he did not forgive CBS for doubting him.</p> <p>That autumn, he visited New York and called on CBS. He was garlanded for his scoop, hailed for his journalism. \"Get lost,\" he snarled, unforgiving, \"I resign.\"</p> <p>He told me once that CBS had then \"offered him the earth\" to stay as their correspondent, but he had refused. \"Well done,\" I enthused, praising his probity. Elkins looked at me. \"I have to tell you something, David,\" he said. \"If Newsweek had not already given me the earth, I would have been sorely tempted.\" That was Elkins - tough-minded, but never stupid.</p> <p>There was another famous BBC occasion in 1982. This time Elkins, for once, got the story wrong. The Israeli army had invaded Lebanon and surrounded Beirut. When the Phalangist militia belonging to their Lebanese allies, the Maronite Christians, began a brutal massacre of Palestinians and other Muslims in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps, Israeli troops simply looked the other way.</p> <p>Back in Jerusalem, Elkins was, at first, misled by Israeli sources. His BBC report was inaccurate. I was in Beirut at that time. I heard the comments of French correspondents in my hotel. \"Did you hear Elkins this evening? D\u00e9gotant. Disgusting.\"</p> <p>The next morning, Elkins was on the World Service again. He had been duped, his voice was bristling with anger, his underlining of Israeli complicity now trenchant. By chance, I overheard the same French group again, this time at the breakfast table. \"Did you hear Elkins this morning? Mon Dieu. Epatant,\" they cried. \"Fantastic.\"</p> <p>He was indeed a phenomenon, a man of parts. Born to European immigrants to the United States, he grew up in New York, and was top of the class in almost everything at school, especially English - he had an inspiring teacher. Then, as a youngster, he fell in with hoodlums, but later went west to join his elder brother, Saul, a Hollywood producer.</p> <p>There, Elkins the film script-writer and trade-union organiser was born. Over the years, he scripted more than 30 Hollywood B-movies. His work as a union representative got him blacklisted by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who accused him (falsely) of being a communist. He was no communist, but was certainly an active anti-fascist before the second world war, a supporter of the International Brigades in republican Spain.</p> <p>With the war, Elkins was recruited into a shadowy, clandestine world. He joined the OSS, America's Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA, led by General \"Wild Bill\" Donovan. He was dispatched on murky missions behind enemy lines in Europe. Heaven knows what these involved. Certainly, he was with US troops when the Dachau death camp was liberated. And it was with this experience, encountering skeletal Holocaust survivors, that Elkins rediscovered his own Jewish roots.</p> <p>In his book, Forged In Fury, published in 1971, Elkins wrote of a secret Jewish organisation, some 50-strong, called DIN, formed in Europe in 1945 to assassinate \"the killers of Jews\" - former Nazis, SS men, camp staff and others who had slipped away unpunished into civilian life. DIN was shortlived but deadly. Elkins changed names, places and dates to protect those of whom he wrote. One DIN member he describes, Arnie Berg, an American, bears a remarkable resemblance to the author himself.</p> <p>A couple of years after the war, Elkins was introduced in New York to Teddy Kollek, later to be mayor of Jerusalem. Kollek was masterminding illegal shipments of arms to the Jewish Haganah in Palestine. With his OSS experience, Elkins was soon on board. When he found the FBI on his tail, he and his wife, Martha, decamped in a hurry to the new-born state of Israel. It was 1948.</p> <p>After living for a year on a kibbutz, he took up documentary film-making, before getting into journalism, first with CBS and Newsweek, then, in 1965, with the BBC. In 1982, aged 65, his BBC days were over. He never regretted them.</p> <p>Eight years later, he joined the Jerusalem Report, a new English-language magazine, as ombudsman and editor of its letters pages. As they themselves would tell you, he was \"a walking history of modern Israel . . . our moral conscience and moral compass . . . a man who embodied the courtesy and integrity of a bygone age, and thereby challenged us to strive for those values\". Michael Elkins was working with them full-time until his death.</p> <p>He is survived by his son Jonathan, and his longtime companion Ruth Tzur.</p> <p>Michael Elkins, journalist, born January 22 1917; died March 10 2001</p>",

It was a demanding life, and he was demanding on himself.</p> <p>He will be missed in museums, and in the great city of Liverpool, which he served so well.</p>",

However, his experience was increasingly sought at national level. In 1993, he was appointed to the Museums and Galleries Commission, where he quickly became an authoritative influence, encouraging the creation of the scheme for designating regional collections of national importance. In all his activities, Foster displayed the qualities and strengths that made him such an effective force in the museum world over more than 30 years. At meetings, he would take meticulous notes, deliberate and then sum up, taking the argument forward to a positive conclusion. For Foster, the planning of a new building, the solution of an intractable problem, or having to deal with an awkward moral issue would serve as a challenge. He would tease out a solution, insisting on contributions from all as a way of engaging opposition - and, more often than not, leave people with a feeling that they had all contributed to a result built on the best of each individual idea. His total lack of ego, generosity, gentle sense of humour, willingness to listen, and determination to find solutions made him an engaging colleague and an inspiring example for younger people. He carried his immense responsibilities lightly, but often found himself acting as the rock on which others would depend for solutions, advice or inspiration. It was a demanding life, and he was demanding on himself. He will be missed in museums, and in the great city of Liverpool, which he served so well.",

Born into a wealthy, cultivated Jewish family, with older siblings both artists themselves, he astonished with his precocious draughtmanship. Solomon was taken up by the most advanced London artistic circles of the time, and he flourished. Flourished, that is, recklessly. He went too far, was more daring, less regarding of convention, more altogether provocative, than any of his contemporaries. Edward Burne-Jones said he was \"the greatest artist of us all; we are mere schoolboys compared to (him)\". </p> <p>He drank, of course and was endlessly indiscreet, but it seemed containable until he was arrested for soliciting in a public lavatory. Fined but not imprisoned, he was disgraced even though no reference to the case ever appeared in any newspaper. His public career was over. Born in 1840, thrown out in 1873, dead in 1905. \"We miss,\" remarked the Jewish Chronicle, \"a competitor for artistic fame in Simeon Solomon, from causes which our readers will know only to lament.\" It was a catastrophe that prefigured Oscar Wilde's and it can overwhelm one's sense of the man's artworks. But he is more than his tragedy. </p> <p>There is a drawing, executed in 1886, years after the private scandal of his importuning, which indicates something of what was lost by the disaster. It is of a Jew holding close to his chest the objects with which the harvest festival is celebrated. As a subject, it is unremarkable. By the late 19th century, works showing Jews at their devotions were circulating so widely, that they barely merited attention. These works introduced the customs of Jews to their Gentile neighbours in a manner both to reassure and entertain. The message they communicated was to the effect that the Jews are a solemn and devout people, and their practices are dignified and picturesque. They are, these works intimated, a pious and decorous people, in all these respects unthreatening. </p> <p>Though many of Solomon's post-1873 works do seem underpowered, his turbaned Jew is not among them. Solomon takes a Jew at prayer as his starting point, but then does something quite remarkable with his subject. To appreciate it, we must first put to one side the tame exotica of dress, headgear and backdrop. We must also not trouble ourselves with the religious meaning of lulav and etrog . They merely provide the means by which the artist may realise his intention, which is the study of a man indifferent to his audience, essentially detached from everything that he wears or holds, rapt in contemplation. But contemplation of what? One cannot say. There is a hint of erotic self-absorption. There is also the implication of a certain reluctance on the part of the model to be portrayed thus. It is best understood, perhaps, as a study of the disengagement, not to say alienation, of a person from his ascribed role. There is a photograph of the artist himself, similarly turbaned, similarly tricked out in oriental finery, looking elsewhere than at the camera, that supports such a reading of the work. Taken in the late 1860s, it precedes by at least two decades the drawing and yet it offers a similar intimation of the appeal of costume to the artist: as the means by which a revelation of self may both be made and concealed. </p> <p>One should resist the temptation to read the pictures either for their homoeroticism or their fuzzy religiosity. In an essay in the catalogue that accompanies the exhibition, Colin Cruise writes: \"His paintings became emblematic of a kind of sexual desire, or being attracted to one's own sex.\" His work was accused of a \"certain effeminacy\".

Their debut album, Homework, smashed house music's US-UK polarity and stamped the French tricolour on its forehead. This week they're back with Discovery, the most anticipated and talked-about dance album of the year. Mixmag, the UK's biggest-selling dance publication, has dubbed it \"the greatest album ever\"; DJ Roger Sanchez, one of the group's mentors, has declared the album \"a lot happier than I expected\". </p> <p>\"I don't know if I feel happier now,\" says Thomas Bangalter, one half of Daft Punk, \"but I am happy. Homework was a happy thing, but there was also anger - a statement. Most of that anger has been proved right, so there's nothing wrong with being happy now.\" </p> <p>Dance music, Bangalter continues, has won its battles: \"Stylistically the revolution is over. Dance music has become mainstream. We fought for dance music on the first album because it was a minority and it's always better to fight for the minority: it's something you believe in, and it's about tolerance. Now it's important to push the limits. </p> <p>\"If we only do techno the way people want us to do techno then we'd be doing what the system wants us to do.

      "bodyText": "It's been four years since Daft Punk took dance music by the tail and shoved it through a beat mangle. Their debut album, Homework, smashed house music's US-UK polarity and stamped the French tricolour on its forehead. This week they're back with Discovery, the most anticipated and talked-about dance album of the year. Mixmag, the UK's biggest-selling dance publication, has dubbed it \"the greatest album ever\"; DJ Roger Sanchez, one of the group's mentors, has declared the album \"a lot happier than I expected\". \"I don't know if I feel happier now,\" says Thomas Bangalter, one half of Daft Punk, \"but I am happy. Homework was a happy thing, but there was also anger - a statement. Most of that anger has been proved right, so there's nothing wrong with being happy now.\" Dance music, Bangalter continues, has won its battles: \"Stylistically the revolution is over. Dance music has become mainstream. We fought for dance music on the first album because it was a minority and it's always better to fight for the minority: it's something you believe in, and it's about tolerance. Now it's important to push the limits. \"If we only do techno the way people want us to do techno then we'd be doing what the system wants us to do. What we have kept between Homework and Discovery is the home studio and the will to do anything. We want to destroy the limits between styles of music and show that it's possible to do funk and rock at the same time, or heavy metal and disco. \"It's still a battle because sometimes you realise people are more rigid than the system itself. You think that it's the structure that's hard to move, but when you move the structure you realise some people's minds are not ready to change.\" Tall, with a mop of dark wavy hair, Bangalter has warm features and intelligent eyes that lock into you as he speaks.

      "bodyText": "This time they were electing town councillors not the national president, but polling officials in Palm Beach county, Florida, were taking no chances yesterday. It was, after all, the first time some of Florida's voters had been to the polls since the disastrous November 7 election which held the United States and the world spellbound for 36 days. Municipal elections in Palm Beach would normally have to work hard to draw the attention of even the local Palm Beach Post. Yesterday, though, it was different, as reporters from CNN, National Public Radio and the New York Times hovered outside the polling stations just in case there was any repetition of last November's \"butterfly ballot\" debacle. Returning to the public gaze for the first time since the traumatic November and December battles over hanging chads and dimpled ballots, the local election supervisor Theresa LePore, designer of the ballot paper that probably lost Al Gore the presidency, tried to act as though she had not a care in the world. But a series of brightly coloured, prominently displayed notices headed \"Attention Voters\" gave the game away. They featured a stylised kickboxer blasting his way through a ballot paper and exhorting voters to \"Punch It Out!\" It is a fair bet that the only issue for the watching reporters was whether the celebrated elderly female Jewish voters of Palm Beach could finally master the ballot paper prepared for them by Ms LePore and successfully elect the candidate of their choice in yesterday's mayoral and council contests. This time there were no interleaved names and punch holes of the kind that became famous on the butterfly ballot and left some November voters weeping and angry after they discovered that they had voted for the conservative Reform party candidate Pat Buchanan in mistake for for Mr Gore. \"These are not my elections. These are the city elections,\" Ms LePore told more than 100 election workers in a pep talk before the voting began. But even she was philosophical. \"I'm sure that if anything goes wrong, whether it's something I'm responsible for or not, it's going to come back on me,\" she said. \"I know we're going to be watched like a hawk.\" Whether by coincidence or design, President George Bush's made his first visit to the sunshine state since the election controversy yesterday.

Karen O'Mahoney, an advertising executive, said that the eight carriage Crayford train came to a \"screeching halt\" just after Hither Green.

      "bodyText": "Six people were killed and 10 wounded yesterday when a US Navy plane missed its target in a training exercise in Kuwait and dropped a bomb on parked cars near the Iraqi border, according to Pentagon officials. At least four of the dead were Americans and one was a New Zealander. There were also five Americans and two Kuwaitis among the injured as a result of the the accident during a joint US-British-Kuwaiti exercise at the Udairi bombing range, about 30 miles from the desert border with Iraq. The plane, a Navy F-18 \"Hornet\" was operating from the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier patrolling the Gulf. Early reports suggested that the pilot may have mistaken a group of parked vehicles for a target when it dropped a 500lb bomb on a group of military observers. According to Kuwaiti officials, the vehicles had their lights on and were intended to guide the planes involved in a \"close air support\" exercise to wards their targets. US defence officials said it was too early yesterday to give the reasons for the accident. Lieutenant Colonel Joe Lamarca, a spokesman for the US Central Command, said the accident occurred at around 4pm GMT. \"There were 16 confirmed casualties, which include dead and injured,\" he said, adding that the casualties were taken to a Kuwait military hospital. Col Lamarca added that Kuwaiti, British and New Zealand forces were playing a support role in the exercise. An MoD spokesman later confirmed that there were no British casualties. British soldiers had not been involved in that specific exercise and were nowhere near the area at the time of the accident, he said. The accident comes at a time when the US Navy is struggling to recover from another lethal mishap, the deaths of nine Japanese, caused by a US submarine colliding with their fishing boat off the coast of Hawaii on February 9 during an emergency surfacing exercise. The latest accident happened shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Gulf War and at a time when Arab sympathy for the plight of Iraq is at a height and when the US military presence in the region is increasingly unpopular. President George Bush, speaking in Florida where he was promoting his tax proposals, called on an audience of supporters to hold a moment of silence for the dead, saying the accident was a reminder of \"how dangerous service can be\".",

The initiative, launched with great fanfare at a White House prayer breakfast in the president's second week in office, has stirred up a hornet's nest of accusations across the spectrum of religious groups and is being radically redrafted.

Mr Farrakhan has said he is not interested, however. The furore raised by the plan - a central plank of the \"compassionate conservative\" platform on which Mr Bush campaigned for the presidency last year - has taken an entirely different turn from the one his advisers expected. The administration prepared for an outcry from organisations and public figures who oppose any links between church and state. What it did not expect was that most of the loudest criticism would come from the conservative Christian right, which was expected to be among the most vociferous supporters. The critics include the veteran conservatives Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as well as Richard Land of the influential Southern Baptist Convention. But perhaps the most remarkable opponent is Marvin Olasky, the guru of compassionate conservatism and a former Bush adviser whose ideas are at the root of the entire faith-based strategy.

      "bodyText": "The case of Jeremy Bamber, one of the most notorious killers of the last 20 years, is being referred to the court of appeal, it emerged last night. Bamber was convicted of shooting dead five members of his wealthy family, including six-year-old twins, at their Essex farmhouse in 1985. The trial judge described Bamber as having a \"warped, callous and evil mind\" and characterised his conduct as \"evil beyond belief\". He became one of a handful of prisoners in Britain who have been told they will spend the rest of their lives behind bars. However, there have long been doubts about the safety of his conviction. Experts from the criminal cases review commission, which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice, have been examining the case for several months and have now decided it should go to the appeal court. Bamber was convicted of shooting his adoptive parents at their home in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, his sister, Sheila Caffell, and her twin sons. The prosecution alleged he murdered them to inherit a \u00a3500,000 family fortune. But Bamber claimed Mrs Caffell, who had a history of mental illness, killed the family and turned the gun, a .22 semi-automatic rifle, on herself. On a website set up on Bamber's behalf, he says the submission to the commission would focus on a \"narrow forensic issue\" but does not give details. It is understood the appeal could centre on traces of blood found in a silencer believed to have been used in the killings. The prosecution suggested the blood was Mrs Caffell's and could not have entered the silencer had she killed herself. It is believed that forensics experts consulted by those acting for Bamber may have cast doubt on this theory. The way the tests on the blood were carried out could have resulted in errors. Bamber, 39, claims on the website: \"I was wrongly convicted in 1986 of murdering five members of my family and I've been in jail for nearly 16 years. I have protested my innocence through all the usual channels and tried hard to find a successful path to the appeal courts.\" He says the crucial forensic information has been disclosed only to his legal team but adds: \"In time, I will publish this information but there are compelling reasons why I cannot do so now.\" Bamber also appeals for anyone with any other information which could help his fight for freedom to come forward. Bamber claims he has had 17 jail moves and 89 cell moves during his imprisonment. At present, he is in the high security Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire. An earlier application for leave to appeal against his conviction was refused by the court of appeal in 1989. Bamber then applied to the Home Office for a review of his conviction and his case was transferred to the criminal cases review commission after March 1997, when it assumed responsibility for the review of suspected miscarriages of justice. In 1995 Bamber lost his high court attempt to challenge the home secretary's decision that he should remain behind bars for the rest of his life. The appeal was seen as a test case for 14 other convicted murderers. Following Bamber's conviction, Essex police were criticised for the way the investigation was handled. Bamber's supporters believe vital evidence could have been destroyed.",

      "bodyText": "In an age when men are supposed to be more involved in helping to bring up children, a survey has revealed that just 17% of new fathers regularly get out of bed at night to help soothe their sleepless baby while one in five never gets up. The stress of sleepless nights and the lack of help from slumbering partners has led eight out of 10 new mothers to say that having a baby has threatened to wreck their relationships. The average mother gets four hours sleep a night during her baby's first four months, and after 18 months they are snatching five hours a night. Women bearing the brunt of the sleepless nights causes resentment, rows and rifts among couples, the study of 2,000 new mothers by Mother and Baby magazine found. More than two thirds of women admit resenting their partner for not getting up at night while eight out of 10 new mothers say their lack of sleep has put their relationship under \"immense strain\" and caused rows with their partners. And 90% are left bad-tempered, tearful, forgetful and irritated with their baby. More than half are so tired that they feel in a \"state of despair and desperation\". Just settling their baby to sleep at the beginning of the night takes 25 minutes. After that, mothers get up an average of three times a night to feed, change and comfort their child. Older mothers suffer most, with those over 34 having less sleep and more problems than their younger counterparts. Dani Zur, editor of Mother and Baby magazine, said: \"The trend nowadays is to have children at a later age, and although there are many positive aspects, older mums don't have the same energy levels as those in their twenties. \"The fresh-faced image of famous older mums like Madonna and Cherie Blair doesn't usually show the entourage of helpers that follow them around.\" \u0095 David Beckham is most men's idea of the perfect father, according to a survey out today.

      "body": "<p>This is hell. A narrowing funnel leading down to the centre of the earth. Sandro Botticelli's chart of hell is a little like a mushroom cloud or a child's spinning top. Look closely, and there are bodies on the terraces and narrow ledges, writhing like tiny maggots. It is the first thing you see as you walk into the Royal Academy's exhibition of his incomplete cycle of unfinished drawings illustrating Dante's Divine Comedy. </p> <p>Botticelli's drawings were made some time between 1480 and 1495, over a century and a half after Dante Alighieri, a fellow Florentine, wrote the Divine Comedy. Terraced, pinnacled, travelling forever downward, the ledges, cities and basements of hell are furnished with sloughs, gorges and deserts; there are cities, rivers of boiling blood, lagoons of scalding pitch, burning deserts, thorny forests, ditches of shit and frozen subterranean lakes. Every kind of sin, and sinner, is catered for. Here, descending circle by circle, like tourists to Bedlam, came Dante and Virgil. Following them, at least through Dante's poem, came Botticelli. </p> <p>For Botticelli, Dante's hell was in part his own Florence, in part the Biblical and Catholic worlds, a collision of religions and mythologies (here's Mohammed, disembowelled, here the giants of antiquity, enchained), in part the state of his own soul. Botticelli's version of the Inferno, and to a lesser extent his Purgatorio, is frequently as hilarious as it is horrible. It is impossible to look at certain of Botticelli's drawings - Inferno XIX, for example, with all those legs and feet on fire protruding from the wormholes that imprison sinners upside-down - without laughing. Hard not to smile, either, at the penitents in the Purgatorio, who crawl, as though between the frames of a strip cartoon, with boulders on their backs. Endless suffering and the variety of torments have become a running gag. Here come the snakes, the bat-winged grinning devils (who frequently smile back at us as we look at them), the guy with the scorpion's tail, the one with the comically engorged sausagey penis. The tormented - ravaged by beasts, or bursting in flames, or naked and frozen on an icy subterranean lake - provide a fabulous opportunity for Botticelli's wit, his empathy, the blackest of black humour. How many things can you do to a body, or a soul, before it breaks? Everything, the answer seems to be, again and again. The round of punishments and degradations eventually takes us to the Devil, a hairy, snaggletoothed, three-headed Satan at the earth's icy core. He is hard, nowadays, to take seriously; maybe that is his disguise. </p> <p>While Satan and his devils are frequently mad cartoons, the suffering sinners are all too human. Dante and Virgil, on the other hand, are always the straight men, plainly drawn, with a kind of reserve. Beatrice, when she appears, is a stereotypical Botticelli beauty, all ringlets, long fingers, too much drapery. Sometimes, she gives her Dante a wry smile or a worried look, as she leads him from Purgatory to Paradise. </p> <p>Ninety-two of Botticelli's original drawings remain; of his projected total - as far as we know - eight have been lost, two others disappeared in Berlin following the second world war, while others were never even begun. Of the vast majority that survive, few are finished, in the sense that Botticelli intended them. A few - such as the chart of hell - were worked over and painted up, rather badly, by studio assistants, while most remain as preparatory under-drawings. These were worked over, to varying degrees of completion, by the artist in pen and ink, using a silver point, which leaves a faint, indented, pencil-like mark, and a softer alloy nib. On the reverse sides of the sheets, Dante's text strikes through. </p> <p>What one might call the nakedness, the incompleteness, of these drawings shouldn't deter us. In fact, they speak to us today all the more eloquently because of it. Fully worked-up illustrations - the one for Canto XVIII of the Inferno, for instance - are somehow removed from us by being filled-in with paint. The bare outlines and graphic shorthand of Botticelli's drawings leave more mental space for the imagination, and speak more directly. The language of drawing has not changed much, and Botticelli's drawing, at times cartoonish and caricatured, at other times painstaking, deli cate, even tentative, is consummate. In some works it is truly a shorthand, in which one is aware of the nib skittering across the smooth parchment, or of Botticelli recording things in a matter of seconds, creating cursive, repetitive rhythms, imagining faces amid writhing, rhythmic flames, figures running through a forest of living trees. The more you look, the more delirious it all gets, the more a mind and a temperament communicate themselves. </p> <p>In the later, sparser and more restrained drawings of Dante's ascent through the circles of Paradise, guided by Beatrice, we see the two figures inside a bubble, a perfect compass-drawn circle. Except that part of the pleasure is seeing how imperfectly drawn the circles actually are, how the pen runs out of ink, or the nib slews away as the compass slips. The drawing, and the compositional organisation, is nevertheless marvellous. The idea is concrete, and needs no finish. Botticelli, like Dante, may have balked at the impossibility of depicting God and heaven. He turned, in part, to geometry, but towards the end left much unsaid, undrawn, blank. The bare, aged, yellowed parchment becomes a kind of immanence, a light-filled emptiness. In modern art, this has become a sign of the inexpressible, of spiritual presence. </p> <p>The reproductions in the excellent catalogue - good though they are - are wholly inadequate, in the sense that one really needs to see the actual drawings, on the slightly translucent animal-skin parch ment. To draw and write on skin provides its own metaphor of the corporeal and the transcendent. The geography and architecture of Botticelli's universe - and Dante's - may seem medieval, part of a cosmology we can no longer believe in. Hell may be eternal, but a modern hell would be altogether different to the Florentine abyss. It would be just as much a product of our time as the hells of Dante, of Fra Filippo Lippi, of Leonardo and of Botticelli were of theirs. Yet popular culture still returns to medieval eschatology for its images: Hannibal Lector returns to Florence, in Thomas Harris's most recent Lector escapade, to the very palace where the conspirators against Botticelli's first mentor, Lorenzo de Medici, were hung. And Dante's journey - and Botticelli's - is still enormously affecting. </p> <p>Both the poet and the artist make the imagery, and the concepts behind them, come alive for us through their respective languages. Thank heavens, I say, Botticelli's Divine Comedy was left unfinished: here is a plain voice, full of humour, imagination, liveliness, pictorial invention and doubt, speaking by and large an unchanged visual language. At times, Botticelli's drawings look forward to just about every 20th-century draughtsman you can think of: here is Henri Michaux on mescaline, in Botticelli's wood of thorns. Here's the Guardian's Steve Bell, in the If cartoon that is Inferno XIX. Here's Cy Twombly, leaving faint traces in Paradise. </p> <p>It is possible, but unlikely, that Botticelli drew Dante entirely for his own pleasure; only a little less likely that they were meant as drawings for frescoes for Florence Cathedral. More likely, he made his drawings for a de luxe codex or collector's book, as an ambassadorial gift to a foreign dignitary, or to be installed in some private room dedicated to Dante, a kind of Borgesian chamber that it is pleasurable to imagine, but has never been found. </p> <p>Whatever the reason for Botticelli's labours over Dante, it consumed him creatively and, according to Vasari \"caused infinite disorder in his life\". Botticelli's staging, his command of actions, emotions and bodies, either in relation to nature or to architecture, is always superb. I always like him best when he is marshalling groups of figures this way and that, choreographing events of enormous portent and stress. He's great, too, at the singular figure - a man sitting in a wilderness, a shade turning its head, a weeping woman. He is an orchestrator, not of anonymous human ciphers, but of individuals. Show me a video, point me at the movie, says the audience for contemporary art. Well, that is almost what Botticelli does here, in this great cycle of drawings, these incomparable works. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Botticelli's Dante: The Drawings for the Divine Comedy is at the Royal Academy, London W1, from Saturday until June 10.

It's tripe with marrow bone and gravy for dinner for those who have read Julie Bick's All I Really Need to Know In Business I Learned at Microsoft and Guy Kawasaki's Rules for Revolutions. Their mantra? Don't pant it, but howl at the moon: \"Eat your own dog food.\" </p> <p>Put through the debunker translator, this appears to refer to the practice of hiring a consultant to hold your nose while you swallow something that might otherwise offend your delicate business tastebuds. You pay them, they decide which part of your company is overdue to be downsized, that kind of thing. </p> <p>But is this approach wise? \"Eating dog food is not dangerous,\" a spokeswoman for the Pet Foods Manufacturing Association says, reassuringly. \"It is just not suitable for human consumption as it is nutritionally formulated for dogs.\" In other words, it won't kill you, but it's not terribly good for the health. Which seems to relate rather neatly to the practice of paying a company to tell you which of your colleagues to sack. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Now the dot.com bubble has popped, the word has entered the lexicon of net whizzkids, who would once smugly have dismissed junior doctors as workshy loafers. It seems there are a lot of burnt-out bunnies who didn't have enough free time to spend the venture capitalists' money, but now have rather too much of it on their hands. Numerous ex-dot.com art directors are spending their gains and new-found free time on the slopes of Blueridge perfecting their 'boarding, or mastering the ancient game of Connect 4 in Thailand. Debunker Tripe with gravy Bright eyes, healthy teeth and glossy coat. No longer only seen on best-in-show pooches, these attributes are now essential for any business (dober)man aspiring to a rosette. At least, that would seem to be the message of a rash of publications extolling the virtues of eating your own dog food. It's tripe with marrow bone and gravy for dinner for those who have read Julie Bick's All I Really Need to Know In Business I Learned at Microsoft and Guy Kawasaki's Rules for Revolutions. Their mantra? Don't pant it, but howl at the moon: \"Eat your own dog food.\" Put through the debunker translator, this appears to refer to the practice of hiring a consultant to hold your nose while you swallow something that might otherwise offend your delicate business tastebuds. You pay them, they decide which part of your company is overdue to be downsized, that kind of thing. But is this approach wise? \"Eating dog food is not dangerous,\" a spokeswoman for the Pet Foods Manufacturing Association says, reassuringly. \"It is just not suitable for human consumption as it is nutritionally formulated for dogs.\" In other words, it won't kill you, but it's not terribly good for the health. Which seems to relate rather neatly to the practice of paying a company to tell you which of your colleagues to sack. work@theguardian.com",

      "byline": "Tom Service",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Hans Werner Henze is one of the grandest old men of modern music. The South Bank Centre's Voices festival is a month-long celebration of the composer's 75th birthday year. The centrepiece of its first weekend - and the work that inspired the title - was the London Sinfonietta's performance of Henze's 22-song collection, Voices. Composed in 1973, and scored for mezzo- soprano, tenor and ensemble, this sets poems which express the horrors of oppression. </p> <p>The diversity of Henze's sources - from Heine and Brecht to the Cuban poet Herberto Padilla - is matched by an enormous range of musical styles and techniques. Expertly crafted pastiches of Weill and Eisler appear alongside limpid evocations of Italian folksongs. Henze gives each song an individual soundworld, and there are startling solos for ocarinas and harmonicas, as well as electro-acoustic soundscapes. Soloists Fiona Kimm and Christopher Gillett ensured that each setting was a succinct, self-contained drama, while Oliver Knussen and the Sinfonietta players gave a kaleidoscopic continuity to the whole collection. </p> <p>Whatever the emotive subject matter of Voices, Henze refuses to preach about doctrine. Even in the fourth number (based on Victor Hernandez Cruz's poem The Electric Cop), Henze's collage of presidential speeches, pop concerts, and shootings manages to be witty and acerbic rather than crassly anti-capitalist. In fact, Voices as a whole is both a compelling musical statement and a moving commentary on the darker sides of humanity. The Sinfonietta's performance allowed the work to speak with eloquence and imagination. </p> <p>Henze's most recent collection of songs is also his most bewildering. His Richard Wagnersche Klavierlieder, written in 1999, is a set of 17 orchestrations of Wagner's early songs. The BBC Symphony Orchestra and Leonard Slatkin gave the work's UK premiere, with soloists Stella Doufexis and Thomas Mohr. The piece represents a rapprochement between Henze and the German romantic tradition that would have seemed impossible three decades ago. </p> <p>But there are surprising connections between Wagner's music and Henze's present-day concerns. There is little sense of dissonance between the two composers in these orchestrations. Instead, Henze amplifies the vivid imagery of the originals: whether in the soldiers, rats and fleas in Wagner's settings of Goethe's Faust, or the love and lullabies of his French songs. </p> <p>In his own work, Henze now seems to crave the immediacy of music such as Wagner's early romanticism. Tenor Mark Padmore and pianist Andrew West performed The Six Songs from the Arabian, which Henze composed for Ian Bostridge in 1998. The beauty of these settings of his own texts is overwhelming and intoxicating, with their luxurious depictions of storm-tossed ships, radiant sunrises and searing laments. </p> <p>If the Wagnersche Klavierlieder and Voices demonstrate Henze's creativity in all its chameleon-like glory, The Six Songs apparently represent his real compositional voice.

      "bodyText": "Hans Werner Henze is one of the grandest old men of modern music. The South Bank Centre's Voices festival is a month-long celebration of the composer's 75th birthday year. The centrepiece of its first weekend - and the work that inspired the title - was the London Sinfonietta's performance of Henze's 22-song collection, Voices. Composed in 1973, and scored for mezzo- soprano, tenor and ensemble, this sets poems which express the horrors of oppression. The diversity of Henze's sources - from Heine and Brecht to the Cuban poet Herberto Padilla - is matched by an enormous range of musical styles and techniques. Expertly crafted pastiches of Weill and Eisler appear alongside limpid evocations of Italian folksongs. Henze gives each song an individual soundworld, and there are startling solos for ocarinas and harmonicas, as well as electro-acoustic soundscapes. Soloists Fiona Kimm and Christopher Gillett ensured that each setting was a succinct, self-contained drama, while Oliver Knussen and the Sinfonietta players gave a kaleidoscopic continuity to the whole collection. Whatever the emotive subject matter of Voices, Henze refuses to preach about doctrine. Even in the fourth number (based on Victor Hernandez Cruz's poem The Electric Cop), Henze's collage of presidential speeches, pop concerts, and shootings manages to be witty and acerbic rather than crassly anti-capitalist. In fact, Voices as a whole is both a compelling musical statement and a moving commentary on the darker sides of humanity. The Sinfonietta's performance allowed the work to speak with eloquence and imagination. Henze's most recent collection of songs is also his most bewildering. His Richard Wagnersche Klavierlieder, written in 1999, is a set of 17 orchestrations of Wagner's early songs. The BBC Symphony Orchestra and Leonard Slatkin gave the work's UK premiere, with soloists Stella Doufexis and Thomas Mohr. The piece represents a rapprochement between Henze and the German romantic tradition that would have seemed impossible three decades ago. But there are surprising connections between Wagner's music and Henze's present-day concerns. There is little sense of dissonance between the two composers in these orchestrations. Instead, Henze amplifies the vivid imagery of the originals: whether in the soldiers, rats and fleas in Wagner's settings of Goethe's Faust, or the love and lullabies of his French songs. In his own work, Henze now seems to crave the immediacy of music such as Wagner's early romanticism. Tenor Mark Padmore and pianist Andrew West performed The Six Songs from the Arabian, which Henze composed for Ian Bostridge in 1998. The beauty of these settings of his own texts is overwhelming and intoxicating, with their luxurious depictions of storm-tossed ships, radiant sunrises and searing laments. If the Wagnersche Klavierlieder and Voices demonstrate Henze's creativity in all its chameleon-like glory, The Six Songs apparently represent his real compositional voice. But the synthesis of romantic and modernist traditions in The Six Songs is as artificial as anything in the other works. And that is the fascination of Henze's music: there is no single approach which defines his work, and his musical personality remains as elusive as ever.",

      "body": "<p>Talk about a bad day at work. Nobuo Miuro was simply getting on with his job, when he keeled over and died. It had been a busy few weeks for the interiors fitter from Tokyo; he was struggling to get a new restaurant ready for its launch and had been putting in a fair bit of overtime. The day before he collapsed he had worked from 11am until 4.30am the next morning, but had managed to snatch a few hours' sleep before starting again. But when Miuro, 47, tried to pick up his hammer and nails again, he suddenly took ill. He died a week later. Last week a coroner returned a verdict of \"karoshi\": death by overwork. </p> <p>In Japan at least, it seems, the old adage that no one ever died from working too hard has been proved comprehensively false. We know that the Japanese often show an unenviable dedication to the office - a typical office worker can leave home at 7am and return after 11pm, spending two hours commuting. But there is something rather more unsettling in the blithe recognition that working too hard - and nothing more - can be enough to kill you. </p> <p>Karoshi is not a new concept in Japan, though assessments of quite how many salarymen keel over having shot a horrified glance at their diaries vary between a trickle and a torrent. In 1996 the Nagoya high court upheld a ruling that Yoshikazu Abo, a salesman for an electrical company in central Japan, had died from overwork 13 years earlier. In the 17 days before his death, Abo had been sent by his company on 20 sales missions around Japan; the last, to South Korea, was ruled to have killed him. </p> <p> Hundreds of civil lawsuits are now being filed every year by the relatives of those believed or found by the coroner to have died from karoshi, seeking compensation for the deaths of their loved ones. But Japanese companies have until now managed to escape criminal charges. The expected prosecution of Junichi Ochiai, the president of the interiors fitting firm, over Miura's death will, if successful, be the first case of a company being held criminally responsible for the death of an employee. With some estimates for karoshi deaths running at 10,000 deaths a year, however, it is possible that a ruling could have a significant impact on Japan's notoriously draconian work ethic. </p> <p>So much for Japanese employers, but what about those of us for whom Miura's 17-hour shift is a daunting, but not entirely unfamiliar, prospect? The British Medical Association estimates that junior doctors frequently work more than 100 hours a week - equivalent to 16 hours 40 minutes a day for six days out of seven. That's alarming enough for anyone about to go into hospital, without now expecting the chap in the white coat to drop dead as soon as he starts to yawn. So just how many hours' sleep do you have to miss before you risk dying? </p> <p>The good news is that the bleary-eyed have no cause to fear their impending demise, according to professor Jim Horner, director of Loughborough University's sleep research laboratory. \"Lack of sleep kills quite a few people at work because they fall asleep at the wheel and crash their lorry,\" he says, \"but apart from that there is no evidence that someone can just spontaneously die from lack of sleep. In humans the effect of sleep loss is pretty uneventful. </p> <p>\"The studies that have been done show that where people have been deprived of sleep they get more and more sleepy, but from the neck down there is no evidence of anything going wrong, even in the immune system. There is no effect on any organ other than the brain.\" </p> <p>The important factor, he notes, is whether the lack of sleep is caused or accompanied by a situation of high stress, the more likely reason for sudden, unexplained death being heart failure. However, according to Belinda Linden, a cardiac nurse at the British heart foundation, \"there is very little evidence associating stress with coronary heart disease\". </p> <p>The illnesses that doctors can confidently relate to anxiety, such as gastric problems or eczema, are rarely life-threatening. And while the factors we know cause heart attacks - smoking, obesity, inactivity - are often found among those who spend long hours at their desks, they are certainly not unique to them. </p> <p>Linden has never heard of someone spontaneously dropping dead because of stress. \"Much more likely is a cumulative effect, or other lifestyle issues, or an underlying disorder. In that case, working sustained long hours might just tip the balance.\" </p> <p>Which is comforting - up to a point. Because we British know ourselves to be the hardest workers in Europe, and while we may pity a Japanese workforce that allows itself to stay in the office until it expires, the facts show that we are not so very far behind them. The average Japanese employee works 2,000 hours per year, which sounds a lot until you realise that it works out at roughly an hour a week longer than we do. </p> <p>Worry not, says Roger Mead, a stress management consultant who advises individuals on dealing with work-related anxiety and companies on the legal ramifications if they are not looking after their employees' emotional welfare. He acknowledges that the implications of a Japanese-style rash of karoshi cases in this country would be \"enormous\", but is confident that it is unlikely to happen. Work-related anxiety, he says, \"depends on the way we look at things rather than the things themselves. The crucial difference is that in this country we don't have anything like the same working culture that there is in Japan. Obviously you can't work for ever, but if you get into a situation where you feel you can't cope, I believe in this country we do not have the general expectation that you will carry on working regardless.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, says Linden, it is important to carry out a careful assessment of whether your working environment, hours or, perhaps most crucially, attitude, is affecting you health. Recent studies have found that there appears to be an association between a feeling of powerlessness at work and an increased risk of heart disease. </p> <p>While some of this may be explained by lifestyle factors - unhealthy coping mechanisms and a likelihood that workers isolated from decision-making are likely to be poorer - early results have shown that a feeling of powerlessness or stress in itself may irritate the coronary arteries, encouraging the development of the fatty deposits that lead to heart attacks. It is possible that Japan's less questioning work ethic may in itself explain its high incidence of karoshi. </p> <p>Similarly, there is some evidence that frequent, temporary instances of high blood pressure, due to occasional stressful episodes, can encourage the blood pressure to rise permanently, which is known to contribute to heart attacks. </p> <p>If the case of Nobuo Miura prompts a change in Japan's working culture, he will have died for more than the interior of a new Tokyo eatery. And even while the country attempts to sidestep economic crisis, there are signs that the tide may be turning. Some Japanese companies are introducing \"no overtime\" days, meaning that for one day a week you get to actually go home when you have done your contracted hours. Whether employees take any notice or not, it's a start. And it might even save a life or two.</p>",

A hooting, exclamatory Blakeyesque theme followed, nodding to the Spirit Level repertoire of the 1980s. Drummer Seb Rochford remained in taut charge of a variety of rhythmic approaches, from straightahead time to the bleary, insinuating Crusaders-like electric funk that followed.

Half of Sunday's show was devoted to Richards' Suite for the Shed, a shrewd mix of the light, dancing energy of a Miles Davis group of the late 1950s, and the earthy heads-down drive of an Art Blakey band. In the opening stages, Great Spirit ran through a repertoire embracing all those references but also some unusual angles on classic material. Thelonious Monk's rugged, train-rhythm swinger Epistrophy was a fine arrangement that emphasised that composer's characteristically sidelong approach to rhythm but also effectively bookended some powerful soloing . Though they had opened inauspiciously, King soon accelerated a hard-bop groove with Latin peripherals. A hooting, exclamatory Blakeyesque theme followed, nodding to the Spirit Level repertoire of the 1980s. Drummer Seb Rochford remained in taut charge of a variety of rhythmic approaches, from straightahead time to the bleary, insinuating Crusaders-like electric funk that followed. Dick Pearce delivered a trumpet solo of punchy economy on the latter. Not exactly a band at the cutting edge of contemporary music, maybe, but a respectful guardian of an indelibly attractive style.",

      "body": "<p>Prudential's surprise \u00a330bn merger with US rival American General, announced yesterday, could earn the 150-year-old insurer a position on the world stage and particularly America, a market British companies notoriously find difficult to crack. </p> <p>The historic transaction, which involves Pru's shareholders paying some \u00a318bn for American General, was greeted with concern in the City. Questions were asked about the price being paid, the structure of the transaction and the timing of the deal which will create the sixth largest international insurance group in the world. </p> <p>Pru's shares fell by 14% to 772p, their lowest levels for two years, as the stock market arbitrageurs who often wade into major deals got to work on the discrepancies in the share prices between the Pru and American National. </p> <p>Their manoeuvring, coupled with anxiety about the reaction of shareholders in America, combined to help reduce the size of the transaction by some \u00a32bn as it was unveiled. </p> <p>It was an inauspicious start - exacerbated by the fact that the overall stock market was at its weakest levels for two years - for a deal designed to transform the Pru, once and for all, from a domestic insurance company ranked 26th biggest in the world to a player on the global stage. </p> <p>In one step thecompany, which already owns Jackson Life in the US, will have a greater foothold in a country where one inhabitant turns 50 every 7.5 seconds. These 4m \"baby boomers\" are a sitting audience for insurance companies, particularly ones eager to sell annuities for retirement. </p> <p>The deal is one of the solutions found by Jonathan Bloomer, the chief executive of the Pru who will run the combined business, to expand the insurance company at a time when pressures are being exerted on profits at home - particularly by the government's introduction of low-cost pensions - and abroad. </p> <p><strong> Continuing pressure</strong><br> </p> <p>It means that 65% of Pru's earnings will come from the US, with the rest coming from Asia, where it recently bought Orico Life of Japan, and Britain, where it also owns the M&amp;G fund management group. </p> <p>Mr Bloomer predicted yesterday that continuing pressure on their profit margins would cause further mergers between major insurance companies. \"It's going to be uncomfortable if you're stuck in the middle ground,\" he said. </p> <p>He was also at pains to insist he was not building up size for the sake of it. While analysts expressed some anxiety about the way the Pru was expanding in America when the economy was slowing, Mr Bloomer insisted the two companies were a \"great fit\". </p> <p>This failed to calm a market that was still digesting last year's \u00a3258m bill at the Pru's US business Jackson Life. This came as a result of sweeping changes in the annuity market - an area where its new acquisition is a major player. </p> <p>Earlier this year, American General itself warned that profits were likely to be lower when the US stock market was falling on concerns the economy had ground to a halt in recent months. </p> <p>One investor who could see the long-term vision behind the transaction pointed out that by buying American General, the Pru was also able to put in a new management team for its entire US operation. </p> <p>Bob Salzman, who has run Jackson Life since 1994, will leave the company once the deal is completed allowing Bob Devlin, the chairman and chief executive of American General, who was paid some $5m last year - some five times more than his new boss, Mr Bloomer - to take control of the new operation. </p> <p>While British companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer have had a patchy track record with attempts to expand in the US, the consensus yesterday appeared to be that Pru has the credentials for achieving success - in the long-term at least. </p> <p>\"Pru won't crash and burn in the US. It's got an existing business there and American General is a good company,\" said one leading insurance analyst. The Pru's expansion follows attempts by other European insurers to expand in the US, most recently Dutch insurer Aegon buying the marketing arm of JC Penney, a deal dwarfed by the Pru's move yesterday. </p> <p>The deal is structured in such a way that the Pru's shareholders will end up owning 50.5% of the combined group - which will retain the Prudential name - and American General's the rest. </p> <p>Pru's shareholders will have to pay 3.6 of their shares for each American General share, which prompted some of the complaints from its shareholders yesterday that the price tag was too high. </p> <p>\"The acquisition is good in the long-term but there appears to be a view that they've overpaid,\" said Tim Rees, director of investment strategy at fund management group Clerical Medical. This suggests that the size and transatlantic nature of the transaction is likely to result in a bumpy ride for Pru shareholders. </p> <p>\"For the next six months they've left their share price in the hands of arbitrageurs,\" an insurance analyst said. </p> <p>This is because until the deal is completed, investors in London - where the main stock market listing is being retained - will be trying to gauge whether the US investors holding shares in American General decide to retain their shares in the Pru. </p> <p>One factor in this decision is the restrictions on the types of shares investors can hold in the US. Pru's shares are denominated in sterling rather than dollars and while the insurer has a listing in New York - a move which first flagged its intention to expand in the US - City analysts say this does not solve all the technical difficulties which may be encountered by US investors. </p> <p>Shares in American General, which is the second-largest publicly traded life insurer in the US, rose by more than 4% to more than $40 after the takeover was announced yesterday. Critics said this confirmed worries that the Pru was paying too much. </p> <p>By merging with American General, Pru aims to make annual cost savings - usually market-speak for job cuts - of \u00a385m a year. Most of this will be the result of combining American General with Jackson Life in the US. The head office will be in New York, eradicating the need for Jackson's headquarters in Michigan and American General's in Texas, although Mr Devlin refused to be specific about the impact on the workforce yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Devlin was more anxious to point out the opportunities for growth. The American retirement market enjoyed strong growth during the last five years of the millennium when a combination of an ageing baby boomer population and a soaring stock market encouraged more people to save. Variable annuities rose 23% a year between 1995 and 2000 for the industry as a whole. American General beat the industry average with an average growth of 35%. </p> <p>Along with Mr Bloomer, Mr Devlin will spend the next three weeks attempting to charm his shareholders into accepting the deal which could take at least six months to complete. </p> <p>In that time, if there is a temptation to speculate about spoiling counter-bids, perhaps from the likes of Allianz of Germany or Axa of France, it may be quashed by some of the small print in the complicated deal. Following the standard procedures with US deals, American General will pay \u00a3408m to the Pru if the deal fails to happen while Pru faces a \u00a3236m bill if its shareholders get cold feet.</p>",

The historic transaction, which involves Pru's shareholders paying some \u00a318bn for American General, was greeted with concern in the City. Questions were asked about the price being paid, the structure of the transaction and the timing of the deal which will create the sixth largest international insurance group in the world. Pru's shares fell by 14% to 772p, their lowest levels for two years, as the stock market arbitrageurs who often wade into major deals got to work on the discrepancies in the share prices between the Pru and American National. Their manoeuvring, coupled with anxiety about the reaction of shareholders in America, combined to help reduce the size of the transaction by some \u00a32bn as it was unveiled. It was an inauspicious start - exacerbated by the fact that the overall stock market was at its weakest levels for two years - for a deal designed to transform the Pru, once and for all, from a domestic insurance company ranked 26th biggest in the world to a player on the global stage. In one step thecompany, which already owns Jackson Life in the US, will have a greater foothold in a country where one inhabitant turns 50 every 7.5 seconds. These 4m \"baby boomers\" are a sitting audience for insurance companies, particularly ones eager to sell annuities for retirement. The deal is one of the solutions found by Jonathan Bloomer, the chief executive of the Pru who will run the combined business, to expand the insurance company at a time when pressures are being exerted on profits at home - particularly by the government's introduction of low-cost pensions - and abroad. Continuing pressure It means that 65% of Pru's earnings will come from the US, with the rest coming from Asia, where it recently bought Orico Life of Japan, and Britain, where it also owns the M&amp;G fund management group. Mr Bloomer predicted yesterday that continuing pressure on their profit margins would cause further mergers between major insurance companies. \"It's going to be uncomfortable if you're stuck in the middle ground,\" he said. He was also at pains to insist he was not building up size for the sake of it. While analysts expressed some anxiety about the way the Pru was expanding in America when the economy was slowing, Mr Bloomer insisted the two companies were a \"great fit\". This failed to calm a market that was still digesting last year's \u00a3258m bill at the Pru's US business Jackson Life. This came as a result of sweeping changes in the annuity market - an area where its new acquisition is a major player. Earlier this year, American General itself warned that profits were likely to be lower when the US stock market was falling on concerns the economy had ground to a halt in recent months. One investor who could see the long-term vision behind the transaction pointed out that by buying American General, the Pru was also able to put in a new management team for its entire US operation. Bob Salzman, who has run Jackson Life since 1994, will leave the company once the deal is completed allowing Bob Devlin, the chairman and chief executive of American General, who was paid some $5m last year - some five times more than his new boss, Mr Bloomer - to take control of the new operation. While British companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer have had a patchy track record with attempts to expand in the US, the consensus yesterday appeared to be that Pru has the credentials for achieving success - in the long-term at least. \"Pru won't crash and burn in the US. It's got an existing business there and American General is a good company,\" said one leading insurance analyst. The Pru's expansion follows attempts by other European insurers to expand in the US, most recently Dutch insurer Aegon buying the marketing arm of JC Penney, a deal dwarfed by the Pru's move yesterday. The deal is structured in such a way that the Pru's shareholders will end up owning 50.5% of the combined group - which will retain the Prudential name - and American General's the rest. Pru's shareholders will have to pay 3.6 of their shares for each American General share, which prompted some of the complaints from its shareholders yesterday that the price tag was too high. \"The acquisition is good in the long-term but there appears to be a view that they've overpaid,\" said Tim Rees, director of investment strategy at fund management group Clerical Medical. This suggests that the size and transatlantic nature of the transaction is likely to result in a bumpy ride for Pru shareholders. \"For the next six months they've left their share price in the hands of arbitrageurs,\" an insurance analyst said. This is because until the deal is completed, investors in London - where the main stock market listing is being retained - will be trying to gauge whether the US investors holding shares in American General decide to retain their shares in the Pru. One factor in this decision is the restrictions on the types of shares investors can hold in the US. Pru's shares are denominated in sterling rather than dollars and while the insurer has a listing in New York - a move which first flagged its intention to expand in the US - City analysts say this does not solve all the technical difficulties which may be encountered by US investors. Shares in American General, which is the second-largest publicly traded life insurer in the US, rose by more than 4% to more than $40 after the takeover was announced yesterday. Critics said this confirmed worries that the Pru was paying too much. By merging with American General, Pru aims to make annual cost savings - usually market-speak for job cuts - of \u00a385m a year. Most of this will be the result of combining American General with Jackson Life in the US. The head office will be in New York, eradicating the need for Jackson's headquarters in Michigan and American General's in Texas, although Mr Devlin refused to be specific about the impact on the workforce yesterday. Mr Devlin was more anxious to point out the opportunities for growth. The American retirement market enjoyed strong growth during the last five years of the millennium when a combination of an ageing baby boomer population and a soaring stock market encouraged more people to save. Variable annuities rose 23% a year between 1995 and 2000 for the industry as a whole. American General beat the industry average with an average growth of 35%. Along with Mr Bloomer, Mr Devlin will spend the next three weeks attempting to charm his shareholders into accepting the deal which could take at least six months to complete. In that time, if there is a temptation to speculate about spoiling counter-bids, perhaps from the likes of Allianz of Germany or Axa of France, it may be quashed by some of the small print in the complicated deal. Following the standard procedures with US deals, American General will pay \u00a3408m to the Pru if the deal fails to happen while Pru faces a \u00a3236m bill if its shareholders get cold feet.",
