      "body": "<p>The Chelsea fans left Dennis Wise in no doubt as to their feelings. There were cheers every time he touched the ball, and if he did anything so important as take a corner he received a standing ovation. He may have asked for a transfer after being dropped for last week's home win over Aston Villa but few here intend to let him leave without a struggle. </p> <p>Barry Fry, the Peterborough manager, had an original interpretation of Wise's recent removal from the Chelsea first team. \"He makes a great difference, and Zola's a class act,\" he said. \"When we watched them last week those two were missing; Claudio's tactics of saving his best players for us was a tremendous compliment.\" </p> <p>Wise saw things differently, of course, but if he was feeling unsettled it did not show in his performance here. Fry rated him \"the best player on the park\" and Gianfranco Zola felt likewise. \"I think Dennis is outstanding. He is the soul of this team,\" he said. \"I can't even think about him leaving. </p> <p>\"Let's put it another way: he played fantastically and hopefully he's going to play fantastically for us all season. </p> <p>\"I knew that he had a few concerns about the way we're playing, and especially his position. But we had so many injuries we were forced to play differently. </p> <p>\"Now those players are coming back so everybody is going to go back to his position. </p> <p>\"Nobody wants him to go, especially the manager. As far as I know he wants to build a team around him. He knows how important he is for the team. We love Dennis and we'll do anything we can to get him to stay.\" </p> <p>But any team built around a 34-year-old will not last long, and Claudio Ranieri has hinted of late that he is ready to promote Chelsea's more youthful talents. Five of yesterday's squad were under 23. </p> <p>Much has been made of Peterborough's youth programme over the past few seasons, and two graduates, Simon Davies and Matthew Etherington, moved to Tottenham last year, but those who remained were simply outclassed. </p> <p>Once in each half they came close to scoring, but sadly they looked close to conceding throughout the remaining 88 minutes. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day they're just too good for us, which we expected,\" said Fry. \"I don't think I can fault my lads in any way, shape or form, and they'll all be better for the experience.\" </p> <p>Mark Tyler, their impressive young goalkeeper, is unlikely to be feeling so philosophical after conceding five. But for him and some profligate finishing it would have been many more. </p> <p>Wise himself missed the best chance of the opening period, his shot deflected wide by Tyler, before Zola calmed any lingering nerves by lofting the ball over the keeper in the 37th minute. </p> <p>Chelsea's recalled captain, controlling the game from midfield, provided a perfect pass to set up the second and seal victory. </p> <p>The Posh passing improved after theinterval but they were still helpless as twice in three minutes Chelsea picked them apart down the right before scoring from centres first low then high.

      "bodyText": "The Chelsea fans left Dennis Wise in no doubt as to their feelings. There were cheers every time he touched the ball, and if he did anything so important as take a corner he received a standing ovation. He may have asked for a transfer after being dropped for last week's home win over Aston Villa but few here intend to let him leave without a struggle. Barry Fry, the Peterborough manager, had an original interpretation of Wise's recent removal from the Chelsea first team. \"He makes a great difference, and Zola's a class act,\" he said. \"When we watched them last week those two were missing; Claudio's tactics of saving his best players for us was a tremendous compliment.\" Wise saw things differently, of course, but if he was feeling unsettled it did not show in his performance here. Fry rated him \"the best player on the park\" and Gianfranco Zola felt likewise. \"I think Dennis is outstanding. He is the soul of this team,\" he said. \"I can't even think about him leaving. \"Let's put it another way: he played fantastically and hopefully he's going to play fantastically for us all season. \"I knew that he had a few concerns about the way we're playing, and especially his position. But we had so many injuries we were forced to play differently. \"Now those players are coming back so everybody is going to go back to his position. \"Nobody wants him to go, especially the manager. As far as I know he wants to build a team around him. He knows how important he is for the team. We love Dennis and we'll do anything we can to get him to stay.\" But any team built around a 34-year-old will not last long, and Claudio Ranieri has hinted of late that he is ready to promote Chelsea's more youthful talents. Five of yesterday's squad were under 23. Much has been made of Peterborough's youth programme over the past few seasons, and two graduates, Simon Davies and Matthew Etherington, moved to Tottenham last year, but those who remained were simply outclassed. Once in each half they came close to scoring, but sadly they looked close to conceding throughout the remaining 88 minutes. \"At the end of the day they're just too good for us, which we expected,\" said Fry. \"I don't think I can fault my lads in any way, shape or form, and they'll all be better for the experience.\" Mark Tyler, their impressive young goalkeeper, is unlikely to be feeling so philosophical after conceding five. But for him and some profligate finishing it would have been many more. Wise himself missed the best chance of the opening period, his shot deflected wide by Tyler, before Zola calmed any lingering nerves by lofting the ball over the keeper in the 37th minute. Chelsea's recalled captain, controlling the game from midfield, provided a perfect pass to set up the second and seal victory. The Posh passing improved after theinterval but they were still helpless as twice in three minutes Chelsea picked them apart down the right before scoring from centres first low then high. Zola's scrappy second five minutes from the end provided a familiar tinge to proceedings: Peterborough also conceded five on their only previous visit to this ground, in 1965. \u0095 Chelsea's 27-year-old defender Christian Panucci is on the verge of signing for the French champions Monaco, according to L'Equipe. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The Geordies have not lost an FA Cup tie anywhere other than Wembley for four years, although that record was endangered by Stone's close-range finish after a tepid first half.

Isn't that wonderful?\" </p> <p>Solano almost won the tie with a vicious free-kick from near the right touchline in stoppage time.

Its particular lustre shone bright this weekend, and simply to hear a few fabled names (Yeovil, Peterborough, Walsall) read out on the radio on Saturday evening stirred the romantic cockles, as did the reprise of legendary ties down the century and beyond: Carlisle v Arsenal, Newcastle v Aston Villa, Fulham v Manchester United. </p> <p>I recall as vividly as if it was last Wednesday week the last pairing's replayed semi-final at Highbury in 1958. A fellow cub reporter and I clandestinely drove the spluttering Hereford Times's Morris Minor van up to north London at dawn. It was only six weeks after the Munich air crash and as well as (a long story) being Fulham fans we seemed spiritually compelled to make pilgrimage as homage to Jimmy Murphy's makeshift United team. </p> <p>The Saturday before, the boy who had walked without a physical scratch from the snowy carnage on that German runway, Bobby Charlton, had scored twice in the 2-2 draw at Villa Park. Now in the damp afternoon murk at Highbury the replay had reached a pulsating 3-3 before Fulham's Gibraltar-born goalkeeper Tony Macedo, as athletically thrilling as he could be clownishly erratic, displayed the latter propensity for butterfingered bungling and gifted United two late goals and their rhapsodic place at Wembley. </p> <p>We drove back to Hereford through the dark in a daze of impassioned and mixed emotions, wondering occasionally whether our inebriate, heavy-handed editor, a dull Dickensian churl misnamed Mr Peacock, had rumbled that the two of us had not spent the day ferreting out a non-existent farming story in the wilds of the Brecon borders. </p> <p>I thought fondly of Macedo this Saturday. I daresay \"Flash\" Tony was the league's first \"continental\" goalkeeper. He should have played for England, but his horrors at Highbury that day meant the only thing he ever safely handled thereafter was Walter Winterbottom's \"black spot\". </p> <p>All of 43 FA Cup tournaments later, in this weekend's perennial third-round luck-of-the-draw, there was Southampton v Sheffield United, a historical match-up which only the most erudite of Cup scholars or a remaining handful of grizzled centenarians know represented a red-stripe vintage and foaming special brew. </p> <p>Sure, the two clubs had met before in the FA Cup: in the 1925 semi-final at Stamford Bridge, when the Saints' right-back Tom Parker (future Arsenal captain as well as Southampton manager) did a Macedo by missing a penalty and scoring the decisive own-goal. All of 38 years later, in 1963, the irrepressible young Terry Paine, a true league great of the century, was beginning his epic spell at the Dell by inspiring the likes of David Burnside and the two Georges, artful and opportunist wire-puller O'Brien and the direct, no-messing Kirby. That Southampton team reached the semi-finals after beating Sheffield 1-0 in the fifth round. But the legend goes back much further than that. </p> <p>In passing, I wonder how many who revelled in young Paine that day also saw this Saturday's tie? Or, come to that, if there was a single soul at Carlisle on Saturday who had witnessed the third-rounder when the Cumbrians famously held Joe Mercer's Arsenal Cup holders to a goalless draw at Highbury in 1951? </p> <p>Of course, the Blades-Saints Cup saga dates back a century. In four seasons between 1898 and 1902 United reached three finals and Southampton two. To settle who was pre-eminent, they met in the 1902 final - the \"cocks of the north\" against the monarchs of the Southern League (of which Southampton were champions six times in eight seasons to 1904). That final at Crystal Palace ended 1-1, with Sheffield winning the replay the following Saturday by 2-1. </p> <p>Before Christmas, I wrote of the happy spate of privately published sports books. I had no space to mention Hagiography Publishing, a cottage-industry company formed by five dedicated Southampton supporters (def: hagiography = biography of legendary saints). </p> <p>Their first venture, David Bull's biography of the legendary Ted Bates, Dell Diamond, went to a second edition and has sold 4,500 copies. A life of Paine is in the pipeline, and when the sumptuous Match of the Millennium (Southampton's 100 most memorable games) came out for Christmas it sold 3,000 in 11 days and is already reprinting. </p> <p>In it, naturally, that cliched and \"timeless magic of the Cup\" surfs throughout, from the days that most celebrated Saint of all, CB Fry (well, till Terry Paine, that is), marked the Blades' dashing Alf Common in the Crystal Palace final.The misnamed Common, of course, was soon to achieve immortality by becoming the first footballer to be sold for \u00a31,000.

Republicans have got to decide whether they want this process to work or whether they are going to keep on playing games.</p> <p>\"They agreed on paper last May to put their weapons beyond use so why don't they just do it? The longer they drag this out the more difficult they make it to sustain and grow support for the Good Friday agreement.\"</p> <p>Republicans, who are blaming Tony Blair for the deadlock, want a substantial security scaledown, particularly in heavily fortified south Armagh, while both Sinn Fein and the largest nationalist party, the SDLP, want a much more radical overhaul of policing than the police bill which could lead to a delay in implementing planned reforms.</p> <p>Gerry Kelly, the IRA bomber turned senior Sinn Fein politician, claimed: \"The British government is in danger of bringing about the breakdown of the institutions and the whole agreement.\"</p> <p>The SDLP policing spokesman, Alex Attwood, denied he had less room for flexibility due to heightened pre-electoral competition with Sinn Fein, but insisted his party must be able to offer young nationalists a degree of confidence in the reforms before it could take its seats on the new police board.</p> <p>He wants assurances on a number of matters, including the neutrality of the future police emblem and the flying of flags, the merger of special branch and CID, the closure of Gough barracks in Armagh, the phasing out of the full-time reserve and entry of garda officers into the new service.</p> <p>Mr Attwood is also keen to see credible, independent investigations into the murders of lawyers Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane, and Portadown Catholic Robert Hamill.</p> <p>\"We want to be able to join the police board and negotiations are far from over,\" he said. \"There are a whole series of meetings going on and progress has been made. But this issue is so central to nationalists that we need to have a credible degree of confidence before we go in, or the whole thing could unravel in months and young Catholics will then not join the new service.\"</p> <p>A senior government source denied that reforms would be put on ice if the SDLP refused to nominate representatives to the police board by the end of the month, but agreed any postponement would have practical consequences.</p> <p>The 19-strong board, of which 10 members will be politicians, is scheduled to be in place by the beginning of February, so that it can oversee the first batch of recruits in April.</p> <p>\"It is over-egging the pudding to say reforms would be shelved,\" said the source. \"However, the SDLP say they want a new police service as soon as possible but they are holding it up.\"</p> <p>Sir Reg Empey was critical of the SDLP for not backing the police bill, contrasting it with the risk Ulster Unionists took in sharing power with Sinn Fein even though they were unhappy over the lack of IRA decommissioning.</p> <p>\"The SDLP have not, as yet, had to take a difficult decision as we have done,\" he said. \"It is indefensible for them to continue to hang back.

      "bodyText": "All sides warned yesterday of the danger of the Northern Ireland political process falling apart if some consensus on demilitarisation, paramilitary decommissioning and policing is not found in the next few weeks. Hardliners within the Ulster Unionists are set to call a crucial meeting of the party's ruling council around the end of the month to try and force the leader, David Trimble, to pull out of the power-sharing Stormont government if the IRA has not made serious progress on disarmament. Sir Reg Empey, a Trimble ally on the moderate wing, warned: \"Everybody is getting sick and tired of the endless dance around the issue. Republicans have got to decide whether they want this process to work or whether they are going to keep on playing games. \"They agreed on paper last May to put their weapons beyond use so why don't they just do it? The longer they drag this out the more difficult they make it to sustain and grow support for the Good Friday agreement.\" Republicans, who are blaming Tony Blair for the deadlock, want a substantial security scaledown, particularly in heavily fortified south Armagh, while both Sinn Fein and the largest nationalist party, the SDLP, want a much more radical overhaul of policing than the police bill which could lead to a delay in implementing planned reforms. Gerry Kelly, the IRA bomber turned senior Sinn Fein politician, claimed: \"The British government is in danger of bringing about the breakdown of the institutions and the whole agreement.\" The SDLP policing spokesman, Alex Attwood, denied he had less room for flexibility due to heightened pre-electoral competition with Sinn Fein, but insisted his party must be able to offer young nationalists a degree of confidence in the reforms before it could take its seats on the new police board. He wants assurances on a number of matters, including the neutrality of the future police emblem and the flying of flags, the merger of special branch and CID, the closure of Gough barracks in Armagh, the phasing out of the full-time reserve and entry of garda officers into the new service. Mr Attwood is also keen to see credible, independent investigations into the murders of lawyers Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane, and Portadown Catholic Robert Hamill. \"We want to be able to join the police board and negotiations are far from over,\" he said. \"There are a whole series of meetings going on and progress has been made. But this issue is so central to nationalists that we need to have a credible degree of confidence before we go in, or the whole thing could unravel in months and young Catholics will then not join the new service.\" A senior government source denied that reforms would be put on ice if the SDLP refused to nominate representatives to the police board by the end of the month, but agreed any postponement would have practical consequences. The 19-strong board, of which 10 members will be politicians, is scheduled to be in place by the beginning of February, so that it can oversee the first batch of recruits in April. \"It is over-egging the pudding to say reforms would be shelved,\" said the source. \"However, the SDLP say they want a new police service as soon as possible but they are holding it up.\" Sir Reg Empey was critical of the SDLP for not backing the police bill, contrasting it with the risk Ulster Unionists took in sharing power with Sinn Fein even though they were unhappy over the lack of IRA decommissioning. \"The SDLP have not, as yet, had to take a difficult decision as we have done,\" he said. \"It is indefensible for them to continue to hang back. As Patten commission member Maurice Hayes said, 'It's better to have 90% of something than 100% of nothing'. \"They are going to have to make up their minds or the government should call a halt to the reforms. What is the point of going through torturous change if we still don't know if they will support it?\" Tensions within loyalism were also growing as the Shankill Road Ulster Freedom Fighter leader, Johnny Adair, awaited a sentence review commission decision, due tomorrow, on whether he will be let out of jail. Either way there are fears of renewed violence between Protestant paramilitaries which could spill over into attacks on Catholics. The finger was pointed at the UFF's associates, the Ulster Defence Association, for the murder of a former senior member from east Belfast, George Legge, stabbed and dumped in a field on the outskirts of the city on Saturday after an alleged row over drugs. And there were fears of a split in the Ulster Democratic Party, the political wing of the UDA/UFF, the biggest loyalist paramilitary grouping in Northern Ireland, with many of its grassroots said to have turned against the Good Friday agreement. The UDP leader, Gary McMichael, son of the murdered UDA chief John McMichael and a staunch supporter of the 1998 peace accord, said he would have to consider quitting if the party changed its policy.",

Mr Pollard, who was one of the Express's regular leader-writers, used the first letter of every paragraph to spell out the phrase \"Fuck you Desmond\".

He was offered a job on the times as a columnist and leader writer on health policy issues in early December. Mr Brock confirmed that contracts had been signed by both The Times and Mr Pollard.

      "bodyText": "The killers of toddler James Bulger this afternoon won a high court order protecting their anonymity once they are freed with new identities. Judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss rejected arguments by newspapers that press freedom and the public's \"overriding right to know\" would be imperilled. But Dame Elizabeth gave newspapers leave to appeal against her ruling to the Court of Appeal. \"I am compelled to take steps in the almost unique circumstances of this case to protect their lives and physical wellbeing,\" she said. The verdict also means that newspapers will be barred from publishing details of the two's time in detention for the next 12 months. The killer's solicitors argued that the threat of revenge attacks against Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, now both 18, necessitated an injunction barring publicity about the pair after their imminent release from secure local authority accommodation. The judge said she was \"convinced that their lives are genuinely at risk as well as their physical safety if their new identities and whereabouts became public knowledge\". James's mother, Denise Fergus, said she was \"disappointed\" with decision. \"They simply don't deserve it,\" she said. \"What right have they got to be given special protection as adults.\" \"Both Venables and Thompson have dragged me and my family and the name of James through every court possible in this country and in Europe.\" Robin Makin, solicitor for Ralph Bulger, James's father, said such protection would be unnecessary with longer custodial sentences. \"If there were adequate punishment, the furore would die down and society would feel less unhappy about the situation,\" he said. Venables and Thompson hope to win parole early this year following a ruling by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, that they have served the minimum tariff necessary under their life sentences. The pair were both aged 10 when they beat two-year-old James to death on a railway line in Liverpool in February 1993. During their time in custody as juveniles, an injunction banned the media from taking or publishing photographs of them or reporting on their progress or treatment. Summarising her judgment, the judge described how the murder of James Bulger was \"a horrific crime and the circumstances unusually shocking and distressing. It caused much public concern and a widespread feeling of moral outrage.\" She said there was massive national and international publicity at the time of the murder and during and after the trial. That coverage continued throughout the period of detention of the two boys. Injunctions restricting publicity came to an end when the boys reached 18 and their lawyers then sought to make those injunctions indefinite. \"I have decided that, taking into account the European Convention on Human Rights, the law of confidence may, in exceptional circumstances be applied to protect individuals who are seriously at risk of injury or death if their identity or whereabouts became public knowledge and that the court has jurisdiction to grant injunctions to ensure their protection,\" she said. Dame Elizabeth said information she had received from the Home Office, press reports and judicial observations had \"convinced me that these young men are uniquely notorious and are at serious risk of attacks from members of the public as well as from relatives and friends of the murdered child\". She said threats to injure and kill them had been set out in the evidence and reported in the press. \"I am satisfied that, although there has been balanced discussion in press articles in recent months, the sense of moral outrage has not diminished and there remains among some members of the public a serious desire for revenge if the two young men are living in the community. \"The Home Office views these threats very seriously and is likely to give Venables and Thompson new identities on their release from detention. \"I am therefore convinced that their lives are genuinely at risk as well as their physical safety if their new identities and whereabouts became public knowledge.\" The judge said \"certain sections of the press would not wish the two young men to remain anonymous and would wish to have them identified and, if information about them became available, there was a real possibility it would be published\".

Aston Villa are set to renew their interest in Benni McCarthy. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Nigel Spackman has been confirmed as the new manager of Barnsley. The former Sheffield United boss, who has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with the Yorkshire club, said: \"I have enjoyed my work with Sky and England, it has been good for me, but it is time to get back and get a full-time job, a proper job.\" West Ham have confirmed they are close to completing a \u00a32.25m deal for Blackburn defender Christian Dailly. \"Blackburn paid over \u00a35m for him so we are getting another bargain. I know that Craig Brown rates him highly and I am sure he can do a job for us,\" admitted Harry Redknapp. Referee Stephen Lodge has admitted he should have sent off Richard Prokas for his foul on Patrick Vieira, after viewing the TV replay. \"When I saw the camera angle on TV it certainly looked an X-rated tackle,\" he said. \"If I'd had the same view while on the pitch I would have sent the player off. I can't defend the decision I made - it's just that I had a different angle.\" Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given has handed in a transfer request. Dundee are hoping to persuade Diego Maradona to play for the club in a friendly against Napoli. Charlton have signed Blackpool goalkeeper Tony Caig on a free transfer for the rest of the season. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (1.40am) \"Back in the days when McCaff was a presenter in the Granada region, I bumped into him walking down Peter Street in Manchester towards Granada HQ,\" writes Norman Baker. Sky Sports 1: You're On Sky Sports! (10.30pm, 2am) \"It was raining heavily, I recall, but he strode proudly without coat or jacket with the rain dripping off his ample nose and chin.\" Sky Sports 2: Football League Review (5.30pm, 6.30pm SS1, 11.30pm SS1) \"He sported a large Kevin Webster moustache in those days, and though it hung limply due to the inclement conditions, it still radiated Terry Thomas-esque rogueism.\" Live FA Cup Football - Bradford v Middlesbrough (7pm, 12midnight SS1) \"We spoke briefly of United games and statistical errors but he seemed distant, subdued, even melancholy.\" Sky Sports 3: Brian Moore Interviews (11pm) \"Whether this was due to Elton Welsby's contract renewal, I can only speculate.\" British Eurosport: World Cup Football (10.15pm) \"Nevertheless, I can reveal here that he possesses the longest limbs in Britain.\" Radio 5 Live: Sport on 5 with Ian Payne (7pm) Have you spotted Alan Green registering a complaint at a customer service desk?

Try as he might - and he tried for an hour or more - the apeman Keys simply couldn't get John Benjamin to commit himself. \"I don't really know anything about English football\", insisted the Welshman. Real Sociedad fans can rest assured that he knows rather more about the game in Spain. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

He vowed to use his remaining days in the White House to narrow differences between Israel and the Palestinians, but with less than two weeks left he made no prediction of success.</p> <p>\"We've got a mess on our hands,\" the president said.</p> <p>Mr Clinton disclosed key elements of his framework for a negotiated settlement. He said it was a fair deal that \"responds to each side's essential needs if not to their utmost desires\". He said he was sending veteran US mediator Dennis Ross to the region this week to talk to Israeli and Palestinian leaders again. Mr Ross will seek their approval for an accord that would give the Palestinians a state with its capital in Jerusalem and give Israel a Jewish Jerusalem \"that is larger and more vibrant than any seen in history\". On Palestinian refugees, a key sticking point, Mr Clinton appeared to hold to his position that they should have the right to return to a Palestinian homeland - not to Israel - or to help in finding new homes, whether in the Arab countries in which they now live or elsewhere.</p> <p>Israel cannot be expected to take in an unlimited number of refugees and thereby \"undermine\" its purpose in being, he said.</p> <p>The president said the incoming Bush administration was not bound by his proposals. \"These parameters originated with me and will go with me when I leave office,\" he said.</p> <p>Addressing the people of Israel before a largely Jewish audience, Mr Clinton said \"you have hardly had one day of peace and quiet since your state was created.\"</p> <p>He said \"your dream of a homeland has come true,\" but when the Jewish people started to return home a century ago, they found \"it was not vacant.

      "bodyText": "Palestinian negotiators have rejected a Middle East peace plan put forward by US President Bill Clinton last night. Meanwhile, as another Palestinian was killed in new violence in the Gaza Strip, thousands of Israelis gathered around the walls of Jerusalem. As night fell, roads into the city were still crowded with heavy traffic, and organisers suggested that they expected up to 150,000 people to join the event, which has been organised to protest against President Clinton's suggestions for the future of the city. The protesters are demanding that Jerusalem must stay under Israeli rule. Both events saw Mr Clinton's hopes for peace recede even further. \"We can't accept Clinton's ideas as a basis for future negotiations or a future settlement. Clinton didn't take (Palestinian leader, Yasser) Arafat's reservations into account, and these ideas don't offer our people their legitimate rights,\" stated senior Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Korei. Another member of the negotiation team, Hassan Asfour, said that Mr Clinton had failed in his efforts to achieve a final peace because his peace team had been influenced by Israeli positions that the Palestinians rejected. Mr Clinton had outlined his plans for an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in a speech to the Israeli Policy Forum in New York, saying that it would \"entail real pain and sacrifices for both sides\". Making a final bid to secure a deal before he leaves office on January 20, he told the people of Israel that their land was also the Palestinians' homeland and \"there is no choice but for you to divide this land into two states for two people\". Mr Clinton also urged the Palestinians to find the courage to accept his framework for a negotiated settlement and \"not hold out for the impossible more\". He vowed to use his remaining days in the White House to narrow differences between Israel and the Palestinians, but with less than two weeks left he made no prediction of success. \"We've got a mess on our hands,\" the president said.

Israel cannot be expected to take in an unlimited number of refugees and thereby \"undermine\" its purpose in being, he said. The president said the incoming Bush administration was not bound by his proposals. \"These parameters originated with me and will go with me when I leave office,\" he said. Addressing the people of Israel before a largely Jewish audience, Mr Clinton said \"you have hardly had one day of peace and quiet since your state was created.\" He said \"your dream of a homeland has come true,\" but when the Jewish people started to return home a century ago, they found \"it was not vacant. You discovered that your land was also their land, the homeland of two peoples. \"The hard reality is that there is no choice but for you to divide this land into two states for two people. \"Whether it happens today or after more bloodshed, it will happen.\" Mr Clinton, who has made the search for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians his highest foreign policy priority, said: \"Sometimes you just have to do the right thing. Sometimes it works out; sometimes it does not.\" Mr Clinton praised Mr Barak, whose concessions to the Palestinians have left him trailing in the polls to Ariel Sharon, the rightwing Likud party leader, ahead of Israel's February 6 election for prime minister. \"He has demonstrated as much bravery in the office of prime minister as he ever did on the field of battle,\" Mr Clinton said in tribute to the former Israeli military chief of staff. At this late date, Mr Clinton said, \"the fundamental question remains: can two people who have gone through this kind of violence still conclude a genuine and lasting peace? I believe with all my heart not only that they can, but that they must.\" Alluding to the bloodshed that has gripped the region for months, he said \"the alternative to peace is being played out before our very eyes; the only consequence of further delay will be greater loss in blood and tears.\" Both sides have already indicated conditional acceptance of his proposals, but bridging the differences presents a formidable challenge. Mr Arafat is challenging Mr Clinton's omission of the right of nearly 4m Palestinian refugees to return to former homes in Israel left behind at the founding of the Jewish state in 1948. Mr Barak wants to limit the control over parts of East Jerusalem that he already has offered the Palestinians. Before Mr Clinton spoke, a senior US official said the administration was not optimistic of reaching a final deal before George W Bush becomes president in less than two weeks. \"But we hope to continue to narrow the gap and move them closer together on a foundation on which they can build,\" the official added. Mr Ross, expected to go to the Middle East on Tuesday, intends to hold separate talks with Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss \"what is possible and advisable to do in the next 14 days,\" the official said. Palestinian security officials said Israeli troops had shot dead a 32-year-old man, Abdel Hamed al-Kharati, as he walked along a road near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza. At least 303 Palestinians, 13 Israeli Arabs and 43 other Israelis have been killed since a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began in late September. An Israeli official said Kharati had approached Israeli forces in the dead of night with a suspicious pack on his back on a road where Israeli troops have been attacked in the past. The soldiers had opened fire, the official said. Yesterday a Palestinian woman was shot dead in the West Bank, witnesses said. Twenty-year-old Fatma Abu Jeifh was driving along a road east of the town of Nablus when she was hit by a bullet fired from a nearby hill manned by Israeli soldiers, her cousin said. The Israeli army denied the Palestinian account and said there had been an exchange of fire in the area at the time.

      "bodyText": "A decision is expected tomorrow on the future of jailed loyalist Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair. Secretary of State Peter Mandelson and Northern Ireland security chiefs fear that his release could heighten tensions on the streets of Belfast, where seven men were shot dead in a bitter loyalist feud last year. The Northern Ireland sentence review commission said that it still had to consider all the evidence presented to it. \"At this stage in the process, the commissioners believe it will be early tomorrow rather than late today when it (a decision) will come,\" a spokesman said. Adiar, the Ulster Freedom Fighters lower Shankill commander, was granted early release in September 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement after serving less than a third of a 16-year sentence for directing terrorism. But he was sent back to prison last August after Mr Mandelson revoked his release on the basis of high-grade security evidence that pointed to Adair fuelling tensions in the loyalist feud. The commissioners spent two days last week hearing submissions from lawyers for the Northern Ireland Office, Royal Ulster Constabulary chief constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan and other senior police officers who are opposed to Adair's release. Adair's legal representatives made no fresh submissions, claiming that a preliminary decision by the commission to free him meant the onus was on the Northern Ireland office. It is now up to the three-man body to assess the last of the evidence before reaching its decision, although either side is then free to mount a legal challenge. \"This is a process where you don't know how big the job is until it's finished,\" the commission spokesman added. \"They are continuing to work. They worked throughout the weekend on the amount of information, which is considerable.\" Related stories 1 January: Feud fear if loyalist leader is released 22 August, 2000: 'Mad dog' turf war threatens Ulster peace Roy Greenslade: Mad dog has them foaming Profile 23 August, 2000: Mad dog and Irishmen Useful links Adair biography from loyalist site Northern Ireland Office the RUC Belfast Telegraph Irish Times",

She added: \"We should be putting more resources into the prevention and monitoring of child abuse rather than historical investigations.\" Her comments came after the Independent disclosed there are nearly 100 large-scale ongoing police inquiries into allegations of sexual and physical abuse believed to involve about 2,500 children at more than 500 residential and care homes. The newspaper's report said investigations are being carried out by nearly three-quarters of police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Tony Butler, chief constable of Gloucestershire and a spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the report reflected the scale of inquiries, although the details were 18 months old.

Breathe.com invested heavily in both technology and marketing and offered a range of wireless services. Breathe took \u00a320m in venture capital in February 2000, and spent millions on a high profile television advertising campaign in a bid to boost subscriber numbers and offer an alternative to companies such as Freeserve, Yahoo and AOL. However, as an early adopter of unmetered internet access, Breathe suffered from high costs: thousands of users, dubbed \"heavy breathers\", remained permanently connected to the ISP. GUS is acquiring a reputation as a bargain hunter among ailing dotcoms. Last September the group acquired loss-making computer e-tailer Jungle.com for \u00a337m, after the company failed to go public. Earlier in the year valuations of as high as \u00a3700m were being associated with the company. Breathe.com's technology is to be used by GUS subsidiary Reality, an e-commerce consultancy the company acquired in May.",

      "byline": "Jonathan Glancey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Mention the word \"Switzerland\" and some people will still chortle about cuckoo clocks, dodgy banks and army penknives. Over the past two decades, however, Switzerland has reinvented at least one aspect of its culture: Swiss architecture is now among the finest in the world, possibly even better than Spain's. </p> <p>Each time Peter Zumthor completes one of his rare and exquisitely crafted new buildings - the Sogn Benedetg chapel in Sumvitg (1988), the residential home for the elderly in Masans (1993) and the thermal baths in Vals (1996) - I have made a pilgrimage to the land of Heidi and William Tell. </p> <p>It is extremely uncommon to find such inventive modern architecture so beautifully built and in such exquisite settings. Yet Zumthor, a cabinet-maker turned interior designer then architect, is not alone. Switzerland has produced several of the world's most original and respected architects in recent years, including Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron (best known outside their homeland for Tate Modern and the exquisite Dominus Winery in California's Napa Valley) and Mario Botta, who was, for a brief while, an assistant of the great Swiss architect Le Corbusier. </p> <p>Their designs are included in the latest pocket-sized architectural guidebook from Ellipsis, written by Thomas Hildebrand and Maya Huber. Don't be put off by the blurb that says that the book, called simply Switzerland, \"will appeal to aficionados of the Neue Einfachheit and the Tendenza as well as to the accidental tourist with a penchant for architecture\". The grand tour of modern Swiss architecture can be taken safely at home with this excellent guide, as well as by trains and buses that never run late and seem like a dream to us poor Brits, who invented the railway but still can't make it run on time. </p> <p>Because they love their railways, the Swiss employ their best architects to design their infrastructure. There's Herzog &amp; de Meuron's striking, copper-clad signal box at Auf dem Wolf, Basel (1995), for example - an intriguing monolithic structure that catches and refracts every change of light and weather. The same firm has recently completed a second signal box outside Basel's main station, M\u00fcnchensteinerbr\u00fccke. </p> <p>The way these architects marry a substantial, crafted architecture to the sensual and ethereal is both surprising and delightful. Their buildings represent, at one level, an attempt to prove that today's architects can readily rival and outmatch the cyberspace fantasies so popular throughout the rest of the world. \"If architecture wants to play a significant role in the future,\" Herzog tells Huber and Hildebrand, \"it has to rely on its own qualities; it needs to exploit fully its own potential. What we have is the opportunity to work with mass, with solid and heavy elements, not just with flighty images.\" </p> <p>Not that they can't create flighty images: by night Herzog &amp; de Meuron's crystalline factory for Ricola-Europe at Mulhouse-Brunstatt (the other side of the Swiss-French border) changes, to use Herzog's words, \"like the surface of water\". </p> <p>By day it has the heroic, sculptural quality of so much Swiss architecture. Maybe this derives from the magnificent, and highly functional farmhouses, notably of the Bernese, that stand like isolated monuments in the landscape, each a fortress, rural factory and home, each beautifully built. </p> <p>I remember thinking about these structures when visiting Zumthor's boat-shaped Benedictine chapel. I was pleased to read this quote from the architect in Huber and Hildebrand's guide: \"To me the presence of a certain building has something secret about it. They seem simply to be here. We do not pay any special attention to them. And yet it is virtually impossible to imagine the place where they stand without them. These buildings appear to be anchored firmly in the ground. They create an impression of being a self-evident part of their surroundings.\" As with Bernese farmhouses, so with Zumthor's hand-wrought chapel. </p> <p>If you're lucky enough to travel to Switzerland, try to take in Zurich for two railway stations - the Hauptbahnhof (remodelled by Meili, Peter, Fickert and Knapkiewicz, 1997) and Stadelhofen (bravura architecture and engineering by Santiago Calatrava, 1990) - as well as Chur for the fantastic, filigree roof of its bus and railway station (Brosi and Obrist, 1992) . But above all you must visit the canton of Ticino, home of Mario Botta and some of the world's most distinctive new architecture. </p> <p>I long to visit the museum, in the medieval town of Giornico, known as La Congiunta (The Marriage), a union between the sculpture of Hans Josephson and the architecture of Peter Markli (1992). This is an utterly uncompromised building with no heating, artificial lighting or flooring. All there is, is the relationship between a sentinel-like architecture composed of severe concrete blocks, daylight, and the sculptures themselves. There are no curators to keep a beady eye on visitors, who must get the key from the local hosteria, 10 minutes away along a Roman road. </p> <p>This is as good an introduction as any to Ticinese architecture, which is essentially a high game of Platonic forms realised in the most solid local and modern materials set among daunting mountains. Here is Botta's highly regimented headquarters for Swisscom at Bellinzola (1998), here his striped chapel of St John the Baptist at Mogno (1996), built to replace its 17th century predecessor, destroyed by an avalanche. When you see its setting, the words \"borrowed time\" spring to mind. </p> <p>Most dramatic of all is the chapel on Monte Tamaro that Botta has designed for the owner of the mountain's cable-car company, in memory of his wife. The stone-clad structure extends as if infinitely along a belvedere into the mountains beyond. Walking alone here, as the cold highland air thins into an ethereal whiteness, one can imagine coming face-to-face with God. If you are tempted to believe that modern architecture is unable to achieve the sacredness of medieval cathedrals, take the train to Rivera and the cable-car up Monte Tamaro. </p> <p>Ticino offers the most recognisable and homogeneous modern Swiss architecture, yet the sculptural solidity of its buildings is matched throughout the country even in utterly unexpected parts. I must go and see the service buildings that accompany the heroic new, 67km-long Transjurane road from Delemont to Porrentruy (architects Flora Ruchat-Roncati and Renato Salvi). These include intriguing zoomorphic bridgeheads and ventilation shafts, the latter emerging in fields of grazing cows, while cars and trucks growl deep below them. </p> <p>Switzerland has started to use its wealth intelligently, at least as far as infrastructure goes. Maybe, as Orson Welles said in The Third Man, it had little to offer the rest of Europe for 500 years, but that has begun to change. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Switzerland is published by Ellipsis, price \u00a310.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mention the word \"Switzerland\" and some people will still chortle about cuckoo clocks, dodgy banks and army penknives. Over the past two decades, however, Switzerland has reinvented at least one aspect of its culture: Swiss architecture is now among the finest in the world, possibly even better than Spain's. Each time Peter Zumthor completes one of his rare and exquisitely crafted new buildings - the Sogn Benedetg chapel in Sumvitg (1988), the residential home for the elderly in Masans (1993) and the thermal baths in Vals (1996) - I have made a pilgrimage to the land of Heidi and William Tell. It is extremely uncommon to find such inventive modern architecture so beautifully built and in such exquisite settings. Yet Zumthor, a cabinet-maker turned interior designer then architect, is not alone. Switzerland has produced several of the world's most original and respected architects in recent years, including Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron (best known outside their homeland for Tate Modern and the exquisite Dominus Winery in California's Napa Valley) and Mario Botta, who was, for a brief while, an assistant of the great Swiss architect Le Corbusier. Their designs are included in the latest pocket-sized architectural guidebook from Ellipsis, written by Thomas Hildebrand and Maya Huber. Don't be put off by the blurb that says that the book, called simply Switzerland, \"will appeal to aficionados of the Neue Einfachheit and the Tendenza as well as to the accidental tourist with a penchant for architecture\". The grand tour of modern Swiss architecture can be taken safely at home with this excellent guide, as well as by trains and buses that never run late and seem like a dream to us poor Brits, who invented the railway but still can't make it run on time. Because they love their railways, the Swiss employ their best architects to design their infrastructure. There's Herzog &amp; de Meuron's striking, copper-clad signal box at Auf dem Wolf, Basel (1995), for example - an intriguing monolithic structure that catches and refracts every change of light and weather. The same firm has recently completed a second signal box outside Basel's main station, M\u00fcnchensteinerbr\u00fccke. The way these architects marry a substantial, crafted architecture to the sensual and ethereal is both surprising and delightful. Their buildings represent, at one level, an attempt to prove that today's architects can readily rival and outmatch the cyberspace fantasies so popular throughout the rest of the world. \"If architecture wants to play a significant role in the future,\" Herzog tells Huber and Hildebrand, \"it has to rely on its own qualities; it needs to exploit fully its own potential. What we have is the opportunity to work with mass, with solid and heavy elements, not just with flighty images.\" Not that they can't create flighty images: by night Herzog &amp; de Meuron's crystalline factory for Ricola-Europe at Mulhouse-Brunstatt (the other side of the Swiss-French border) changes, to use Herzog's words, \"like the surface of water\". By day it has the heroic, sculptural quality of so much Swiss architecture. Maybe this derives from the magnificent, and highly functional farmhouses, notably of the Bernese, that stand like isolated monuments in the landscape, each a fortress, rural factory and home, each beautifully built. I remember thinking about these structures when visiting Zumthor's boat-shaped Benedictine chapel. I was pleased to read this quote from the architect in Huber and Hildebrand's guide: \"To me the presence of a certain building has something secret about it. They seem simply to be here. We do not pay any special attention to them. And yet it is virtually impossible to imagine the place where they stand without them. These buildings appear to be anchored firmly in the ground. They create an impression of being a self-evident part of their surroundings.\" As with Bernese farmhouses, so with Zumthor's hand-wrought chapel. If you're lucky enough to travel to Switzerland, try to take in Zurich for two railway stations - the Hauptbahnhof (remodelled by Meili, Peter, Fickert and Knapkiewicz, 1997) and Stadelhofen (bravura architecture and engineering by Santiago Calatrava, 1990) - as well as Chur for the fantastic, filigree roof of its bus and railway station (Brosi and Obrist, 1992) . But above all you must visit the canton of Ticino, home of Mario Botta and some of the world's most distinctive new architecture. I long to visit the museum, in the medieval town of Giornico, known as La Congiunta (The Marriage), a union between the sculpture of Hans Josephson and the architecture of Peter Markli (1992). This is an utterly uncompromised building with no heating, artificial lighting or flooring. All there is, is the relationship between a sentinel-like architecture composed of severe concrete blocks, daylight, and the sculptures themselves. There are no curators to keep a beady eye on visitors, who must get the key from the local hosteria, 10 minutes away along a Roman road. This is as good an introduction as any to Ticinese architecture, which is essentially a high game of Platonic forms realised in the most solid local and modern materials set among daunting mountains. Here is Botta's highly regimented headquarters for Swisscom at Bellinzola (1998), here his striped chapel of St John the Baptist at Mogno (1996), built to replace its 17th century predecessor, destroyed by an avalanche. When you see its setting, the words \"borrowed time\" spring to mind. Most dramatic of all is the chapel on Monte Tamaro that Botta has designed for the owner of the mountain's cable-car company, in memory of his wife. The stone-clad structure extends as if infinitely along a belvedere into the mountains beyond. Walking alone here, as the cold highland air thins into an ethereal whiteness, one can imagine coming face-to-face with God. If you are tempted to believe that modern architecture is unable to achieve the sacredness of medieval cathedrals, take the train to Rivera and the cable-car up Monte Tamaro. Ticino offers the most recognisable and homogeneous modern Swiss architecture, yet the sculptural solidity of its buildings is matched throughout the country even in utterly unexpected parts. I must go and see the service buildings that accompany the heroic new, 67km-long Transjurane road from Delemont to Porrentruy (architects Flora Ruchat-Roncati and Renato Salvi). These include intriguing zoomorphic bridgeheads and ventilation shafts, the latter emerging in fields of grazing cows, while cars and trucks growl deep below them. Switzerland has started to use its wealth intelligently, at least as far as infrastructure goes. Maybe, as Orson Welles said in The Third Man, it had little to offer the rest of Europe for 500 years, but that has begun to change. \u00b7 Switzerland is published by Ellipsis, price \u00a310.",

Venables and Thompson hope to win parole early this year following a ruling by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, that they have served the minimum tariff necessary under their life sentences. The pair were both aged 10 when they beat two-year-old James to death on a railway line in Liverpool in February 1993. During their time in custody as juveniles, an injunction banned the media from taking or publishing photographs of them or reporting on their progress or treatment. Summarising her judgment, the judge described how the murder of James Bulger was \"a horrific crime and the circumstances unusually shocking and distressing. It caused much public concern and a widespread feeling of moral outrage.\" She said there was massive national and international publicity at the time of the murder and during and after the trial. That coverage continued throughout the period of detention of the two boys. Injunctions restricting publicity came to an end when the boys reached 18 and their lawyers then sought to make those injunctions indefinite. \"I have decided that, taking into account the European Convention on Human Rights, the law of confidence may, in exceptional circumstances be applied to protect individuals who are seriously at risk of injury or death if their identity or whereabouts became public knowledge and that the court has jurisdiction to grant injunctions to ensure their protection,\" she said. Dame Elizabeth said information she had received from the Home Office, press reports and judicial observations had \"convinced me that these young men are uniquely notorious and are at serious risk of attacks from members of the public as well as from relatives and friends of the murdered child\". She said threats to injure and kill them had been set out in the evidence and reported in the press. \"I am satisfied that, although there has been balanced discussion in press articles in recent months, the sense of moral outrage has not diminished and there remains among some members of the public a serious desire for revenge if the two young men are living in the community. \"The Home Office views these threats very seriously and is likely to give Venables and Thompson new identities on their release from detention. \"I am therefore convinced that their lives are genuinely at risk as well as their physical safety if their new identities and whereabouts became public knowledge.\" The judge said \"certain sections of the press would not wish the two young men to remain anonymous and would wish to have them identified and, if information about them became available, there was a real possibility it would be published\". The Guardian was not among media organisations contesting the case.",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence was coming under increasing pressure last night to screen British troops who served in the Balkans and the Gulf war for signs of contamination by depleted uranium used in anti-tank weapons. With Nato officials preparing to face up to growing concern across Europe about the weapons linked to a spate of leukaemia cases among Balkans veterans, Britain and the US, the only two countries to use the shells, are increasingly isolated in their defence. Switzerland yesterday joined France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, and Finland in setting up screening programmes for soldiers who have served in the Balkans. Official assurances and the lack of hard evidence have failed to dampen public concern among veterans - echoed by the European commission and the UN - about the safety of the weapons. Senior officials will meet in Nato headquarters in Brussels tomorrow to consider how to respond to pressure on governments faced with evidence linking DU shells with cancer. The EU has announced an inquiry into the health risks of the shells. The Ministry of Defence insisted that ranges in Eskmeals, Cumbria, and the Solway Firth in Scotland, where DU shells were used, were monitored by the health and safety executive. It could not comment on reports they had also been fired at the army's ranges at Lulworth, Dorset. Though the ministry acknowledges that toxic dust from the shells is harmful if inhaled or ingested in large quantities, a spokesman said it did not believe the shells posed \"any significant health risk\". The MoD has asked for an independent study by the Royal Society, which is to report in the spring. However, it has no plans to screen veterans, the spokesman said. The ministry's stand has not been helped by its failure to warn troops before the Gulf war of the risks of DU in shells used by US AI0 \"tankbusters\" and British Chieftain tanks. The Labour MP Paul Flynn yesterday showed the Guardian a letter he received in 1993 from Jeremy Hanley, then a Foreign Office minister, who explained that the omission was due \"to the urgency attached to bringing into service such a critical capability which at the start of the crisis was still under development\". Mr Flynn, who was also told in 1993 that DU shells had been used in West Freugh, Scotland, and Foulness in Essex, criticised the MoD for contaminating large areas with radioactive dust - what he called \"an unknown hazard with unknown remedies\". Terry Gooding, a Gulf war veteran, described the MoD's refusal to screen for DU contamination as \"disgusting\". He has a war pension for what the MoD describes as \"unspecified and ill-defined\" illnesses. American A10 aircraft fired more than 30,000 rounds of DU shells in Kosovo and more than 10,000 in Bosnia, mainly around Sarajevo. The Commons defence committee is to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to summon ministers to explain the government's policy. \"If it is shown that depleted uranium causes an increase in cancers, then we have got to look at alternative weapon systems and at precautions which could be taken to protect our troops, as well as at how we can clean up the areas where the shells were used,\" said Bruce George, the committee chairman. He said no repeat should be permitted of the MoD foot-dragging over Gulf war syndrome in the 1990s, which saw ex-servicemen battling for years to convince ministers that their illness was real.",

But it can only be possible if, as a society, we decide that compassion, rehabilitation and hope are more important to us than keeping the rage and fury directed at two lads who themselves were victims of hideous childhoods and who then acted out their distorted and disturbed feelings in their dreadful act. Predictably as the question of the killers' release is raised the populist press steps in with its simplistic relentlessly unforgiving approach, urging us to think of little James's suffering and that of his parents and never to forget that Thompson and Venables are evil incarnate. Except that all the evidence is they are not, that they have been successfully rehabilitated in a way I have seen is possible, having spent the last year visiting youth jails as research for a book on young offenders, and that they feel remorse, want to pay their price to society by living decent, productive lives. Of course if the rewards of keeping this desperately sad tale of three victimised children ever alive, our emotional batteries charged up with rage and hatred, are what we want then we should tattoo their names on their foreheads, erect neon signs saying where they live and tacitly support anyone who vents their feelings on them while celebrating the way we have maintained the tradition of the medieval witch hunt. But surely a nation that prides itself on concern for children can do better than than clinging to cheap notions of original sin and innate evil. Wouldn't it be so much better to direct our energies to doing something about the far too many children living with the kind of severe deprivation, emotional neglect, lack of nurture the Bulger killers endured - conditions which are known risk factors for delinquency and violence - and campaign for more to be done? That way we might just prevent another Bulger death rather than ensuring that his memory is enshrined in the wrecked lives of Venables and Thompson. Talk about it What do you think?

Judge Ann Goddard, 64, was taken to hospital, after a man who is accused of killing his partner with a sword leaped out of the dock and punched her. He struck several punches before barristers, police and court officials grabbed him. An immediate inquiry will be held into the incident - including a review of security at Britain's premier court. Some lawyers have privately expressed concern over security for some time, as numbers of court officials and attendants have been reduced, and one commented today: \"This attack was waiting to happen.\" The bar council, which represents barristers, said that the attack should put an end to any debate about whether judges' lodgings, which are relatively expensive to run, should be scrapped in favour of hotels. A spokesman said: \"This was an appalling attack which emphasises the real risks that all judges run for society. \"There has been a debate about the need to have special accommodation for judges. We think that this shows that there is no case for making judges stay in hotels or other accommodation.\" Judge Goddard has been a familiar figure at the Old Bailey for a number of years - both on the bench and, earlier, as a barrister. She is among senior Old Bailey judges tipped to succeed the common serjeant of London, Neil Denison, when he retires this year. Judge Goddard was called to the Bar, Gray's Inn, in 1960, and was made a recorder 19 years later. She has been a circuit judge since 1993. The judge had just adjourned the case so that the man could consult with his legal representatives. He is accused of killing his female partner by striking her 44 times, and faces charges of murder or manslaughter. The first person to reach the judge, Detective Constable John Nicholson, jumped on to the bench and started struggling with the man as he was hitting out at Judge Goddard. A police officer in court said: \"The defendant was sitting in the dock during the 10-minute hearing. There were five male security officers with him. \"He suddenly vaulted over the dock and grabbed a jug of water from the jury bench. He threw it 10 feet towards the judge - but luckily it missed her and it smashed against the back wall. \"Everyone thought he was trying to escape and blocked off the exits - but instead, he ran down the side of the court and on to the platform where the judge sits. \"He punched her and I think there were five or six other punches which connected as we grabbed him and were trying to pull him away.\" The officer said: \"It was a great shock to everyone. It took us by surprise.\" He added: \"We don't know what set the man off. The judge had a gash to her left temple. It was about one-and-a-half inches long and would probably need stitches.\" The man, who is in his early 30s and from east London, was later remanded, in his absence, in custody to Belmarsh Prison until Friday by another judge. Judge Goddard was treated for minor head injuries and shock, said a Lord Chancellor's Office spokesman. A respected senior judge with a reputation as a tough criminal lawyer, Judge Goddard was at the centre of a controversy in 1996 when she allowed a rapist to cross-examine his victim for six days. She drew criticism for allowing Ralston Edwards to put Julia Mason through the witness box ordeal, in which he forced her to go into intimate details for several days. Edwards was convicted and given life in prison. Barristers defended Judge Goddard's decision at the time, saying that the case would have been overturned on appeal had she not allowed him to put his questions. Ms Mason waived her right to anonymity so that she could launch a campaign to change the law. Her high-profile case prompted a debate that led to a change in the law last year to prevent alleged rapists from putting their accusers through such an ordeal.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>More than half of all British schoolchildren have been bullied, a report will reveal this week. Their torment is so severe many victims told researchers it had driven them to attempt suicide. </p> <p>In one of the most detailed studies of the extent of bullying, 7,000 pupils were questioned by the charity Young Voices and Oxford University. </p> <p>The evidence of the children, aged between 13 and 19, from rural and inner-city schools, is alarming. One in 10 reported severe bullying, including physical violence. Many felt they could not tell anyone what was happening to them as their treatment by other children had sent them into a spiral of depression and misery. </p> <p>Many went on to become bullies themselves in a desperate attempt to cope with feelings of powerlessness. </p> <p>\"I hated myself. I felt there must be something I'd done wrong or terrible for this to happen. I felt ashamed,\" said one 14-year-old girl. </p> <p>Adrienne Katz, of Young Voices, told the Observer: \"It's time we listened to what kids are telling us. A glossy brochure sent to the headteacher is not going to help, nor is removing the bully from the class so that you just displace the bullying from the playground to the bus stop. </p> <p>\"Children are telling us that half of schools still do not have an anti-bullying policy and of those who do only half again seem to be effective.\" </p> <p>The study found that home life plays a vital part in determining whether a child will be a bully or a victim. \"For both the victims and the bullies, parenting was markedly less positive, colder and more controlling. Bullies were far more likely to see aggression at home,\" said Ms Katz. </p> <p>Children were far less likely to be bullied if they lived with both parents. Severely bullied boys reported not having a supportive parent and were highly likely to have an absent or unsupportive father. </p> <p>Of the bullied girls, 79% felt anxious about one parent, and were more likely to say they planned to bring up their own children very differently from the way they were being raised. </p> <p>Racism seems to be a factor.

      "bodyText": "More than half of all British schoolchildren have been bullied, a report will reveal this week. Their torment is so severe many victims told researchers it had driven them to attempt suicide. In one of the most detailed studies of the extent of bullying, 7,000 pupils were questioned by the charity Young Voices and Oxford University. The evidence of the children, aged between 13 and 19, from rural and inner-city schools, is alarming. One in 10 reported severe bullying, including physical violence. Many felt they could not tell anyone what was happening to them as their treatment by other children had sent them into a spiral of depression and misery. Many went on to become bullies themselves in a desperate attempt to cope with feelings of powerlessness. \"I hated myself. I felt there must be something I'd done wrong or terrible for this to happen. I felt ashamed,\" said one 14-year-old girl. Adrienne Katz, of Young Voices, told the Observer: \"It's time we listened to what kids are telling us. A glossy brochure sent to the headteacher is not going to help, nor is removing the bully from the class so that you just displace the bullying from the playground to the bus stop. \"Children are telling us that half of schools still do not have an anti-bullying policy and of those who do only half again seem to be effective.\" The study found that home life plays a vital part in determining whether a child will be a bully or a victim. \"For both the victims and the bullies, parenting was markedly less positive, colder and more controlling. Bullies were far more likely to see aggression at home,\" said Ms Katz. Children were far less likely to be bullied if they lived with both parents. Severely bullied boys reported not having a supportive parent and were highly likely to have an absent or unsupportive father. Of the bullied girls, 79% felt anxious about one parent, and were more likely to say they planned to bring up their own children very differently from the way they were being raised. Racism seems to be a factor. A quarter of children from ethnic minorities reported being severely bullied, as opposed to 13% of white pupils. \"There are factors which protect children: being bolder and having high self-esteem and positive, warm parenting is overwhelmingly linked to those who are not being bullied,\" said Ms Katz. Last year Ian Rivers, of the College of Ripon and York St John, interviewed 190 lesbian and homosexual young adults who were bullied at school and discovered that in later life one in six of them suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, including nightmares and flashbacks, and used drugs to help to get through the day. Bullying in childhood has also been linked to problems in adulthood such as alcohol abuse, violence against children, marital breakdowns and psychiatric disorders. A 12-year-old bully is three times as likely as other pupils to have a criminal conviction by the age of 24. Bullying is taking new forms. With one in four children now owning mobile phones, harassment is conducted by phone and email. \"They send sick messages to your mobile,\" one girl said. It was a campaign of torment by text messaging and silent calls that drove Gail Jones to take an overdose at her Merseyside home last year, her father Glyn believes. She was 15. Suicide among adolescents has risen in the past decade, and now attempts among under-14s seem to be going up too. According to Professor Keith Hawton of the Centre for Suicide Research in Oxford, girls largely account for the increase in non-fatal overdoses and self-inflicted injuries. They outnumber boys by at least six to one. In most cases, children are sending out the simple message: \"I feel so bad I could die.\" Psychologists, who previously thought the concept of death was understood by an individual at puberty, now believe it can develop far earlier in stressed children, at around seven or eight. Kelly Yeomans, 13, took an overdose of her mother's painkillers in 1997 to end an 18-month bullying campaign against her. \"We keep going over the same question: 'Why didn't she tell somebody?'\" her mother Julie said then. Only months later 15-year-old choirboy Darren Steele's mother asked the same question when her son hanged himself just weeks away from sitting his GCSEs. In 1996 two schoolgirls were jailed, branded by the judge \"contemptible and cowardly\", after the overdose death of 16-year-old Scots schoolgirl Katherine Jane Morrison. One of the most heart-rending cases was that of the 13-year-old Manchester schoolboy Vijay Singh whose parents found the following entries in his diary in 1997: \"Monday: My money was taken.

There are gloomy predictions about falling advertising volumes and revenue. Last time this happened, local weekly frees suffered badly and many were killed off. </p> <p>So why is Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, willing to expand its unprofitable paper? There appear to be a number of overlapping reasons. The company is certainly wealthy enough to afford the risk. Not that it is much of a risk anyway, given that the cost base is relatively low and the costs are, to an extent, controllable. </p> <p>Having come so far since the launch of the first Metro in London in March, Associated certainly doesn't want to give any rival the chance to supplant it. </p> <p>It stole a march on the continental inventors of the concept, Sweden's Modern Times group, by its initial negotiation of an exclusive contract with London underground and, in company with its partners, Trinity-Mirror, it has just forced the Swedes to retire hurt from Newcastle. </p> <p>Associated is well aware of News International's close monitoring of the venture and knows that Rupert Murdoch is the one owner capable of making a swift intervention if it shows any sign of weakness. </p> <p>So the Metros of London, Birmingham, central Scotland, Newcastle and Manchester (where the paper is entitled News North West) appear to have a firm future. Almost 800,000 are distributed at train and bus stations daily. The Yorkshire Metro, a partnership between Associated and Regional Independent Media, will add a further 55,000 from tomorrow, growing in March to 75,000. </p> <p>To put that total in perspective, in strict circulation terms, it places Metro as the sixth largest national morning paper, above the Times and not far behind the Daily Express. </p> <p>Associated has used formidable muscle to protect and enhance its venture, not least in Manchester where it has lost four court battles with its main competitor, Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Manchester Evening News and the Guardian. </p> <p>GMG has not only protected its hold on its own Metro title, it is competing directly with Associated's News North West, which gives away some 120,000 copies, by distributing 80,000 Manchester Metros at bins in bus stations and through local bus companies. Associated is forced to spend money employing people to give out copies at traffic lights. </p> <p>Mike Anderson, Metro's managing director, refuses to make any comment on this bitter newspaper war, or indeed any matter involving his paper. He is doubtless regretting his recent TV and radio interviews in which he launched an intemperate attack on the Manchester Evening News. </p> <p>Last June, Associated even threatened to launch a free evening paper in Manchester, though a recent report that this might happen soon was swiftly discounted. </p> <p>It would appear that Anderson's public sabre-rattling conceals a much more rational private negotiation between the two companies in which the more likely outcome will be an agreement eventually giving Manchester a single morning Metro. </p> <p>The most sensible result would be a joint venture between Associated and GMG on the lines of the ones already in place in Newcastle and Yorkshire. Though Associated has played it tough, it has found it difficult to walk in on regions where there are strong local monopolies. </p> <p>Newcastle is a case in point, where Trinity's morning Newcastle Journal and Evening Chronicle, jointly selling about 150,000 copies a day, retain the loyalty of Tynesiders. </p> <p>There has undoubtedly been an impact on the sales of both since the Swedes launched Morning News in January 2000 and Associated-Trinity responded with Metro. With 100,000 of the former being given away on the city's underground system, and more than 60,000 of the latter being distributed too, a relatively small city was saturated with papers. </p> <p>Even so, the down-turn in sales of the Journal and Chronicle has been very slight. Now, with the Swedes pulling out and agreeing to sell their paper to Associated and Trinity (subject to Department of Trade and Industry approval), the pressure on the paid-fors will probably ease. The reason, similar to experiences in every region where Metro is distributed, appears to stem from the fact that many Metro-readers don't buy other newspapers. Metros are expanding the market. In Newcastle, research shows that the total newspaper audience is greater than it has been for years. </p> <p>No wonder Steve Brown, managing director of the Journal and Chronicle, is bubbling. He says: \"The Metro is here to stay and we are all very excited by its possibilities. We see it as a key part of our product portfolio.\" </p> <p>Ignoring the offputting management argot, it is clear that Brown's views mesh with those of Anderson and all at Associated who reel off figures which point to the Metro's appeal to a group they identify as \"young urban commuters with a frenetic lifestyle\". </p> <p>In other words, Metro is attracting the newspaper equivalent of the holy grail: a new generation of young affluent consumers. According to researchers, 78% of Metro readers are under 44, one in three are under 24 and some 70% are ABC1. </p> <p>Even allowing for exaggeration, and noting that the research was done on behalf of Metro, it is impressive. No other national paper can produce a similar readership profile for its advertisers. Then again, and I readily admit to the anecdotal nature of my own experience, I am not convinced that Metro is read in the same way as the paid-for dailies. Most people skim-read it, even on long tube journeys, and they discard it quickly. </p> <p>Though Metro editor Tim Jotischky enthuses, \"We have tapped into the lifestyle of young readers in a way no other paper has managed\", it's difficult to find any justification for that claim in the rather bland content. </p> <p>It is a very professional technical achievement, as one would expect from the Mail stable. It looks good and it is also very clean, leaving no ink on readers' hands. </p> <p>Metro does provide a digest of national and international news which is presented in a fairly neutral way, though I imagine a competent media studies post-graduate would be able to show all manner of unconscious bias in both selection and presentation. </p> <p>There is a good page of quizzes and crosswords. The sport, at least in London, isn't comprehensive enough. The listings are barely adequate. </p> <p>Despite this, as I leave my commuter train at Victoria in the morning, I see scores of people go out of their way to pick up copies from the bins around the station. </p> <p>On the Northern Line tube, the carriages overflow with Metros, almost all of them showing signs of having been read from cover to cover. Then, at the British Newspaper Library, the repository of every newspaper title you could imagine and more besides, there is a pile of Metros at the entrance and more copies in the refreshment lounge. </p> <p>During their breaks from the microfiches and fading files of the world's great newspapers, these newspaper addicts inevitably pick up a Metro. Could there be a more auspicious augury for its future?</p>",

Even so, the down-turn in sales of the Journal and Chronicle has been very slight. Now, with the Swedes pulling out and agreeing to sell their paper to Associated and Trinity (subject to Department of Trade and Industry approval), the pressure on the paid-fors will probably ease. The reason, similar to experiences in every region where Metro is distributed, appears to stem from the fact that many Metro-readers don't buy other newspapers. Metros are expanding the market. In Newcastle, research shows that the total newspaper audience is greater than it has been for years. No wonder Steve Brown, managing director of the Journal and Chronicle, is bubbling. He says: \"The Metro is here to stay and we are all very excited by its possibilities. We see it as a key part of our product portfolio.\" Ignoring the offputting management argot, it is clear that Brown's views mesh with those of Anderson and all at Associated who reel off figures which point to the Metro's appeal to a group they identify as \"young urban commuters with a frenetic lifestyle\". In other words, Metro is attracting the newspaper equivalent of the holy grail: a new generation of young affluent consumers. According to researchers, 78% of Metro readers are under 44, one in three are under 24 and some 70% are ABC1. Even allowing for exaggeration, and noting that the research was done on behalf of Metro, it is impressive. No other national paper can produce a similar readership profile for its advertisers. Then again, and I readily admit to the anecdotal nature of my own experience, I am not convinced that Metro is read in the same way as the paid-for dailies. Most people skim-read it, even on long tube journeys, and they discard it quickly. Though Metro editor Tim Jotischky enthuses, \"We have tapped into the lifestyle of young readers in a way no other paper has managed\", it's difficult to find any justification for that claim in the rather bland content. It is a very professional technical achievement, as one would expect from the Mail stable. It looks good and it is also very clean, leaving no ink on readers' hands. Metro does provide a digest of national and international news which is presented in a fairly neutral way, though I imagine a competent media studies post-graduate would be able to show all manner of unconscious bias in both selection and presentation. There is a good page of quizzes and crosswords. The sport, at least in London, isn't comprehensive enough. The listings are barely adequate. Despite this, as I leave my commuter train at Victoria in the morning, I see scores of people go out of their way to pick up copies from the bins around the station. On the Northern Line tube, the carriages overflow with Metros, almost all of them showing signs of having been read from cover to cover. Then, at the British Newspaper Library, the repository of every newspaper title you could imagine and more besides, there is a pile of Metros at the entrance and more copies in the refreshment lounge. During their breaks from the microfiches and fading files of the world's great newspapers, these newspaper addicts inevitably pick up a Metro. Could there be a more auspicious augury for its future?",

The three Lockerbie judges are now expected to deliver their verdict within weeks. The legal submissions from both sides are expected to last two or three days. The surprise move by the two lawyers for the two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish town means the defence case has lasted less than two days in a marathon 77-day trial which opened in May last year and heard evidence from 235 witnesses. After months of prosecution witnesses, the defence lawyers finally began their case on December 5 on behalf of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, 48, and his co-accused Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 44. They both deny the bombing, in which an aircraft exploded over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 killing 270 people. They have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to murder, murder and a breach of the 1982 Aviation Security Act. The defence case began last month with brief evidence about Palestinian terrorism.

Today the court heard that the Syrians had refused to cooperate - and William Taylor QC for Mr Megrahi and Richard Keen QC for Mr Fhimah then indicated that they did not intend to call the two defendants to give evidence. The surprise ending of the evidence follows months of legal argument, frequent adjournments and hundreds of witnesses ranging from Lockerbie residents who saw the burning plane drop from the sky to baggage handlers at Frankfurt airport where the bomb is said to have been placed aboard the Pan Am flight bound for London and then to New York. This week Mr Megrahi had been expected to take the stand as the defence attempted to establish that Palestinian terror groups, and not the Libyans, were responsible for the atrocity. Then came the announcement in court today that the Syrians had refused to provide any documents which might have helped establish a link between the Lockerbie explosion and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. After hearing from the two defence lawyers, presiding judge Lord Sutherland said the intention now was to adjourn the proceedings until tomorrow, when final submissions from prosecution and defence lawyers would begin. Earlier, an FBI agent who turned out to be the final witness in the trial gave evidence.

They suggest that there was a real chance of peaceful dialogue between the party and the students until the prime minister, Li Peng, and other hardliners took advantage of the crisis.</p> <p>\"We can't confront the students with inflammatory or antagonistic propaganda anymore ...\" the moderate politburo member Li Ruihuan argued earlier in the crisis.</p> <p>\"We should take a sober look at what has caused the strong rebellious streak in the popular mood in recent times. We said there would be no inflation, and then in fact inflation came.\"</p> <p>Another, Tian Jiyun, urged \"effective measures to clean up government and to accelerate our steps towards democracy.\"</p> <p>The documents - amounting to about 15,000 pages in English - are said to have been brought out of China on computer disc by a disaffected official who wishes to \"open up the question\" of what happened in June 1989.</p> <p>Some China specialists believe the operation is backed by reformers who want to tilt the balance against the hardliners, including Mr Li, before important party and state congresses in 2002-03, when new leaders will be selected.</p> <p>The events of June 1989 are still not discussed in China, and many younger Chinese have no clear idea of what happened. Revelations published abroad are likely to circulate on the internet, despite official attempts to block access.</p> <p>The documents confirm that Mr Li fully earned the epithet of \"Butcher of Beijing\" for the June 3-4 massacre.</p> <p>He alarmed the aged leaders by telling them that Taiwanese and CIA agents were manipulating the students, and describing the mainly peaceful protest against the army as a \"counter-revolutionary riot\".</p> <p>On June 3 he argued that the troops should be \"authorised to use any means necessary to deal with people who interfere with the mission [of occupying Tiananmen Square]\".</p> <p>Deng, although he had officially retired from office after promoting China's post-Mao economic reforms, had the final say as the crisis developed.</p> <p>Professor Nathan says in an introduction that at first Deng \"seemed willing to consider anything, so long as the students were somehow cleared from the square in time for [a visit by the] Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\". But the students announced their hunger strike and their protest spread to other provinces, completely over-shadowing the intended diplomatic triumph.</p> <p>Deng then denounced the democracy sought by the students as \"western-style stuff\", and said the unrest would lead to civil war. \"If our one billion people jumped into multi-party elections we would get chaos like the 'all-out civil war' we saw during the [1966-76] cultural revolution.\"</p> <p>A politburo standing committee meeting at his home on May 17 was divided by his proposal to declare martial law. The moderate party secretary-general, Zhao Ziyang, warned: \"One more big political mistake might well cost us all our remaining legitimacy.\"</p> <p>Deng and the elders, entitled to intervene in the event of a committee stalemate, had no hesitation in approving martial law.</p> <p>\"Give them no mercy!\" the retired general Wang Zhen exploded. \"These kids don't know how good they have got it. When we were their age we lived in a forest of rifles and a rain of bullets ... If the students don't leave Tiananmen on their own, the People's Liberation Army should go in and carry them out.\"</p> <p>Mr Zhao quickly became the scapegoat. He was secretly replaced by the Shanghai party boss Jiang Zemin, now president and supreme leader.</p> <p>Though the troops were ordered to fire only in the last resort, they deliberately shot protesters and bystanders as they moved towards the square that evening. They seem not to have fired in the square itself, but many were killed on the approach roads.</p> <p>\"Infantrymen led the way, firing into the air,\" the army reported to the leaders. \"Then the soldiers - with the first two rows in a kneeling position and those in back standing - pointed their weapons at the crowd.\"</p> <p>\"At 10.30pm, under a barrage of rocks, the troops opened fire.\"</p> <p>The documents make it clear that the senior leaders were kept fully informed, contrary to speculation at the time. The state security ministry reported that \"some soldiers lost their self-control and fired wildly as people shouted 'fascists' and threw stones\".</p> <p>The documents put the death toll in the region of 200 - fewer than most estimates, though independent scholars no longer believe claims that \"thousands died\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Moderate Chinese leaders favoured a dialogue with the students in Tiananmen Square but were overruled by Communist party elders, a dossier of documents on the crisis in 1989 which led to the Beijing massacre has revealed. Secret transcripts of the leaders' debate show that the veteran party and army leaders, headed by Deng Xiaoping, were enraged when the students went on hunger strike and erected a statue of \"the goddess of democracy\". One said he was revolted by the statue, calling it \"neither human nor demon\". Extracts will be published in New York tomorrow as the Tiananmen Papers, edited by the Andrew Nathan and Perry Link. They suggest that there was a real chance of peaceful dialogue between the party and the students until the prime minister, Li Peng, and other hardliners took advantage of the crisis. \"We can't confront the students with inflammatory or antagonistic propaganda anymore ...\" the moderate politburo member Li Ruihuan argued earlier in the crisis. \"We should take a sober look at what has caused the strong rebellious streak in the popular mood in recent times. We said there would be no inflation, and then in fact inflation came.\" Another, Tian Jiyun, urged \"effective measures to clean up government and to accelerate our steps towards democracy.\" The documents - amounting to about 15,000 pages in English - are said to have been brought out of China on computer disc by a disaffected official who wishes to \"open up the question\" of what happened in June 1989. Some China specialists believe the operation is backed by reformers who want to tilt the balance against the hardliners, including Mr Li, before important party and state congresses in 2002-03, when new leaders will be selected. The events of June 1989 are still not discussed in China, and many younger Chinese have no clear idea of what happened. Revelations published abroad are likely to circulate on the internet, despite official attempts to block access. The documents confirm that Mr Li fully earned the epithet of \"Butcher of Beijing\" for the June 3-4 massacre. He alarmed the aged leaders by telling them that Taiwanese and CIA agents were manipulating the students, and describing the mainly peaceful protest against the army as a \"counter-revolutionary riot\". On June 3 he argued that the troops should be \"authorised to use any means necessary to deal with people who interfere with the mission [of occupying Tiananmen Square]\". Deng, although he had officially retired from office after promoting China's post-Mao economic reforms, had the final say as the crisis developed. Professor Nathan says in an introduction that at first Deng \"seemed willing to consider anything, so long as the students were somehow cleared from the square in time for [a visit by the] Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\". But the students announced their hunger strike and their protest spread to other provinces, completely over-shadowing the intended diplomatic triumph. Deng then denounced the democracy sought by the students as \"western-style stuff\", and said the unrest would lead to civil war. \"If our one billion people jumped into multi-party elections we would get chaos like the 'all-out civil war' we saw during the [1966-76] cultural revolution.\" A politburo standing committee meeting at his home on May 17 was divided by his proposal to declare martial law. The moderate party secretary-general, Zhao Ziyang, warned: \"One more big political mistake might well cost us all our remaining legitimacy.\" Deng and the elders, entitled to intervene in the event of a committee stalemate, had no hesitation in approving martial law. \"Give them no mercy!\" the retired general Wang Zhen exploded. \"These kids don't know how good they have got it. When we were their age we lived in a forest of rifles and a rain of bullets ... If the students don't leave Tiananmen on their own, the People's Liberation Army should go in and carry them out.\" Mr Zhao quickly became the scapegoat. He was secretly replaced by the Shanghai party boss Jiang Zemin, now president and supreme leader. Though the troops were ordered to fire only in the last resort, they deliberately shot protesters and bystanders as they moved towards the square that evening. They seem not to have fired in the square itself, but many were killed on the approach roads. \"Infantrymen led the way, firing into the air,\" the army reported to the leaders. \"Then the soldiers - with the first two rows in a kneeling position and those in back standing - pointed their weapons at the crowd.\" \"At 10.30pm, under a barrage of rocks, the troops opened fire.\" The documents make it clear that the senior leaders were kept fully informed, contrary to speculation at the time. The state security ministry reported that \"some soldiers lost their self-control and fired wildly as people shouted 'fascists' and threw stones\". The documents put the death toll in the region of 200 - fewer than most estimates, though independent scholars no longer believe claims that \"thousands died\".",

So I put forward parameters that I wanted to be a guide toward a comprehensive agreement, parameters based on eight years of listening carefully to both sides and hearing them describe with increasing clarity their respective grievances and needs.</p> <p>\"Both Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat have now accepted these parameters as the basis for further efforts.</p> <p>\"Both have expressed some reservations. At their request, I am using my remaining time in office to narrow the differences between the parties to the greatest degree possible.</p> <p>\"The parameters I put forward contemplate a settlement in response to each side's essential needs, if not to their utmost desires. A settlement based on sovereign homelands, security, peace and dignity for both Israelis and Palestinians...</p> <p>\"Here they are: First, I think there can be no genuine resolution to the conflict without a sovereign, viable, Palestinian state that accommodates Israeli's security requirements and the demographic realities.</p> <p>\"That suggests Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza, the vast majority of the West Bank, the incorporation into Israel of settlement blocks, with the goal of maximising the number of settlers in Israel while minimising the land annex, for Palestine, to be viable, must be a geographically contiguous state.</p> <p>\"Now, the land annexed into Israel into settlement blocks should include as few Palestinians as possible, consistent with the logic of two separate homelands. And to make the agreement durable, I think there will have to be some territorial swaps and other arrangements.</p> <p>\"Second, a solution will have to be found for the Palestinian refugees who have suffered a great deal - particularly some of them. A solution that allows them to return to a Palestinian state that will provide all Palestinians with a place they can safely and proudly call home.</p> <p>\"All Palestinian refugees who wish to live in this homeland should have the right to do so.

      "bodyText": "\"Given the impasse and the tragic deterioration on the ground, a couple of weeks ago both sides asked me to present my ideas. So I put forward parameters that I wanted to be a guide toward a comprehensive agreement, parameters based on eight years of listening carefully to both sides and hearing them describe with increasing clarity their respective grievances and needs. \"Both Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat have now accepted these parameters as the basis for further efforts. \"Both have expressed some reservations. At their request, I am using my remaining time in office to narrow the differences between the parties to the greatest degree possible. \"The parameters I put forward contemplate a settlement in response to each side's essential needs, if not to their utmost desires. A settlement based on sovereign homelands, security, peace and dignity for both Israelis and Palestinians... \"Here they are: First, I think there can be no genuine resolution to the conflict without a sovereign, viable, Palestinian state that accommodates Israeli's security requirements and the demographic realities. \"That suggests Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza, the vast majority of the West Bank, the incorporation into Israel of settlement blocks, with the goal of maximising the number of settlers in Israel while minimising the land annex, for Palestine, to be viable, must be a geographically contiguous state. \"Now, the land annexed into Israel into settlement blocks should include as few Palestinians as possible, consistent with the logic of two separate homelands. And to make the agreement durable, I think there will have to be some territorial swaps and other arrangements. \"Second, a solution will have to be found for the Palestinian refugees who have suffered a great deal - particularly some of them. A solution that allows them to return to a Palestinian state that will provide all Palestinians with a place they can safely and proudly call home. \"All Palestinian refugees who wish to live in this homeland should have the right to do so. All others who want to find new homes, whether in their current locations or in third countries, should be able to do so, consistent with those countries' sovereign decisions. And that includes Israel. \"All refugees should receive compensation from the international community for their losses, and assistance in building new lives. \"Now, you all know what the rub is.

Y Rodri es el novio de Carolina. </p> <p>\u00bfQu\u00e9 es la anorexia? \u00bfY la bulimia?<br> Lourdes (18 a\u00f1os): Anorexia y bulimia es lo mismo.

Cuando enfermas te das cuenta de que hay algo que no funciona pero no quieres cambiarlo. Y no quieres que los dem\u00e1s se den cuenta. Para prevenir puede ser m\u00e1s eficaz hacer campa\u00f1as de informaci\u00f3n a los padres.<br> Rodri: Es muy dif\u00edcil. En nuestra sociedad vende la imagen y un cuerpo de anuncio. Prevenir es cambiar este <strong>chip</strong>. Y decir que se pueden hacer mucho da\u00f1o.<br> Blanca: No es f\u00e1cil detectarlo porque cualquier ni\u00f1a hoy hace r\u00e9gimen.

The emergency meeting was called after Lazio lost 2-1 at home to relegation-threatened Napoli last night.</p> <p>Cragnotti was forthright in his comments regarding England's next coach after the defeat. \"The players still had Christmas cake in their feet,\" he said. \"On Monday I will meet with Eriksson to try and understand how this has happened and to see how we can find the way out of this tunnel.\"</p> <p>Eriksson, who was not expected to fully take up his new role until the summer, has been the subject of criticism in Italy ever since he accepted the England role, and his record this season has not helped. Lazio have lost four times in 13 Serie A games this season, and they stand pointless at the foot of their Champions League group.</p> <p>Earlier, Football Association spokesman David Davies inferred that the FA were aware of Eriksson's fragile position. \"We are keeping more than a close eye on Lazio's results,\" he admitted. \"We want Sven-Goran Eriksson to do well and we are disappointed when Lazio do not win.\"</p> <p>Davies then re-stated that Eriksson would still be featuring in the build-up to England's friendly against Spain next month, followed by the World Cup qualifying matches against Finland and Albania. \"He will be involved in all our key games until the end of the season,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Adam Crozier will be meeting with them in the next couple of weeks and we will attempt to resolve any uncertainty about the future. We have a good relationship with Sergio Gragnotti and Sven-Goran Eriksson. </p> <p>But he added: \"It has been made clear that Peter Taylor will be in charge for the game against Spain in February.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sven-Goran Eriksson is to meet with Lazio chairman Sergio Cragnotti this afternoon amidst intense speculation that his time as coach of the Italian champions is set to come to an end. The emergency meeting was called after Lazio lost 2-1 at home to relegation-threatened Napoli last night. Cragnotti was forthright in his comments regarding England's next coach after the defeat. \"The players still had Christmas cake in their feet,\" he said. \"On Monday I will meet with Eriksson to try and understand how this has happened and to see how we can find the way out of this tunnel.\" Eriksson, who was not expected to fully take up his new role until the summer, has been the subject of criticism in Italy ever since he accepted the England role, and his record this season has not helped. Lazio have lost four times in 13 Serie A games this season, and they stand pointless at the foot of their Champions League group. Earlier, Football Association spokesman David Davies inferred that the FA were aware of Eriksson's fragile position. \"We are keeping more than a close eye on Lazio's results,\" he admitted. \"We want Sven-Goran Eriksson to do well and we are disappointed when Lazio do not win.\" Davies then re-stated that Eriksson would still be featuring in the build-up to England's friendly against Spain next month, followed by the World Cup qualifying matches against Finland and Albania. \"He will be involved in all our key games until the end of the season,\" he said. \"Adam Crozier will be meeting with them in the next couple of weeks and we will attempt to resolve any uncertainty about the future. We have a good relationship with Sergio Gragnotti and Sven-Goran Eriksson. But he added: \"It has been made clear that Peter Taylor will be in charge for the game against Spain in February.\"",

Any revelation that the sports brand leveraged its multi-million backing to influence team selection would cause one of the biggest scandals in sponsorship history. Ronaldo is scheduled to appear before the government's congressional committee in Brasilia investigating soccer corruption on Wednesday. Officials want to know whether Nike, which sponsors both Ronaldo and the Brazilian Soccer Confederation, insisted that he play in the 1998 final against France. Just hours before the final the 1997 Fifa player of the year suffered serious convulsions and was left out of the team. However shortly before kick off Nike's talisman surprisingly re-appeared on the team sheet and turned in a lacklustre performance. Brazil lost 3-0. Nike and former team coach Mario Zagallo have denied the accusations. Zagallo claims Ronald begged him to play, assuring the coach he had been cleared by doctors. But it appears the testimonies of other members of the Brazilian camp contradict these claims. The Nike sponsorship deal was one of the biggest ever signed worldwide and was worth \u00a3300m over 10 years.",

Ms Harding could have given them a stark and disturbing insight into what their plans might really mean. But in the world of policy and principle people like Ms Harding rarely are consulted. Too much raw human experience, the stuff of which nightmares are made, can get in the way of a good, headline-grabbing ministerial announcement. </p> <p>Ms Harding is a project worker in the mental health field, a job for which she is well qualified. As well as being trained in psychology she was diagnosed five years ago with schizophrenia. She was placed on a course of medication that had a pretty immediate effect: her blood pressure plummeted like a stone. \"I kept fainting a lot and waking up on the floor wondering how I'd got there,\" she says now. She was moved on to another drug but it too had vicious side effects. She developed pronounced muscle spasms and twitches in her hands and, most worryingly, a condition called oculogyric crisis in which the eye balls roll up involuntarily into the head. \"I ended up looking like a zombie and not wanting to socialise with anybody,\" she says. </p> <p>And so to a third drug and a third set of side effects: twitching legs and feet, sudden memory loss, restlessness leading to anxiety - a combination that almost lost Ms Harding her job. Unsurprisingly, she stopped taking the drugs which, though detrimental in other ways, had controlled the symptoms of her schizophrenia. Now they came roaring back. \"One evening I found myself talking to my laundry basket. I was asking it what it had done with all my friends.\" She swiftly hospitalised herself. </p> <p>Many people with schizophrenia will find Ms Harding's story horribly familiar. She had experienced the terrible side effects - some of which, like Parkinsonian shakes and tremors, can be permanent - of a group of drugs known as typical antipsychotics. Happily there are alternatives, a relatively new group of drugs called atypical antipsychotics which have fewer and less severe side effects. Ms Harding's schizophrenia is now controlled by one of them. </p> <p>But there are many people who, because of plans recently announced by home secretary Jack Straw and secretary of state for health Alan Milburn, will not be as fortunate as Ms Harding. Under the government's new mental health proposals, they will be forced to take the older drugs, regardless of the grim consequences; consequences that many users describe as even worse than the symptoms of schizophrenia itself. </p> <p>When the white paper was published much of the attention was focused on plans for people with untreatable personality disorders to be locked up without trial, a troubling enough move in itself. But the paper also included another proposal: the introduction of compulsory treatment orders under which people with schizophrenia who, for whatever reason, had stopped taking their medication, could be taken to hospital and be forced to take their drugs. </p> <p>The problem is that the only drugs that can be given involuntarily to a subject are those that can be administered by injection or, ideally, by depot, a slow release dose inserted painfully deep into the muscle which can seep into the blood stream for a month or more. And the only drugs available in that form are the old typicals with their vicious side effects. The new drugs can be taken by mouth in tablet or jelly form, but in no other way. Injectable forms are under development but none is even close to being ready for use. </p> <p>Only the woolly-minded would argue that there are no circumstances under which a person with schizophrenia should be forced to take their drugs. While the vast majority of those with the condition, which affects 1% of the population, are going to pose no danger, there will always be a few who, unmedicated, will present some form of risk, if only to themselves. The uncontrollable psychotic, gripped by paranoia, who tries to crash a packed Jumbo jet, may be one such example. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the state should not be administering drugs that damage the health of already vulnerable people. It doesn't need to happen. The current situation has emerged from a complete failure of what Tony Blair trumpeted in the early days as \"joined-up government\". </p> <p>One of the main reasons why people stop taking their medication - the reason why they would need to be the subject of one of the new compulsory treatment orders - is because, like Ms Harding, they can no longer stand the side effects. The solution for most of them is to be switched to the less harmful atypicals. </p> <p>However, the atypicals are much more expensive than the typicals and, like so many other drugs with a large price tag attached, have been the subject of \"postcode prescribing\". Their availability is dependent purely on the attitude of whichever health authority the patient happens to find themselves under. One survey of Britain's psychiatrists found that more than half were continuing to prescribe the older toxic drugs for financial reasons. </p> <p>There is no doubt the atypicals are costly: they account for 16% of schizophrenia prescriptions but 76% of the overall drug costs. But that is to look at the cost of the care of schizophrenia in only the narrowest sense. It takes a far greater proportion of the health and welfare budget to care for someone who refuses to take their medication because of the side effects, if they end up unable to work and needing the attentions of more doctors, more nurses and more social workers. </p> <p>This is a job for the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), which was set up specifically, to look at issues such as this. But it was only announced that it would be looking at these groups of drugs as the mental health white paper was published. The logical way forward would have been for Nice to issue a \"guidance\" giving the green light for mass prescribing of atypicals before the government introduced its heavy-handed proposals for dealing with those with acute mental problems. </p> <p>However, Nice will not report until the end of this year, by which time the government's proposals will already be working their way towards becoming law. </p> <p>Many working in mental health are concerned that Nice will ignore the side-effects issue and fail to find in favour of the atypicals. A survey published last month by the National Schizophrenia Fellowship found that more than 60% of those with the illness had never been offered an alternative drug. More than 40% had never received anything in writing about the side effects they might experience. In short, many clinicians seem to be rather poor at listening to the people they are meant to be helping. The government is in danger of repeating the pattern. </p> <p>Professor Louis Appleby, the national director of mental health, appointed last April, says that neither he nor the government has anything against atypicals. \"But we do want Nice to look at this question and reach a guidance.\" He also says he is a firm believer in people having a say in their treatment \"and the white paper serves them better in that respect\". There is no reason to doubt the professor's integrity nor to question the commitment of the Department of Health (DoH). The DoH is shortly to launch a major campaign to counter discrimination against mentally ill people. The problem lies with the other signature on the white paper: that of home secretary Jack Straw. </p> <p>Because whatever the paper may have to say about reform of the Mental Health Act, this was, as far as the Home Office is concerned, a law and order initiative. It was about banging up dangerous freaks and making mad men and women do as they were told. It was about making voters feel safer in their homes. </p> <p>Since law and order will be one of the major battlegrounds of the coming election, it was simply not on the cards that legislation would be delayed while clinicians reached their judgments about the merits of different drugs. As one person close to the process told me, the competing interests of the DoH and the home secretary were \"a very difficult circle to square\". </p> <p>It doesn't look as if that process was ever completed.

      "body": "<p>Health authorities have been told to improve the appalling state of men's health - which leads to more premature deaths and illnesses than among women - by targeting them for priority care. </p> <p>The Department of Health issued the command after mounting concern that the yawning health gap between men and women is costing thousands of lives. </p> <p>The health of British men is so bad that each year 20,000 more of them die before the age of 65 than women. They are more likely to suffer heart disease, cancer and HIV. Men aged 20 to 24 are three times more likely to die than young women. </p> <p>The new policy follows an admission that men suffer because previous health campaigns have targeted women, and men have far too little access to health services. </p> <p>Health authorities will have to monitor how sick men in their region are and, if they are suffering significantly more than women, take steps to remedy the situation. A Health Department spokesman said: \"Health authorities have been told to target all inequalities, including that based on gender. If in a local area men are twice as likely to die from heart disease as women, they will be expected to try and target services at men.\"</p> <p>There is growing realisation among politicians and doctors that men's health has been neglected. This month, MPs will launch the first All Party Group on Men's Health to raise awareness and coordinate policies. </p> <p>Official figures show men are more likely to die than women across all age ranges. They are twice as likely to die in accidents and three times as likely to commit suicide. Young men are almost five times more likely to kill themselves than young women. </p> <p>Men are more likely to smoke, to have an unhealthy diet, to be overweight, and to expose themselves to sun. They are three times as likely to be alcoholic as women, and four times as likely to be registered drug addicts. </p> <p>However, men are about half as likely to visit their GP as women. Overall, men can expect to live 74.6 years, five years less than women. An unskilled man can expect to live 11 years less than a professional woman. An unskilled black man lives almost 15 years less than a professional white woman. The excess of premature male deaths is the equivalent of a jumbo jet full of men crashing each week. </p> <p>Public health minister Yvette Cooper said last summer that the difference between men and women was the \"biggest health inequality of all\". The government wants to combat the assumption that the poor state of men's health is all their own fault. </p> <p>There is eight times as much money spent on specific female health issues as on male ones. Women are screened for breast cancer and cervical cancer, and will soon be screened for ovarian cancer. But there is no screening programme for prostate cancer, which kills four times as many men as cervical cancer kills women. Some countries in Europe, and many states in the US, screen for prostate cancer, which this month claimed the life of libel lawyer George Carman. </p> <p>The government's Health Development Agency, which has appointed its first men's health officer, will be working out ways to raise awareness of health among men, and encourage them to visit their GP more frequently. Surgeries will be asked to open after work and at weekends, as men are more likely to work full-time. Health authorities should make men more aware of health issues by working through betting shops, and opening clinics in pubs and sports centres. </p> <p>Making men's health a priority has largely been the work of the women health ministers Tessa Jowell and Yvette Cooper.</p>",

An unskilled black man lives almost 15 years less than a professional white woman. The excess of premature male deaths is the equivalent of a jumbo jet full of men crashing each week. Public health minister Yvette Cooper said last summer that the difference between men and women was the \"biggest health inequality of all\". The government wants to combat the assumption that the poor state of men's health is all their own fault. There is eight times as much money spent on specific female health issues as on male ones. Women are screened for breast cancer and cervical cancer, and will soon be screened for ovarian cancer. But there is no screening programme for prostate cancer, which kills four times as many men as cervical cancer kills women. Some countries in Europe, and many states in the US, screen for prostate cancer, which this month claimed the life of libel lawyer George Carman. The government's Health Development Agency, which has appointed its first men's health officer, will be working out ways to raise awareness of health among men, and encourage them to visit their GP more frequently. Surgeries will be asked to open after work and at weekends, as men are more likely to work full-time. Health authorities should make men more aware of health issues by working through betting shops, and opening clinics in pubs and sports centres. Making men's health a priority has largely been the work of the women health ministers Tessa Jowell and Yvette Cooper.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The government is to reject swaths of the seminal Police Foundation report on the future of British drugs policy because it fears appearing to be \"soft\". </p> <p>In an announcement next month, the government will say it does not agree with seven key findings of the National Commission on Drugs because of lack of evidence that the recommendations will work. </p> <p>The state-sponsored report sparked debate by calling for a significant relaxation of the drugs laws. But Keith Hellawell, the drugs tsar, will tell ministers that softening their stance on cannabis would send the wrong message to the public. </p> <p>\"We have looked at the report carefully and keep saying to ourselves, 'where's the evidence to support what they are saying?'\" said a highly-placed government source. </p> <p>\"Although we back much of what the report says on drugs education and rehabilitation, on the issue of reclassification of hard drugs and on the issue of cannabis in general, we do not agree with the findings.\" </p> <p>The move will dismay campaigners who say that Britain has the toughest anti-drugs laws in Europe and that the government should make a clearer distinction between hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine and softer drugs such as cannabis. </p> <p>Dame Ruth Runciman, who wrote the report, will increase pressure on the government this week when she says that the Home Office is being slow to respond to the recommendations, which were published last March. </p> <p>She will tell a drugs conference organised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that the government is seeking to cherry pick the foundation's ideas, a policy she says will not work. The report provides \"a middle ground approach\", she will say, and it should be implemented in full. </p> <p>A government source said: \"How long did she take to write the report? About two years. So the fact that we have taken some time to think a lot about what she is saying is reasonable.\"</p> <p>He said the government's 10-year strategy on drugs was starting to have results, with evidence that the number of people taking drugs was falling. </p> <p>But anti-government campaigners point to polls showing that the majority want to see cannabis decriminalised. </p> <p>Many senior police officers have also admitted that they no longer prosecute people for small scale cannabis offences because it is a waste of resources. </p> <p>The seven key areas that will be rejected are: </p> <p> \u0095 Making the possession of cannabis a non-imprisonable offence. </p> <p> \u0095 Allowing people to defend themselves against charges of supplying drugs such as ecstasy if they can say that it was only for use by a small circle of friends. </p> <p> \u0095 Reducing the sentences for those convicted of offences involving Class A drugs such as heroin. </p> <p> \u0095 Making more sentences involving softer drugs community based rather than prison based. </p> <p> \u0095 Ensuring that people prosecuted for cultivating a small number of cannabis plants do not face prison. </p> <p> \u0095 Reclassifying ecstasy and LSD from Class A to Class B drugs. </p> <p> \u0095 Reclassifying cannabis from Class B to Class C.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is to reject swaths of the seminal Police Foundation report on the future of British drugs policy because it fears appearing to be \"soft\". In an announcement next month, the government will say it does not agree with seven key findings of the National Commission on Drugs because of lack of evidence that the recommendations will work. The state-sponsored report sparked debate by calling for a significant relaxation of the drugs laws. But Keith Hellawell, the drugs tsar, will tell ministers that softening their stance on cannabis would send the wrong message to the public. \"We have looked at the report carefully and keep saying to ourselves, 'where's the evidence to support what they are saying?'\" said a highly-placed government source. \"Although we back much of what the report says on drugs education and rehabilitation, on the issue of reclassification of hard drugs and on the issue of cannabis in general, we do not agree with the findings.\" The move will dismay campaigners who say that Britain has the toughest anti-drugs laws in Europe and that the government should make a clearer distinction between hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine and softer drugs such as cannabis. Dame Ruth Runciman, who wrote the report, will increase pressure on the government this week when she says that the Home Office is being slow to respond to the recommendations, which were published last March. She will tell a drugs conference organised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that the government is seeking to cherry pick the foundation's ideas, a policy she says will not work. The report provides \"a middle ground approach\", she will say, and it should be implemented in full. A government source said: \"How long did she take to write the report? About two years. So the fact that we have taken some time to think a lot about what she is saying is reasonable.\" He said the government's 10-year strategy on drugs was starting to have results, with evidence that the number of people taking drugs was falling. But anti-government campaigners point to polls showing that the majority want to see cannabis decriminalised. Many senior police officers have also admitted that they no longer prosecute people for small scale cannabis offences because it is a waste of resources. The seven key areas that will be rejected are: \u0095 Making the possession of cannabis a non-imprisonable offence. \u0095 Allowing people to defend themselves against charges of supplying drugs such as ecstasy if they can say that it was only for use by a small circle of friends. \u0095 Reducing the sentences for those convicted of offences involving Class A drugs such as heroin. \u0095 Making more sentences involving softer drugs community based rather than prison based. \u0095 Ensuring that people prosecuted for cultivating a small number of cannabis plants do not face prison. \u0095 Reclassifying ecstasy and LSD from Class A to Class B drugs. \u0095 Reclassifying cannabis from Class B to Class C.",

The 29-year-old Everton striker discovered the break-in when he returned to his home near Ormskirk, Lancashire, early yesterday after his team's victory over Watford in the FA Cup on Saturday. Inspector Steve Sansbury, of Lancashire police, said officers were called to a report of a break-in and found one of the alleged offenders \"detained\" by the homeowner shortly after 1am. A second suspect had managed to escape. \"The householder has been interviewed by Lancashire police and we are satisfied that he acted both bravely and responsibly on encountering these intruders at his home,\" Insp Sansbury said. \"There is no suggestion of any police action against the homeowner.\" A 21-year-old man captured by Ferguson was arrested and taken to hospital with head injuries. Insp Sansbury said he would be formally interviewed after his release from hospital. The former Scottish international, known affectionately by fans as \"Duncan Disorderly\", became the first British professional footballer to be jailed for an offence on the pitch after he was convicted in 1995 of headbutting a rival defender while playing for Glasgow Rangers. He served 44 days in Barlinnie prison.",

The show, a follow-up to the hugely successful Survivor, actively encourages people to cheat on their partners. In the series, four couples will be banished to the beaches of Belize with 26 young, attractive singles. The details and the participants of the show are being kept secret, but trailers for the show make the tone clear. Promotions featuring scantily-clad men and women on tropical beaches saying, \"They thought it was a game. They didn't know how far it could go\". One women says: \"This could rip two people apart\". Launching on Wednesday, it flies in the face of a campaign by the network to clean up its image after the PR debacle of last year's Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?. The show, screened last summer, invited women to apply to marry Rick Rockwell, who subsequently turned out not only not to be a millionaire but to have two restraining orders filed against him. Fox Television chairman Sandy Grushow signalled an about-turn by the network after the incident, saying schlock ratings-grabbers were \"gone\" and \"over\". But Fox's new adventure into reality looks set to plunge the station into a fresh morality debate.

He builds up for this by playing Unchained Melody over and over again and then sitting on a window ledge with a bottle of scotch and a photo of his wedding day. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the local kids scavenge below trying to catch the video. There was an incident like this on my patch but I cannot remember how much really happened, how much was embellished in office gossip and how much I later invented.</p> <p>Although much will have changed since I was a housing officer, I am sure a great deal is the same. I tried to recreate this world in my novel - the sudden shift from the tedium of rent arrears to the tenant from hell who threatens to kill you unless you get him a transfer. </p> <p>This goes to the heart of the problem of being a housing officer - as the principal point of contact you are held responsible for things that are frequently outside your control. </p> <p>You would love to get a transfer for a difficult tenant, nothing would make you happier than to shunt him off to somebody else's patch, but you do not control allocations. You would be delighted to get the repair done, but do not control the contractor or building works. </p> <p>I can remember a tenant who had lost his electricity supply and whose meat-packed freezer was defrosting. He was issuing a stream of threats to his housing officer - threats of the \"I'm going to kill you\" variety that we were in no doubt he would carry out - if his supply was not restored in half an hour. Fortunately, the power came back but this, of course, had nothing to do with us. </p> <p>I also remember one irate character who was reporting his mother's repair and overheard me talking in the background about a void property - housing speak for an empty flat. </p> <p>He became convinced I was calling his mum a void property. \"Come out from behind that desk and I'll give you void fucking property, mate.\" </p> <p>This sort of incident might then be followed up by somebody complaining their neighbour had trained her cat to sit and stare at her through the window.</p> <p>The most common strategy for dealing with the mixture of stress and tedium is to deploy humour. One of the things I miss the most from the days when I worked in a housing office is the banter between colleagues, the way the banal and the eccentric, the ludicrous and the tragic would sometimes have us helpless with laughter. </p> <p>The danger of this kind of humour is that it can lead to cynicism, a tendency to see all tenants as either moaners, timewasters or psychopaths. </p> <p>In fact, most of the tenants on the estates were people struggling against considerable odds - poverty, racism, violence, inadequate services - to maintain a decent standard of living. </p> <p>It was difficult sometimes not to become misanthropic, develop a siege mentality and be dismissive of real problems. It is greatly to the credit of most housing officers I worked with that they managed to avoid this trap.</p> <p>There are aspects of life in the housing department I definitely miss. The question of working life presents the full-time writer with a paradox - the daily office interaction is a good way of maintaining your sanity and it provides ideas, stimulation, access to different narratives and dialogue. </p> <p>Writing is a solitary activity but the writer must engage with the world. And no amount of warm white wine at tedious literary parties can compensate for the rich vein of material that is found in the world of work - particularly in the housing office.</p> <p>\u0095 Ben Richards's first novel Throwing the House out of the Window was followed by Don't Step on the Lines, The Silver River and A Sweetheart Deal. He teaches development studies, specialising in South America, at University College London.</p>",

He became convinced I was calling his mum a void property. \"Come out from behind that desk and I'll give you void fucking property, mate.\" This sort of incident might then be followed up by somebody complaining their neighbour had trained her cat to sit and stare at her through the window. The most common strategy for dealing with the mixture of stress and tedium is to deploy humour. One of the things I miss the most from the days when I worked in a housing office is the banter between colleagues, the way the banal and the eccentric, the ludicrous and the tragic would sometimes have us helpless with laughter. The danger of this kind of humour is that it can lead to cynicism, a tendency to see all tenants as either moaners, timewasters or psychopaths. In fact, most of the tenants on the estates were people struggling against considerable odds - poverty, racism, violence, inadequate services - to maintain a decent standard of living. It was difficult sometimes not to become misanthropic, develop a siege mentality and be dismissive of real problems. It is greatly to the credit of most housing officers I worked with that they managed to avoid this trap. There are aspects of life in the housing department I definitely miss. The question of working life presents the full-time writer with a paradox - the daily office interaction is a good way of maintaining your sanity and it provides ideas, stimulation, access to different narratives and dialogue. Writing is a solitary activity but the writer must engage with the world. And no amount of warm white wine at tedious literary parties can compensate for the rich vein of material that is found in the world of work - particularly in the housing office. \u0095 Ben Richards's first novel Throwing the House out of the Window was followed by Don't Step on the Lines, The Silver River and A Sweetheart Deal.

Eastern culture is so different from the west that a person must come here with an open mind and be prepared for a lot of frustration. </p> <p> <strong><a name=\"A\">Finding jobs</a></strong><br> English teachers are always in great demand in China, but it is difficult to find out what is available since the schools and universities will not spend money on advertising. </p> <p>My own experience is that I got my first job in a primary school through a Chinese friend in the UK who used to teach there. Once there, I was contacted by the power plant where I now. For those for whom things don't fall so nicely into place, it is worth remembering that the VSO also recruits teachers for China. But once a teacher is working, offers will often come from other schools and workplaces.</p> <p>Some people visit China on a tourist visa with the intention of finding a job and sorting out the paperwork afterwards. This is perfectly acceptable, but probably easier to do in the major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai as contacts are easy to find</p> <p>In any documentation on TEFL working in China, it will say that you need a degree and TEFL qualifications, but in practice, this is not always the case. If you find work in a school you may not need previous experience or qualifications, but to work in a university, you will need a degree, though not necessarily TEFL qualifications. For teaching in a business environment, the decision depends on the company.</p> <p> <strong><a name=\"B\">Salaries</a></strong><br> The cost of living in China is very low and you will not earn very much - nobody comes to teach in China to get rich.</p> <p>Chinese teachers traditionally earn only a low wage of about RMB450 per month, paid by the government and sometimes topped up by the school or university depending on how wealthy the establishment is. At the moment the exchange rate is about RMB12 to \u00a31. A foreign teacher will probably earn between RMB1000 - 1300 per month.</p> <p>Working in a business will give you a much higher salary, though still not high by European standards, particularly if you are actually recruited in China. Something in the order of RMB6000 - 10,000 would be usual.</p> <p> <strong><a name=\"C\"> Accommodation and living expenses </a></strong><br> It is usual for accommodation to be provided on site free by the employer. In China, employees have traditionally lived at their workplace and, although this is slowly changing, this is still the case in the education sector. The quality of accommodation varies - although it is never of a very high standard. </p> <p>Almost everyone in China lives in a flat consisting of a tiny kitchen, tiny shower room/toilet, living/dining room and two or three bedrooms. Flats above the ground floor always have a balcony but this is for hanging out your washing on and not for sitting comfortably! </p> <p>Heating is found in flats north of the Yangtze River but air-conditioning is not a universal feature. Accommodation in the business sector is often of a significantly higher quality.</p> <p>Workplaces often have canteens attached and you can live very cheaply by making use of these. It is difficult to eat alone at a Chinese restaurant as people usually share dishes and restaurants cannot cater easily for individuals but if you go out with a group of friends then RMB80 for 4 would be considered normal, though in a tourist area you would pay much more.</p> <p> <strong><a name=\"D\"> Classes and teaching methods</a></strong><br> Classes in schools usually have a minimum of 60 students but 100 is not unusual. The situation is similar in universities, but in business, the situation will obviously vary from company to company</p> <p>The traditional method for teaching English is grammar translation - with a lot of chanting. The Chinese government is trying to introduce more communicative practices such as pair and group work, using information gap activities etc, and although it is possible use newer methods in the classroom, it is often logistically difficult. </p> <p>TEFL teachers in China are often told 'just to teach speaking and listening, not reading, writing or grammar', partly because the education system focuses heavily on exams and everyone has to take English exams, but it does make integrating the skills a great challenge. </p> <p>Chinese teachers prepare their students to a formula, not varying from the course books and the students prepare for the exams by memorising everything possible - which means that what the students do not get is conversation beyond memorised dialogues.</p> <p>If you plan to teach in China, it is a good idea to bring copies of your favourite books and cassettes with you since the schools will only have the national course books available (primary, junior and senior English for China). </p> <p>Some publishers such as Longman and Cambridge University Press have agreements with Chinese publishers to produce cheap copies of often-outdated EFL books, but the paper quality is poor and they really amount to nothing more than photocopies and often you can only get the books but not the tapes, or vice versa. </p> <p> <strong><a name=\"E\"> Visas and paperwork </a></strong><br> There is an enormous amount of official form filling in China with a payment to be made at each stage, but your employer should pay for all of this. If you work in the public education sector, the local foreign affairs office will know of your placement and be available for problem solving or queries. </p> <p>It is advisable to bring some needles with you for any healthcheck, as you cannot always be sure that a doctor's needle has not been used before.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"F\"> Is China for me? </a></strong><br> As you may have realised, China is not an easy place to work in but because the people here are still not very used to foreigners, it makes for a more unusual place to work. Tourists usually stay in the main centres like Beijing, Shanghai or Xian and do not get a chance to meet 'ordinary' Chinese. English is incredibly important here and teachers in all subjects are rated highly. Because of this, there will always be someone to talk to. It is hard work and you cannot fight the authorities, you really must go with the flow. If you did not have an interest in psychology before working here, you will certainly acquire one. </p> <p>It's a fascinating place where the reward will be experience not money.</p> <p> <strong><a name=\"G\"> Useful websites </a></strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://teflchina.com\">teflchina.com</a> - By far the best website for information on teaching in China, including job information and lists you can join. <br> <a href=\"http://www.chinanow.com\">Chinanow</a> - a fine guide to city life in China, from finding your way around to discovering restaurants and things to do. Essential for researching where you'd want to be and for making sense of it all when you get there.</p> <p> Jane Pennington is an English trainer at the Laibon B power plant in Guangxi in the People's Republic of China.

      "bodyText": "Finding jobs | Salaries | Accommodation and Living Expenses | Classes and teaching methods | Visas and paperwork | Is China for me? | Useful websites Introduction Working in China is an adventure, but not one to everybody's taste. Eastern culture is so different from the west that a person must come here with an open mind and be prepared for a lot of frustration. Finding jobs English teachers are always in great demand in China, but it is difficult to find out what is available since the schools and universities will not spend money on advertising. My own experience is that I got my first job in a primary school through a Chinese friend in the UK who used to teach there. Once there, I was contacted by the power plant where I now. For those for whom things don't fall so nicely into place, it is worth remembering that the VSO also recruits teachers for China. But once a teacher is working, offers will often come from other schools and workplaces. Some people visit China on a tourist visa with the intention of finding a job and sorting out the paperwork afterwards. This is perfectly acceptable, but probably easier to do in the major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai as contacts are easy to find In any documentation on TEFL working in China, it will say that you need a degree and TEFL qualifications, but in practice, this is not always the case. If you find work in a school you may not need previous experience or qualifications, but to work in a university, you will need a degree, though not necessarily TEFL qualifications. For teaching in a business environment, the decision depends on the company. Salaries The cost of living in China is very low and you will not earn very much - nobody comes to teach in China to get rich. Chinese teachers traditionally earn only a low wage of about RMB450 per month, paid by the government and sometimes topped up by the school or university depending on how wealthy the establishment is. At the moment the exchange rate is about RMB12 to \u00a31. A foreign teacher will probably earn between RMB1000 - 1300 per month. Working in a business will give you a much higher salary, though still not high by European standards, particularly if you are actually recruited in China. Something in the order of RMB6000 - 10,000 would be usual. Accommodation and living expenses It is usual for accommodation to be provided on site free by the employer. In China, employees have traditionally lived at their workplace and, although this is slowly changing, this is still the case in the education sector. The quality of accommodation varies - although it is never of a very high standard. Almost everyone in China lives in a flat consisting of a tiny kitchen, tiny shower room/toilet, living/dining room and two or three bedrooms. Flats above the ground floor always have a balcony but this is for hanging out your washing on and not for sitting comfortably! Heating is found in flats north of the Yangtze River but air-conditioning is not a universal feature. Accommodation in the business sector is often of a significantly higher quality. Workplaces often have canteens attached and you can live very cheaply by making use of these. It is difficult to eat alone at a Chinese restaurant as people usually share dishes and restaurants cannot cater easily for individuals but if you go out with a group of friends then RMB80 for 4 would be considered normal, though in a tourist area you would pay much more. Classes and teaching methods Classes in schools usually have a minimum of 60 students but 100 is not unusual. The situation is similar in universities, but in business, the situation will obviously vary from company to company The traditional method for teaching English is grammar translation - with a lot of chanting. The Chinese government is trying to introduce more communicative practices such as pair and group work, using information gap activities etc, and although it is possible use newer methods in the classroom, it is often logistically difficult. TEFL teachers in China are often told 'just to teach speaking and listening, not reading, writing or grammar', partly because the education system focuses heavily on exams and everyone has to take English exams, but it does make integrating the skills a great challenge. Chinese teachers prepare their students to a formula, not varying from the course books and the students prepare for the exams by memorising everything possible - which means that what the students do not get is conversation beyond memorised dialogues. If you plan to teach in China, it is a good idea to bring copies of your favourite books and cassettes with you since the schools will only have the national course books available (primary, junior and senior English for China). Some publishers such as Longman and Cambridge University Press have agreements with Chinese publishers to produce cheap copies of often-outdated EFL books, but the paper quality is poor and they really amount to nothing more than photocopies and often you can only get the books but not the tapes, or vice versa. Visas and paperwork There is an enormous amount of official form filling in China with a payment to be made at each stage, but your employer should pay for all of this. If you work in the public education sector, the local foreign affairs office will know of your placement and be available for problem solving or queries. It is advisable to bring some needles with you for any healthcheck, as you cannot always be sure that a doctor's needle has not been used before. Is China for me? As you may have realised, China is not an easy place to work in but because the people here are still not very used to foreigners, it makes for a more unusual place to work. Tourists usually stay in the main centres like Beijing, Shanghai or Xian and do not get a chance to meet 'ordinary' Chinese. English is incredibly important here and teachers in all subjects are rated highly. Because of this, there will always be someone to talk to. It is hard work and you cannot fight the authorities, you really must go with the flow. If you did not have an interest in psychology before working here, you will certainly acquire one. It's a fascinating place where the reward will be experience not money. Useful websites teflchina.com - By far the best website for information on teaching in China, including job information and lists you can join. Chinanow - a fine guide to city life in China, from finding your way around to discovering restaurants and things to do. Essential for researching where you'd want to be and for making sense of it all when you get there.

You know you're talking to a Ku Klux Gran when she says: \"I've never been abroad and I'm not about to start taking holidays overseas now - I don't know what all the fuss is about,\" or: \"I wouldn't know how to switch a computer on but it hasn't done me any harm - most people just use it for pornography anyway.\" \u0095 Data supplied by MediaCom TMB",

      "bodyText": "ITV's publicity pack for Popstars, the real-life music soap, focuses on the success of Bardot, the girl band formed for the Australian version of the show last year. There is no mention of TrueBliss, the original Popstars band, which was put together by the format's creator for the New Zealand version of the show in 1999. But then TrueBliss split up shortly before Christmas, after a long, slow decline from the heady days of mid-1999, when the five-piece girl band scored a number one single and album on the back of the Popstars TV show. The New Zealand version of Popstars was a hit on state broadcaster TVNZ's TV2 channel in the first half of 1999. ITV is hoping to follow in its footsteps when it launches Popstars this Wednesday. But it will be disappointed if the success of the pop band is as shortlived as that of TrueBliss. Initially the New Zealand band looked full of pop promise. TrueBliss' debut single Tonight went straight to number one in the local pop charts in May that year, with a successful tour and number one album Dream following shortly afterwards. But then things started to go wrong. Follow-up singles Number One and Freedom - a cover of the old Wham song - failed to reach the New Zealand top ten. By the autumn of 1999, Dream had been consigned to the bargain bin of local record shops and TrueBliss' five twentysomething female band members were talking about getting day jobs to supplement their meagre showbiz incomes. Sony was expected to release a second TrueBliss album early in 2000. But the record company dragged its feet about picking up an option to renew its contract with the band. The writing was certainly on the wall by July last year, when it emerged that band member Carly Binding had quit to pursue a solo career, backed by Popstars creator Jonathon Dowling. Another member of TrueBliss, Erika Takacs, has started out on a TV presenting career, fronting a TV2 pop chart show. By the end of the 13th and final episode week, ITV hopes to have a pop sensation on its hands and at least one hit single. But it will be Australia it will be looking to follow after that. Bardot, the down-under girl band are still going one year on, after a number one single and album. The group have signed a multi-record deal with Warner Music Australia and are planning to release a new single next month, with a second album to follow. Australian broadcaster Seven Network is planning a second series of Popstars, this time with a boy band.",

New media agencies are rushing to find the next big thing, such as pop-up boxes, interstitial messages appearing between webpages, websites, micro-sites and viral messages sent through email. Even the banner is being jazzed up with rich media functions that can throw simple shapes through the small horizontal space to get attention and therefore that all-important clickthrough. </p> <p>So why don't banners work? \"Banner\" is just a fancy word for a long, thin poster. The kind that are splashed on poster sites or bus sides all over the country, which seem to do their job without any fuss. And they can't even be animated very well. But most national bus, poster, radio or TV ads aren't measured by \"clickthroughs\" - the act of taking your mouse to the banner and clicking on it to be taken to another website in the hope that you might buy something. </p> <p>This is where the banner ad is failing. The efficiency of poster and broadcast ads can be measured by how well they are remembered by viewers and by how much sales increase. If the latest Persil TV ad was measured by how many letters viewers wrote to the company headquarters for more information, they'd be off the box before you could say \"whiter than white\". </p> <p>Ironically, when banner ads were first being sold, one of the appeals for the client was that they could see just how many people had responded to the ad by clicking through.

The trouble is, I don't know which half.\" Like direct marketing before it, interactive advertising offered a way to track how successful ads were and who responded by clicking through the banner. Sadly, as the novelty of the banner ad wore off for readers, it was soon apparent that approximately 99.7% of the clients' money was being wasted. </p> <p>There have been attempts to recapture this lost audience. For example, because research shows that the words \"Click Here\" on a banner ad increases the likelihood of clickthrough, most banner ads now seem to have that legend. A number are becoming more desperate in their \"tricks\" to capture the reader. The most infamous is Punch The Monkey For $20, an advert for sponsored money giveaway website Treeloot.com. Readers were asked to click on a monkey as it jumped from side to side across the banner with a cursor resembling a punchbag. However, those wishing to claim their $20 found increasingly tiresome tasks ahead - most gave up before their promised reward. </p> <p>Banner ads designed to resemble search engines, opinion polls or buttons tricked the reader into trying to use them. But they only led to the advertiser's website. This has taught readers not to trust such executions. Banner ads are behaving more like mewling babies, attempting to gain the reader's attention and immediate response with every cry and wail at their disposal. And, like good parents, readers are learning not to encourage them. </p> <p>But the fact that readers don't click through a banner doesn't mean they ignore it. You can be aware of a message without having to click on it. It's simply stopped being a medium where readers respond directly, there and then. </p> <p>Adam Jackson, associate creative director at Tribal DDB, wrote for Clickz Today: \"For a while, the click-through rate (CTR) was the most important metric.

      "byline": "David Teather",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The omens are not good for residents of the Marco Polo building, that paean to 1980s hubris in Battersea, south London. The candy-striped marble office block, which sits at the bottom of Chelsea Bridge, was home to the ill-fated squarial satellite television venture BSB. It then witnessed sinking sales and the threat of closure for the Observer newspaper, which was eventually rescued by the Guardian Media Group and shipped to Farringdon. </p> <p>ONdigital, which now shares the space with the home shopping network QVC, is aiming to break the curse. Stuart Prebble, its chief executive, has a touch of understated hubris himself. Next week the company will announce figures that are expected to show that the pay television group has hit the 1m subscriber mark. He maintains, with a deadpan expression, that the two-year-old company can still become the biggest operator of pay TV in Britain, despite the fact that it is currently lagging behind BSkyB by 4m households. </p> <p>\"We have reached this stage in two years when Sky didn't do that, NTL didn't do that and Telewest didn't do that,\" he says. \"For a new technology and an entirely new brand to have reached that milestone is very significant. It's a soaraway success.\" </p> <p>Some City analysts, however, are becoming increasingly cynical. Worries are being expressed over levels of churn (the rate at which customers leave the service), suggestions that the company has been massaging figures with one-off promotions, and boosted levels of investment needed to fund exclusive rights and internet services. When the two shareholders, Granada and Carlton, unveiled the platform in May 1998, they said it would need \u00a3300m funding, a figure which has since inflated to \u00a3950m. </p> <p>BSkyB, in the meantime, has lifted its own subscriber targets to 7m by the end of 2003. </p> <p>Among the critics is John Egan, a former ONdigital director who believes the company could go the way of BSB and find itself a part of Rupert Murdoch's empire. \"They are pumping money into set-top boxes which aren't producing the revenues they had hoped for. Nothing they currently offer looks like turning into a big revenue stream.\" </p> <p>The great hope on the horizon for Prebble is the sale of digital TV sets and, ultimately, the analogue switch-off. At that point ONdigital will have a clearer advantage over its cable and satellite rivals: it will simply need to supply a credit card-sized piece of plastic through the post that will slot into the back of the TV, reducing customer acquisition costs substantially. BSkyB will still need the satellite dish; NTL and Telewest will still need to dig up the road. </p> <p>Ending subsidising the cost of supplying free set-top boxes alone will be significant. Prebble claims that ONdigital is currently paying around \u00a3130 in subsidy for each set-top box, as well as retailer commissions and door-to-door salesmen. \"My sense is that the 15m households that have not yet adopted pay TV haven't been waiting for video on demand or for 40 channels to become 200; they are waiting for the barriers of entry to get lower, and we are in a much better position than any of our competitors to reduce the barriers to entry. </p> <p>\"Our cost of acquisition will probably go to a fifth of what it currently is, which means we can offer a multi-channel service that is much more flexible. If you only want to take two or three channels from us it will still be viable because the cost of acquiring the customer has gone down. </p> <p>\"We are all focused on trying to get more money from the 7m or 8m customers we've got. My objective is to get any money at all out of the 15m we haven't got.\" </p> <p>However, the sale of integrated digital sets has not been as rapid as ONdigital had hoped, and there are concerns that, in the meantime, BSkyB might simply eat up the market. To accelerate the take-up of digital sets, Prebble is in discussions with ITV, the BBC and the government about developing a joint campaign to sell them, including a possible Kitemark to take away customer confusion. </p> <p>\"If you hear 40 times a month, 'Starting on ITV2 now ...' then over a period you are going to think, 'I really need this channel,' \" he says. Prebble is also encouraged by the BBC's plans. \"BBC3 and BBC4 is exactly what I'd want them to do. As a viewer, if I had BBC1 and BBC2, I'd know I only had half the set. There are very conspicuously two other channels I don't have and I'd be asking, 'How do I get them?' </p> <p>\"We know that between now and the end of the decade we will move to analogue switch-off. Well, before that point, digital TVs will be ubiquitous. At that point it is so easy for us to get a customer, it doesn't take a big leap of faith to believe we could match and outpace Sky.\" </p> <p> In the here and now, the priority for Prebble is customer service and its effect on controlling churn. Since he took the helm at ONdigital 18 months ago, a new call centre has opened, more than doubling capacity, to ensure that all calls to the company are answered within 20 seconds - although he concedes that a technical hitch in the weekend before Christmas, with some customers losing many of their channels, saw the call centres jammed. He has also instigated a policy of calling customers a month after they sign their annual contract and a month before it expires to check on satisfaction. </p> <p>Fears in the City were particularly focused on the end of the contracts for the first wave of people who took advantage of the free set-top box offer. </p> <p>\"I expect churn in the next figures to be between 15% and 20%. In some months they were a little higher and some months lower,\" Prebble says. \"As an annual running average they won't be higher than 20%. I am absolutely convinced it will end up closer to 10-12% over a period of two or three years. </p> <p>\"We have to be utterly customer-focused. The cable companies have taught us an important lesson. They could have great customer service for five years before the perception that they have bad customer service evaporated.\" </p> <p>Flotation of the business has temporarily been put on hold. The most obvious reason is the uncertain state of the markets, but equally important is the consolidation of ITV. Carlton and Granada's dominance of ITV has created far clearer synergies. \"We need to have thought through and started to implement whatever is the sensible strategy between ourselves and ITV,\" Prebble says. \"If you believe, as I do, that there is enormous value in consolidating that relationship, it would be a bit eccentric to try and realise value in this business short of having done so. </p> <p>\"Any time you wanted Des Lynam to say, 'You can see the next match on ONdigital,' you had one shareholder in ITV saying, 'Why would we do that?' The consolidation of ITV has taken that barrier away so it means the scope of our discussions can be much more interesting. We will review the situation again, possibly in the spring.\" </p> <p>The delay, if nothing else, should quash rumours of Prebble's imminent departure. A wry smile appears when I bring up the subject of potentially lucrative share options that could make him a rich man by most standards if the business is listed. \"I don't think that's cynical. I think it's sensible,\" he says. </p> <p>ONdigital clearly still has much to go for. The service launched with 52% coverage of the population, which has expanded to 72%. Two strong selling points, Nickelodeon and the Paramount Comedy Channel, were added at the start of the month, and the platform will also carry E4, Channel 4's new entertainment channel. It is perhaps too early to judge the success of its web TV service. </p> <p>ONdigital will also continue to pursue exclusive rights in addition to its Champions League football and ATP tennis. Prebble raises the prospect of buying film rights direct from the studios to launch its own channels. \"We've made a couple of significant moves and will do more, because we have to. You can't be reliant on your main competitor for the key content that drives these platforms, especially when that competitor is Sky.

      "bodyText": "The omens are not good for residents of the Marco Polo building, that paean to 1980s hubris in Battersea, south London. The candy-striped marble office block, which sits at the bottom of Chelsea Bridge, was home to the ill-fated squarial satellite television venture BSB. It then witnessed sinking sales and the threat of closure for the Observer newspaper, which was eventually rescued by the Guardian Media Group and shipped to Farringdon. ONdigital, which now shares the space with the home shopping network QVC, is aiming to break the curse. Stuart Prebble, its chief executive, has a touch of understated hubris himself. Next week the company will announce figures that are expected to show that the pay television group has hit the 1m subscriber mark. He maintains, with a deadpan expression, that the two-year-old company can still become the biggest operator of pay TV in Britain, despite the fact that it is currently lagging behind BSkyB by 4m households. \"We have reached this stage in two years when Sky didn't do that, NTL didn't do that and Telewest didn't do that,\" he says. \"For a new technology and an entirely new brand to have reached that milestone is very significant. It's a soaraway success.\" Some City analysts, however, are becoming increasingly cynical. Worries are being expressed over levels of churn (the rate at which customers leave the service), suggestions that the company has been massaging figures with one-off promotions, and boosted levels of investment needed to fund exclusive rights and internet services. When the two shareholders, Granada and Carlton, unveiled the platform in May 1998, they said it would need \u00a3300m funding, a figure which has since inflated to \u00a3950m. BSkyB, in the meantime, has lifted its own subscriber targets to 7m by the end of 2003. Among the critics is John Egan, a former ONdigital director who believes the company could go the way of BSB and find itself a part of Rupert Murdoch's empire. \"They are pumping money into set-top boxes which aren't producing the revenues they had hoped for. Nothing they currently offer looks like turning into a big revenue stream.\" The great hope on the horizon for Prebble is the sale of digital TV sets and, ultimately, the analogue switch-off. At that point ONdigital will have a clearer advantage over its cable and satellite rivals: it will simply need to supply a credit card-sized piece of plastic through the post that will slot into the back of the TV, reducing customer acquisition costs substantially. BSkyB will still need the satellite dish; NTL and Telewest will still need to dig up the road. Ending subsidising the cost of supplying free set-top boxes alone will be significant. Prebble claims that ONdigital is currently paying around \u00a3130 in subsidy for each set-top box, as well as retailer commissions and door-to-door salesmen. \"My sense is that the 15m households that have not yet adopted pay TV haven't been waiting for video on demand or for 40 channels to become 200; they are waiting for the barriers of entry to get lower, and we are in a much better position than any of our competitors to reduce the barriers to entry. \"Our cost of acquisition will probably go to a fifth of what it currently is, which means we can offer a multi-channel service that is much more flexible. If you only want to take two or three channels from us it will still be viable because the cost of acquiring the customer has gone down. \"We are all focused on trying to get more money from the 7m or 8m customers we've got. My objective is to get any money at all out of the 15m we haven't got.\" However, the sale of integrated digital sets has not been as rapid as ONdigital had hoped, and there are concerns that, in the meantime, BSkyB might simply eat up the market. To accelerate the take-up of digital sets, Prebble is in discussions with ITV, the BBC and the government about developing a joint campaign to sell them, including a possible Kitemark to take away customer confusion. \"If you hear 40 times a month, 'Starting on ITV2 now ...' then over a period you are going to think, 'I really need this channel,' \" he says. Prebble is also encouraged by the BBC's plans. \"BBC3 and BBC4 is exactly what I'd want them to do. As a viewer, if I had BBC1 and BBC2, I'd know I only had half the set. There are very conspicuously two other channels I don't have and I'd be asking, 'How do I get them?' \"We know that between now and the end of the decade we will move to analogue switch-off. Well, before that point, digital TVs will be ubiquitous. At that point it is so easy for us to get a customer, it doesn't take a big leap of faith to believe we could match and outpace Sky.\" In the here and now, the priority for Prebble is customer service and its effect on controlling churn. Since he took the helm at ONdigital 18 months ago, a new call centre has opened, more than doubling capacity, to ensure that all calls to the company are answered within 20 seconds - although he concedes that a technical hitch in the weekend before Christmas, with some customers losing many of their channels, saw the call centres jammed. He has also instigated a policy of calling customers a month after they sign their annual contract and a month before it expires to check on satisfaction. Fears in the City were particularly focused on the end of the contracts for the first wave of people who took advantage of the free set-top box offer. \"I expect churn in the next figures to be between 15% and 20%. In some months they were a little higher and some months lower,\" Prebble says. \"As an annual running average they won't be higher than 20%. I am absolutely convinced it will end up closer to 10-12% over a period of two or three years. \"We have to be utterly customer-focused. The cable companies have taught us an important lesson. They could have great customer service for five years before the perception that they have bad customer service evaporated.\" Flotation of the business has temporarily been put on hold. The most obvious reason is the uncertain state of the markets, but equally important is the consolidation of ITV. Carlton and Granada's dominance of ITV has created far clearer synergies. \"We need to have thought through and started to implement whatever is the sensible strategy between ourselves and ITV,\" Prebble says. \"If you believe, as I do, that there is enormous value in consolidating that relationship, it would be a bit eccentric to try and realise value in this business short of having done so. \"Any time you wanted Des Lynam to say, 'You can see the next match on ONdigital,' you had one shareholder in ITV saying, 'Why would we do that?' The consolidation of ITV has taken that barrier away so it means the scope of our discussions can be much more interesting. We will review the situation again, possibly in the spring.\" The delay, if nothing else, should quash rumours of Prebble's imminent departure. A wry smile appears when I bring up the subject of potentially lucrative share options that could make him a rich man by most standards if the business is listed. \"I don't think that's cynical. I think it's sensible,\" he says. ONdigital clearly still has much to go for. The service launched with 52% coverage of the population, which has expanded to 72%. Two strong selling points, Nickelodeon and the Paramount Comedy Channel, were added at the start of the month, and the platform will also carry E4, Channel 4's new entertainment channel. It is perhaps too early to judge the success of its web TV service. ONdigital will also continue to pursue exclusive rights in addition to its Champions League football and ATP tennis. Prebble raises the prospect of buying film rights direct from the studios to launch its own channels. \"We've made a couple of significant moves and will do more, because we have to. You can't be reliant on your main competitor for the key content that drives these platforms, especially when that competitor is Sky. It is costly, but in the end it won't be significantly more costly than having a relationship with Sky where every time we sell a Sky channel to one of our customers we lose money. \"It's not clear to me why we should take our movies from Sky. The studios are very willing to deal directly with us and so we are looking at a whole range of content.\" Whether or not ONdigital has managed to break the Marco Polo curse will become apparent this time next year. The company has set a target for the end of 2002 of 2m subscribers, at which point it should begin breaking even. By the start of 2002 it should be clear how achievable that figure is.",

Alistair Ramsey, managing director of Dennis Publishing, said that Shape would sit well alongside Dennis's existing women's magazine, PS. Dennis beat Emap Active to buy the rights to Shape and Men's Fitness, two magazines published by Mollin Publishing, which has gone into administration. Mr Ramsey said Shape and PS could form the backbone of a new women's publishing department for Dennis, which currently focuses on computer and men's lifestyle magazines including Maxim, Stuff and PC Pro. Mr Ramsey said: \"Women's magazines and the health and fitness sectors will have a lot of longevity - there is a lot of value to be had there.\" He added that Dennis was interested in acquiring more magazines over the next year and predicted the closure of more small magazine publishers. Independent publishing company Mollin launched two titles in the UK two years ago, but confirmed at the end of last year that it was closing a third, Jump. Since then Mollin confirmed it was seeking investment amid reports that up to 30 freelance journalists had not been paid for work. Mr Ramsey said that all staff journalists on Men's Fitness and Shape would be kept on at Dennis.",

Especially since that ultimate test of BBC competence, a general election, looms in May. Following the Christmas interval, the final act begins this week. Will Tony Hall, director of BBC News for the past nine years, accept the powderkeg post he's been offered as director of the Royal Opera House? </p> <p>\"I am very, very tempted,\" said Hall last week, as he returned to his Henley-on-Thames home from his Dorset holiday retreat. Talks - haggling over terms - resume this week when Sir Colin Southgate, the ROH chairman, also gets back. The sticking point is the big drop in pay (from \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3150,000) and pensions - Hall is 50 in March, when generous BBC provisions kick in. </p> <p>The ROH offers a smaller budget and fewer staff, but a graceful exit for the head boy to John Birt's headmaster, whose annual Tuscan holidays take in Verona's summer opera festival. Bosses before him have moved from broadcasting to the arts. Sir Jeremy Isaacs left Channel 4 for Covent Garden 13 years ago; John Tusa, ex-BBC, runs the Barbican. </p> <p>Since Hall lost the race against Greg Dyke for the director-generalship, he has looked an obvious candidate for pastures new, provided the grass was green. Dyke has encroached on his territory with Jeff Randall's appointment as business editor and the abrupt order to move news to 10pm and Panorama to Sundays. </p> <p>But where does Hall's expected departure leave BBC News? As a headless chicken, encouraging politicians to swoop? Or an open door for a Dyke placeman to shake things up? </p> <p>Hall would like to see the election through, savour one last time the calls from cabinet ministers and their shadows. But the man he's expected to succeed, Michael Kaiser, is already back in Washington. Then there is a potential conflict of interest. The Opera House is a public body and the tabloids thrill when things go wrong for subsidised toffs. </p> <p>Long handovers are not Dyke's preferred style. He is expected to resist an outside trawl - and not call in a big fish such as Chris Cramer, the ex-BBC man now running CNN international services. </p> <p>He will appoint internally, and swiftly, say sources close to him. The favourites must be Hall's deputy, Richard Sambrook, highly regarded for his straight talking, with Mark Byford, director of the World Service, also fancied. Other possibles include Mark Damazer, the news empire's brainy assistant director, and Roger Mosey, the canny head of TV news. But down-to-earth Sambrook - his frank public admission of BBC mistakes in covering the green movement in Edinburgh six years ago was a rare treat - held the fort for Dyke in sport last summer, and may break the rule that deputies don't succeed. A key task of any successor will be to bring in new blood lower down, especially to resuscitate the dismal Breakfast programme. </p> <p>In contrast to Hall's wavering, one vital decision was made smartly. On Christmas Eve, Jonathan Baker, a BBC \"lifer\" who shepherded the Nine O'Clock News smoothly to its new 10pm slot, was appointed world news editor. He's being replaced by Mark Popescu, currently editor of the relaunched Six o'Clock News. Both stay in post until after the election. There were no interviews for the 10pm job, more powerful than a Fleet Street editorship. </p> <p>At 40, Popescu is the coming man. Decisive, and famed for his eye for a story, his rise has been meteoric since he joined the BBC from ITN two years ago. It's as if ITN's greater stress on news-getting is being gradually instilled in the vast BBC machine. After helping to sort out News 24, he was entrusted with revamping the 6pm bulletin, now the UK's most popular news programme. His onward march and concentration on big popular stories (as opposed to Birtist analysis) is meeting some internal nervousness. But Popescu was struck by what he terms the enclosed metropolitan nature of BBC news: people drawing ideas from newspapers, following the agenda set by the Today programme. He demanded a fresh approach, scrapped stale packages running all day, and told correspondents to get out of the capital and illustrate stories such as NHS waiting lists with real-life instances of people dying from postponed operations. </p> <p>Asked about his image as a tabloid populariser, he says, \"People who don't like modernisation find the easiest way to attack it is by turning what I do into dumbing down. News programmes are living organisms. Look at The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, they do consumer news, showbusiness.\" </p> <p>Popescu's generalship is crucial because on January 23 (probably) ITV will partly reinstate News at Ten, setting up Britain's first experience of a head-to-head mass-channel news battle. The BBC desperately needs to keep up audiences, and satisfy a six- month review by politicians. </p> <p>Then there's the election. The good news is that the BBC's 10pm News will not be expanded by more than six to seven minutes, according to Jonathan Baker - lessons have been learnt from the 1997 election, when the 9pm bulletin was extended to a lumbering 45-50 minutes and audiences turned off in droves. </p> <p>The 10pm bulletin has changed since shifting its slot in October, he says. It is not, as the BBC promised at the time, the old Nine O'Clock News. The tone is pacier with shorter reports (two minutes instead of three) because by 10pm more has happened - more sports reports, more live interviews with Andrew Marr, for example. Baker makes no apology for the substantial coverage of Madonna's recent wedding. \"I've tried to make [the agenda] slightly broader,\" says Baker, \"and improve story-telling, with attractive pictures - after all, it's part of a TV channel.\" Popescu will accelerate this approach. It seems the straight-talking pragmatists are inheriting BBC News.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> The phone on my desk was ringing. \"Is that Mr Tooooolis,\" said the voice of a perfect but familiar stranger, his long Afrikaans vowels ringing in my ears. He did not introduce himself, but then he never needed to: he was a security policeman, part of the illegal South African occupation of Namibia. I answered and then waited, already knowing what was coming next. \"You're not verking at the Namibian newspaper are you, Mr Tooooolis?\" </p> <p>I did not answer because there was nothing I could say or do. This phone call was not an inquiry but an executive act: his words and the decision were synchronous - I was being expelled from the country. </p> <p>The year was 1986 and the Namibian was the sole voice of opposition to a nasty racist regime. Namibia was the last colony on African soil. Originally a German colony, it had been virtually annexed by South Africa in 1916. In 1966 the UN ordered South Africa to leave. To no one's great surprise the apartheid regime refused to go. </p> <p>I wasn't anyone important, a mere irritant, an easily removable bit-player in the long struggle for independence in Namibia. But that did not matter. In the eyes of the white security men I was probably a \"terrorist\", a \"white Swapo\" - a follower of the liberation movement that challenged Afrikaner rule. Worst of all, I was a racial traitor, a foreign \"kaffir boetie\" - black-lover - working for what they considered to be a communist newspaper. I was the enemy. </p> <p>I had joined the paper after answering an ad in the Guardian's Media section to help train black Namibian reporters, but soon ended up reporting myself. It was not exactly a cushy number. Not long after I left, the paper's offices were firebombed, the windows shot out and the editor, Gwen Lister, sent repeated death threats. </p> <p>The paper's barrister, Anton Lubowski, was assassinated in 1989, on the eve of independence, by a killer from a notorious apartheid death squad, the Civil Co-operation Bureau. In his confession, the killer said he had also been told to target Lister. No one took the Namibian more seriously than apartheid's security policemen. </p> <p>In the mid-80s Namibia's tiny capital Windhoek was a back-water, but to the north of this huge semi-desert country the armies of apartheid were locked in two cruelly bitter wars. Deep in Angola the South African Defence Force was fighting, and losing, a desperate rearguard action against a Cuban expeditionary force equipped with the latest sophisticated Soviet fighters and air defence systems. Inside Namibia a vicious guerrilla counter-insurgency war was raging in which South African mercenaries \"slotted\" gooks and, like the ancient Romans, paraded their bodies as trophies through the surrounding villages. We did not know it but Pretoria's evil empire was falling. </p> <p>What I did know was that it was great in that Namibian dawn to be a young journalist. I was 26. Every day I would get out of bed, shoulder my verbal armour, and go out to report and denounce the cruelties of South Africa's racist regime. The sun shone, the stories kept coming, and we would end our days jumping into suburban swimming pools, drinking cold beers or getting stoned on Natal grass. </p> <p>In apartheid's final days, Namibia had one of the most complicated governments ever invented. Theoretically, there were nine governments to reflect the nine tribal groups that composed Namibia's 1.3m population. In reality, there was just one white colonial administrator and a row of \"black puppets\" in what was known derisively as the \"so-called Transitional Government of National Unity\", or TGNU for short. The whole thing was as unreal as a Hollywood stage set. All the puppets' offices, from the blond Afrikaner secretaries to the immaculate rosewood furniture, had the air of being props that could instantly be switched to the next location. </p> <p>Equally strange was the composition of the local press, which included English, Afrikaans and German dailies with tiny circulations, and a weekly, the Windhoek Observer, that ran inquest photos of white suicide cases on the front page to fill space. I can still remember the sad, bloated face of one middle-aged German hausfrau staring out of the passenger window of the family car in which she had asphyxiated herself. </p> <p>But apart from the Namibian, all toed the government line. The paper was and is the child of one woman, its editor Gwen Lister. Lister, a white South African with an Imelda Marcos-like love of good shoes and a 60-a-day cigarette habit, was the first real hero I ever met, and like all real heroes was a bad, mad and dangerous person to know. If she was ever afraid, then she did a good job of hiding it. </p> <p>Lister had been pursued by the regime from paper to paper for her outspoken criticism until she had run out of papers to be sacked from. Her solution was to found the Namibian with money donated originally by the European Union as a \"development project\". The presses started rolling again, printing the truth about what was going on in Namibia under apartheid rule. </p> <p>Independence came in 1990 and the Nambian went daily. A black Swapo government took power but, ironically, the Nambian, which had campaigned so vigorously for freedom, was soon cast again as the lone voice of opposition to the government. </p> <p>\"The Swapo government has failed to keep up with the idea that although we shared their aims for independence, we are an independent newspaper and our role now is to act as a watchdog scrutinising the actions of that government. In fairness they have never tried to clamp down but they attack us verbally almost on a daily basis,\" says Lister. </p> <p>Instead of atrocities, the Namibian, under the slogan, \"Telling it like it is\", now reports on government corruption scandals, the sub-Saharan Aids crisis and the rumbling opposition to Swapo President Sam Nujoma's autocratic-style rule. </p> <p>In peace the Namibian, run as a non-profit trust, has grown to become Namibia's biggest- selling newspaper with a staff of 100 and a daily circulation of 21,000 - a huge achievement given Namibia's literacy rate and immense distances. Financially the paper is self-sustaining and it has just celebrated its 15th birthday. </p> <p>The existence of a small paper such as the Namibian, in the face of murder and bombing attacks, is a sweet reminder that sometimes even in the cynical world of journalism some dreams do come true. And that a small band of journalists committed to a dream of freedom can help make the world a better place.</p>",

In fairness they have never tried to clamp down but they attack us verbally almost on a daily basis,\" says Lister. Instead of atrocities, the Namibian, under the slogan, \"Telling it like it is\", now reports on government corruption scandals, the sub-Saharan Aids crisis and the rumbling opposition to Swapo President Sam Nujoma's autocratic-style rule. In peace the Namibian, run as a non-profit trust, has grown to become Namibia's biggest- selling newspaper with a staff of 100 and a daily circulation of 21,000 - a huge achievement given Namibia's literacy rate and immense distances. Financially the paper is self-sustaining and it has just celebrated its 15th birthday. The existence of a small paper such as the Namibian, in the face of murder and bombing attacks, is a sweet reminder that sometimes even in the cynical world of journalism some dreams do come true. And that a small band of journalists committed to a dream of freedom can help make the world a better place.",

      "body": "<p>It is tempting to imagine an air of impermanence in Rebecca Hardy's editor's office at the Scotsman. There's a distinct lack of clutter and no stamp of personality. A large calculator dominates the desk; the video player still has its instructions in a plastic bag on top of it, the walls are largely bare and, as we discover in a somewhat embarrassing moment, there are no copies of that day's paper anywhere in the room. </p> <p>But then, ever since she took over last year as Scotland's first woman editor, barely a week has gone by without a fresh buzz of speculation that the former showbusiness editor of the Daily Mail is about to vacate the plush office at Barclay House. And much of that speculation has come from within the shiny new Scotsman building itself. </p> <p>Hardy didn't exactly step cleanly into the job. She was shunted into it last May by publisher and editor in chief Andrew Neil after the paper lost its sixth editor in as many years. Tim Luckhurst had lasted three weeks at the helm after the departure of Alan Ruddock, before taking a short sick leave from which he didn't return. Hardy, 35, who had been drafted in as joint deputy editor to transform features coverage, became acting editor, then editor, just weeks after arriving in Scotland. </p> <p>\"I feel quite sorry for her,\" says one senior Scottish newspaper executive. \"She was really dumped right into it. She ended up with a job she had not applied for and probably would not have applied for. And she is not believed to have made a success of it.\" </p> <p>Hardy bristles at such talk and wields a clutch of statistics in her defence. And, indeed, in the past year the Scotsman's fortunes have revived dramatically. Between June and November last year, daily sales of the paper rose by 33.6%, to an average of 102,958. The leap followed a multi-million pound relaunch and promotional campaign and a price cut, initially to 20p and then up to 30p in September. Officials for the publishers, Press Holdings Ltd, say that 54% of the new readers are women and that there has also been a marked increase in the number of younger readers. Hardy says that the Scotsman, which was in terminal decline just over a year ago with sales bottoming out at 72,000, now outsells all the London broadsheets combined north of the border. </p> <p>There are rumours that she has just received a \"huge\" bonus from the Scotsman's owners, the Barclay brothers, but there is also talk that the sales figures for December show circulation back below 95,000. Press Holdings says it will be closer to 98,000. Andrew Neil, meanwhile, continues, publicly, to back his latest appointee. </p> <p>One senior Scotsman journalist said reports that Hardy's days were numbered were \"complete nonsense\" and claimed she had not been given a chance by the Scottish journalistic establishment. \"She's here for the long haul and it's a pretty stable environment we have here now. There's no sense that her coming up from London has damaged the paper.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think anyone said to my face I shouldn't be given the job,\" says Hardy. \"I think it has been a success and I think it is a success. Success is a continuing thing. </p> <p>\"I enjoy the job enormously. I'm not planning on going anywhere. I find it intriguing that an editor - and team - who have put on 33% in sales, the biggest British newspaper success story of 2000 in terms of percentage increases; that changed the demographics of the newspaper as well as retaining the loyal, established readership; that there should be question marks raised about their length of tenure.\" </p> <p>She also dismisses rumours that she was recently offered, and rejected, a move from editor to the amorphous post of group features editor. \"The only jobs I have been offered by this group are deputy editor, which I came up for, and editor,\" she says. Nor does she seem perturbed by the appointment of former Scotland on Sunday editor John McGurk as group editorial director, a position some say will dilute her role substantially; or the arrival of John Mullin, the driven and well-regarded former Guardian journalist, as her deputy. </p> <p>Hardy is equally upbeat about staff morale, an area she promised to address when she took over. And the Scotsman badly needed a unifying presence. Following the departure of Ruddock, experienced staff fled from the paper or were unceremoniously dumped. Hardy thinks the exodus has been beneficial. </p> <p>\"I think staff morale is really good. I genuinely do. Stability is a long-term thing and I think the nature of Scottish journalism is that people tend to move about with frightening speed. I know that the staff one is keen to retain as part of the team are very happy with the direction of the new Scotsman.\" </p> <p>Only it's still not clear where the paper is headed. It looks better than it ever has and its features coverage is bright and on-the-button. But the news agenda puzzles many in the Scottish establishment and on rival publications. \"Eccentric is how it is viewed,\" says another newspaper executive. \"There are times when you are amazed by their choice of lead or front-page stories and you wonder what on earth they are thinking about. It is not lack of ability on Rebecca's part, it is lack of close understanding of Scottish affairs.\" </p> <p>Hardy refutes this. \"I think that's complete nonsense. I think you can take cheap shots at people very easily.\" She says the paper is simply following the lead of the London titles. </p> <p>\"I don't think our choice and selection of news stories is any different to the London papers. The Scotsman used to be called the grand old man of Scottish journalism. Well, grand old men die and the reality is if the Scotsman had continued as the paper of record that it was, there becomes a bottom line which it doesn't meet and that was the path that the Scotsman was following. You know, some people don't like change. I think the Scotsman has changed enormously. I think the change was absolutely necessary. The research shows that people feel there is more of a sense of humour, that it is more vibrant. They like the mix of stories, the mix of light and more serious articles, and it still remains a paper of record.\" </p> <p>Her own vision for the paper is grandiose, if a little puzzling. She seems particularly concerned about the fate of \"Scotland's islands\". </p> <p>\"The intellectual and cultural heart and future of the country has not been protected by a national newspaper that has the Scottish peo ple's interests at heart and I think that is where a lot of our success has been; repositioning ourselves as a national. </p> <p>\"The social and economic change going on within Scotland, the paper is reflecting it and pushing it. We're moving into a digital age. There's still islands that don't have ISDN lines and whole areas of Scotland that aren't connected up. Forcing that through, highlighting that is enormously important. </p> <p>\"We're going to campaign for the islands. If one's not careful they will become very nice sort of holiday homes and they lose their heart. Just ensuring, particularly with the digital age, that they have the facilities, that they are funded facility-wise so that people can run companies from home with their computers; making travel cheaper, subsidising that so that they are not cut off, remote little areas.\" </p> <p> Before she arrived in Edinburgh Hardy's strongest link with Scotland was her four years studying at Aberdeen University where she read English. After graduation she applied to the Scotsman for a trainee position but was turned down. She went, instead, to the Brighton Evening Argus and from there to the Mail where she stormed through the ranks, building a fearsome reputation as a skilled and ruthless interviewer. Staff who worked for her as showbusiness editor talked of suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. </p> <p>For all her skills at the sharp end of the pen, however, she clearly dislikes being interviewed herself. After an hour of chat she worries that she has not come across well. \"I was told to show my sense of humour.\" She then offers an anecdote about her four-year-old son and how he swam a whole length of the swimming pool at her urging, braving the deep end with his water wings on. She says it's to show what a determined and tough little character he is, that sometimes you have to just jump in and get on with things. </p> <p>\"It's easy for people to take cheap shots at you,\" she adds. \"You read a lot about yourself that's nonsense, some of it that's true. You have to laugh at it. It is part and parcel of the job. You don't expect to win a personality contest being an editor.\" </p> <p>There are many here, however, who continue to think she won't have to worry about that for much longer. \"The dogs on the street say it won't be too long into the year before there's someone else sitting in her chair,\" says a senior Scottish journalist. \"It is not an easy job. I'm not sure she realised how difficult it was when she took it on, but I think she knows now.\"</p>",

You have to laugh at it. It is part and parcel of the job. You don't expect to win a personality contest being an editor.\" There are many here, however, who continue to think she won't have to worry about that for much longer. \"The dogs on the street say it won't be too long into the year before there's someone else sitting in her chair,\" says a senior Scottish journalist. \"It is not an easy job. I'm not sure she realised how difficult it was when she took it on, but I think she knows now.\"",

      "bodyText": "The BBC is developing a drama based on Victoria Coren's monologue about John Diamond's experience of cancer. Olivia Lichtenstein, BBC creative director, general documentaries, has secured the rights to the play and is developing it for a one-off TV drama. A Lump in my Throat, a one-man play compiled by Ms Coren from the newspaper columns of Mr Diamond, debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe last summer, with Mr Diamond played by his friend, the journalist Robert Katz. The BBC said the play had not been commissioned, but a source confirmed that it was in development. Journalist and former broadcaster John Diamond's columns in the Times won not only critical plaudits but bags of mail from members of the public who were enthralled and disgusted in equal measure by his candid revelations about the disease. Over the course of three years, Mr Diamond has chronicled the impact of cancer on his life and work. He is married to food writer and critic Nigella Lawson, with whom he has two children.",

But the irony is that the case that spelled it out was not about some sensitive, shrinking celebrity anxious to avoid prying paparazzi lenses or intrusive tabloid inquiries. On the contrary, the people seeking to assert their right to privacy had deliberately courted massive publicity and had been paid a huge sum of money to allow themselves to be seen in the world's media.</p> <p>The problem was that the publicity that Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones received for their New York wedding in November wasn't exactly what they wanted. They asked the courts of England to rule that, even though they had sold off a part of their privacy for \u00a31m, they were still entitled to the protection of the law. The judges, citing our new Human Rights Act, agreed.</p> <p>The wedding of the year (until it was supplanted by Madonna's) was held at the Plaza Hotel under conditions of absurdly exaggerated security. The reason was not so much the possibility of gatecrashers as the far more horrifying threat of uninvited cameras. Douglas and Zeta-Jones had signed a contract giving OK! magazine exclusive rights to taking and publishing photos of the nuptials. Invited guests were sternly warned not to bring cameras; they were electronically frisked anyway. Everyone working at the wedding signed a draconian contract promising not to take snaps, on pain of unimaginable legal consequences if they disobeyed.</p> <p>But some cameras did sneak in, including one whose portfolio of nine not very good photos found its way to arch-rival Hello! magazine, which, to OK!'s dismay, was to publish them three days before OK! went on sale.</p> <p>And so to court. OK! raised several legal issues in its - ultimately unsuccessful - attempt to stop Hello! from publishing. But the point that raised the privacy issue came from the Douglases personally. They want to sue Hello! for damages for breach of privacy. But surely they had abandoned their right - or sold it - by allowing the ceremony and reception to be photographed, and the results published?</p> <p>Not quite, said Lord Justice Sedley in the appeal court. They had insisted on a veto over what photos were to be used, \"in order to maintain the kind of image which is professionally and personally important to them\". By retaining that editorial control, they were in effect saying that any pictures other than those personally chosen by them invaded their privacy.</p> <p>The appeal court decided that the newlyweds were likely to succeed in any claim for damages against Hello! for breach of privacy. Whether in fact they win their case and how much they will get if they do is for a future court to decide. What's important is that this was the first case in which an English court has specifically said that we now have a law of privacy to protect individuals. The second case may well come later today, with a decision on the claim of the two killers of James Bulger to be granted lifetime anonymity. The Human Rights Act gives them the right to be left alone, free from media prying, they say.</p> <p>But there is another twist to the law. The right to privacy arises because Britain has incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into our national laws. Article 8 says that \"everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life\". But a little way further is Article 10, which guarantees the freedom of expression and freedom of the press. When the media want to publish something - whether information or pictures - about someone's private life, the two are bound to clash.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act exhorts the judges to have particular regard to freedom of expression when deciding which way to rule, and gives the media a public-interest defence against anyone trying to stop them from publishing. That still leaves the judges with a sensitive balancing act to perform, and it is by no means clear which way they will turn when faced with a free speech-versus-media intrusion dilemma.</p> <p>Other countries in Europe which have had privacy laws for decades don't always provide clear-cut solutions. In France, celebrities - Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Adjani and Brigitte Bardot among them - are used to going to court to complain that photographs have been taken of them without their consent, but the line between private and public occasions has often proved hard to draw.</p> <p>Until recently, the French press has been particularly timid in revealing information about politicians, even where it would have been in the public interest. The late President Mitterrand's cancer, surely relevant to his capacity to carry out his duties, was kept from the nation virtually throughout his presidency, as was the existence of his daughter by a long-term lover - though that revelation might not have met the public interest test.</p> <p>The French privacy laws have also had a chilling effect in an area that worries the British media - the investigation of wrongdoing and corruption. It is generally accepted that crooked businessmen and dodgy politicians are more easily able to escape scrutiny because of the deterrent effect of privacy laws.</p> <p>In Germany, with its relatively recent experience of dictatorship, the right to free speech is treated with particular reverence. German judges are constantly having to balance it against individuals' claims that their privacy has been invaded.

But the irony is that the case that spelled it out was not about some sensitive, shrinking celebrity anxious to avoid prying paparazzi lenses or intrusive tabloid inquiries. On the contrary, the people seeking to assert their right to privacy had deliberately courted massive publicity and had been paid a huge sum of money to allow themselves to be seen in the world's media. The problem was that the publicity that Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones received for their New York wedding in November wasn't exactly what they wanted. They asked the courts of England to rule that, even though they had sold off a part of their privacy for \u00a31m, they were still entitled to the protection of the law.

      "body": "<p>Steal This Book was the title of Abbie Hoffman's 1970 hippy manual. One was tempted. More so than if one saw the instruction in Tesco to Steal This Can of Baked Beans. \"Books,\" the book trade insists, \"are different.\" No one ever said: \"Where baked beans are burned, men are burned.\" Nor do mundane rules about meum et tuum apply. </p> <p>I asked a colleague if she had any instructive stories on the subject of book stealing. Yes, she said. She once knew a guy in Foyle's who offered to get anything she needed \"cut rate\". He duly came out in Charing Cross Road at closing time with a bundle of volumes, looking shifty. They were pilfered, of course. \"Loads of people here do it,\" he explained. \"The pay's so lousy.\" The point is, she kept the books. But what, she asked herself, if he had dipped his hand in the till and given her a bunch of fivers? She would have shopped him and returned the stolen cash. But books were, somehow, \"different\". </p> <p>Booksellers used to agree. Once upon a time, Blackwells accepted that needy Oxford students would plunder their shelves. The shop politely requested that, later in life, they should make a \"conscience\" payment for their shoplifting. Many did. Alas, a notice went up 20 years ago saying, effectively, no more Mr Nice Guy. Don't steal your book from Blackwells. It now prosecutes as brutally as Tesco. </p> <p>I wouldn't misappropriate my neighbour's ox or ass. But, as my bookshelves witness, I have, over the years, been light-fingered about the printed word. As students we walked out of libraries with books up our jumpers, not with larcenous intent, but because check-out was such a hassle. The libraries turned a blind eye. Most of the books came back. We trusted one another. But, sometimes, one forgot. </p> <p>If you want a measure of the evaporation of mutual trust in British society, consider libraries, or more specifically, the London Library, set up in 1841 by Thomas Carlyle and friends. The great Scottish grump was fed up with the British Museum and \"the man with the bassoon nose\" who invariably sat next to him (Karl Marx, one would like to think). Gentlemen like Carlyle wanted a library where they could range at will, unfettered by irksome security. </p> <p>Notwithstanding the introduction of some discreet control on its front door, the London Library remains a trusting institution. Members continue to wander its shelves as unfettered as Carlyle did, and are waved in and out by the solicitous staff, with no more impolite poking in bags than he suffered. I wouldn't mind betting that Carlyle's shelves at the time of his death contained a couple of London Library books he had forgotten to return. </p> <p>Much, however, has had to change at the London Library as a result of rising levels of theft. The current librarian, Alan Bell, divides book theft into two categories: misdemeanour and felony. Lesser breaches of the rules are, however, just as inconvenient for the members, he points out, when books vanish from circulation. Smart villains don't steal books. If valuable they will be property-marked and there are fewer reliable fences among antiquarian book dealers than among, say, jewellers. </p> <p>The trick is to steal \"plates\" (pictures or maps). Plates are easily razored out. They are usually unstamped and can be disposed of through auction houses or antique shops. Many end up, behind glass, in living rooms. </p> <p>The London Library and British Library, a couple of years ago, won a notable victory over a villain from Leeds who, in Yorkshire and then in London, was methodically gutting valuable books of their plates to pay his gambling debts. This \"Yorkshire Ripper\" got four years (in my view he should have got as much as the other one). </p> <p>Book kleptomaniacs are odder fish. They usually have better taste than mere villains, Bell tells me. Damn them. Bell is a man of much learning, but a series of major thefts means that nowadays he has to be much more of a custodian than merely a knowledgeable curator of books. Modern librarians will know as much about security systems as incunabula. Libraries have changed and so has everything else (even the London Library). </p> <p>The more \"security\" we have, the less secure we feel, because without trust, we're all criminal suspects. Every shop sees us as potential shoplifters; every rail company sees us as potential fare-dodgers; every bank as potential robbers and every airline sees us as potential bombers. Employers see us as potential misusers of the firm's computer. And perhaps we are (potentially) all those things. After all, we did steal that library book 30 years ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steal This Book was the title of Abbie Hoffman's 1970 hippy manual. One was tempted. More so than if one saw the instruction in Tesco to Steal This Can of Baked Beans. \"Books,\" the book trade insists, \"are different.\" No one ever said: \"Where baked beans are burned, men are burned.\" Nor do mundane rules about meum et tuum apply. I asked a colleague if she had any instructive stories on the subject of book stealing. Yes, she said. She once knew a guy in Foyle's who offered to get anything she needed \"cut rate\". He duly came out in Charing Cross Road at closing time with a bundle of volumes, looking shifty. They were pilfered, of course. \"Loads of people here do it,\" he explained. \"The pay's so lousy.\" The point is, she kept the books. But what, she asked herself, if he had dipped his hand in the till and given her a bunch of fivers? She would have shopped him and returned the stolen cash. But books were, somehow, \"different\". Booksellers used to agree. Once upon a time, Blackwells accepted that needy Oxford students would plunder their shelves. The shop politely requested that, later in life, they should make a \"conscience\" payment for their shoplifting. Many did. Alas, a notice went up 20 years ago saying, effectively, no more Mr Nice Guy. Don't steal your book from Blackwells. It now prosecutes as brutally as Tesco. I wouldn't misappropriate my neighbour's ox or ass. But, as my bookshelves witness, I have, over the years, been light-fingered about the printed word. As students we walked out of libraries with books up our jumpers, not with larcenous intent, but because check-out was such a hassle. The libraries turned a blind eye. Most of the books came back. We trusted one another. But, sometimes, one forgot. If you want a measure of the evaporation of mutual trust in British society, consider libraries, or more specifically, the London Library, set up in 1841 by Thomas Carlyle and friends. The great Scottish grump was fed up with the British Museum and \"the man with the bassoon nose\" who invariably sat next to him (Karl Marx, one would like to think). Gentlemen like Carlyle wanted a library where they could range at will, unfettered by irksome security. Notwithstanding the introduction of some discreet control on its front door, the London Library remains a trusting institution. Members continue to wander its shelves as unfettered as Carlyle did, and are waved in and out by the solicitous staff, with no more impolite poking in bags than he suffered. I wouldn't mind betting that Carlyle's shelves at the time of his death contained a couple of London Library books he had forgotten to return. Much, however, has had to change at the London Library as a result of rising levels of theft. The current librarian, Alan Bell, divides book theft into two categories: misdemeanour and felony. Lesser breaches of the rules are, however, just as inconvenient for the members, he points out, when books vanish from circulation. Smart villains don't steal books. If valuable they will be property-marked and there are fewer reliable fences among antiquarian book dealers than among, say, jewellers. The trick is to steal \"plates\" (pictures or maps). Plates are easily razored out. They are usually unstamped and can be disposed of through auction houses or antique shops. Many end up, behind glass, in living rooms. The London Library and British Library, a couple of years ago, won a notable victory over a villain from Leeds who, in Yorkshire and then in London, was methodically gutting valuable books of their plates to pay his gambling debts. This \"Yorkshire Ripper\" got four years (in my view he should have got as much as the other one). Book kleptomaniacs are odder fish. They usually have better taste than mere villains, Bell tells me. Damn them. Bell is a man of much learning, but a series of major thefts means that nowadays he has to be much more of a custodian than merely a knowledgeable curator of books. Modern librarians will know as much about security systems as incunabula. Libraries have changed and so has everything else (even the London Library). The more \"security\" we have, the less secure we feel, because without trust, we're all criminal suspects. Every shop sees us as potential shoplifters; every rail company sees us as potential fare-dodgers; every bank as potential robbers and every airline sees us as potential bombers. Employers see us as potential misusers of the firm's computer. And perhaps we are (potentially) all those things. After all, we did steal that library book 30 years ago.",

She was sentenced to death a year ago for the murder of a close friend, Maria Wolmarans, whose husband she later married.</p> <p>The appeal hearing begins on Wednesday, the fiftieth birthday of the mother of three. Bosch is represented by a British barrister, Desmond de Silva.</p> <p>Marietta Bosch moved to Botswana with her first husband nine years ago and settled in a well-off area of the capital Gaborone where they became friends with Maria and Tienie Wolmarans.</p> <p>Then Bosch's husband was killed in a car crash in 1995. Within months she started an affair with Mr Wolmarans. He promised to divorce his wife but apparently not quickly enough for Bosch.</p> <p>In June 1996, she borrowed a pistol from a friend in South Africa, returned home and shot Mrs Wolmarans twice. Police were unable to solve the crime, but Bosch made what could prove to be two fatal mistakes.</p> <p>She revealed her relationship with Tienie Wolmarans by ordering a wedding dress from a Pretoria designer, and she gave the murder weapon to her late husband's brother. His wife, Juliet - said in court to loathe Marietta Bosch - took it to the police.</p> <p>After Bosch was arrested, Tienie Wolmarans married her, even though she was charged with killing his wife.</p> <p>Isaac Aboagye, the high court judge in Botswana who sentenced Bosch to death a year ago, told her: \"I have not been able to find one moral extenuating circumstance.\"</p> <p>If the appeal is turned down, Bosch will still be entitled to a clemency hearing. Of the 14 death sentences in Botswana in the past decade, six have been commuted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British and African judges are to hear an appeal this week by a white South African socialite sentenced to hang in Botswana for a killing described by the prosecution as embracing \"the four Ls of murder - love, loot, lust and loathing\". Sir John Blufeld from England and Lord Weir of Scotland will sit with three other Commonwealth judges - from Nigeria, Zimbabwe and South Africa - to constitute the Botswana appeals court, as stipulated under the former colony's judicial provisions. If executed, Marietta Bosch will be the first woman to hang in Botswana for 30 years. She was sentenced to death a year ago for the murder of a close friend, Maria Wolmarans, whose husband she later married. The appeal hearing begins on Wednesday, the fiftieth birthday of the mother of three. Bosch is represented by a British barrister, Desmond de Silva. Marietta Bosch moved to Botswana with her first husband nine years ago and settled in a well-off area of the capital Gaborone where they became friends with Maria and Tienie Wolmarans. Then Bosch's husband was killed in a car crash in 1995. Within months she started an affair with Mr Wolmarans. He promised to divorce his wife but apparently not quickly enough for Bosch. In June 1996, she borrowed a pistol from a friend in South Africa, returned home and shot Mrs Wolmarans twice. Police were unable to solve the crime, but Bosch made what could prove to be two fatal mistakes. She revealed her relationship with Tienie Wolmarans by ordering a wedding dress from a Pretoria designer, and she gave the murder weapon to her late husband's brother. His wife, Juliet - said in court to loathe Marietta Bosch - took it to the police. After Bosch was arrested, Tienie Wolmarans married her, even though she was charged with killing his wife. Isaac Aboagye, the high court judge in Botswana who sentenced Bosch to death a year ago, told her: \"I have not been able to find one moral extenuating circumstance.\" If the appeal is turned down, Bosch will still be entitled to a clemency hearing. Of the 14 death sentences in Botswana in the past decade, six have been commuted.",

      "bodyText": "General Augusto Pinochet defied a court order to submit to medical tests at a hospital in Santiago yesterday, and instead remained holed up with military allies in his seaside home, south-west of the Chilean capital. Investigating judge Juan Guzman and a five-strong team comprising two psychiatrists, two psychologists and a neurologist had attended the Hospital Militar to conduct two days of examinations on the former dictator. They were seeking to determine whether he would be mentally fit to stand trial for his alleged role in masterminding hundreds of kidnappings and murders during his 1973-1990 rule. But Gen Pinochet, 85, and his legal team are refusing to cooperate with the medical examinations in the hope that they can stall questioning of the general, scheduled for tomorrow. The Chilean supreme court has ruled that the medical tests must precede the questioning. In response to the refusal to be examined, human rights lawyers reiterated their calls for Judge Guzman to place Gen Pinochet under house arrest, to ensure that he will be questioned about his role in the executions known as the Caravan of Death. \"The Pinochet family said long ago that he was not crazy and would not submit to tests,\" said human rights lawyer Hugo Guttierez as he waited outside the Hospital Militar. \"This is the result of a strategy that was decided months ago.\" Gen Pinochet's defence had initially hoped to use the tests at the Hospital Militar to protect the former ruler from the courts. For months the team sought to have the medical exams conducted exclusively by the army-run institution. That request, however, was denied by Judge Guzman, who determined that civilian institutions must verify all tests to avoid charges that Gen Pinochet's medical team would inject him with drugs to alter the results. Judge Guzman's suspicion that Gen Pinochet was guilty of \"doping\" infuriated the general's defence, who requested that the judge be removed from the case because of what they called his \"perturbed behaviour and lack of serenity\". Few people expect Gen Pinochet to appear today for the second day of scheduled tests. Yesterday, relatives of Pinochet victims holding placards with photos of their executed family members protested outside the hospital, as a lone armed guard patrolled. According to Chilean press reports, the army is preparing to reinforce security at the Hospital Militar to give Gen Pinochet the option of using the building as a refuge from justice. By declaring Gen Pinochet \"suddenly ill\", the military could then transport him to the hospital and refuse to have him questioned, citing his fragile condition. This strategy has been used repeatedly by the Chilean army in the past to protect top officials facing murder and torture charges. Many opponents of the Pinochet regime died in the Hospital Militar, including General Augusto Lutz, head of army intelligence, whose mysterious death was never cleared up. \"My dad said: 'If anything happens to me, don't take me to the Hospital Militar, because from there I will never leave alive',\" said Patricia Lutz, his daughter. \"He was head of military intelligence, he knew there were strange operations going on inside.

Machine guns, silent for almost 10 years, were greased and mounted on jeeps in preparation for possible Polisario assaults against a long-established defensive wall hundreds of miles long and guarded by the Moroccan army. An official from the United Nations mission in Layoune, the capital of occupied Western Sahara, said the situation was \"very tense\". Ignoring the glint of enemy helmets, squads of Polisario sappers plotted at the weeekend to clear minefields and blast holes in the wall, allowing their mechanised infantry to race into Western Sahara from their bases in Algeria. Morocco's decision to route this year's rally through Western Sahara, which it invaded in 1975 as the Spanish colonial authorities were pulling out, has infuriated the Polisario front. Its leaders accuse rally organisers of in effect endorsing the annexation of the region. The sight of more than 350 race and support vehicles rumbling across the desert from Goulimine to Smara through part of the rebels' home has been declared a provocation; tensions have grown steadily since a ceasefire was brokered in 1991. A referendum on whether Western Sahara should be independent or integrated into its northern neighbour has been delayed by haggling about voter eligibility for nine years, during which time Morocco has consolidated its occupation despite UN resolutions supporting the Sahrawis' right to self-determination. \"The organisers of the rally have decided to cross our territory at a decisive moment in the evolution of our struggle,\" said the Polisario president, Mohammed Abdel Aziz. The movement's military commanders have maintained a studied ambiguity about whether they would attack the rally's participants. Morocco's leader, King Mohammed VI, has followed his late father, Hassan II, in claiming the barren but phosphate-rich land as part of his country's medieval empire. Billions of pounds and 300,000 settlers have been poured into the territory. Polisario fears being pressured into accepting limited autonomy in which 250,000 Sahrawis could be swallowed up by 30m Moroccans. After a short-lived detente with King Mohammed, Algeria, where the independence movement is based, is believed to have given the green light for an offensive. Fresh supplies of food and fuel are being ferried from the Algerian town of Tindouf to four nearby Polisario camps, home to more than 100,000 people. The UN special envoy for Western Sahara, the former US diplomat William Eagleton, said sending the rally there did not constitute \"recognition of the sovereignty of either side over the territory, whose final status...remains to be determined\".

Their crime may be to sit next to a man other than a relative. Pakistan's Human Rights Commission has documented hundreds of cases of brutal attacks against women, some accused of simply looking in the direction of another man. Successive governments in Pakistan have condemned the practice. These killings \"are immoral acts of cowardice\", Attiya Inayatullah, minister for women's development in the military government, said at the weekend. \"It is the most pervasive form of violence.\" AP",

His belated interest in a rapprochement with the man awarded the Nobel peace prize for his efforts to bring peace to Israel was spurred by the opinion polls, which show the hardline challenger for the premiership, Ariel Sharon, winning half the votes. The momentum could increase today when tens of thousands of rightwingers, many of them flown in from the US and Europe, converge outside Jerusalem's ancient walls to protest against the a proposal in the current US peace plan for the area that would divide the Old City between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr Barak hopes that Mr Peres can help him persuade leftwingers and Arabs that he is still a peacemaker. But the prospect of a peace deal being agreed before Bill Clinton relinquishes the US presidency on January 20 seems all but dead, Israeli and Palestinian officials said yesterday. And any hope that the two sides might resume security cooperation soon was shrinking, too. Israeli officials accused Palestinian military intelligence of recruiting the Jordanian man who bombed a Tel Aviv bus last month.

The Israelis said the bomber, Abdallah Abu Jaber, a citizen of Jordan where Palestinians form a majority, was given the bomb by Palestinian agents in Nablus. He was working in Israel at the time. The peace camp is hugely disillusioned with Mr Barak, and Labour party activists are afraid that a low turnout or spoiled ballots may give Mr Sharon victory by default. Mr Barak's standing in the party is so low that he has to fend off calls from his cabinet ministers and a petition from party activists to step aside for Mr Peres. Yesterday he was reduced to telling Israel Radio that he would fight the election even if he had only four supporters. He is reaching out to Mr Peres as insurance. At the weekend the two appeared together on TV, promising to work for peace, just as Mr Peres worked with Yitzhak Rabin. \"The goal is not to become prime minister.

Republicans have got to decide whether they want this process to work or whether they are going to keep on playing games.</p> <p>\"They agreed on paper last May to put their weapons beyond use so why don't they just do it? The longer they drag this out the more difficult they make it to sustain and grow support for the Good Friday agreement.\"</p> <p>Republicans, who are blaming Tony Blair for the deadlock, want a substantial security scaledown, particularly in heavily fortified south Armagh, while both Sinn Fein and the largest nationalist party, the SDLP, want a much more radical overhaul of policing than the police bill which could lead to a delay in implementing planned reforms.</p> <p>Gerry Kelly, the IRA bomber turned senior Sinn Fein politician, claimed: \"The British government is in danger of bringing about the breakdown of the institutions and the whole agreement.\"</p> <p>The SDLP policing spokesman, Alex Attwood, denied he had less room for flexibility due to heightened pre-electoral competition with Sinn Fein, but insisted his party must be able to offer young nationalists a degree of confidence in the reforms before it could take its seats on the new police board.</p> <p>He wants assurances on a number of matters, including the neutrality of the future police emblem and the flying of flags, the merger of special branch and CID, the closure of Gough barracks in Armagh, the phasing out of the full-time reserve and entry of garda officers into the new service.</p> <p>Mr Attwood is also keen to see credible, independent investigations into the murders of lawyers Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane, and Portadown Catholic Robert Hamill.</p> <p>\"We want to be able to join the police board and negotiations are far from over,\" he said. \"There are a whole series of meetings going on and progress has been made. But this issue is so central to nationalists that we need to have a credible degree of confidence before we go in, or the whole thing could unravel in months and young Catholics will then not join the new service.\"</p> <p>A senior government source denied that reforms would be put on ice if the SDLP refused to nominate representatives to the police board by the end of the month, but agreed any postponement would have practical consequences.</p> <p>The 19-strong board, of which 10 members will be politicians, is scheduled to be in place by the beginning of February, so that it can oversee the first batch of recruits in April.</p> <p>\"It is over-egging the pudding to say reforms would be shelved,\" said the source. \"However, the SDLP say they want a new police service as soon as possible but they are holding it up.\"</p> <p>Sir Reg Empey was critical of the SDLP for not backing the police bill, contrasting it with the risk Ulster Unionists took in sharing power with Sinn Fein even though they were unhappy over the lack of IRA decommissioning.</p> <p>\"The SDLP have not, as yet, had to take a difficult decision as we have done,\" he said. \"It is indefensible for them to continue to hang back.

      "bodyText": "All sides warned yesterday of the danger of the Northern Ireland political process falling apart if some consensus on demilitarisation, paramilitary decommissioning and policing is not found in the next few weeks. Hardliners within the Ulster Unionists are set to call a crucial meeting of the party's ruling council around the end of the month to try and force the leader, David Trimble, to pull out of the power-sharing Stormont government if the IRA has not made serious progress on disarmament. Sir Reg Empey, a Trimble ally on the moderate wing, warned: \"Everybody is getting sick and tired of the endless dance around the issue. Republicans have got to decide whether they want this process to work or whether they are going to keep on playing games. \"They agreed on paper last May to put their weapons beyond use so why don't they just do it? The longer they drag this out the more difficult they make it to sustain and grow support for the Good Friday agreement.\" Republicans, who are blaming Tony Blair for the deadlock, want a substantial security scaledown, particularly in heavily fortified south Armagh, while both Sinn Fein and the largest nationalist party, the SDLP, want a much more radical overhaul of policing than the police bill which could lead to a delay in implementing planned reforms. Gerry Kelly, the IRA bomber turned senior Sinn Fein politician, claimed: \"The British government is in danger of bringing about the breakdown of the institutions and the whole agreement.\" The SDLP policing spokesman, Alex Attwood, denied he had less room for flexibility due to heightened pre-electoral competition with Sinn Fein, but insisted his party must be able to offer young nationalists a degree of confidence in the reforms before it could take its seats on the new police board. He wants assurances on a number of matters, including the neutrality of the future police emblem and the flying of flags, the merger of special branch and CID, the closure of Gough barracks in Armagh, the phasing out of the full-time reserve and entry of garda officers into the new service. Mr Attwood is also keen to see credible, independent investigations into the murders of lawyers Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane, and Portadown Catholic Robert Hamill. \"We want to be able to join the police board and negotiations are far from over,\" he said. \"There are a whole series of meetings going on and progress has been made. But this issue is so central to nationalists that we need to have a credible degree of confidence before we go in, or the whole thing could unravel in months and young Catholics will then not join the new service.\" A senior government source denied that reforms would be put on ice if the SDLP refused to nominate representatives to the police board by the end of the month, but agreed any postponement would have practical consequences. The 19-strong board, of which 10 members will be politicians, is scheduled to be in place by the beginning of February, so that it can oversee the first batch of recruits in April. \"It is over-egging the pudding to say reforms would be shelved,\" said the source. \"However, the SDLP say they want a new police service as soon as possible but they are holding it up.\" Sir Reg Empey was critical of the SDLP for not backing the police bill, contrasting it with the risk Ulster Unionists took in sharing power with Sinn Fein even though they were unhappy over the lack of IRA decommissioning. \"The SDLP have not, as yet, had to take a difficult decision as we have done,\" he said. \"It is indefensible for them to continue to hang back. As Patten commission member Maurice Hayes said, 'It's better to have 90% of something than 100% of nothing'. \"They are going to have to make up their minds or the government should call a halt to the reforms. What is the point of going through torturous change if we still don't know if they will support it?\" Tensions within loyalism were also growing as the Shankill Road Ulster Freedom Fighter leader, Johnny Adair, awaited a sentence review commission decision, due tomorrow, on whether he will be let out of jail. Either way there are fears of renewed violence between Protestant paramilitaries which could spill over into attacks on Catholics. The finger was pointed at the UFF's associates, the Ulster Defence Association, for the murder of a former senior member from east Belfast, George Legge, stabbed and dumped in a field on the outskirts of the city on Saturday after an alleged row over drugs. And there were fears of a split in the Ulster Democratic Party, the political wing of the UDA/UFF, the biggest loyalist paramilitary grouping in Northern Ireland, with many of its grassroots said to have turned against the Good Friday agreement. The UDP leader, Gary McMichael, son of the murdered UDA chief John McMichael and a staunch supporter of the 1998 peace accord, said he would have to consider quitting if the party changed its policy.",

Lawyers for the People's Lottery believe it may be able to force a judicial review based on the fairness and legality of the commission's U-turn. </p> <p>A spokesman for the People's Lottery said Sir Richard had been encouraged to consider an alternative lottery by support from the public since December's announcement. </p> <p>\"We've had an enormous number of calls and letters suggesting we launch an alternative lottery for good causes and we have a team of lawyers looking into it,\" he said. </p> <p>He also pointed to the poor sales of National Lottery tickets during recent weeks. The new year Big Draw jackpot game sold less than 25m tickets, compared with 80m at the end of 1999. </p> <p>The People's Lottery was left smarting on Friday after a request to publish the two rival bids in full was turned down by the commission. </p> <p>The commission also rejected a request for a meeting with executives from the company today. </p> <p>People's Lottery chief executive Simon Burridge accused the commission of making a derisory response to its request and was sharply critical of the commission's chairman, Lord Burns, for failing to sign the letter himself. \"Lord Burns has gone on the record as saying that the decision was the result of a fair and open evaluation,\" Mr Burridge said. </p> <p>\"Given that the commission's response fails to address any of the substantive issues we raised, it is impossible to judge whether the process has indeed been either fair or open.\" </p> <p>The People's Lottery maintains that during the lifetime of the seven-year licence it would raise \u00a3770m more for good causes than Camelot. </p> <p>A spokesman for the National Lottery Commission said the regulator had already given its reasons for awarding the licence to Camelot, and was not under any pressure to explain itself further. </p> <p>\"It is incumbent upon us as a public body to make sure that we have explained any decisions we make and we have done so in black and white, in plain English and in detail,\" he said, referring to the six-page statement of reasons issued with the judgment in December.</p>",

Sir Richard is also considering legal action to recoup the estimated \u00a330m spent on his attempt to win the licence during last year's protracted and often farcical bidding process. \"The National Lottery Commission said in its judgment that it was basically too risky to change operators, so you have to ask, 'why put us through all this in the first place?'\" said one of Sir Richard's advisers. Sir Richard was shocked by the judgment in late December which overturned an earlier decision naming the People's Lottery as preferred bidder. Lawyers for the People's Lottery believe it may be able to force a judicial review based on the fairness and legality of the commission's U-turn. A spokesman for the People's Lottery said Sir Richard had been encouraged to consider an alternative lottery by support from the public since December's announcement. \"We've had an enormous number of calls and letters suggesting we launch an alternative lottery for good causes and we have a team of lawyers looking into it,\" he said. He also pointed to the poor sales of National Lottery tickets during recent weeks. The new year Big Draw jackpot game sold less than 25m tickets, compared with 80m at the end of 1999. The People's Lottery was left smarting on Friday after a request to publish the two rival bids in full was turned down by the commission. The commission also rejected a request for a meeting with executives from the company today. People's Lottery chief executive Simon Burridge accused the commission of making a derisory response to its request and was sharply critical of the commission's chairman, Lord Burns, for failing to sign the letter himself. \"Lord Burns has gone on the record as saying that the decision was the result of a fair and open evaluation,\" Mr Burridge said. \"Given that the commission's response fails to address any of the substantive issues we raised, it is impossible to judge whether the process has indeed been either fair or open.\" The People's Lottery maintains that during the lifetime of the seven-year licence it would raise \u00a3770m more for good causes than Camelot. A spokesman for the National Lottery Commission said the regulator had already given its reasons for awarding the licence to Camelot, and was not under any pressure to explain itself further. \"It is incumbent upon us as a public body to make sure that we have explained any decisions we make and we have done so in black and white, in plain English and in detail,\" he said, referring to the six-page statement of reasons issued with the judgment in December.",

Among the other members were Dame Shirley Porter, Tim Renton (a Tory arts minister who had retired hurt) and Lord Attenborough.

Much as I disapprove of Mr Mandelson's politics, I have always admired his intellectual agility. But not even he, at his Machiavellian worst, could have arranged for the Legacy consortium (which Mr Bourne runs) to come second in the competition to buy the site of the Greenwich fiasco and then persuade Nomura (who originally won the bid) to pull out so that Bourne could have a clear run.

The battle between the parties ought to be concerned with great issues of principle - the nature of the society that the rival philosophies hope to create and the way in which the better life, which they both promise, can be brought about. Because of the death of ideology, the political battle is now more and more concerned with trivia. And, as the Greene-Bourne-Mandelson story illustrates, even the attempts to make trivial mischief are often dependent on innuendo rather than information.</p> <p>I do not suggest that deferential journalists should feel it their duty to suppress the personal indiscretions of politicians.

Tony Blair wins the next election, stays on through the whole of the next parliament and then stands down six months into his third term. It is Christmas 2005. The economy is recovering from a mini-recession. The halo has slipped from the chancellor. The man who succeeds Blair is not Gordon Brown. He is bearded and in his mid-50s, and until 2001 wasn't even in the cabinet: he is Charles Clarke.</p> <p>This theory may be far-fetched but some Labour MPs are also suggesting it as an outside bet. It's all the more curious because, on the face of it - literally - Clarke is not an obvious New Labour man: \"I don't know what arch-Blairites look like,\" he says. \"I never had a call saying, would I shave my beard off, would I not talk to journalists. I never had a call saying, 'You've got to check what you say with us'.\"</p> <p>The others must have done - the people who are nominally his seniors, such as Stephen Byers, Alastair Darling and Geoff Hoon. Were their promotions to the cabinet linked to the disappearance of their facial hair? \"I've no idea, you'd better ask them. One of the things I'm least qualified to give advice on is fashion.\"</p> <p>Clarke has taken off his scuffed shoes - shades of Mo Mowlam, perhaps. His suit is a bit rumpled. It is late in the afternoon and he is pouring wine in his seventh-floor room at the Home Office. He is relaxed, but alert. He's the one who has been attacking William Hague over police and race on the airwaves. He's the one piloting four important pieces of legislation into the new, almost certainly brief, parliamentary session.</p> <p>No other minister will spend anything like as much time at the dispatch box this winter. The issues are central to the government's agenda, and are controversial - vehicle crime, private security services, a criminal justice bill on alcohol-driven yob violence, and the reintroduction of that much-derided mode of trial bill.</p> <p>This man is no libertarian. He blames the Thatcher years for many, but by no means all, of society's ills. \"I do think the 'no such thing as society' culture is deeply embedded in a whole generation of people. A key strategic goal of the Labour government is to rebuild community and society in all its senses. But this can't be changed overnight.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, punishment should be tough. So does he agree with his boss, Jack Straw, that a liberal legal establishment is part of the problem? \"I'm surrounded by lawyers. My boss is a lawyer. His boss is a lawyer. My fellow ministers of state are lawyers. We have lawyers all over the place.\"</p> <p>Straw, he says, has \"a far more profound experience of the legal profession and the individuals involved\". That is quintessential Clarke: almost agreeing with what his boss says. \"The thing that dominates me isn't that the Bar Council or Law Society are liberals, more that they're about the self-interest of the legal profession rather than the interests of society as a whole.\"</p> <p>He makes a good fist of defending the mode of trial bill, which shifts several categories of crime from jury trial to magistrate. It was rejected last time by the House of Lords, but the government seems determined to push it through. The only people attacking the government, Clarke maintains, are lawyers; their motives are purely self-interest. \"The more I see of the criminal justice system, the more I think many of its practices are completely indefensible.\"</p> <p>You don't come across many in the second echelon of government, a mere minister of state, with such self-assurance. His rank is, in any case, anomalous. He secured his seat, Norwich South, months before the '97 election. Blair has promoted him as fast as he can. A decent cabinet place next time around is as near to a dead cert as you get in politics. \"All these people who claim to know about election dates, reshuffles - it's complete bollocks: people just don't know.\"</p> <p>He should know. He was chief-of-staff to Neil Kinnock during the wilderness years, taking no prisoners as they fought off Militant and battled, to use the historical shorthand, to make Labour electable. Part of that, he says, is self-restraint. Like so many of his colleagues from their opposition days, he sees much of the media, especially the tabloids, as endemically hostile. It is, he insists, extremely difficult to float interesting ideas in public. \"The constraint on politicians isn't imposed by Tony Blair or anyone else. You have to be very, very careful - if you're serious about power - about how you talk about things.\"</p> <p>And what about the \"faceless wonders\" - the advisers as described by John Prescott, and the various anonymous denunciations of ministers? \"Your phrase, not mine,\" he says. \"In general, the quality of the people around the leadership is very good. But there were some people, it is well known, who made it their business to argue on behalf of their principles in ways which were negative.\" He pours himself another glass of office regulation red, and smiles. \"Some of those are no longer there.\"</p> <p>So what does he believe in? What is his political philosophy? An obvious question, you might think, but this arch-fixer, arch-doer, seems stumped. He comes up with the need to build a strong society, to get the voluntary and state sector working together, and the need to re-establish \"leadership in society\", to end the \"walk on by\" culture. \"Many people don't feel the confidence to lead their communities.\" As for economics, the key element is abolition of poverty. What about the word that dare not speak its name - redistribution? Does the Labour government believe in it as part of creating a more fair society? \"I would say yes. It must do.\"</p> <p>He knows his way around. He combines a joviality and supreme self-confidence that, some might say, goes with the territory of public school and Oxbridge education. His father, Sir Richard \"Otto\" Clarke, was a Labour figure who rose through the postwar public sector to become the top civil servant at Tony Benn's Ministry of Technology.</p> <p>Clarke wishes his father were still alive so they could compare notes. He could have done with help during the many tragicomic Kinnock moments. Clarke didn't take prisoners then, and ruffled many a feather as, under his leader, Labour suffered two defeats on the trot. The period after '92 was his lowest point. Clarke ran his own lobbying firm, and failed several times to win a seat.</p> <p>As a not-so-new backbencher, it didn't take long for him to be noticed. Within months he had signed a parliamentary motion backing the strike at British Airways - the most prominent non-leftwinger to do so. Eyebrows were raised. He was called in. Word was he hadn't quite grasped parliamentary procedure - an unlikely story.</p> <p>So what did happen? He laughs raucously. \"If you want to know, it was a total fuck-up on my part.\" He recalls being accosted by Ken Livingstone and Bill Morris in the central lobby at Westminster, and urged to put his name to a piece of paper. He says he thought they were talking about the principle of union consultation.</p> <p>So if not then, what about another perfect piece of political positioning a year later when a letter he wrote to the then social security secretary Harriet Harman, attacking cuts to lone-parent benefits, was leaked to the Observer? \"I have thought about positioning. Positioning is an interesting question. The assessments I made in that letter were correct. The only thing I regret is that it was leaked. Many people today believe I leaked it to promote myself. Actually, I haven't done that kind of thing at any point.\"</p> <p>He didn't vote against the measure, though. \"I'm a loyalist. I've always believed it's much more effective to make your argument for change from inside the family than outside. That's a tactical judgment.\"</p> <p>So does he consider himself a Blairite? \"I'm not quite sure what it means.\" But the intertwining of the Kinnock and Blair teams is now stronger than ever. The John Smith years are increasingly seen by them as an aberration. Clarke was an early supporter of Blair's bid for the leadership in 1994. \"How shall I put this? Labour won the election in 1997 as a result of his leadership,\" he says. He sheds few tears for Brown's frustrated ambitions. \"It's by no means clear that under any other leader it [the victory] would have happened as well.\"</p> <p>He awards praise to the chancellor for his management of the economy. But if Brown might not have had what it takes to lead the party a few years back, does he now? What about that supposed deal that sees Blair standing down at some point over the next few years for his old chum? \"I don't see how there can be a pre-agreed inheritance, in the sense that the people who will decide will be the party by its constitutional processes.</p> <p>\"Of course, the party listens to its leaders. But one of the things I learnt very much when I worked for Neil is that they listen to their party only to a point, and they don't like their prerogatives being trampled on too much. If anybody tries to say to the party at any point in the next 10 years, 'You ought to choose x,' it would be a very mistaken thing to do. I'd be absolutely amazed if either Tony or Gordon, if you're talking about a pre-agreement, thought anything other than what I've just said.\"</p> <p>That does not take much decoding. Brown is not, in Clarke's view, a shoo-in. Others in and around the cabinet might agree with him. So who would be the alternative? The obvious choices for many in the party are Straw or David Blunkett. So, what about this long-shot theory about Clarke himself? Had he heard it from other MPs? \"I don't think that they'd be so bold as to say that to me.\" I did not take that as being a resounding \"no\".</p> <p>Everything goes in cycles, and the youthful and clean-cut appeal of Blair might eventually give way to an older, more in-your-face school of politics. Still, the only imminent leadership election, Clarke says, will be for the Tories. He would be happy to give them advice. When he took over Kinnock's office, he consulted Richard Ryder, who had run Margaret Thatcher's office in opposition in the late 70s. So what would he say now to Sebastian Coe, William Hague's right-hand man? \"My advice would be: get rid of your leader. I never had much time for him.\"</p>",

His rank is, in any case, anomalous. He secured his seat, Norwich South, months before the '97 election. Blair has promoted him as fast as he can. A decent cabinet place next time around is as near to a dead cert as you get in politics. \"All these people who claim to know about election dates, reshuffles - it's complete bollocks: people just don't know.\" He should know. He was chief-of-staff to Neil Kinnock during the wilderness years, taking no prisoners as they fought off Militant and battled, to use the historical shorthand, to make Labour electable. Part of that, he says, is self-restraint. Like so many of his colleagues from their opposition days, he sees much of the media, especially the tabloids, as endemically hostile. It is, he insists, extremely difficult to float interesting ideas in public. \"The constraint on politicians isn't imposed by Tony Blair or anyone else. You have to be very, very careful - if you're serious about power - about how you talk about things.\" And what about the \"faceless wonders\" - the advisers as described by John Prescott, and the various anonymous denunciations of ministers? \"Your phrase, not mine,\" he says. \"In general, the quality of the people around the leadership is very good. But there were some people, it is well known, who made it their business to argue on behalf of their principles in ways which were negative.\" He pours himself another glass of office regulation red, and smiles. \"Some of those are no longer there.\" So what does he believe in? What is his political philosophy? An obvious question, you might think, but this arch-fixer, arch-doer, seems stumped. He comes up with the need to build a strong society, to get the voluntary and state sector working together, and the need to re-establish \"leadership in society\", to end the \"walk on by\" culture. \"Many people don't feel the confidence to lead their communities.\" As for economics, the key element is abolition of poverty. What about the word that dare not speak its name - redistribution? Does the Labour government believe in it as part of creating a more fair society? \"I would say yes. It must do.\" He knows his way around. He combines a joviality and supreme self-confidence that, some might say, goes with the territory of public school and Oxbridge education. His father, Sir Richard \"Otto\" Clarke, was a Labour figure who rose through the postwar public sector to become the top civil servant at Tony Benn's Ministry of Technology. Clarke wishes his father were still alive so they could compare notes. He could have done with help during the many tragicomic Kinnock moments. Clarke didn't take prisoners then, and ruffled many a feather as, under his leader, Labour suffered two defeats on the trot. The period after '92 was his lowest point. Clarke ran his own lobbying firm, and failed several times to win a seat. As a not-so-new backbencher, it didn't take long for him to be noticed. Within months he had signed a parliamentary motion backing the strike at British Airways - the most prominent non-leftwinger to do so. Eyebrows were raised. He was called in. Word was he hadn't quite grasped parliamentary procedure - an unlikely story. So what did happen? He laughs raucously. \"If you want to know, it was a total fuck-up on my part.\" He recalls being accosted by Ken Livingstone and Bill Morris in the central lobby at Westminster, and urged to put his name to a piece of paper. He says he thought they were talking about the principle of union consultation. So if not then, what about another perfect piece of political positioning a year later when a letter he wrote to the then social security secretary Harriet Harman, attacking cuts to lone-parent benefits, was leaked to the Observer? \"I have thought about positioning. Positioning is an interesting question. The assessments I made in that letter were correct. The only thing I regret is that it was leaked. Many people today believe I leaked it to promote myself. Actually, I haven't done that kind of thing at any point.\" He didn't vote against the measure, though. \"I'm a loyalist. I've always believed it's much more effective to make your argument for change from inside the family than outside. That's a tactical judgment.\" So does he consider himself a Blairite? \"I'm not quite sure what it means.\" But the intertwining of the Kinnock and Blair teams is now stronger than ever. The John Smith years are increasingly seen by them as an aberration. Clarke was an early supporter of Blair's bid for the leadership in 1994. \"How shall I put this? Labour won the election in 1997 as a result of his leadership,\" he says. He sheds few tears for Brown's frustrated ambitions. \"It's by no means clear that under any other leader it [the victory] would have happened as well.\" He awards praise to the chancellor for his management of the economy. But if Brown might not have had what it takes to lead the party a few years back, does he now? What about that supposed deal that sees Blair standing down at some point over the next few years for his old chum? \"I don't see how there can be a pre-agreed inheritance, in the sense that the people who will decide will be the party by its constitutional processes. \"Of course, the party listens to its leaders. But one of the things I learnt very much when I worked for Neil is that they listen to their party only to a point, and they don't like their prerogatives being trampled on too much. If anybody tries to say to the party at any point in the next 10 years, 'You ought to choose x,' it would be a very mistaken thing to do. I'd be absolutely amazed if either Tony or Gordon, if you're talking about a pre-agreement, thought anything other than what I've just said.\" That does not take much decoding. Brown is not, in Clarke's view, a shoo-in. Others in and around the cabinet might agree with him. So who would be the alternative? The obvious choices for many in the party are Straw or David Blunkett. So, what about this long-shot theory about Clarke himself? Had he heard it from other MPs? \"I don't think that they'd be so bold as to say that to me.\" I did not take that as being a resounding \"no\". Everything goes in cycles, and the youthful and clean-cut appeal of Blair might eventually give way to an older, more in-your-face school of politics. Still, the only imminent leadership election, Clarke says, will be for the Tories. He would be happy to give them advice. When he took over Kinnock's office, he consulted Richard Ryder, who had run Margaret Thatcher's office in opposition in the late 70s. So what would he say now to Sebastian Coe, William Hague's right-hand man? \"My advice would be: get rid of your leader. I never had much time for him.\"",

Not only because I was 15, which meant socialism had to vie for my attention with girls, skincare and A-levels, but because, spanning 1984 and 1985, it coincided with the gradual, grinding defeat of the miners' strike. For months I had heard podiums pounded to a familiar tune - if the miners lost it would signal a massive setback for the left. Then they lost and, amid all the hot air that blew through loudspeakers at the time, this bleak assertion seemed to hold more than a whiff of truth.</p> <p>As the miners returned to work the despondency of having attached myself to a lost and noble cause set in. Advising against despair, older activists convinced me that this was little more than the periodic bump and grind of the class struggle. We were now moving into a \"downturn\", they explained, when the right would make ideological headway and the left would be on the defensive. But as sure as the sun would rise in the east, they insisted, things would improve. Confidence to resist attacks on living standards, working conditions, discrimination, low pay and no pay would return. There would, they asserted confidently, be an \"upturn\".</p> <p>Waiting for the upturn, over the past 16 years, has felt like being cast as one of Beckett's tramps waiting for Godot. Unsure of when it would turn up or what it would look like even if it did, there was little to do but hope. There were, of course, isolated events to savour, like the repeal of the poll tax, Nelson Mandela's release and Livingstone's victory in London. But each one promised more than it could possibly have delivered - the swallows were sighted, but the summer never came.</p> <p>Until now that is. For there is a fragile but discernible sense that the tide is beginning to turn. Gradually, unevenly and erratically comes anecdotal and empirical evidence of a mood swing. An indignant, stroppy strain of political optimism which suggests that resistance is worthwhile, change is possible and alternatives desirable. The upturn is here.</p> <p>I am all too well aware that this may be the wishful thinking of a believer whose dream has been too long deferred. At first glance the omens are not brilliant. Under the most rightwing Labour government ever, industrial action remains incredibly low not just in comparison with our past but also with almost every other country.</p> <p>So why the optimism? Firstly because campaigning is producing results. Pensioners received this year's increase through protest, not patronage. The same is true of students in Scotland and tuition fees. And while the number of days lost through strike action dropped between 1998 and 1999, the number of ballots on industrial action doubled. Of those on strike action, 95% showed majorities in favour; of those on action short of a strike, the figure was 91%. In nine out of ten cases, according to the Trade Unions Trends survey, they won all or some of their demands. Part of this is undoubtedly down to a booming economy. But the upshot is that it elevates protest from the kneejerk moral response of a minority to a practical means of improving the lot of the many. When people win or see others win they gain in confidence and the likelihood is that they will fight again.</p> <p>It is also producing results at the polls, where a persistent voice has emerged to the left of Labour. After the Scottish Socialist party saved its deposit in the Falkirk West byelection John Curtice, the deputy director of the ESRC Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends, wrote: \"What is notable is that this is the fifth byelection in a row in which a candidate standing under a socialist label has passed the 5% threshold.

Last month more than 1,000 people turned up in central London to a meeting about an obscure but pernicious trade agreement, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, with more left outside pleading to come in. Reclaim the Streets activists bringing the City to a standstill; local meetings to support asylum seekers of several hundred strong; large anti-racist meetings in Bristol - these are snapshots of recent times that contribute to a bigger picture.</p> <p>The vista is hazy. A mood is, by its nature, undefinable and unquantifiable. But it is also pervasive. We are not talking barricades in the streets here. But from the growing self-assertion of black and Asian communities following the Lawrence report to a commonsense view, born from bitter experience, that the railways were a privatisation too far, this shift to the left will be widespread, substantial and stubborn.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the left have Labour to thank for some of this. While it is the government they are usually fighting, it is partly because there is a Labour government that they have a chance of winning. There was never any point trying to appeal to the Tories' better nature because they never had one. But there are expectations that come with Labour - equality, fairness, social responsibility - which no amount of rebranding can dispel. With an election due this is a point both the left and Labour would do well to remember. Claiming that there is no significant difference between New Labour and the Tories is a convenient refrain - it is also untrue and unhelpful. Claiming that the left is insignificant makes a good soundbite - but it will not motivate the base Labour needs to maintain a decent majority.</p> <p>Unlike previous upturns, this new wave of militancy will neither be union-led nor necessarily reflected in any substantial way within the Labour party. Labour has neutralised its internal levers of democracy. The quarter of a century or so since the last upturn has left a generation with only an abstract notion of what trade unions are for and a transformed workplace of part-timers, teleworkers and contract casuals who are non-unionised.</p> <p>The days of gauging leftwing opinion by charting resolutions to conferences are over. Unlike the last one in the 70s, this new phase will not have the century-old traditions of the Labour and trade union movement, but nor will it have the bureaucracy and conservatism that come with them.

      "bodyText": "Top-end management buyout deals reached a record of just under \u00a320bn last year but could begin to tail off in 2001, according to KPMG Corporate Finance. KPMG said yesterday that, in a buoyant private equity market, the value of the 150 management buyouts, management buy-ins and institutional buy-outs reached \u00a319.95bn, up 39% on the \u00a314.38bn of 149 similar deals in 1999. Almost half the value - \u00a39bn - came from public companies going private in the wake of unacceptable stock market ratings, with five more worth \u00a31.36bn incomplete by the end of the year. The top two buyouts last year - MEPC at \u00a33.5bn and United Biscuits at \u00a31.5bn - took this route. Two others - General Healthcare at \u00a31.3bn and Rank Hovis McDougall at \u00a31.1bn - were worth more than \u00a31bn, while two-thirds of the total were worth more than \u00a3250m each. KPMG said the final quarter of 2000 saw no decline in activity but the value of deals fell by 38%, with the largest the \u00a3507m buyout at Powell Duffryn, the engineering group. Charles Milner, UK head of private equity at KPMG Corporate Finance, said: \"2000 was another record year for fund raising. Looking forward to 2001, some commentators have suggested that the pri vate equity market place will have a tougher time. The debt markets are showing signs of greater caution and this is undoubtedly a critical factor in putting deals together. \"However, with economic fundamentals sound, substantial funds available for investment and with continuing restructuring as companies and markets consolidate, we firmly believe that the outlook is far from bleak.\" \u0095 The initial public offering market is likely to remain in hibernation this week despite positive sentiment surrounding the US Federal Reserve's surprise interest rate cut, say analysts. No companies are scheduled to price in the second week of January.",

The Blue Circle board, which fended off a hostile bid worth 450p a share from Lafarge in May last year, met last night to agree a 495p offer that will make the aggressively expanding French group the world's biggest cement maker. The deal, worth \u00a34.8bn as Lafarge is taking on Blue Circle's \u00a31.8bn debt, will make the enlarged Anglo-French group an integrated business making cement, aggregates and concrete in the UK. Lafarge bought materials group Redland for \u00a31.8bn three years ago. It follows the takeover of Rugby, the cement maker, by RMC, a concrete producer, a year ago and represents the latest stage of consolidation in the industry. The new offer, heralded by Bertrand Collomb, Lafarge's chairman, last month, is marginally short of the 500p-plus initially sought by his rival, Rick Haythornwaite, Blue Circle's chief executive.

Former safecracker George Reynolds, who now spends part of his \u00a3300m kitchen furniture fortune on running Darlington FC, is to conduct his own legal claim for wrongful arrest. Famous for trying to reduce \"barmy\" football wages, the self-made millionaire has dispensed with lawyers in the civil action against Cleveland police. He will conduct his own case at the high court in Middlesbrough, with the help of statements from 14 officers, including an assistant chief constable. Mr Reynolds, who went straight after serving a four year jail sentence for safe-blowing in the 1960s, is bringing six wrongful arrest actions against the police over an incident nine years ago. He was arrested and held in police cells overnight in 1992 on three charges of threatening criminal damage, which were later dropped. Mr Reynolds, 64, has worked between business commitments since the incident to gather evidence. He said: \"I have gathered a huge amount of documentation to show I was wrongfully arrested, detained and charged.\" His case accused Cleveland police of arresting him without properly checking the private complaint against him, ignoring release requests from his solicitor, and failing properly to evaluate the strength of the evidence against him. Mr Reynolds, born in poverty in Sunderland, used his ice cream van to transport gelignite during his safecracking days, but used his prison term to educate himself and proved a successful businessman after release. He said: \"I consulted several leading barristers, who wanted \u00a360,000 to represent me - and I was certainly not going to hand over that sort of money when I can do just as good a job myself.\"",

      "bodyText": "The police complaints authority has criticised the Metropolitan police over the way it arrested Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of Harrods, for the alleged theft of gemstones and other precious items from a safe deposit box belonging to his arch-enemy, Tiny Rowland. The police watchdog said it was wrong to detain Mr Fayed and five of his employees in March 1998 without first investigating alleged payments by Mr Rowland to the former security chief at the Knightsbridge store, Bob Loftus. It was Mr Loftus who made the original allegation that Mr Fayed had ordered his staff to break into the safe deposit box. The PCA inquiry, launched after Mr Fayed complained, also upheld a complaint that the force failed to investigate alleged financial dealings between Mr Rowland and Mr Loftus. The Metropolitan police said it was aware of the PCA's decision but said the officer involved had retired and would not be disciplined. Both of the complaints, made in March 1999, were upheld against Detective Chief Superintendent Jeffrey Rees, who was in charge of the investigation. Complaints were also made against Commander Niall Mulvihill and Assistant Commissioner David Veness, but they are being considered by the Home Office. A spokesman said it would be inappropriate to discuss the complaints against the other two officers because they were still being investigated. Mr Fayed, his private secretary, Mark Griffiths, bodyguard Paul Handley-Greaves, former Harrods director of security John Macnamara, John Allen and Colin Dalman were arrested over the alleged break-in to the safe box at the store three years earlier. No charges were brought against the five. The PCA investigation, led by Northamptonshire's chief constable, Christopher Fox, found that Mr Rees sought advice from the crown prosecution service before deciding on the arrests. \"Ultimately, however, the decision fell to Mr Rees and it was his responsibility,\" Duncan Gear, PCA member, said in a letter to Mr Fayed's solicitors. \"The investigating officer considers, and the authority agrees, that the officer should have investigated this aspect regardless of what he was told. This aspect of your client's complaint is, accordingly, upheld.\" According to the PCA, Mr Fayed's complaint also raised the question of whether Mr Loftus was under suspicion of involvement in the alleged break-in. The PCA report said that Mr Rees did not arrest Mr Loftus - even though an independent witness \"clearly placed\" him at the scene of the alleged offence - because he was the main prosecution witness and had made the initial allegation. The PCA said that had Mr Rees not retired from the force last year, he would have received advice concerning his decision not to arrest Mr Loftus, and would have faced a disciplinary charge for neglect of duty for failing to investigate the financial relationship between him and Mr Rowland. In March last year Mr Fayed told the high court he had \"no personal responsibility\" for the disappearance of the gems, but paid Mr Rowland's widow, Josephine, \u00a31.4m in damages after accepting responsibility as the owner of the store for the opening of the box. Yesterday Mr Fayed said: \"I am delighted that our complaints have been upheld. These arrests should not have been made.

      "body": "<p>Lord Lovell-Davis, who has died aged 76, was a deeply reluctant Labour life peer who was sent to the Lords by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in Febrary 1974 so that he could make him a junior minister in the department of energy. Like many other ministers regarded as Wilson groupies, he was sacked when James Callaghan took over the premiership the following year.</p> <p>Lovell-Davis always regretted his decision to join an institution he regarded as an absurd anachronism, especially as he had abandoned a lucrative business career in media management in order to take the shortlived job. In spite of this, he remained a loyal backbench workhorse for Labour until a few weeks before his death.</p> <p>But if that sounds merely worthy, it would be wrong. Peter Davis - his name before he acquired the title - had a major hand in turning Labour into an election-winning machine during the Wil son years.

      "bodyText": "Lord Lovell-Davis, who has died aged 76, was a deeply reluctant Labour life peer who was sent to the Lords by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in Febrary 1974 so that he could make him a junior minister in the department of energy. Like many other ministers regarded as Wilson groupies, he was sacked when James Callaghan took over the premiership the following year. Lovell-Davis always regretted his decision to join an institution he regarded as an absurd anachronism, especially as he had abandoned a lucrative business career in media management in order to take the shortlived job. In spite of this, he remained a loyal backbench workhorse for Labour until a few weeks before his death. But if that sounds merely worthy, it would be wrong. Peter Davis - his name before he acquired the title - had a major hand in turning Labour into an election-winning machine during the Wil son years. Together with David Kingsley and Denis Lyons, he formed a triumvirate of unpaid experts from the world of PR, advertising and the media to perform much the same function for Wilson that the Mandelsons, Folletts and Goulds performed for Tony Blair. They were known, not without irony, as the Three Wise Men. Confirming that New Labour is not as new as it thinks, Davis and his colleagues managed to persuade the party to accept serious, professional opinion-polling as part of the party's electoral armoury.

The future Czech president Vaclav Havel was among the domestic and international intellectuals and artists who voiced their outrage, and so it was that the Plastics' trial galvanised the human rights movement Charter 77, which fuelled the velvet revolution some 22 years later.</p> <p>\"Vaclav was the engine of the efforts,\" Hlavsa told the Guardian in a 1998 interview. \"The band itself had no political ambition, and we didn't intend to destroy communism through our music. If we helped, we are only too glad.\" The words of Epitaph, a song from the first Plastics' album, Egon Bondy's Happy Hearts Club Banned, are a poignant legacy of the gravel-voiced musician: \"It's too late now to protest/ I've been laid to rest.\"</p> <p>Hlavsa was born in Prague to a bankclerk father and a housewife mother. Coming from a generation that considered western-influenced music highly suspicious, and saw long-haired men as \"hooligans\", they thoroughly disapproved of their son's musical aspirations.</p> <p>He first developed his passion for rock music in the early 1960s, when his brother Vaclav, nine years his senior, started bringing home rock 'n' roll recordings which had mostly been smuggled into the country. He formed his first band at the age of 14. In 1967, he heard the first Velvet Underground album; he later told friends it was \"to influence the rest of my life\".</p> <p>He formed the Plastics a month after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, which crushed the Prague Spring. The name was taken from the Frank Zappa song, Plastic People, and a quotation of Andy Warhol: \"I love everything that is plastic, I would love to become plastic.\" The band was dismissed by the Czech communist daily, Rude Pravo, as \"long-haired, neurotic drug addicts and mental cases who take delight in the grossest of perversions and deliberately sing vulgar, anti-social songs\".</p> <p>When the Plastics' official status was revoked, they refused to give up, playing impromptu concerts under the guise of cultural theory lectures, often in village halls and secret locations. The quietly subversive Czech spirit meant they were never short of an audience.</p> <p>Their lyrics were smuggled out of Bohemia in samizdat form, their music dubbed and redubbed onto bootleg cassettes, and distributed often via diplomatic channels. Havel lent the Plastics his farmhouse at Hradecek, and offered advice on lyrics when their songwriter was arrested by the secret police.</p> <p>In 1998, Hlavsa said the Plastics felt \"more like a guerrilla group than a rock 'n' roll band\", when, in 1974, fans, arriving in the southern town of Ceske Budejovice for a concert, were set on by police, who clubbed them before herding them onto trains back to Prague. Many were expelled from university as a result. Despite the difficulties the Plastics faced, including their arrests, trials and imprisonments in 1976, they continued to perform underground, finally splitting up in 1987.</p> <p>In 1992, the now President Havel took Lou Reed, a founder member of the Velvet Underground, to a club in downtown Prague where Hlavsa was playing in the Velvet Underground Revival band. Hlavsa recalled the occasion: \"Lou was really impressed. He said: 'These guys know all my songs better than I do.' I said to Lou: 'My dream's come true, now I can die.' Lou said: 'Don't do that, my friend, it would be a tragedy.\"'</p> <p>In 1997, Havel held a Plastics' reunion concert at Prague castle to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Charter 77. It was the band's first ever official concert, in contrast to their usual rundown venues with equipment cobbled together from junk. A major tour of the Czech Republic followed, and a New York concert in the summer of 1998 was hailed with rave reviews.

Although the accident was said by royal aides to be minor and will not affect the prince's schedule of public engagements, it was the latest mishap to affect members of the royal family in what is being seen as a disastrous fortnight in public relations terms. The prince fell from his horse on wet and slippery ground near Ashbourne while hunting with the Meynell and South Staffordshire hunt. He clambered back into the saddle, but after the hunt finished he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth medical centre in Nottingham, where an x-ray examination revealed that he had fractured the acromium, a small bone near the shoulder blade. The prince's arm was placed in a sling but the fracture is expected to heal itself within a few weeks. He was said yesterday to be resting at his country home, Highgrove, in Gloucestershire. The accident follows the admission by Buckingham Palace last week that Princess Margaret had suffered a second stroke amid newspaper allegations that she was depressed about her state of health. There was also an incident involving the Princess Royal, who was said to have been rude to a pensioner who was trying to present a home-made basket of flowers to the Queen Mother outside Sandringham church on Christmas Day. The Queen spoke of her younger sister's health after attending church on the royal estate at Sandringham in Norfolk. Asked about the princess's health by well-wishers in a crowd of about 100 people, the Queen said: \"She is getting better.\" Further tabloid revelations about Prince Andrew cavorting with topless women on a beach while on holiday in Thailand over the new year have prompted even normally sycophantic newspapers to test their readers' reactions with strong personal criticism, questioning the long-term prospects of survival for the family in its current role. Reports of Prince Charles's accident prompted listeners to call the BBC yesterday morning to ask why no mention had been made of the health of the fox.",

      "bodyText": "The British government, in a policy u-turn, is to propose to the incoming US administration that the bombing of targets over southern Iraq should be stopped. British and US planes have enforced no-fly zones along Iraq's northern and southern borders since 1992. In the past two years alone, they have dropped more than 100 bombs, mainly against Iraqi air defences. The bombing, in what is sometimes called the \"forgotten war\", has led to an unknown number of civilian casualties. Hans von Sponek, the former UN humanitarian coordinator, writing in the Guardian last week, said that 144 civilians had died in the no-fly zones because of the bombing. The two no-fly zones were imposed by the US and Britain after the Gulf war in what was described as a humanitarian effort to protect the Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Kurds in the north. However, they are not backed by any UN security council resolution and do not include flights by Iraqi helicopters. Iraq is now flying civilian aircraft over the zones. The official British line is that there are no plans to change the approach to Iraq and that British foreign policy is determined independently of the US. In the Guardian last week, Peter Hain, the Foreign Office minister, strongly defended the no-fly zone policy. But in reality, the whole of US-British policy towards Iraq is under review as a result of the impending arrival of a new US administration. Among the top foreign policy issues the new president, George W Bush, will have to contend with is how to deal with the renewed confidence of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. Mr Bush is expected to take a tough line, given that his father was president at the time of the Gulf war and that his secretary of state, Colin Powell, commanded the Allied forces. Gen Powell has spoken of the need to \"re-energise\" US policy towards Iraq. But only Britain and the US remain enthusiastic about maintaining sanctions and France, among others, has criticised the continued bombing of southern Iraq. In an attempt to deflect criticism, the British government has been looking behind-the-scenes at the introduction of so-called \"smart\" sanctions and an end to the southern no-fly zone. The no-fly zone was meant to counter Saddam Hussein's assault on the southern Shi'ites by denying him air space. But the Iraqi campaign of repression has effectively ended because the anti-Saddam opposition in the towns and among the Marsh Arabs has been quelled. The Ministry of Defence, which has spent more than \u00a3800m policing the zones, is increasingly uneasy about the possibility of an RAF pilot going down, and the bombing has led to public concern, especially after evidence that victims have included civilians. The British government is proposing to retain the no-fly zone in the north because it argues the threat remains to the Iraqi Kurds. Although ready to consider fresh policies, Britain does not intend to let up on Saddam, seeing him as a serious threat to world stability. Downing Street has been increasingly toying with the idea of switching from a blanket ban that has exceptions to sanctions that specify a narrow band of prohibited goods, mainly weapons. UN reports have shown that the sanctions have resulted in a high civilian death toll, especially among children. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said yesterday a rethink of British and UN policy towards Iraq was \"absolutely necessary\". \"Ten years of inertia is no substitute for effective policy,\" he said. Also under consideration will be sanctions that target the regime more effectively by trying to limit the ability to travel and hitting overseas bank accounts, though such measures have proved difficult to achieve in the past.",

      "byline": "Larry Elliott",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The ancient Greeks believed their world was ruled by gods and goddesses living on the summit of Mount Olympus. There was a god of the sea, Poseidon; a goddess of love, Aphrodite. From this lofty pinnacle, the Olympians decided the fate of mortals, rewarding the good and punishing the wicked.</p> <p>They were very like human beings, apart from being endowed with superhuman powers. But in a world vulnerable to war, pestilence and disaster, the rulings of the Olympians provided an explanation for when life got tough.</p> <p>The modern world has its own Olympians. Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, is a new Olympian, as is Horst K\u00f6hler, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Mike Moore, director-general of the World Trade Organisation, is another, along with Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and a host of lesser deities. While there seems to be no candidate for the new Aphrodite, there is no doubt who is the Zeus in this pantheon: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>When he acted last week to cut half a point off US interest rates it was the equivalent of a thunderbolt hurled down from on high. Such was the faith in this god of gods that the markets instantly stopped selling shares and began buying truckloads instead. Greenspan had spoken. All would now be well.</p> <p>The reaction of the financial markets is fascinating, for two reasons. First, it is in flat contradiction to the orthodoxy of the past quarter-century, namely that policymakers have little control over economic activity, and that when they do try to meddle they do more harm than good.</p> <p>Yet here we had the situation where the mood in the markets changed simply because a central banker had loosened monetary policy by half a point. This belief in the omnipotence and omniscience of technocrats was supposed to have died out in the mid-70s, but is apparently alive and well in the dealing rooms of Wall Street and the City. </p> <p>As John Llewellyn of Lehman Brothers put it recently: \"Investors and traders typically pore over policymakers' utterances with an almost unimaginable intensity, revealing a belief in the effectiveness of policymaking that the policymakers, or at least their advisers, rigorously deny.\"</p> <p>This does not mean policymakers are powerless. Take the following example. A government comes into power committed to a policy of \"education, education, education\". Three and a half years later, the number of applications for post-graduate teaching courses is down 16.1% on the year and some schools are going on four-day weeks. Clearly, there is a shortage of people willing to sell their labour to the government for the going rate.</p> <p>The solution is to raise salaries. There is a mismatch between demand and supply - the culmination of decades in which increased workload and the decline in teachers' pay have made the job less attractive. In a perfect market either the salaries of teachers would rise to attract and retain more or consumers of education would take their custom elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "The ancient Greeks believed their world was ruled by gods and goddesses living on the summit of Mount Olympus. There was a god of the sea, Poseidon; a goddess of love, Aphrodite. From this lofty pinnacle, the Olympians decided the fate of mortals, rewarding the good and punishing the wicked. They were very like human beings, apart from being endowed with superhuman powers. But in a world vulnerable to war, pestilence and disaster, the rulings of the Olympians provided an explanation for when life got tough. The modern world has its own Olympians. Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, is a new Olympian, as is Horst K\u00f6hler, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Mike Moore, director-general of the World Trade Organisation, is another, along with Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and a host of lesser deities. While there seems to be no candidate for the new Aphrodite, there is no doubt who is the Zeus in this pantheon: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve. When he acted last week to cut half a point off US interest rates it was the equivalent of a thunderbolt hurled down from on high. Such was the faith in this god of gods that the markets instantly stopped selling shares and began buying truckloads instead. Greenspan had spoken. All would now be well. The reaction of the financial markets is fascinating, for two reasons. First, it is in flat contradiction to the orthodoxy of the past quarter-century, namely that policymakers have little control over economic activity, and that when they do try to meddle they do more harm than good. Yet here we had the situation where the mood in the markets changed simply because a central banker had loosened monetary policy by half a point. This belief in the omnipotence and omniscience of technocrats was supposed to have died out in the mid-70s, but is apparently alive and well in the dealing rooms of Wall Street and the City. As John Llewellyn of Lehman Brothers put it recently: \"Investors and traders typically pore over policymakers' utterances with an almost unimaginable intensity, revealing a belief in the effectiveness of policymaking that the policymakers, or at least their advisers, rigorously deny.\" This does not mean policymakers are powerless. Take the following example. A government comes into power committed to a policy of \"education, education, education\". Three and a half years later, the number of applications for post-graduate teaching courses is down 16.1% on the year and some schools are going on four-day weeks. Clearly, there is a shortage of people willing to sell their labour to the government for the going rate. The solution is to raise salaries. There is a mismatch between demand and supply - the culmination of decades in which increased workload and the decline in teachers' pay have made the job less attractive. In a perfect market either the salaries of teachers would rise to attract and retain more or consumers of education would take their custom elsewhere. Given that the government is a monopoly employer and, for most, a monopoly provider, it can buck the market. But the problem can only be resolved by making them work harder, importing teachers from overseas, cutting the length of the school week, or a combination thereof. Even then, it is only a short term solution. Teachers of economics, assuming that there are any left, might like to get their A-level students to sketch out some demand and supply curves for teachers to see why this is the case. Resolving a market failure in education is one thing; assuming Greenspan can play god is quite another. Increasing the supply of teachers is a two-dimensional problem; steering the global economy away from recession involves making sense of the decisions of millions of individual economic agents. This would be impossible even if they behaved rationally, but they do not.

Freed trade Today, with most of the barriers to trade and money torn down, it is impossible for central bankers and finance ministers to know what the effects of any policy move will be. A cut in interest rates should stimulate demand, but if individuals and firms believe the move is a portent of hard times, it may encourage them to save, rather than spend.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The hardest part of writing is the start. (I previously deleted four variations on this sentence.) But the novelist has at least 50 pages and the movie-writer 30 minutes to win the interest of the audience. In the 60s and 70s, when television was a novelty, the TV scriptwriter may have had half-an-hour's grace. These days, fighting hundreds of rival networks and alternative uses of the box, the only argument within the profession is whether you have five or ten minutes to forestall a switch-off. Some young pessimists say it's a mere minute. </p> <p>This attrition rate makes me nervous for In a Land of Plenty, a vastly expensive, ten-part drama adapted from a novel by Tim Pears. </p> <p>The trick in selling an epic story - In a Land of Plenty follows one family across the last five decades of the 20th century - is to establish the scale and implications at the beginning. This is why so many family sagas flashback from a funeral, jury verdict or impending suicide at the beginning. </p> <p>This structure has become a narrative default. As readers and viewers, we've all become used to the opening moments in the nursing home as the ancient crone croaks something enticing along the lines of: \"If my father hadn't landed on Mars, I wouldn't be sitting here 50 years later in Morocco with the fraud squad and the prime minister banging on the door.\" Then there are three dots on the page or fuzzy lines on screen and we're in wartime London. </p> <p>It's easy to understand why new talent wants to resist this standard format, but I fear that any other approach undersells what's coming. Adapter Kevin Hood and director Hettie Macdonald begin In a Land of Plenty with a beautiful but confusing mosaic of frames. We're then with a young married couple in the 50s. The drama feels small, domestic and period, which is merely a fraction of what it will eventually be. </p> <p>Halfway through the episode, you begin to sense what's being sown. </p> <p>Stuffy factory owner Charles Freeman (Robert Pugh) obsessively impregnates his wife Mary (Helen McCrory), creating a large and rivalrous set of siblings and fuelling frustrations in his wife, who dreams of being a Plath-like poet. </p> <p>After 50 minutes, it seemed a potential hit. But after ten, I'd thought it a disaster. This worries me because TV serials are like the 100 metres race: the start is everything. </p> <p>In television, new drama is as associated with January as repeats are with August. In Judge John Deed, GF Newman, the guvnor of the modern police series with Law And Order, upgrades to the legal big-wigs. </p> <p>On both the bookshelves and on television, the legal thriller has been one of the most powerful forms of the last decade. Now, with most barrister storylines used up, judges have become the subject, allowing the genre to apply for an extension. </p> <p>As writer and producer of Judge John Deed, Newman has created a clever twist on the cop genre. The maverick detective is now a character so overdone that TV had to turn to a dull stickler, Inspector Barnaby, in The Midsomer Murders. But once the enemy of the rule-book becomes a High Court judge, a clapped-out narrative banger can go back on the forecourt with a tempting price-sign. </p> <p>In casting which smartly underlines the transplant taking place, Judge Deed is played by Martin Shaw, still dashing around the video stores as a cop in The Professionals. Glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work, the piece tempts comparison between what was possible in television in the 70s and what is tolerated in the 90s. </p> <p>Newman's signature cynicism is still present; there's plenty of contempt for court. The judge is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC and connives with the Met police chief while jousting at their fencing club. Yet these offences against his profession are undertaken in good causes: helping his daughter to protest against GM crops, freeing a black defendant who has shot his daughter's killer. </p> <p>Some will think the guvnor has gone soft, but he retains a rare skill for involving narrative and dialogue. </p> <p>Appropriately, Judge John Deed is itself on trial. This one-off episode tests public tolerance of a series. But, if this offering doesn't justify the full term, then, as a litigant once remarked, I'm a banana. </p> <p>Tonight's conclusion of the two-part drama The Innocent is another twist on television law stories, in that both plaintiff and defendant in a rape case are barristers. Sexual assault is an attractive plot for fiction because the accused and the accuser's differing accounts offer a particularly stark example of the way in which all drama hopes to tease the viewer with two possible explanations. </p> <p>And yet rape is also a dangerous subject for fiction - rivalled only by race in this respect - because of the dilemma over whether the outcome should reflect reality or hope. In life, a probable majority of rapists go unprosecuted or unconvicted. But a drama which reflects this reality may seem to be endorsing a bloke's right to poke who he wants. Writer Jan McVerry's attempt to solve this problem in the final segment tonight is a fascinating technical exercise. </p> <p>\u0095 In a Land of Plenty, Wednesday, 9pm, BBC2 Judge John Deed, Tuesday, 8pm, BBC1 The Innocent, tonight, 9pm, ITV.</p> <p><strong>By the book</strong></p> <p>One of the most reliably entertaining items for consumer series such as Watchdog is the short film in which a reporter tries to follow the instruction manual for a new video recorder or computer. </p> <p>In America of late, there's been a trend for handbooks to the human personality, suggesting that a husband or wife can be run like a car, or that a co-operative toddler can be constructed by following numbered steps. Living By The Book (Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4) has had the idea of running a consumer test on these instruction manuals for people. </p> <p>In the first show, a focus group of three young British women test out The Rules, an American bestseller which tells single females how to snare a husband in 35 steps, which are broadly variations on the old advice to keep them keen by treating them mean. Intercourse, weekday dates and home-cooked meals must only be offered to a man according to a strict timetable constructed by two stern and now very rich Americans, Ellen and Sherrie. </p> <p>Sandi Scott's film contains the funniest dating scenes since There's Something About Mary. Having constructed a theology of attraction, Ellen and Sherrie preside like the Holy Inquisition over video diaries kept by the trio of British rule-users. </p> <p>\"This what you get if you cook on a Monday night for a man you've known for a month!\" shrieks one of the American rulers, noting that the guy is looking frightened. Urged to refuse a sunshine holiday with her beau because the rule-book is still confiscating passports at this stage, one of the testers insists on travelling. </p> <p>\"Talk about the weather\", she is warned, \"not your relationship.\" Regrettably, I fear that this lethally funny documentary will increase rather than reduce sales of The Rules. But anyone who understands the handbook for their video recorder should watch this skewering of the attempt to impose protocol on procreation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The hardest part of writing is the start. (I previously deleted four variations on this sentence.) But the novelist has at least 50 pages and the movie-writer 30 minutes to win the interest of the audience. In the 60s and 70s, when television was a novelty, the TV scriptwriter may have had half-an-hour's grace. These days, fighting hundreds of rival networks and alternative uses of the box, the only argument within the profession is whether you have five or ten minutes to forestall a switch-off. Some young pessimists say it's a mere minute. This attrition rate makes me nervous for In a Land of Plenty, a vastly expensive, ten-part drama adapted from a novel by Tim Pears. The trick in selling an epic story - In a Land of Plenty follows one family across the last five decades of the 20th century - is to establish the scale and implications at the beginning. This is why so many family sagas flashback from a funeral, jury verdict or impending suicide at the beginning. This structure has become a narrative default. As readers and viewers, we've all become used to the opening moments in the nursing home as the ancient crone croaks something enticing along the lines of: \"If my father hadn't landed on Mars, I wouldn't be sitting here 50 years later in Morocco with the fraud squad and the prime minister banging on the door.\" Then there are three dots on the page or fuzzy lines on screen and we're in wartime London. It's easy to understand why new talent wants to resist this standard format, but I fear that any other approach undersells what's coming. Adapter Kevin Hood and director Hettie Macdonald begin In a Land of Plenty with a beautiful but confusing mosaic of frames. We're then with a young married couple in the 50s. The drama feels small, domestic and period, which is merely a fraction of what it will eventually be. Halfway through the episode, you begin to sense what's being sown. Stuffy factory owner Charles Freeman (Robert Pugh) obsessively impregnates his wife Mary (Helen McCrory), creating a large and rivalrous set of siblings and fuelling frustrations in his wife, who dreams of being a Plath-like poet. After 50 minutes, it seemed a potential hit. But after ten, I'd thought it a disaster. This worries me because TV serials are like the 100 metres race: the start is everything. In television, new drama is as associated with January as repeats are with August. In Judge John Deed, GF Newman, the guvnor of the modern police series with Law And Order, upgrades to the legal big-wigs. On both the bookshelves and on television, the legal thriller has been one of the most powerful forms of the last decade. Now, with most barrister storylines used up, judges have become the subject, allowing the genre to apply for an extension. As writer and producer of Judge John Deed, Newman has created a clever twist on the cop genre. The maverick detective is now a character so overdone that TV had to turn to a dull stickler, Inspector Barnaby, in The Midsomer Murders. But once the enemy of the rule-book becomes a High Court judge, a clapped-out narrative banger can go back on the forecourt with a tempting price-sign. In casting which smartly underlines the transplant taking place, Judge Deed is played by Martin Shaw, still dashing around the video stores as a cop in The Professionals. Glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work, the piece tempts comparison between what was possible in television in the 70s and what is tolerated in the 90s. Newman's signature cynicism is still present; there's plenty of contempt for court. The judge is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC and connives with the Met police chief while jousting at their fencing club. Yet these offences against his profession are undertaken in good causes: helping his daughter to protest against GM crops, freeing a black defendant who has shot his daughter's killer. Some will think the guvnor has gone soft, but he retains a rare skill for involving narrative and dialogue. Appropriately, Judge John Deed is itself on trial. This one-off episode tests public tolerance of a series. But, if this offering doesn't justify the full term, then, as a litigant once remarked, I'm a banana. Tonight's conclusion of the two-part drama The Innocent is another twist on television law stories, in that both plaintiff and defendant in a rape case are barristers. Sexual assault is an attractive plot for fiction because the accused and the accuser's differing accounts offer a particularly stark example of the way in which all drama hopes to tease the viewer with two possible explanations. And yet rape is also a dangerous subject for fiction - rivalled only by race in this respect - because of the dilemma over whether the outcome should reflect reality or hope. In life, a probable majority of rapists go unprosecuted or unconvicted. But a drama which reflects this reality may seem to be endorsing a bloke's right to poke who he wants. Writer Jan McVerry's attempt to solve this problem in the final segment tonight is a fascinating technical exercise. \u0095 In a Land of Plenty, Wednesday, 9pm, BBC2 Judge John Deed, Tuesday, 8pm, BBC1 The Innocent, tonight, 9pm, ITV. By the book One of the most reliably entertaining items for consumer series such as Watchdog is the short film in which a reporter tries to follow the instruction manual for a new video recorder or computer. In America of late, there's been a trend for handbooks to the human personality, suggesting that a husband or wife can be run like a car, or that a co-operative toddler can be constructed by following numbered steps. Living By The Book (Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4) has had the idea of running a consumer test on these instruction manuals for people. In the first show, a focus group of three young British women test out The Rules, an American bestseller which tells single females how to snare a husband in 35 steps, which are broadly variations on the old advice to keep them keen by treating them mean. Intercourse, weekday dates and home-cooked meals must only be offered to a man according to a strict timetable constructed by two stern and now very rich Americans, Ellen and Sherrie. Sandi Scott's film contains the funniest dating scenes since There's Something About Mary. Having constructed a theology of attraction, Ellen and Sherrie preside like the Holy Inquisition over video diaries kept by the trio of British rule-users. \"This what you get if you cook on a Monday night for a man you've known for a month!\" shrieks one of the American rulers, noting that the guy is looking frightened. Urged to refuse a sunshine holiday with her beau because the rule-book is still confiscating passports at this stage, one of the testers insists on travelling. \"Talk about the weather\", she is warned, \"not your relationship.\" Regrettably, I fear that this lethally funny documentary will increase rather than reduce sales of The Rules. But anyone who understands the handbook for their video recorder should watch this skewering of the attempt to impose protocol on procreation.",

It had fight after fight in which people of whom we knew little - and cared less - died.

Hardly a great incentive for tuning in next week. </p> <p>(And for those who have an in-depth knowledge of Irish history, it might have been abundantly clear why Bill Paterson was doing a Connery and maintaining his Scottish accent whilst playing an Irishman, but for those of us without, it was not). </p> <p>As the serial develops, it's evident that those who would go onto become major figures in Irish republicanism - Michael Collins, Cathal Brugha - will come to the fore but after such a disappointing start, their rise to notoriety may well go unnoticed. </p> <p>In <strong> Titans</strong> (Sunday, Sky One), Aaron Spelling's steamy saga of duplicitous rich people, we got a gratuitous butt shot of Starship Troopers' Casper Van Dien, Yasmin \"Baywatch\" Bleeth in a bikini and Victoria Principal gazing meaningfully into her ex-husband's eyes.

The story of the middle-class Coyne's progress from well-to-do apathy into passionate belief in an Irish republic would have been engrossing and irresistible. Characters could have been honed and polished with plot inexorably leading to a disastrous denouement. (Such an approach worked rather well in Titanic after all). Instead, Rebel Heart began with what could have been the last episode of a serial you had missed the rest of. It had fight after fight in which people of whom we knew little - and cared less - died. Rather than mourn characters whom we had grown to like, respect or indeed hate - the socialist O'Toole was pretty magnetic as was the principled commander Ceannt - one merely rued the future absence of the actors who played them. Hardly a great incentive for tuning in next week. (And for those who have an in-depth knowledge of Irish history, it might have been abundantly clear why Bill Paterson was doing a Connery and maintaining his Scottish accent whilst playing an Irishman, but for those of us without, it was not). As the serial develops, it's evident that those who would go onto become major figures in Irish republicanism - Michael Collins, Cathal Brugha - will come to the fore but after such a disappointing start, their rise to notoriety may well go unnoticed. In Titans (Sunday, Sky One), Aaron Spelling's steamy saga of duplicitous rich people, we got a gratuitous butt shot of Starship Troopers' Casper Van Dien, Yasmin \"Baywatch\" Bleeth in a bikini and Victoria Principal gazing meaningfully into her ex-husband's eyes. Shoulder pads and oil companies may be out but with a Reaganite about to move into the White House and a recession on the way, it's like the 1980s all over again. All we need now is a Dana comeback and Armageddon will be upon us. Joy.",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 The issue of Iraq in 2001 is too critical for the future of its people, Europe's relations with the Middle East and the standing of international law for us to remain silent about Peter Hain's article (I fought apartheid, I'll fight Saddam, January 6).</p> <p>We write from privileged experience since we were charged by the UN secretary general to oversee the oil-for-food programme soon after its inception, from 1997 until last year. We both resigned in protest against what we perceive as a failed Iraq policy, with all its tragic human consequences, and the violation of international law.</p> <p>Arguing for an end to economic sanctions is not at all about \"propping up a dictator\". Have sanctions targeted the proper parties? No. Have sanctions imposed in 1990 retained their legality? The UN Charter, the International Covenants on Human Rights and a host of other treaties allow only one answer: they have not.</p> <p>Peter Hain is indeed \"ducking the debate\". We all know, professionally and personally, how difficult it is to admit failure. What a powerful and honourable signal Hain would send, if such awareness of failure would translate into courage for change.</p> <p>Hain has been hiding behind a smoke-screen for a long time with his defence of an indefensible policy conducted with little respect for facts. \"Iraq was a threat to humanity and this threat is real now,\" he maintains. This is a house of cards held aloft by those who want to maintain the status quo. Disinformation is morally and legally also indefensible. Hain's reference to UN resolution 688 as the legitimisation for the \"no-fly-zones\" in Iraq is an example. This resolution makes no reference to a right to take over Iraqi airspace, resulting in the tragic killing of civilians as detailed in the 1999 UN security reports.</p> <p>Hain repeatedly stresses that those who oppose sanctions offer no alternative. This is false. Both of us, for example, have said time and again that the UN security council should delink economic sanctions from the disarmament debate while imposing arms controls on Iraq and those countries which wish to sell arms to Baghdad, keeping in mind resolution 687, paragraph 14, which calls for the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction; we have argued that the hidden agenda of hardline geo-strategic interests be dropped and a dialogue be started; we have also argued that the unrealistic demand for quantitative disarmament be replaced by negotiations on weapon systems containment.</p> <p>We, too, fight against \"appeasement of oppression\". Ours, however, is a fight against the violation of international law by the UN security council and the sacrifice of innocent civilians as pawns.<br><b>Denis Halliday</b><br> UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq 1997-98 <b>HC von Sponeck</b><br> UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq 1998-2000<br></p> <p>\u0095 \"You simply have to notify the UN\" to export food and medicines, writes Peter Hain. The tortuous bureaucracy of the UN is beyond the scope of a letter. Exporting anything takes many months, on the UN's own admission.</p> <p>If a patient needs medicine it is needed immediately. I was threatened with prosecution by the Department of Trade and Industry for taking a small package of chemotherapy to Iraq for a surgeon with cancer - who had worked here for many years saving the lives of British children.</p> <p>A London-based Iraqi sent insulin in a Jiffy bag to his diabetic brother in Baghdad. It was returned by the Post Office with a request for an export licence. Before the licence was granted, his brother had died.<br><b>Felicity Arbuthnot</b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Hain's concern for the Kurds in Iraq would be touching if he extended it also to the Turkish Kurds. His support of UN resolutions imposed on Iraq would be more credible if he adopted the same attitude to those against Israel. His opposition to Iraqi weapons would be more justified if he condemned Israel's nuclear capability. Condemning Saddam Hussein is one thing but getting at him through the innocent children of Iraq is another.<br><b>June and Tony Freke</b><br> Newbury</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Hain claims that the bombing of northern Iraq by British and US aircraft was \"in support of security council resolution 688, which called on Iraq to end its repression of Kurds and the Shia\".</p> <p>Nowhere in the resolution is there even a hint about using force against Iraq. But it makes the point that \"all member states\" are committed to \"the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and of all states in the area\". So this is UN permission to bomb Iraq, is it? <br><b>Brian Cloughley</b><br> Thornhill, Dumfriesshire</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Hain has some nerve comparing the sanctions on Iraq to the sanctions imposed on apartheid South Africa. Whereas in South Africa it was the oppressed people who themselves called for sanctions to be imposed, there has been no such call from the Iraqi people. Whereas sanctions actually hurt white South Africa, they stand no chance of ousting Saddam. Indeed, sanctions have brought appalling hardship upon the people of Iraq and have served only to strengthen Saddam's grip on power.<br> <b>Timothy Walker</b><br> London</p>",

We write from privileged experience since we were charged by the UN secretary general to oversee the oil-for-food programme soon after its inception, from 1997 until last year. We both resigned in protest against what we perceive as a failed Iraq policy, with all its tragic human consequences, and the violation of international law. Arguing for an end to economic sanctions is not at all about \"propping up a dictator\". Have sanctions targeted the proper parties? No. Have sanctions imposed in 1990 retained their legality? The UN Charter, the International Covenants on Human Rights and a host of other treaties allow only one answer: they have not. Peter Hain is indeed \"ducking the debate\". We all know, professionally and personally, how difficult it is to admit failure. What a powerful and honourable signal Hain would send, if such awareness of failure would translate into courage for change. Hain has been hiding behind a smoke-screen for a long time with his defence of an indefensible policy conducted with little respect for facts. \"Iraq was a threat to humanity and this threat is real now,\" he maintains. This is a house of cards held aloft by those who want to maintain the status quo. Disinformation is morally and legally also indefensible. Hain's reference to UN resolution 688 as the legitimisation for the \"no-fly-zones\" in Iraq is an example. This resolution makes no reference to a right to take over Iraqi airspace, resulting in the tragic killing of civilians as detailed in the 1999 UN security reports. Hain repeatedly stresses that those who oppose sanctions offer no alternative. This is false. Both of us, for example, have said time and again that the UN security council should delink economic sanctions from the disarmament debate while imposing arms controls on Iraq and those countries which wish to sell arms to Baghdad, keeping in mind resolution 687, paragraph 14, which calls for the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction; we have argued that the hidden agenda of hardline geo-strategic interests be dropped and a dialogue be started; we have also argued that the unrealistic demand for quantitative disarmament be replaced by negotiations on weapon systems containment. We, too, fight against \"appeasement of oppression\". Ours, however, is a fight against the violation of international law by the UN security council and the sacrifice of innocent civilians as pawns. Denis Halliday UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq 1997-98 HC von Sponeck UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq 1998-2000 \u0095 \"You simply have to notify the UN\" to export food and medicines, writes Peter Hain. The tortuous bureaucracy of the UN is beyond the scope of a letter. Exporting anything takes many months, on the UN's own admission. If a patient needs medicine it is needed immediately. I was threatened with prosecution by the Department of Trade and Industry for taking a small package of chemotherapy to Iraq for a surgeon with cancer - who had worked here for many years saving the lives of British children. A London-based Iraqi sent insulin in a Jiffy bag to his diabetic brother in Baghdad. It was returned by the Post Office with a request for an export licence. Before the licence was granted, his brother had died. Felicity Arbuthnot London \u0095 Peter Hain's concern for the Kurds in Iraq would be touching if he extended it also to the Turkish Kurds. His support of UN resolutions imposed on Iraq would be more credible if he adopted the same attitude to those against Israel. His opposition to Iraqi weapons would be more justified if he condemned Israel's nuclear capability. Condemning Saddam Hussein is one thing but getting at him through the innocent children of Iraq is another. June and Tony Freke Newbury \u0095 Peter Hain claims that the bombing of northern Iraq by British and US aircraft was \"in support of security council resolution 688, which called on Iraq to end its repression of Kurds and the Shia\". Nowhere in the resolution is there even a hint about using force against Iraq. But it makes the point that \"all member states\" are committed to \"the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and of all states in the area\". So this is UN permission to bomb Iraq, is it? Brian Cloughley Thornhill, Dumfriesshire \u0095 Peter Hain has some nerve comparing the sanctions on Iraq to the sanctions imposed on apartheid South Africa. Whereas in South Africa it was the oppressed people who themselves called for sanctions to be imposed, there has been no such call from the Iraqi people. Whereas sanctions actually hurt white South Africa, they stand no chance of ousting Saddam. Indeed, sanctions have brought appalling hardship upon the people of Iraq and have served only to strengthen Saddam's grip on power. Timothy Walker London",

She is well used to the proposition: \"If it distresses you so much, just give me your money.\" But she is also aware of a more entrenched hostility to the rich, which she blames on the new \"wealthism\". I point out that in the process of getting wealthy there must be victims, so why should the unsuccessful be sympathetic? O'Neill says this is unfortunately the way it works: \"Of course we can't expect people who hate us to want to help us,\" she says. \"There is so much fear now between the classes.\" The one surprising missing element is religion, usually vital to the American crusader. \"I don't follow a particular religious path,\" she says, \"but I believe we are all on this earth for a reason.\" So this is not the philosophy of a sect. But what is wrong with the perfectly acceptable mechanism for creating a just society: massive taxation of the rich? \"I don't like to get too political,\" says O'Neill. \"But I certainly think the wealthy should be taxed in proportion to the amount of money they have. Taxes are non-directed philanthropy, and we favour philanthrophy. But certainly, we don't pay our teachers enough and we don't pay our day care workers. \"I don't do this work so that people will feel sorry for the rich,\" she says. \"I do this work so that the $136 trillion that is going to be transferred to the next generation can get to where it needs to go.\" That would include her daughters. One, aged 20, is studying to be a professional horse trainer; the other, 18, is in high school. Both have trust funds from their grandmother worth $2m each. So are they in danger of an attack of affluenza? \"I think it is certainly enough for them to suffer from affluenza if they are not properly prepared,\" says O'Neill. \"But I think it is also a nice amount if they choose to use it well. On my side, what ever money I have left I will leave to my charitable Affluenza foundation. I won't leave my daughters anything\". \u0095 Jessie O'Neill appears in The Secret Life of Happiness on BBC1 on Wednesday at 9.10pm.",

      "body": "<p>When Eminem leaves the Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 21, after the Recording Academy's 43rd annual Grammy awards, he will have made his mark even if he goes home empty-handed. The world's biggest rapper - real name Marshall Bruce Mathers III - has already earned himself a place in Grammy history as the most controversial nominee to date, garnering four nominations (including best album) for a CD that features the lines: \"You think I give a damn about a Grammy? Half you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.\" </p> <p>The hand that Eminem has bitten is now attempting to feed him. </p> <p>Within hours of their announcement last Wednesday, the nominations were providing further material for his intensely self-referential lyrics.

It's about violence.\" </p> <p>In fact, The Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem's 9m-selling second album, is about a whole lot more than that. Notably, on tracks including The Real Slim Shady, The Way I Am and Criminal, it's about the media and the music industry, taking potshots at critics such as Timothy White, editor of the trade magazine Billboard. What better way for the stuffy Grammies to take a walk on the wild side than rewarding somebody who regards them with such contempt? </p> <p>Britain's own Brit awards may be conservative, but the Grammies make them look revolutionary. Even Nirvana, an alternative rock act that conquered the mainstream, went unrecognised by the academy until 1996, after Kurt Cobain, their frontman, had committed suicide. Last year, eight awards went to Carlos Santana, the veteran guitarist. </p> <p>But now it seems that the academy is going all-out for credibility. With a never-ending list of niche categories (best traditional tropical Latin album, anybody?), most big-selling acts get a chance of bagging a gong, but the Grammies' true colours are displayed in the shortlist for best album. This year, refreshingly, such middle-aged establishment favourites as Steely Dan and Paul Simon have to duke it out with Beck's Midnite Vultures and Radiohead's Kid A, as well as Eminem. </p> <p>Of course, it's perilously difficult to retain your edge once you have begun schmoozing the suits. Just ask Everlast, the white rapper-turned-bluesman who is one of Eminem's foes.

In fact, he has more in common with Radiohead, his fellow nominees. Both have followed breakthrough albums with uncommercially extreme discs that somehow sold even more. Most importantly, both have proved remarkably resistant to flattery, greeting fame and adoration with undisguised disdain. But even Radio head's Thom Yorke wouldn't go quite as far as the line in The Way I Am where Eminem spits: \"I'm so sick and tired of being admired that I wish that I would just die or get fired.\" </p> <p>In a sense, Eminem has already proved he can hang on to his credibility. On Kill You, the first track on The Marshall Mathers LP, he sneers: \"They say I can't rap about being broke no more/They didn't say I can't rap about coke no more.\" Critics claimed that the instant success of his debut album, The Slim Shady LP, would distance him from his subject matter - the desperate nihilism of America's poverty-stricken white underclass. Then it turned out that the complications of fame had only made his mood worse and inspired an even more misanthropic sequel. </p> <p>If you're hunting for precedents, skip his hip-hop peers and consider Kurt Cobain, another white blue-collar superstar prone to depression. Nirvana followed their critically acclaimed, 10m-selling Nevermind album with the abrasive In Utero, whose sarcastic working titles included Verse Chorus Verse and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter. The catch, of course, is that within a year of its release an anguished Cobain had put a shotgun in his mouth. </p> <p>Similarly, the feting of Eminem has a twist in the tail. His turbulent personal life is inextricably tangled with his music, lending a sharper edge to such album highlights as the haunting stalker tale Stan and the grotesquely compelling Kim, in which he acts out a murderous showdown with his (now estranged) wife. For the listener, it's win-win: you get to admire one of the greatest lyricists that pop has recently produced and also feel the voyeuristic thrill of an accident waiting to happen. Eminem's fans will demand yet more extremity on his third album, but at what cost to the man himself? </p> <p>The Grammy president, Michael Greene, has said: \"This is probably the most repugnant record of the year, but in a lot of ways it's also one of the more remarkable records of the year.\" He is being disingenuous - the repugnance is essential to the appeal.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Perhaps more than any other demographic, teenage girls are true, if not downright ardent, believers in the concept of the quick-fix solution. This is the premise on which generations of us have shelled out small fortunes on spot creams and curling tongs, and why books on spells are enjoying cult status among schoolgirls. Now, though, there is a new miracle cure, one that carries a higher price tag than the old get-a-boyfriend-by-Friday gimmicks: breast implants.</p> <p>The current furore surrounding 15-year-old Jenna Franklin and the refusal of a surgeon to give her breast implants before she reaches the age of 18 is just one case among many. According to the Channel 4 documentary Perfect Breasts, to be shown tomorrow night, Franklin is part of \"the silicone generation\", a growing army of teenagers who believe their lives will be transformed through the acquisition of perfect breasts.</p> <p>Franklin's motivation for wanting to undergo surgery as soon as possible is nothing if not hopeful. \"I want to be famous. And I don't think you can be famous without boobs. When I'm going out and I've got to get dressed up, the world's over for me.\" Her parents, not uncoincidentally both employed in the cosmetic surgery industry, were happy to shell out the \u00a33,250 required for the operation, but it looks as if their daughter still has a long wait ahead of her.</p> <p>\"I had thought about having my breasts enlarged when I was 12,\" she says, \" but when I was about to turn 15, I saw so many people having it done that I wanted mine bigger as well. Every other person you see on television has had implants. If I want to be successful, I need to have them, too.\"</p> <p>This perceived link between perfect breasts and success appears to be all-pervasive. Kay, a 19-year-old singer who recently had surgery and also appears in the documentary, believes it to be true. \"Because of the career I want, I need to look my best. Sex sells. Most girls in the music industry at the moment have had it done. Even if your music's not good, if you look great then the men are going to buy your stuff anyway.\"</p> <p>Thankfully not everyone accepts this viewpoint. \"You have to have talent to be successful, not breasts,\" argues Tanya, 16. \"It might be true that certain people got signed to record labels, or are TV presenters, because of their breasts instead of their raw talent, but then where's the success in that? If people are going to have breast implants just so they can get on in certain industries, they might as well just sleep their way to the top.\"</p> <p>Sociologists may scratch their heads and come up with theories of cleavage oppression propagated by pubescent icons such as Britney Spears, assorted Spices and All Saints, Lara Croft and the monstrous creature from the Triumph bra commercial. But media images are not solely responsible for the current outbreak of cleavage envy, as the findings of two recent surveys show.</p> <p>One, conducted by BUPA, noted that one in five British children have such a poor image of themselves that they would consider cosmetic surgery. Another, from teen website <a href=\"http://www.wowgo.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Wowgo</a>, found that two-thirds of girls aged between 12 and 14 wanted cosmetic surgery to make them feel happier and stop them being bullied. Most wanted breast implants added or fat removed. Last year, 2,000 girls under 18 had breast implant surgery.</p> <p>Psychologist Petra Boynton has carried out extensive research into young women and body image, and has studied different responses to images of \"perfect\" breasts. \"What was most disturbing was how women recoiled from images of 'normal' breasts, such as those of different sizes, and responded positively to the perfect, airbrushed ones from glamour magazines, referring to those as 'normal'.</p> <p>You can blame the celebrities publicly sporting implants, but that is to take a certain level of power away from teenage girls themselves. They do invent their own idea of what looks good. The current trend is to be slim and large-breasted; a few years back it was the waif look. The difficulty is providing girls with a forum where they can talk about their fears and insecurities, and give them positive feedback about themselves.\"</p> <p>Boynton is opposed to girls under the age of 18 undergoing the surgery. \"The biggest psychological risk is that these girls believe their life will alter beyond belief after surgery. But if they are already experiencing such an extreme level of body dissatisfaction, then it's unlikely they will overnight get the self-esteem to go out and face the world. You really need to look at the underlying causes of low self-esteem.\" She warns that if these aren't sorted out, the most likely scenario is for a woman to try to solve her problems with more surgery, to other areas.</p> <p>Getting this message through to young women is not going to be easy. \"Breast implants are like having sex; no one can say that a girl isn't ready at 16 because all girls are different,\" says Lucy, 17. \"It's hard for teenage girls, boys can be really spiteful sometimes. If you have a small chest and boys are always laughing at you because of it, calling you names, you start to believe you're worthless. Implants are a good idea because they help girls gain confidence and that's important.\"</p> <p>Some feminist academics would agree with her. Ever since we entered what Naomi Wolf called \"the surgical age\", women of all ages have been seeking to boost their confidence in the operating theatre. Kathy Davis, author of Reshaping the Female Body: the Dilemma of Plastic Surgery (Routledge), has spent years interviewing women who have undergone surgery. She argues against the notion that these women are \"cultural dupes\", vainly attempting to fulfil the fantasies of lovers, husbands or surgeons. For the most part, she asserts, women want cosmetic surgery not to attain an impossible standard of beauty, but to be perceived as normal.</p> <p>Charmaine, 21, spent her teenage years yearning for implants. \"When I was 17, I really wanted to be a model. My friends told me I had the looks but I was scared to pursue it because I had such a small chest. All my friends were big-breasted and when we walked about college, it was as though boys were interested in them but not me. They told me I was being paranoid but I knew I wasn't because of the name-calling. I just wanted to have big breasts and be normal. I was really unhappy and thought about implants. I'm glad I didn't have them.\"</p> <p>So what of the teenage boys in this equation, what do they think? \"Yeah, of course it's important for girls to have big breasts,\" says Michael, 16, seemingly without shame. \"When you go to a club, or you're walking down the street, and you see a girl with a nice body - you know, big breasts, hips, all the curves in the right places but not fat - you've got to try to get her number, because that's the type of girl you want to be seen with. But if you've got a girl with no breasts, people are going to think it's because you're not man enough to get a real girl, then you will get cussed hard.\"</p> <p>With comments like this, is it any wonder teenage girls find themselves turning to surgery? Boynton doesn't agree. \"The whole point of being teenage is that you're supposed to be full of angst. It's all about finding yourself and your own identity, discovering your body and how you look as a woman. Most of the women I know, when they look at old photos of themselves, are very surprised. Most say: 'Hey, I wasn't that bad after all!' \"</p>",

This is the premise on which generations of us have shelled out small fortunes on spot creams and curling tongs, and why books on spells are enjoying cult status among schoolgirls. Now, though, there is a new miracle cure, one that carries a higher price tag than the old get-a-boyfriend-by-Friday gimmicks: breast implants. The current furore surrounding 15-year-old Jenna Franklin and the refusal of a surgeon to give her breast implants before she reaches the age of 18 is just one case among many. According to the Channel 4 documentary Perfect Breasts, to be shown tomorrow night, Franklin is part of \"the silicone generation\", a growing army of teenagers who believe their lives will be transformed through the acquisition of perfect breasts. Franklin's motivation for wanting to undergo surgery as soon as possible is nothing if not hopeful. \"I want to be famous. And I don't think you can be famous without boobs. When I'm going out and I've got to get dressed up, the world's over for me.\" Her parents, not uncoincidentally both employed in the cosmetic surgery industry, were happy to shell out the \u00a33,250 required for the operation, but it looks as if their daughter still has a long wait ahead of her. \"I had thought about having my breasts enlarged when I was 12,\" she says, \" but when I was about to turn 15, I saw so many people having it done that I wanted mine bigger as well. Every other person you see on television has had implants. If I want to be successful, I need to have them, too.\" This perceived link between perfect breasts and success appears to be all-pervasive. Kay, a 19-year-old singer who recently had surgery and also appears in the documentary, believes it to be true. \"Because of the career I want, I need to look my best. Sex sells. Most girls in the music industry at the moment have had it done. Even if your music's not good, if you look great then the men are going to buy your stuff anyway.\" Thankfully not everyone accepts this viewpoint. \"You have to have talent to be successful, not breasts,\" argues Tanya, 16. \"It might be true that certain people got signed to record labels, or are TV presenters, because of their breasts instead of their raw talent, but then where's the success in that? If people are going to have breast implants just so they can get on in certain industries, they might as well just sleep their way to the top.\" Sociologists may scratch their heads and come up with theories of cleavage oppression propagated by pubescent icons such as Britney Spears, assorted Spices and All Saints, Lara Croft and the monstrous creature from the Triumph bra commercial. But media images are not solely responsible for the current outbreak of cleavage envy, as the findings of two recent surveys show. One, conducted by BUPA, noted that one in five British children have such a poor image of themselves that they would consider cosmetic surgery. Another, from teen website Wowgo, found that two-thirds of girls aged between 12 and 14 wanted cosmetic surgery to make them feel happier and stop them being bullied. Most wanted breast implants added or fat removed. Last year, 2,000 girls under 18 had breast implant surgery. Psychologist Petra Boynton has carried out extensive research into young women and body image, and has studied different responses to images of \"perfect\" breasts. \"What was most disturbing was how women recoiled from images of 'normal' breasts, such as those of different sizes, and responded positively to the perfect, airbrushed ones from glamour magazines, referring to those as 'normal'. You can blame the celebrities publicly sporting implants, but that is to take a certain level of power away from teenage girls themselves. They do invent their own idea of what looks good. The current trend is to be slim and large-breasted; a few years back it was the waif look. The difficulty is providing girls with a forum where they can talk about their fears and insecurities, and give them positive feedback about themselves.\" Boynton is opposed to girls under the age of 18 undergoing the surgery. \"The biggest psychological risk is that these girls believe their life will alter beyond belief after surgery. But if they are already experiencing such an extreme level of body dissatisfaction, then it's unlikely they will overnight get the self-esteem to go out and face the world. You really need to look at the underlying causes of low self-esteem.\" She warns that if these aren't sorted out, the most likely scenario is for a woman to try to solve her problems with more surgery, to other areas. Getting this message through to young women is not going to be easy. \"Breast implants are like having sex; no one can say that a girl isn't ready at 16 because all girls are different,\" says Lucy, 17. \"It's hard for teenage girls, boys can be really spiteful sometimes. If you have a small chest and boys are always laughing at you because of it, calling you names, you start to believe you're worthless. Implants are a good idea because they help girls gain confidence and that's important.\" Some feminist academics would agree with her. Ever since we entered what Naomi Wolf called \"the surgical age\", women of all ages have been seeking to boost their confidence in the operating theatre. Kathy Davis, author of Reshaping the Female Body: the Dilemma of Plastic Surgery (Routledge), has spent years interviewing women who have undergone surgery. She argues against the notion that these women are \"cultural dupes\", vainly attempting to fulfil the fantasies of lovers, husbands or surgeons. For the most part, she asserts, women want cosmetic surgery not to attain an impossible standard of beauty, but to be perceived as normal. Charmaine, 21, spent her teenage years yearning for implants. \"When I was 17, I really wanted to be a model. My friends told me I had the looks but I was scared to pursue it because I had such a small chest. All my friends were big-breasted and when we walked about college, it was as though boys were interested in them but not me. They told me I was being paranoid but I knew I wasn't because of the name-calling. I just wanted to have big breasts and be normal. I was really unhappy and thought about implants. I'm glad I didn't have them.\" So what of the teenage boys in this equation, what do they think? \"Yeah, of course it's important for girls to have big breasts,\" says Michael, 16, seemingly without shame. \"When you go to a club, or you're walking down the street, and you see a girl with a nice body - you know, big breasts, hips, all the curves in the right places but not fat - you've got to try to get her number, because that's the type of girl you want to be seen with. But if you've got a girl with no breasts, people are going to think it's because you're not man enough to get a real girl, then you will get cussed hard.\" With comments like this, is it any wonder teenage girls find themselves turning to surgery? Boynton doesn't agree. \"The whole point of being teenage is that you're supposed to be full of angst. It's all about finding yourself and your own identity, discovering your body and how you look as a woman. Most of the women I know, when they look at old photos of themselves, are very surprised. Most say: 'Hey, I wasn't that bad after all!' \"",

She has eyes like saucers and looks like an ordinary, healthy girl.\"</p> <p>Jodie was separated from her twin Mary in a 20-hour operation in November. Her parents had opposed the procedure on religious grounds because they knew it would inevitably lead to the death of the weaker of the girls. Surgeons had argued that it was better to operate and save Jodie because both girls would inevitably die if nothing were done about their condition. They were able to carry out the separation only after a lengthy legal battle, and could not say for certain that it would not leave Jodie disabled.</p> <p>Last month, the parents spoke for the first time about Jodie's progress. At first she did not smile, making them afraid that something had gone wrong. But when the doctors stopped administering morphine, she settled, they said.</p> <p>Mrs Attard said: \"We are very happy - she likes to try to talk with us and she smiles at people and at us. It makes us encouraged for the future. She is going to be a real fighter.\"</p> <p>Last month, Adrian Bianchi, a paediatric consultant who helped perform the separation, said Jodie was now a \"bright, alert and interested child\". She was likely to be able to live a completely normal life. At first doctors had believed that it could be 12 months or even up to five years before Jodie would be well enough to return to Gozo.</p> <p>Mr Hubble said: \"No date had been set for Jodie to be discharged but she is much further forward than anticipated. She is putting on weight as would be expected with any normal child.\"</p> <p>The Attards now take her from the intensive care unit for a half hour or so at a time and take her in a pram around the hospital and its grounds. They spent Christmas with Jodie in the hospital.</p> <p>Since the publicity around the case, the Attards have been inundated with gifts and messages of goodwill. They have spent many weekends with Mr Hubble and his family at his Staffordshire home, and an appeal fund to support Jodie through further treatment has topped \u00a3350,000 and could reach \u00a3500,000 by Easter. The cloud on the horizon is Mary's funeral. Her parents need to chose between returning to Gozo without Jodie to lay her sister to rest, or waiting until Jodie is well enough to travel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The parents of the surviving conjoined twin, Jodie, could be allowed to take their baby girl back home to the Maltese island of Gozo in a matter of weeks, it emerged yesterday. Doctors are pleased with the progress of the five-month-old whose parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard, are able to push her in a pram around the hospital complex where she is being treated. Although St Mary's hospital in Manchester says the baby will probably continue to be treated there until the spring or summer, a close family friend, Tony Hubble, said she could be discharged in \"weeks rather than months\". Mr Hubble said yesterday: \"She is a beautiful little girl who is beginning to resemble her mum. She has eyes like saucers and looks like an ordinary, healthy girl.\" Jodie was separated from her twin Mary in a 20-hour operation in November. Her parents had opposed the procedure on religious grounds because they knew it would inevitably lead to the death of the weaker of the girls. Surgeons had argued that it was better to operate and save Jodie because both girls would inevitably die if nothing were done about their condition. They were able to carry out the separation only after a lengthy legal battle, and could not say for certain that it would not leave Jodie disabled. Last month, the parents spoke for the first time about Jodie's progress. At first she did not smile, making them afraid that something had gone wrong. But when the doctors stopped administering morphine, she settled, they said. Mrs Attard said: \"We are very happy - she likes to try to talk with us and she smiles at people and at us. It makes us encouraged for the future. She is going to be a real fighter.\" Last month, Adrian Bianchi, a paediatric consultant who helped perform the separation, said Jodie was now a \"bright, alert and interested child\". She was likely to be able to live a completely normal life. At first doctors had believed that it could be 12 months or even up to five years before Jodie would be well enough to return to Gozo. Mr Hubble said: \"No date had been set for Jodie to be discharged but she is much further forward than anticipated. She is putting on weight as would be expected with any normal child.\" The Attards now take her from the intensive care unit for a half hour or so at a time and take her in a pram around the hospital and its grounds. They spent Christmas with Jodie in the hospital. Since the publicity around the case, the Attards have been inundated with gifts and messages of goodwill. They have spent many weekends with Mr Hubble and his family at his Staffordshire home, and an appeal fund to support Jodie through further treatment has topped \u00a3350,000 and could reach \u00a3500,000 by Easter. The cloud on the horizon is Mary's funeral. Her parents need to chose between returning to Gozo without Jodie to lay her sister to rest, or waiting until Jodie is well enough to travel.",

Television exit polls combined with unofficial results indicated that the opposition Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party of policeman-turned-telecoms magnate Thaksin Shinawatra could gain as many as 257 of the legislature's 500 seats. The incumbent prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, conceded defeat yesterday despite revotes being ordered in several constituencies and investigations into vote-buying expected in dozens of others. \"The result is quite clear,\" he said. \"I believe the people have freely made their choice and we respect that decision.

However, Mr Thaksin has said he wants a stable base of at least 320 seats, so he is likely to continue coalition talks with a couple of minor parties. But it remains unclear whether Mr Thaksin, who formed his party only 18 months ago as a vehicle for his personal political ambitions, will be able to enjoy a mandate to govern a country still struggling to recover from the economic crisis that broke in 1997.

The year 2001 is census year, when households throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are required by law to fill out the detailed forms whose raw data is used by central and local government for planning and policy making. The aim of the exercise is to provide accurate information on the numbers of people in the UK, where they live and what their needs are. In England and Wales alone the census is costing \u00a3225m. Forms will have to be delivered to some 24m households and the Office for National Statistics is seeking part-time recruits to do the necessary legwork. Parallel censuses will take place at the same time in Scotland and Northern Ireland, using similar forms but with question variations that reflect local needs. The recruitment drive for the England and Wales census is due to get under way in a blaze of publicity in central London before rolling out across the rest of the country in a series of awareness-raising roadshows over the following two weeks. The enumerators, or census takers as the ONS is keen for them to be known, will be paid \u00a3318, rising to \u00a3398 in parts of London, for the equivalent of two weeks' work between March 20 and May 21. Equipped with large yellow bags bearing the census logo \"Count me in\", their task will be to hand deliver the bar coded forms and make follow up calls to households that have not returned them after census day, April 29. They will also be asked to make notes of derelict or unoccupied properties as part of the exhaustive statistical exercise. Recruits, who will work mainly at weekends and in the evening, will be required to be good communicators, meticulous, community spirited and able to keep to deadlines. With the exception of 1941, a census has been taken every 10 years in Great Britain since 1801. Householders will this year be required to answer a series of around 50 questions on everything from education and employment activity to the number of rooms in their home and the lack or otherwise of amenities such as central heating and inside toilets. Failure to make a completed return can lead to a \u00a31,000 fine. More than 400 people were prosecuted in the wake of the last census in 1991 when the final tally, achieving a 98% coverage of the population, was affected by the aftermath of the poll tax protests. The nature of questions asked down the years has changed from census to census, reflecting changes in society and technological advances. For the current census, new questions on general health and unpaid personal carers have been added. In England and Wales the ethnic group categories used 10 years ago have been extended to include Irish, mixed ethnic group, black British and Asian British - a development that has caused anger in parts of Wales, where there have been protests at the absence of a separate Welsh tick box on the census form. Although householders in Wales can choose to fill in a Welsh language form and will be allowed to write the word Welsh in the tick box marked \"other\", the ONS and government officials are keen to head off any revolt against taking part in the survey. The director of census, Graham Jones, was in Cardiff yesterday to hammer home the message that Wales will lose out economically if the census figures are wrong. Rhodri Morgan, first minister of the national assembly for Wales, has already warned that any boycott or burning of census forms would deny the Welsh people their entitlement to extra money to tackle poverty and employment. Plaid Cymru, which has led the chorus of anger over the issue, insisted yesterday that it was not advocating that people should not fill in their form.

      "bodyText": "The government was last night embroiled in a dirty tricks row after an official memo alleged that a minister wanted civil servants to dig up damaging information to \"rubbish\" the radical Channel 4 comedian Mark Thomas. Richard Caborn, the trade minister, denied the allegation, claiming that he had been misinterpreted by an official, who had since been disciplined. Thomas has written to the prime minister Tony Blair calling for an investigation to establish whether Mr Caborn has broken the code of conduct for ministers. The comedian said: \"If Caborn wants to smear me, this is a waste of taxpayers' money and time. This is the type of behaviour you would expect from undemocratic regimes, not from a government which promised to be whiter than white.\" A batch of Whitehall emails has revealed how officials sought to counter the threat of Thomas's criticisms of controversial government support for British exporters during long-running skirmishes. They also show how the comedian irked officials, one of whom dubbed him \"an out-and-out nutter\", when he publicised the activities of a Whitehall organisation, the export credit guarantee department (ECGD), in his television series. The row centres on an email on May 3 last year in which an unnamed ECGD official wrote: \"Thomas is back on the tele in the autumn (by the way, [name of official deleted] also said that Caborn wants him to gather as much background/dirt on him in order to rubbish him).\" Yesterday, Mr Caborn appeared to shift the blame on to the unnamed official who wrote the email. The minister said he was \"unaware of the contents of this email, and since the contents came to light, the official concerned has received a warning over the incident\". He said he had never asked for dirt to rubbish the comedian, but had merely \"made a purely procedural request for background on Mark Thomas and his programme, as a result of the programme's continuing interest in the ECGD and its projects\". Thomas's show, a hybrid of comedy and investigation, has for five years used humour and stunts to highlight political issues and scandals, from arms sales to Indonesia to American spying on Britons. Two programmes looked at the ECGD, for which Mr Caborn is responsible. The department provides British exporters with credit and insures them in case foreign buyers default. Thomas criticised ECGD plans to support the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey, by a consortium including Balfour Beatty, that will make more than 25,000 Kurdish people homeless. He was also scathing about official aid for selling military equipment, efforts to wipe out debt in developing countries, and the secrecy surrounding the ECGD. The comedian has used the new Data Protection Act to obtain the internal memos about himself from government departments, for a programme to be broadcast tonight, the first of a new series of The Mark Thomas Product. This \"anti-Big Brother\" act gives citizens the right to see information about themselves that is contained in files held by the government and other bodies so they can check it is accurate and is not being misused. The names of officials who wrote the emails have been deleted by the government to preserve their privacy. In one ECGD email, an official wrote: \"Mark Thomas appears to be an alternative comedian who specialises in investigatory journalism.\" Another official replied: \"Thomas is certainly 'alternative' - but I wouldn't go so far as to call him a 'comedian' - the bloke is an out-and-out nutter - and he more or less agreed he was when he rang me later.\" Another email says: \"We ought not to give Thomas 'chatting' time given what an inquisitor he is. \"And we should do our best to 'help' to get [Caborn] away if he stays verbal jousting for too long.\" The memos show how the ECGD grappled with different tactics to defend its activities. Last January, a civil servant wrote to a senior ECGD official: \"You have said that we should attempt to close him down - and put all correspondence through the minister for trade [Mr Caborn].\" Later that day, another official replied: \"I understand from [name deleted] that Mr Caborn has now reversed his view about starving Thomas of information.

Campaigns of a TV stuntman \u0095 Pursued the former Tory minister William Waldegrave in a tank asking him to help export it to Iraq during the controversy over selling military equipment to Saddam Hussein. \u0095 Ambushed a train carrying nuclear waste with 40 protesters dressed in military uniform in a hoax terrorist attack.

      "bodyText": "Safeguards for civil service impartiality were yesterday demanded by former senior Whitehall officials and MPs following the Guardian's disclosure of government plans to develop a powerful electronic information and rebuttal system. Leaked cabinet office documents described the aim of the Knowledge Network Project, as it is officially known, as explaining `the government's core message' so that the public could get `the full facts without going through the distorting prism of media reporting'. Critics of the hi-tech project yesterday raised questions about what effect it would have on the impartiality of the civil service and the accountability of government. They expressed fears that a system intended to make the running of government more efficient and professional could be used for party political purposes. The system, a descendant of the Excalibur database the Labour party used during the 1997 election, opens a new chapter in the relationship between the Labour government and the civil service . The project, devised by Frank Dobson's former spin doctor, Joe McCrea, recommended that the database included the `best five arguments and the best three facts' for every key government policy, as well as the `key quotes, key facts and rapid reaction to attacks on departmental policy and practice'. One former senior cabinet office civil servant, Sir Peter Kemp, told the BBC yesterday: `The question is whether civil servants and the rest will actually be able, or indeed allowed, to put out totally objective material.' If the new machinery meant civil servants could not put out the `four bad facts' as well as the three good ones, then, `I think we may be in trouble.' The idea of trying to cut out the `distorting prism of the media' was mistaken, he said, since it was media reporting that kept democracy alive. Jonathan Baume, head of the civil service union the First Division Association, said there were clear rules for civil servants and the government's information service, and the Knowledge Network would help modernise work that was already being carried out. But he warned: `What would be difficult is if this system was hijacked in some way to be used for party political purposes. The danger would be if people who had access to it, which must clearly include special advisers, would then misuse this information for party purposes.' The home secretary, Jack Straw, defended the system as a sensible use of new information technology systems, and said it was consistent with traditional political debate. He also insisted that it was no threat to opposition parties, because Labour had doubled the state aid they received, in the interest of fairness. `This is information which is going to be used publicly any way, and is available publicly,' Mr Straw told the Guardian. `This is about material which is used for public argument.

You could set up an informal work-shadowing system with them, so all staff get a better idea of the company's functions. \u0095 If project teams are being set up, and you'd like to contribute, then volunteer. Don't wait to be asked. And if you see a part of your boss's job that you could take on, go in and ask for it. Everyone is busy, so the onus is on you to get yourself noticed. \u0095 How is your body language? If you're a bit of a mouse, take lessons or study others who have got it right. Walk confidently, and with a purpose. Always keep eye contact with people, and give a firm handshake. Walk into rooms with your head held high; don't sneak in, looking at the ground. \u0095 In meetings, greet everyone brightly and look as though you're meant to be there. Never sit through a meeting in silence. Even if you only say: \"Yes, I think Mark's point is important,\" or \"Can we open a window?\" \u0095 Your boss can help to raise your profile, so get them to make sure senior managers know who you are. If your boss isn't already aware, draft a \"skills and achievements\" document, which shows both what you have done and what you can do. \u0095 So go on - the new year is a great time to start. Draft an action plan headed \"Me plc\" and start selling your skills to your organisation. They'll be amazed when they find out what you can do - and they'll wonder why they never thought of you before. \u0095 Penny Cottee is editor of Executive PA magazine.",

      "body": "<p>This time last year, Maureen Hudson was a highly qualified, highly paid communications manager for an international firm. Today, she is a less qualified, lower-paid secretary for a smaller firm. \"What went wrong?\" is the most common reaction to her story. But the reality is that the 44-year-old made the career move out of choice. </p> <p>Recruitment agencies including Office Angels and Reed report that downshifting from being the boss to the PA is increasingly common, and that January is the most prevalent time for taking the plunge. </p> <p>Why? Hudson opted for the \"new year, new life\" because of the stress of her managerial position. \"Secretarial work seemed the perfect solution because it holds far less responsibility than a managerial position, yet it holds enough responsibility to still be stimulating,\" she explains. </p> <p>Initially, Hudson made the decision to leave her job because she wanted to set up a website, \"but the pressure wound up being even more severe than the managerial job. Although I may well go back to pursuing it one day, I've decided that, for the time being, I want a job where there remains plenty of challenge - for example in IT and communication - but little stress. When I leave the office now, I don't have to think about work until the following morning.\" </p> <p>Mek Rahmani, chief executive of Deskdemon.com, a website aimed at management support professionals, increasingly hears such tales. \"What we are witnessing is an increase in people wanting the same level of 'drive' in their role, but a lower level of accountability,\" he says. \"That's why we refuse to refer to the move from manager to secretary as 'downshifting'.\" </p> <p>Betsy Jaffe, president of US consulting firm Career Continuum, even claims that for some managers, becoming a secretary can be an ambitious option. \"The 90s' rush to create 'flatter' organisations and to get rid of 'jobs for life' led to companies knocking rungs out of career ladders. What they were essentially saying is 'goodbye to the ladder and hello to the chequerboard.' In other words, today's career moves need to be sideways, forwards, diagonal and sometimes even backwards,\" she says. </p> <p>Once people feel \"stuck\" in a position that's not right for them, says Jaffe, that's the time to make their move - not necessarily upwards - but to another post, even in another company, where they have a different range of learning experiences. \"It's the breadth of skills rather than sta tus that increasingly count in today's working climate,\" she insists. \"If you can show, as many secretaries do, that you can do everything from arranging company conferences to running personnel, it could potentially count for more in the long run than a series of specialised, blinkered managerial jobs.\" </p> <p>A further reason for her career move, says Hudson, is the level of contact she now has with people. \"I am far more involved with colleagues and clients - and on a far more equal footing - than I ever have been in previous roles,\" she explains. </p> <p>Likewise, Judy Briers, 35, swapped her job as manager in a major stationery firm for PA in an insurance company because she felt she had no life. \"I was on contract to work 40 hours a week, yet it wasn't uncommon for me to be working 60. Some weeks, I rarely saw my children. My best friend, who is a PA, had been telling me for years that unpaid overtime is far less common in her profession, and one day last year I woke up and took her advice. I haven't looked back.\" </p> <p>The latest Quality of Work/Life Survey carried out by the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) found that 86% of managers claimed long hours were adversely affecting their relationship with their children, and a further 79% said the hours were putting pressure on their relationship with their partner. </p> <p>Professor Cary Cooper, the organisational psychologist who headed the survey, says: \"PAs and secretaries certainly aren't immune from being asked to do regular overtime, but studies show such requests are far less likely than for managers. It's one of the reasons graduates who value their work/life balance are increasingly turning to secretarial work.\" </p> <p>In fact, research by the UMIST recently found that 55% of secretaries not only work reasonable hours, but that 55% are key users of flexible working - often including working partly from home. \"This provides the opportunity to spend more time with the kids, to study, to stop spending so much time commuting, to prevent boredom or simply to work less,\" says Paul Jacobs, communications officer at Office Angels. \"It also enables people to take advantage of their body clock. Some people, for instance, work much better in the evening than in the morning.\" </p> <p>Dr Jane Sturges, research fellow at London University's Birkbeck College, believes the increase in bosses-turned-secretaries is because \"today's job-seekers - particularly women - have different incentives than previous generations\". So when your friend beams, \"My new job is amazing. I've got a company sports car, a huge corner office and stacks of money coming in. Who could ask for more?\", you're more likely than ever to reply, \"Me, actually.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, cautions Eileen Stillwell, 52, who gave up her job as a secondary school teacher to spend more time with her children, becoming a secretary isn't always a smooth transition. \"It's a very ageist sector and the newer you are to it, the more you're likely to suffer,\" she explains. \"I approached nine recruitment agencies in search of a secretarial job. The more honest ones actually admitted that my age would go against me, despite having good qualifications and a continuous work record. In the end, I felt I had no choice but to go back to my original job.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Blue Arrow, the recruitment agency, warns anyone about to downshift to think carefully about the inevitable drop in income. \"We've found that people tend to underestimate how much money they need to maintain the lifestyle they enjoy.

      "bodyText": "This time last year, Maureen Hudson was a highly qualified, highly paid communications manager for an international firm. Today, she is a less qualified, lower-paid secretary for a smaller firm. \"What went wrong?\" is the most common reaction to her story. But the reality is that the 44-year-old made the career move out of choice. Recruitment agencies including Office Angels and Reed report that downshifting from being the boss to the PA is increasingly common, and that January is the most prevalent time for taking the plunge. Why? Hudson opted for the \"new year, new life\" because of the stress of her managerial position. \"Secretarial work seemed the perfect solution because it holds far less responsibility than a managerial position, yet it holds enough responsibility to still be stimulating,\" she explains. Initially, Hudson made the decision to leave her job because she wanted to set up a website, \"but the pressure wound up being even more severe than the managerial job. Although I may well go back to pursuing it one day, I've decided that, for the time being, I want a job where there remains plenty of challenge - for example in IT and communication - but little stress. When I leave the office now, I don't have to think about work until the following morning.\" Mek Rahmani, chief executive of Deskdemon.com, a website aimed at management support professionals, increasingly hears such tales. \"What we are witnessing is an increase in people wanting the same level of 'drive' in their role, but a lower level of accountability,\" he says. \"That's why we refuse to refer to the move from manager to secretary as 'downshifting'.\" Betsy Jaffe, president of US consulting firm Career Continuum, even claims that for some managers, becoming a secretary can be an ambitious option. \"The 90s' rush to create 'flatter' organisations and to get rid of 'jobs for life' led to companies knocking rungs out of career ladders. What they were essentially saying is 'goodbye to the ladder and hello to the chequerboard.' In other words, today's career moves need to be sideways, forwards, diagonal and sometimes even backwards,\" she says. Once people feel \"stuck\" in a position that's not right for them, says Jaffe, that's the time to make their move - not necessarily upwards - but to another post, even in another company, where they have a different range of learning experiences. \"It's the breadth of skills rather than sta tus that increasingly count in today's working climate,\" she insists. \"If you can show, as many secretaries do, that you can do everything from arranging company conferences to running personnel, it could potentially count for more in the long run than a series of specialised, blinkered managerial jobs.\" A further reason for her career move, says Hudson, is the level of contact she now has with people. \"I am far more involved with colleagues and clients - and on a far more equal footing - than I ever have been in previous roles,\" she explains. Likewise, Judy Briers, 35, swapped her job as manager in a major stationery firm for PA in an insurance company because she felt she had no life. \"I was on contract to work 40 hours a week, yet it wasn't uncommon for me to be working 60. Some weeks, I rarely saw my children. My best friend, who is a PA, had been telling me for years that unpaid overtime is far less common in her profession, and one day last year I woke up and took her advice. I haven't looked back.\" The latest Quality of Work/Life Survey carried out by the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) found that 86% of managers claimed long hours were adversely affecting their relationship with their children, and a further 79% said the hours were putting pressure on their relationship with their partner. Professor Cary Cooper, the organisational psychologist who headed the survey, says: \"PAs and secretaries certainly aren't immune from being asked to do regular overtime, but studies show such requests are far less likely than for managers. It's one of the reasons graduates who value their work/life balance are increasingly turning to secretarial work.\" In fact, research by the UMIST recently found that 55% of secretaries not only work reasonable hours, but that 55% are key users of flexible working - often including working partly from home. \"This provides the opportunity to spend more time with the kids, to study, to stop spending so much time commuting, to prevent boredom or simply to work less,\" says Paul Jacobs, communications officer at Office Angels. \"It also enables people to take advantage of their body clock. Some people, for instance, work much better in the evening than in the morning.\" Dr Jane Sturges, research fellow at London University's Birkbeck College, believes the increase in bosses-turned-secretaries is because \"today's job-seekers - particularly women - have different incentives than previous generations\". So when your friend beams, \"My new job is amazing. I've got a company sports car, a huge corner office and stacks of money coming in. Who could ask for more?\", you're more likely than ever to reply, \"Me, actually.\" Nevertheless, cautions Eileen Stillwell, 52, who gave up her job as a secondary school teacher to spend more time with her children, becoming a secretary isn't always a smooth transition. \"It's a very ageist sector and the newer you are to it, the more you're likely to suffer,\" she explains. \"I approached nine recruitment agencies in search of a secretarial job. The more honest ones actually admitted that my age would go against me, despite having good qualifications and a continuous work record. In the end, I felt I had no choice but to go back to my original job.\" Meanwhile, Blue Arrow, the recruitment agency, warns anyone about to downshift to think carefully about the inevitable drop in income. \"We've found that people tend to underestimate how much money they need to maintain the lifestyle they enjoy. The reality usually hits them after about three months into their new role, and is often an unwelcome shock,\" says communications director Charles Walker. David Kasmir, group HR director at employment agency Manpower, adds that, \"Anyone thinking of downshifting shouldn't be naturally authoritative. You can get away with being bossy as a manager, but you'll have little hope as a secretary. It can be a knock to the self-worth to discover people no longer do what you ask.\" Cooper also concedes that natural power-seekers may not make it. \"If you've opted to downshift because you want less responsibility, you must be careful not to let your intrinsic drive push you into being power-orientated in your new role.

      "body": "<p>The retail sector is one of the UK's biggest employers, accounting for one in nine of the workforce. It is also one of the fastest growing - more than a fifth of jobs created in 1999 were in retail. </p> <p>Such rapid expansion in the tightest labour market for more than a generation should be pushing up wages but it is not. While average wage rises are about 5%, in retail they are 3.5%. This is true behind the scenes as well as on the shopfloor. Even in central London, secretarial salaries in retail lag around \u00a31,000 behind other sectors. </p> <p>The consequence of low wages and far from brilliant conditions is rapid staff turnover. About half the staff employed in retail leave every year. This figure is way above even those sectors such as nursing, which are said to be in a recruitment crisis. Part of the problem is that the employers themselves are under considerable financial pressure. Like manufacturing, retail is suffering a long-term slide independent of the rises and falls of the economy. </p> <p>One of the reasons for this is consumer pressure. With the rise of e-commerce, customers shop longer and harder and are looking for bigger and better bargains. They are also wise to sales, and prepared to wait for bargains. Value for money has overtaken conspicuous consumption. </p> <p>There are some pluses for employees, however. Low wages and high turnover make retail a youthful sector. Real managerial responsibility can be attained by the mid-20s, if you are prepared to wait a short space of time. </p> <p>And despite the pressures, the retail sector does, on occasion, produce some of the more progressive employee development programmes. Asda, for example, has a community service scheme that trains staff in team-building through work on environmental neighbourhood projects. And B&amp;Q has an impressive record in combating ageism with its experienced DIY enthusiasts at hand. It makes a point of hiring older men who understand what they are selling, rather than youngsters desperate to leave retailing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The retail sector is one of the UK's biggest employers, accounting for one in nine of the workforce. It is also one of the fastest growing - more than a fifth of jobs created in 1999 were in retail. Such rapid expansion in the tightest labour market for more than a generation should be pushing up wages but it is not. While average wage rises are about 5%, in retail they are 3.5%. This is true behind the scenes as well as on the shopfloor. Even in central London, secretarial salaries in retail lag around \u00a31,000 behind other sectors. The consequence of low wages and far from brilliant conditions is rapid staff turnover. About half the staff employed in retail leave every year. This figure is way above even those sectors such as nursing, which are said to be in a recruitment crisis. Part of the problem is that the employers themselves are under considerable financial pressure. Like manufacturing, retail is suffering a long-term slide independent of the rises and falls of the economy. One of the reasons for this is consumer pressure. With the rise of e-commerce, customers shop longer and harder and are looking for bigger and better bargains. They are also wise to sales, and prepared to wait for bargains. Value for money has overtaken conspicuous consumption. There are some pluses for employees, however. Low wages and high turnover make retail a youthful sector. Real managerial responsibility can be attained by the mid-20s, if you are prepared to wait a short space of time. And despite the pressures, the retail sector does, on occasion, produce some of the more progressive employee development programmes. Asda, for example, has a community service scheme that trains staff in team-building through work on environmental neighbourhood projects. And B&amp;Q has an impressive record in combating ageism with its experienced DIY enthusiasts at hand. It makes a point of hiring older men who understand what they are selling, rather than youngsters desperate to leave retailing.",

She looks for trends or patterns forming, and their likely causes. The weather can be a factor in her findings: she'll log on to the Met Office website and add summaries of the daily conditions and temperatures to the report.</p> <p>When she's back at her computer, the phone rings frequently with individual shop managers enquiring about comparable information from the previous week, or the corresponding time last year. \"It gives them meaningful feedback. Plus, they'll share anecdotal evidence with us - they're on the ground, as it were, seeing things for themselves, so it's a two-way thing.\"</p> <p>For Atkinson, the most enjoyable part of the job is supplying training on DSA to incoming retailers, or new employees in existing outlets. \"It's easy to use. All in all, it takes me only about half an hour to talk through what they need to do.\" (Showing an admirable level of devotion to the task, she prefers to visit them, rather than the other way round. Only in the name of her work, you understand).</p> <p>Marketing is the thread that runs throughout her career, including four years with Thomson Holidays. She has been employed by Lend Lease, the management company behind Bluewater, since June 1999 - the centre had opened only that March - and started as a temp, spending four weeks on general admin, assisting PAs throughout the office. \"That was close to a month-long interview, really,\" she says. \"I got to know how Bluewater operates, the team here learnt about me, and it was a nice way of doing it.\"</p> <p>Her progress was swift. She became PA to the marketing director, and within two months her current role had been created and offered to her. Atkinson believes she has been fortunate - \"right place, right time\" - but the speed at which events changed for her meant she had to adapt to a faster-paced environment than she had experienced in the past. \"My background meant I was used to coping with fixed patterns of demand - very different to retail, which is reactive, and quite specialised.\"</p> <p>Starting at Bluewater made her feel \"like a child let loose in a candy store. I am completely addicted to shopping,\" she admits, happily. </p> <p>During her first couple of months, she spent most of the lunch hours scanning the malls. \"But I've got that down to not every day now!\"</p> <p>After some thought, she says the biggest disadvantage of her surroundings is that she has absolutely no excuse to offer anyone if she is late with a birthday card or gift. When temptation does cross her path, however, Atkinson is careful to avoid committing all her spending to plastic. \"I have got a credit card, and it can be convenient. But I make sure the amounts don't build up too much, and even as a child, my philosophy was always to save up for something until I could afford to buy it.\"</p> <p>Working in shopping heaven, and remaining financially solvent? Now that's a level of self-control you just can't put a price on.</p>",

Plus, they'll share anecdotal evidence with us - they're on the ground, as it were, seeing things for themselves, so it's a two-way thing.\" For Atkinson, the most enjoyable part of the job is supplying training on DSA to incoming retailers, or new employees in existing outlets. \"It's easy to use. All in all, it takes me only about half an hour to talk through what they need to do.\" (Showing an admirable level of devotion to the task, she prefers to visit them, rather than the other way round. Only in the name of her work, you understand). Marketing is the thread that runs throughout her career, including four years with Thomson Holidays. She has been employed by Lend Lease, the management company behind Bluewater, since June 1999 - the centre had opened only that March - and started as a temp, spending four weeks on general admin, assisting PAs throughout the office. \"That was close to a month-long interview, really,\" she says. \"I got to know how Bluewater operates, the team here learnt about me, and it was a nice way of doing it.\" Her progress was swift. She became PA to the marketing director, and within two months her current role had been created and offered to her. Atkinson believes she has been fortunate - \"right place, right time\" - but the speed at which events changed for her meant she had to adapt to a faster-paced environment than she had experienced in the past. \"My background meant I was used to coping with fixed patterns of demand - very different to retail, which is reactive, and quite specialised.\" Starting at Bluewater made her feel \"like a child let loose in a candy store. I am completely addicted to shopping,\" she admits, happily. During her first couple of months, she spent most of the lunch hours scanning the malls. \"But I've got that down to not every day now!\" After some thought, she says the biggest disadvantage of her surroundings is that she has absolutely no excuse to offer anyone if she is late with a birthday card or gift. When temptation does cross her path, however, Atkinson is careful to avoid committing all her spending to plastic. \"I have got a credit card, and it can be convenient. But I make sure the amounts don't build up too much, and even as a child, my philosophy was always to save up for something until I could afford to buy it.\" Working in shopping heaven, and remaining financially solvent? Now that's a level of self-control you just can't put a price on.",

But it is important to remember that Isas remain sound investments, if viewed over the long term, and are a way of saving tax-free. </p> <p>But, with the investment markets set to recover slowly, no one should see an Isa as a short-term bet. Most suggest money should be tied up for a minimum of five years.</p> <p>There are a number of investment trends being tipped by the experts as likely winners in 2001 and while not all are in agreement, there are some common themes. In particular, global, European and smaller UK companies are viewed as good bets for a winning Isa.</p> <p>So, which are the likely Isa winners this year?</p> <p>Philip Saunders, director of Isa provider Investec says avoid anything \"faddish\". \"I would steer clear of any exotic themed fund, such as those claiming to be focusing on ecology or whatever. Stick to broad-themed Isas such as those covering Europe.\"</p> <p>He says the improving euro is good news for Isa investors who choose a European fund. For those looking to the UK, he recommends funds that focus on stocks outside of the FTSE 100. \"We offer an opportunities fund, which looks at smaller to medium sized companies This is volatile but offers good potential.\"</p> <p>Robin Stoakley, sales director for Schroders, agrees that Europe is one of the best areas for growth and that smaller companies in the UK are a good tip, but he also insists that thematic Isas remain good buys. \"We expect one of our best sellers to be our medical discovery fund, which focuses on a range of healthcare sectors including bio-technology.\"</p> <p>If you are completely bamboozled by the choice of Isas on the market, it is worth seeing an independent financial adviser to point you in the right direction. Some will charge a fee, others will be paid a commission if you buy on their recommendation.</p> <p>Terry Reed, a financial adviser in Bishops Stortford, says his first piece of advice to anyone would be to ignore \"headline rates used in advertising\". He says these snapshot figures are often misleading.</p> <p>For recommendations, Mr Reed says that many of Fidelity's global funds have performed well and also favours a \"fund of funds\" approach. \"I've been recommending Portfolio Fund Managers to my clients who want a safe option\", he says.</p> <p>He adds anyone who has just a small amount of money to invest, should take advantage of a mini-cash Isa, since these can be opened with as little as \u00a31. </p> <p>Another adviser, Alan Lakey of Highclere Financial Services in Hemel Hempstead, says he has seen several clients who have had bad experiences with technology Isas this year. </p> <p>\"One client came to see us who had borrowed money on a credit card to put into a technology Isa. They've lost a lot of money that they are now struggling to pay back. They'd have been a lot better off with a building society.\"</p> <p>But, Mr Lakey says for a client who does want some risk, he would suggest Japan, and in particular, Gartmore's Japanese growth fund.</p> <p>But, not everyone is steering clear of technology. Michael Aaron of Milton Keynes advisers David Aaron Partnership, says that the technology crash will mean the stocks are now far better value: \"There are plenty of good holdings still and the lower cost can be good for those prepared to wait.\"</p> <p>Of course, these are just a few suggestions, so be prepared to put in some research of your own, so for more background information on ISAs, keep checking out the information supplied on <a href=\"http://www.moneyunlimited.co.uk\">Money Unlimited</a>.</p>",

But, with the investment markets set to recover slowly, no one should see an Isa as a short-term bet. Most suggest money should be tied up for a minimum of five years. There are a number of investment trends being tipped by the experts as likely winners in 2001 and while not all are in agreement, there are some common themes. In particular, global, European and smaller UK companies are viewed as good bets for a winning Isa. So, which are the likely Isa winners this year? Philip Saunders, director of Isa provider Investec says avoid anything \"faddish\". \"I would steer clear of any exotic themed fund, such as those claiming to be focusing on ecology or whatever. Stick to broad-themed Isas such as those covering Europe.\" He says the improving euro is good news for Isa investors who choose a European fund. For those looking to the UK, he recommends funds that focus on stocks outside of the FTSE 100. \"We offer an opportunities fund, which looks at smaller to medium sized companies This is volatile but offers good potential.\" Robin Stoakley, sales director for Schroders, agrees that Europe is one of the best areas for growth and that smaller companies in the UK are a good tip, but he also insists that thematic Isas remain good buys. \"We expect one of our best sellers to be our medical discovery fund, which focuses on a range of healthcare sectors including bio-technology.\" If you are completely bamboozled by the choice of Isas on the market, it is worth seeing an independent financial adviser to point you in the right direction. Some will charge a fee, others will be paid a commission if you buy on their recommendation. Terry Reed, a financial adviser in Bishops Stortford, says his first piece of advice to anyone would be to ignore \"headline rates used in advertising\". He says these snapshot figures are often misleading. For recommendations, Mr Reed says that many of Fidelity's global funds have performed well and also favours a \"fund of funds\" approach. \"I've been recommending Portfolio Fund Managers to my clients who want a safe option\", he says. He adds anyone who has just a small amount of money to invest, should take advantage of a mini-cash Isa, since these can be opened with as little as \u00a31. Another adviser, Alan Lakey of Highclere Financial Services in Hemel Hempstead, says he has seen several clients who have had bad experiences with technology Isas this year. \"One client came to see us who had borrowed money on a credit card to put into a technology Isa. They've lost a lot of money that they are now struggling to pay back. They'd have been a lot better off with a building society.\" But, Mr Lakey says for a client who does want some risk, he would suggest Japan, and in particular, Gartmore's Japanese growth fund. But, not everyone is steering clear of technology. Michael Aaron of Milton Keynes advisers David Aaron Partnership, says that the technology crash will mean the stocks are now far better value: \"There are plenty of good holdings still and the lower cost can be good for those prepared to wait.\" Of course, these are just a few suggestions, so be prepared to put in some research of your own, so for more background information on ISAs, keep checking out the information supplied on Money Unlimited.",

But we inevitably find ourselves thinking of Jackson Pollock's line as a cowboy's lasso or as a drunk's trail of piss on the floor. Whatever we look at, we bring to it a wealth of association; even something as apparently non-referential as the colour pink has a history that could fill a book. This makes abstract painting a lot of fun for artists today, who can play on its seriousness and bring it down to size, pointing out its unacknowledged sexual suggestiveness, insisting that it is (as the abstract expressionists went to such extremes to deny) a pretty decoration, a colourful thing to put on the wall. </p> <p>Victoria Morton does this with great panache. Her paintings frolic with the different associations of different kinds of patterning. They evoke both the big space of landscape and the textures of softer, lighter, indoor stuff: boas, costume jewellery, buttons and the unreal colours of party clothes - a silvery turquoise, a shimmer of blue. </p> <p>Based in Glasgow, this young artist seems to have a systematic ambition to reimagine the Scottish landscape. You can see it quite clearly and richly in her art: her pictures, with their cascades of green, brown and feathery blues and reds, make you think of forest and pheasant. At the same time, you think of parties, dresses, decorations, silks and velvets. Natural and luxuriantly synthetic at the same time, her Scotland is a sexy utopia. </p> <p>Morton's paintings also unexpectedly evoke the abstract expressionist Arshile Gorky, who was born in Armenia and emigrated to the US in the wake of the Armenian genocide, then later committed suicide. Gorky's abstract paintings, with their falls and gusts of colour, are drenched in memories of the lost landscape of his childhood. In a far more optimistic way, Morton seems to emulate his art in her own imaginary, unreal landscapes. </p> <p>She pictures a land that might be, rather than one lost forever.
