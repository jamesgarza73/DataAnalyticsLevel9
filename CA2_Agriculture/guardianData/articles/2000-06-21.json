      "body": "<p>Second-guessing which of the dot.com start-ups will survive is exercising the sharpest brains on both sides of the Atlantic. Picking the survivors is the task Barron's, the influential business magazine, has set itself. This week saw its second stab at predicting the winners and losers. </p> <p>In contrast to its first analysis three months ago, the paper this time won the tacit support of Henry Blodget, star internet strategist at Merrill Lynch. When Barron's published its first report in March - which caused controversy among some of the companies on the list - high profile start-ups such as Peapod were hit hard. </p> <p>The magazine knocked billions off Cisco last month when it aired concerns about its accounting practices. The methodology does court controversy, and like last time, some companies on this week's list have already issued clarifying statements. Mr Blodget yesterday said: \"It's a good back-of-the-envelope measure.\" </p> <p>Barron's picked its losers by calculating how quickly dotcom companies are burning through their precious cash. More than 60 of the 227 dot.coms in its league table could run out money in the coming 12 months, an uncomfortable position since venture captalists have become wary of fresh investments after watching the stock market values of dot.coms plummet to $693bn from $1.4 trillion. </p> <p>The fall has meant fewer flotations. Only 39, worth $4.2bn, have been made by internet companies since the peak of the Nasdaq hi-tech stock market in March. Investors are already jumpy - Barron's work will panic them. Top of the 227-strong burn list, compiled with research company Pegasus, are GenesisIntermedia.com, Convergent Com, Netzee, Peapod and Bluefly, a discount clothing company which Barron's warns could run of cash in less than a month. </p> <p>Better-known groups, such as Amazon, the online book seller, are also on the list. Barron's calculated that Amazon, will run of cash in 35 months time. Ask Jeeves, the search engine, is given 23 months. The conclusions are reached by scrutinising the \"burn rate\" of cash for each company during the first quarter of the year. </p> <p>The paper tried to take account of action taken by the companies to bolster their financial positions since their last set of reported figures. </p> <p>Barron's particularly highlights 12 dot.coms which are likely to be making announcements in the coming months about their position. </p> <p>One company, on line advertising and media network 24/7, ranked 33rd, was forced into making its announcement just hours after the article appeared, pledging that it had \"sufficient liquidity to carry the company to a break-even on a cash basis\" by the first half of 2002. By Barron's calculations, it will run out of cash in a little over six months. </p> <p>It is not all doom and gloom, however.

      "bodyText": "Second-guessing which of the dot.com start-ups will survive is exercising the sharpest brains on both sides of the Atlantic. Picking the survivors is the task Barron's, the influential business magazine, has set itself. This week saw its second stab at predicting the winners and losers. In contrast to its first analysis three months ago, the paper this time won the tacit support of Henry Blodget, star internet strategist at Merrill Lynch. When Barron's published its first report in March - which caused controversy among some of the companies on the list - high profile start-ups such as Peapod were hit hard. The magazine knocked billions off Cisco last month when it aired concerns about its accounting practices. The methodology does court controversy, and like last time, some companies on this week's list have already issued clarifying statements. Mr Blodget yesterday said: \"It's a good back-of-the-envelope measure.\" Barron's picked its losers by calculating how quickly dotcom companies are burning through their precious cash. More than 60 of the 227 dot.coms in its league table could run out money in the coming 12 months, an uncomfortable position since venture captalists have become wary of fresh investments after watching the stock market values of dot.coms plummet to $693bn from $1.4 trillion. The fall has meant fewer flotations. Only 39, worth $4.2bn, have been made by internet companies since the peak of the Nasdaq hi-tech stock market in March. Investors are already jumpy - Barron's work will panic them. Top of the 227-strong burn list, compiled with research company Pegasus, are GenesisIntermedia.com, Convergent Com, Netzee, Peapod and Bluefly, a discount clothing company which Barron's warns could run of cash in less than a month. Better-known groups, such as Amazon, the online book seller, are also on the list. Barron's calculated that Amazon, will run of cash in 35 months time. Ask Jeeves, the search engine, is given 23 months. The conclusions are reached by scrutinising the \"burn rate\" of cash for each company during the first quarter of the year. The paper tried to take account of action taken by the companies to bolster their financial positions since their last set of reported figures. Barron's particularly highlights 12 dot.coms which are likely to be making announcements in the coming months about their position. One company, on line advertising and media network 24/7, ranked 33rd, was forced into making its announcement just hours after the article appeared, pledging that it had \"sufficient liquidity to carry the company to a break-even on a cash basis\" by the first half of 2002. By Barron's calculations, it will run out of cash in a little over six months. It is not all doom and gloom, however. Barron's calculates that e-companies are burning up their cash slightly less quickly than they were in the previous three months of the survey - the last quarter of 1999 - claiming they ate up $1.15bn in the first three months of year, a fall of 24%. There are 20 more companies included in the survey this time as more companies are making disclosures about their positions. Revenue - said by analysts to be the key to success for any dot.com company - is starting to rise, with the net companies taking in a combined $12.5bn in the first quarter, from $10.3bn. This is said to give dot.com companies a combined life span of 13 years, a dramatic improvement on the eight years calculated during the last survey. Barron's found nine companies that actually reported positive cash flows - rather than a cash drain - during the three months.

John Tavener's Total Eclipse - given its world premiere on the opening night of the City of London festival - curiously shares its title with Christopher Hampton's haunting study of the creative power of homoerotic love. Both works, essentially about inspiration, also share blinding as an image: Hampton's characters are metaphorically blinded by desire; for Tavener, the light of Christ robs the body of physical sight in order to illuminate the soul. </p> <p>Writing for performance in St Paul's Cathedral, Tavener takes that saint's conversion on the road to Damascus as an archetypal model of mystical experience. This is music that aspires to convey a sudden flash of insight that resonates through eternity. Tavener, himself a convert to the Eastern Orthodox Church, ranges fearlessly over time, space and tradition. The scoring embraces antiquity and modernity: the main orchestra is a period band (the Academy of Ancient Music, conducted by Paul Goodwin) augmented by modern percussion and ancient Tibetan instruments. Saul/Paul is dually represented by a counter-tenor (Christopher Robinson) and a soprano saxophone (John Harle), the pair of them weaving their way round the building in the enactment of their spiritual journey. The Choir of New College Oxford, in full regalia, anchor the work in ritual. Massive batteries of timpani are placed in each transept. </p> <p>Tavener exploits to the limit the cathedral's vast 10-second reverberation, and begins by bombarding us with a barrage of sound from all sides in an awesome depiction of the Crucifixion, against which Harle's sax can be heard screaming flutter-tongued imprecations. The tumult is gradually stilled as the voice of Christ (tenor James Gilchrist) drifts down from the dome. Harle's raving is gradually replaced by arpeggiated lyricism. Robson, hitherto silent, finds both voice and words as Paul's conversion is effected. </p> <p>From this point on Tavener proceeds with the measured solemnity of Orthodox ritual, often impressively, though it strikes me that he comes unstuck in the section that forms the theological crux of the work. This depicts, as Tavener puts it, \"the teaching moving through Christ into the mouth of Paul\". What actually happens is a lengthy canon for Gilchrist, Robson and Harle, its entries shortening with each repetition as Christ effectively dictates to Paul part of Chapter 13 of the First Letter to the Corinthians. Musically the piece dips here and doesn't regain its momentum by the time it reaches its serene close. Even so, I suspect Tavener has another hit on his hands. The standing ovation that followed was testament to both the work's impact on the audience and his cult status.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Karen Smithies watched from beyond the boundary yesterday as England's women recorded their first one-day international win since last year. The presence of the former captain, who resigned after England's 220-run defeat by Australia in February, was a reminder to the coach Paul Farbrace that she is still around. Smithies has been promised a return if she recaptures her form - possibly before the end of this five-match series - but on yesterday's evidence against South Africa she may not be required. With the World Cup approaching in November, England began to find the talents that dramatically deserted them on their tour of Australia and New Zealand. It was their batting that let them down then, so yesterday's decision by the captain Clare Connor to bat was particularly courageous. It looked like backfiring, however, when England were all out for 159. The veteran Barbara Daniels, never at her best during the winter, compiled 49 from 89 balls before the Yorkshire dynamo Melissa Reynard bolstered the total with a rapid 46 from 54 deliveries. But it was in the field that England's improvement shone through. They started the upward curve in New Zealand and here it went off the graph, as three run-outs and a brilliant stumping by Jane Cassar condemned South Africa to a frustrating afternoon.",

David Beckham 6 For once, the radar was not working on his crossing. Subdued for much of game. Paul Ince 5 Got forward well for the penalty and began the move for the second goal. But lost possession far too often and was lucky that Romania did not profit from a suicidal back pass. Paul Scholes 7 Tidy and solid as ever, completed more passes than any other England player. But, restricted to holding up the centre of midfield, never got into his usual dangerous positions. Denis Wise 5 Lacks his club confidence at this level. Continually gave away possession and was too easily knocked off the ball in the first half. Improved a little in the second before being substituted. Alan Shearer 6 Played too deeply but produced an absolute killer ball which led to the penalty. Then buried it with his usual panache. Stupidly booked for diving. Michael Owen 6 Once again struggled to hang on to the ball but took his goal superbly. Looked livelier after that but again substituted. Emile Heskey 6 Struggled to get into the game with England so on the defensive in the second half. Looked better when Barmby came on to provide balls on the deck rather than high balls from the back. Nick Barmby 7 Looked sharper and more attacking than Wise as soon as he came on. Confident and accurate in his passing, he must be close to a starting position. Gareth Southgate 6 Played only the last 10 minutes as Keegan tried to shut up shop.",

The then Dutch coach Rinus Michels changed Marco van Basten's orders for the final and he scored the second goal. </p> <p>Rijkaard acknowledged that it would be difficult to learn much from this game given the weakened state of his opponents.

That was in Euro 96, when Germany defeated the Czech Republic 2-0 in a group game but needed Oliver Bierhoff's golden goal to win at Wembley. The fourth instance of such a second meeting saw Brazil held 0-0 by Czechoslovakia in the 1962 World Cup and progress to beat them 3-1 in the final. </p> <p>Ultimately, then, it would be daft to read much into tonight's result if the teams are reunited in Rotterdam. It is peaking at the right time that counts. Bayern Munich's two resounding defeats of Real Madrid in the group stage of last season's Champions League counted for little when the sides met again in the semi-final, Real winning and going on to defeat Valencia in the final. </p> <p>And it has escaped no one's attention that a defeat for France would suit both sides. Just as the Dutch would get to stay in Hoenderloo rather than having to move to Belgium, Lemerre's squad would be able to remain at their base in Genval, deep in Francophone Belgium, and play their next game in Bruges, where they have already won twice.

In Switzerland a 75-year-old man, angered by fans driving around hooting their horns, took out a gun and started shooting. Luckily his aim was not as hot as his temper, and nobody was hurt. \u0095 Not everyone loved England's historic win over Germany on Saturday. \"I watched most of the match on TV,\" says Frank de Boer, \"but I fell asleep with about 20 minutes left.\" Still, it'll be remembered as a classic over here and, impressively, the video, distributed by Visual Entertainment, hits the shops this Friday. It costs \u00a312.99, but we've got 10 copies to give away to anyone who can tell us what percentage of all the players in Euro 2000 play in Britain. Is it a) 10%, b) 20%, or c) 15%.

      "body": "<p>How the once mighty have fallen and how remarkably fast. Four years after winning the European Championship at Wembley, Germany slunk out of the first round of this competition last night, without spirit, without a win and apparently without hope. </p> <p>Their comprehensive defeat by a team of Portuguese reserves encapsulated their sorry plight. Long before Sergio Conceicao had completed his hat-trick by shooting into the far corner in the 71st minute, German heads had dropped. Where their opponents showed speed, invention and youth, Germany's ageing team looked leaden and lost, relics of another era. </p> <p>Three of the Germany team that finished here had 100 or more caps, and the way Portugal teased and taunted them when they felt in the mood was a sign of the changing guard of European football. Erich Ribbeck's successor as coach has a huge rebuilding job on his hands. </p> <p>When the match started Germany's fate was out of their hands but they knew they had to win to stand any chance of avoiding their first opening-round exit from a major championship since Euro 84. </p> <p>Ribbeck made four changes from the side beaten by England. Among the absentees were Markus Babbel and Jens Jeremies, officially because of injury though there were rumours they had been dropped for disciplinary reasons. </p> <p>The 23-year-old Michael Ballack was drafted in but at the other end of the scale Lothar Matth\u00e4us took his place as sweeper for his 150th cap. </p> <p>Ribbeck must have been taken by surprise by the team Humberto Coelho sent out against his selection. The Portugal facing them bore little resemblance to the side that had beaten Romania on Saturday to secure a place in the last eight. Only two players - Jorge Costa and Fernando Couto - remained. </p> <p>Even so Germany struggled to make much of an impression early on, strangely deploying Carsten Jancker as a lone striker despite the desperate need for three points. Their passing was neat at times as they monopolised possession, and the young Hertha Berlin midfielder Sebastian Deisler caused problems down the right flank, but there was little end product. </p> <p>Sure enough the Portuguese second XI soon went close despite being mostly on the back foot. Twice they burst into life, Sa Pinto seeing a shot deflected over the bar and Pauleta flashing an effort just wide from Conceicao's cross. </p> <p>Then came news that Romania had taken the lead over England and the German fans burst into life. Their team also started to fire as first Jancker turned sharply and shot wide and then Mehmet Scholl released Marco Bode, whose shot beat Pedro Espinha but came back off the post. </p> <p>If Germany felt then that their luck was out it was confirmed in the next 15 minutes, when Conceicao gave Portugal the lead and in Belgium Alan Shearer equalised for England from the penalty spot. </p> <p>On 35 minutes Pauleta's burst down the left ended with a cross-shot which looped off a defender and bounced agonisingly out of Oliver Kahn's reach and towards the far post, where Conceicao bundled it over with his head. </p> <p>At half-time Germany's fate looked sealed. Ribbeck threw on a second forward, Paolo Rink, for Ballack but they still laboured to create chances. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us sweated to offer inspiration but his legs are not what they were. Likewise Germany's passing deteriorated as their spirits dropped. If an indication was needed of how far they have sunk and how minds had wandered, it came when Portugal's second goal arrived in the 54th minute. </p> <p>Conceicao was again the scorer, cutting inside Hamann and hitting a low drive from the edge of the area which seemed a comfortable save for Kahn. But in bending down to collect it the Bayern Munich goalkeeper let the ball through his arms and legs and into the net. </p> <p>And, as Conceicao made sure, that was not the last German embarrassment of the night.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How the once mighty have fallen and how remarkably fast. Four years after winning the European Championship at Wembley, Germany slunk out of the first round of this competition last night, without spirit, without a win and apparently without hope. Their comprehensive defeat by a team of Portuguese reserves encapsulated their sorry plight. Long before Sergio Conceicao had completed his hat-trick by shooting into the far corner in the 71st minute, German heads had dropped. Where their opponents showed speed, invention and youth, Germany's ageing team looked leaden and lost, relics of another era. Three of the Germany team that finished here had 100 or more caps, and the way Portugal teased and taunted them when they felt in the mood was a sign of the changing guard of European football. Erich Ribbeck's successor as coach has a huge rebuilding job on his hands. When the match started Germany's fate was out of their hands but they knew they had to win to stand any chance of avoiding their first opening-round exit from a major championship since Euro 84. Ribbeck made four changes from the side beaten by England. Among the absentees were Markus Babbel and Jens Jeremies, officially because of injury though there were rumours they had been dropped for disciplinary reasons. The 23-year-old Michael Ballack was drafted in but at the other end of the scale Lothar Matth\u00e4us took his place as sweeper for his 150th cap. Ribbeck must have been taken by surprise by the team Humberto Coelho sent out against his selection. The Portugal facing them bore little resemblance to the side that had beaten Romania on Saturday to secure a place in the last eight. Only two players - Jorge Costa and Fernando Couto - remained. Even so Germany struggled to make much of an impression early on, strangely deploying Carsten Jancker as a lone striker despite the desperate need for three points. Their passing was neat at times as they monopolised possession, and the young Hertha Berlin midfielder Sebastian Deisler caused problems down the right flank, but there was little end product. Sure enough the Portuguese second XI soon went close despite being mostly on the back foot. Twice they burst into life, Sa Pinto seeing a shot deflected over the bar and Pauleta flashing an effort just wide from Conceicao's cross. Then came news that Romania had taken the lead over England and the German fans burst into life. Their team also started to fire as first Jancker turned sharply and shot wide and then Mehmet Scholl released Marco Bode, whose shot beat Pedro Espinha but came back off the post. If Germany felt then that their luck was out it was confirmed in the next 15 minutes, when Conceicao gave Portugal the lead and in Belgium Alan Shearer equalised for England from the penalty spot. On 35 minutes Pauleta's burst down the left ended with a cross-shot which looped off a defender and bounced agonisingly out of Oliver Kahn's reach and towards the far post, where Conceicao bundled it over with his head. At half-time Germany's fate looked sealed. Ribbeck threw on a second forward, Paolo Rink, for Ballack but they still laboured to create chances. Matth\u00e4us sweated to offer inspiration but his legs are not what they were. Likewise Germany's passing deteriorated as their spirits dropped. If an indication was needed of how far they have sunk and how minds had wandered, it came when Portugal's second goal arrived in the 54th minute. Conceicao was again the scorer, cutting inside Hamann and hitting a low drive from the edge of the area which seemed a comfortable save for Kahn. But in bending down to collect it the Bayern Munich goalkeeper let the ball through his arms and legs and into the net. And, as Conceicao made sure, that was not the last German embarrassment of the night.",

But sometimes believers' faith in the doctrine wavers. Harriet Harman and Patricia Hewitt's Fabian pamphlet this week lays out the growing gender gap between women and men's voting intentions. Yet again women are swinging against Labour. What's new? If women never had the vote, we'd never have had Conservative governments. Thank women's votes for Thatcher, Europhobia, the poll tax and the tripling of poverty. Think Molly in Animal Farm - airhead, fickle, silly moos.</p> <p>A month before the last election the Fawcett Society and Mori reported that a quarter of women voters were still undecided. They put the best possible gloss on it: \"These are the thoughtful voters,\" they said. Ho hum. Another Mori poll showed 63% of women proclaim themselves \"not interested\" in politics, compared with only 31% of men. Women are less well informed with 10% more men reading quality newspapers. The gender gap in voting habits has been pretty constant since the war, but in 1997 Labour cut it to just 2%. Now the Harman paper shows 13% more women than men expressing dissatisfaction with Labour. Women switch-voters threaten to switch back.</p> <p>Ever since Margaret Thatcher there's been a feminist problem with women and politics. (Well, we used to explain unconvincingly, it's all because she was one woman alone, pushing her way into an all-male world, forced to cast herself in iron, tougher than the boys and so on.) Feminists are used to the standing-on-your-head posture to explain why women are always justified. But there are good demographic reasons to explain women's tendency to vote Tory. All over 55s are far more conservative than the young: there are many more old women, so women as a bloc are more conservative. The hope is for the future: women under 35 are the opposite. They are 10% more Labour than young men. But psephologists don't know whether women turn Tory as they get old or whether the current old women are a dying Tory generation. British Social Attitudes shows how higher education creates far more liberal attitudes and older women are the least educated. There's an old tradition of working-class women adopting conservative views along with higher social aspirations preferring to vote with the antimacassar not the cloth cap. But that's all dying out.</p> <p>Politicians are not allowed to think voters are ever wrong, so this week Labour women have sought to explain women's bad voting habits. It's all the government's fault. Labour hasn't delivered. In the focus groups women who switched from Tory in 1997 complain that Labour hasn't come across on health, education, books in schools, A and E in hospitals, nursery places, class sizes and lots more. (The report does not say whether these logical, rational creatures think the Conservatives are likely to deliver more of those things.) Ignorant or not, they are unaware of what the government has done for women. The billions spent so far have not bought their votes, not the minimum wage (mainly for women), the working families tax credit, (mainly to women), biggest ever rise in child benefit (all to women), childcare tax credits, part-time workers rights or increased maternity. The news hasn't permeated the thick heads of the fair sex. What went wrong?</p> <p>First of all, the poorest women who benefited most are the least likely to vote. Doing them good was for its own sake, not to buy votes. Some other policies haven't worked yet. Childcare credits have been taken up by few, not enough childcare is available, the money isn't enough to pay for it. What women want are high quality nurseries, but there's no plan for the gleaming universal nursery provision taken for granted across Europe. On the de Tocqueville principle of revolution, giving women a little more but not enough may only have inflamed them. Nice to have a bit more maternity pay and a few more rights, but it only reminds them how almost unbearably difficult it still is to have a baby and go back to work, juggle work and home and stay afloat.</p> <p>Most mothers have to go back to work at 18 weeks and they feel it is too soon. There is no right to demand to work part-time or a four-day week, such as all men and women have in Holland and Belgium. And \u00a370 a week doesn't buy enough childcare when it costs about \u00a3150. Too little, too timid, the policies for women haven't worked. As with the reluctant introduction of part-time workers rights, the government is so frightened of alarming business that they forgot to tell women altogether. They whispered and they mumbled.</p> <p>What this pamphlet describes is an aura that died. Women in these focus groups thought they were getting a new, feminised politics. Blair looked nicely non-macho. Even if some gag at the sight, these women voters liked that picture of Blair surrounded by his 101 women MPs. But where did all those women MPs go? None in the key spending cabinet posts, none visible, even Mo shut out. The all-male image is rebarbative and image matters. But it's politics as usual, men's stuff, by men, for men. Old versus New Labour may fight it out - Kilfoyle v Mandelson - but both miss the spot for women. Gordon and his boys have done quite a bit for women - but it doesn't feel like women's policy because they don't own it. It has simply passed women voters by.</p> <p>Tony Blair isn't even going to the Labour women's conference on Saturday. Maybe the WI have traumatised him, but he's going to have to learn how to talk to women - and not in the dreadful unctuous tones he used on the WI. The hand-claps drowned out reporting of his actual words. If you missed his misguided, tin-eared attempt to please those women, it was patronisingly awful - all about his mother's sense of duty in doing meals on wheels, \"the moral guidance of churches\", \"the case for marriage\", \"the forces that hold communities together, the family, the church, respect for elders\". Those Tory harpies didn't believe him and younger Labour-leaning women would hate all that too.</p> <p>Today is the Commons modernisation committee's last chance to do what they should have done three years ago - abolish late-night sittings and programme bills for sensible debating times. It's a belated symbol of the power of women in parliament, growing restive at the anonymous misery of backbench life. Labour has so badly lost the plot on women that it risks having fewer women MPs next time - 11 men selected for vacant seats and only one woman. Harriet Harman, with the support of likely cabinet star Patricia Hewitt, has laid out the solution. Try putting women first in policies and pronouncements, women ministers delivering policies for women and they might find the best path back to where most voters are.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Now the Harman paper shows 13% more women than men expressing dissatisfaction with Labour. Women switch-voters threaten to switch back. Ever since Margaret Thatcher there's been a feminist problem with women and politics. (Well, we used to explain unconvincingly, it's all because she was one woman alone, pushing her way into an all-male world, forced to cast herself in iron, tougher than the boys and so on.) Feminists are used to the standing-on-your-head posture to explain why women are always justified. But there are good demographic reasons to explain women's tendency to vote Tory. All over 55s are far more conservative than the young: there are many more old women, so women as a bloc are more conservative. The hope is for the future: women under 35 are the opposite. They are 10% more Labour than young men. But psephologists don't know whether women turn Tory as they get old or whether the current old women are a dying Tory generation. British Social Attitudes shows how higher education creates far more liberal attitudes and older women are the least educated. There's an old tradition of working-class women adopting conservative views along with higher social aspirations preferring to vote with the antimacassar not the cloth cap. But that's all dying out. Politicians are not allowed to think voters are ever wrong, so this week Labour women have sought to explain women's bad voting habits. It's all the government's fault. Labour hasn't delivered. In the focus groups women who switched from Tory in 1997 complain that Labour hasn't come across on health, education, books in schools, A and E in hospitals, nursery places, class sizes and lots more. (The report does not say whether these logical, rational creatures think the Conservatives are likely to deliver more of those things.) Ignorant or not, they are unaware of what the government has done for women. The billions spent so far have not bought their votes, not the minimum wage (mainly for women), the working families tax credit, (mainly to women), biggest ever rise in child benefit (all to women), childcare tax credits, part-time workers rights or increased maternity. The news hasn't permeated the thick heads of the fair sex. What went wrong? First of all, the poorest women who benefited most are the least likely to vote. Doing them good was for its own sake, not to buy votes. Some other policies haven't worked yet. Childcare credits have been taken up by few, not enough childcare is available, the money isn't enough to pay for it. What women want are high quality nurseries, but there's no plan for the gleaming universal nursery provision taken for granted across Europe. On the de Tocqueville principle of revolution, giving women a little more but not enough may only have inflamed them. Nice to have a bit more maternity pay and a few more rights, but it only reminds them how almost unbearably difficult it still is to have a baby and go back to work, juggle work and home and stay afloat. Most mothers have to go back to work at 18 weeks and they feel it is too soon. There is no right to demand to work part-time or a four-day week, such as all men and women have in Holland and Belgium. And \u00a370 a week doesn't buy enough childcare when it costs about \u00a3150. Too little, too timid, the policies for women haven't worked. As with the reluctant introduction of part-time workers rights, the government is so frightened of alarming business that they forgot to tell women altogether. They whispered and they mumbled. What this pamphlet describes is an aura that died. Women in these focus groups thought they were getting a new, feminised politics. Blair looked nicely non-macho. Even if some gag at the sight, these women voters liked that picture of Blair surrounded by his 101 women MPs. But where did all those women MPs go? None in the key spending cabinet posts, none visible, even Mo shut out. The all-male image is rebarbative and image matters. But it's politics as usual, men's stuff, by men, for men. Old versus New Labour may fight it out - Kilfoyle v Mandelson - but both miss the spot for women. Gordon and his boys have done quite a bit for women - but it doesn't feel like women's policy because they don't own it. It has simply passed women voters by. Tony Blair isn't even going to the Labour women's conference on Saturday. Maybe the WI have traumatised him, but he's going to have to learn how to talk to women - and not in the dreadful unctuous tones he used on the WI. The hand-claps drowned out reporting of his actual words. If you missed his misguided, tin-eared attempt to please those women, it was patronisingly awful - all about his mother's sense of duty in doing meals on wheels, \"the moral guidance of churches\", \"the case for marriage\", \"the forces that hold communities together, the family, the church, respect for elders\". Those Tory harpies didn't believe him and younger Labour-leaning women would hate all that too. Today is the Commons modernisation committee's last chance to do what they should have done three years ago - abolish late-night sittings and programme bills for sensible debating times. It's a belated symbol of the power of women in parliament, growing restive at the anonymous misery of backbench life. Labour has so badly lost the plot on women that it risks having fewer women MPs next time - 11 men selected for vacant seats and only one woman. Harriet Harman, with the support of likely cabinet star Patricia Hewitt, has laid out the solution. Try putting women first in policies and pronouncements, women ministers delivering policies for women and they might find the best path back to where most voters are. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

But it's still flawed: in India, a five-day Ranji Trophy semi-final can come down to a tedious battle for first-innings lead. Third innings are as common as Yorkshire running away with it at the end of the season. The only alternative is to ban bonus points altogether, but still give 12 points for a win and four for a draw. This would encourage teams to play for a win rather than waste time batting on in rain-interrupted games for another point or two, and would widen the gap (proportionally) between the best teams and the worst. At my old school, there was an archaic rule that allowed the head boy to keep a goat on one of the playing fields. Why it existed, no-one knew. The raison d'etre of the bonus-points system isn't quite as mystifying, but like the goat that probably never was, it should be put out to graze. Then we might get a more accurate reflection of every side's ability over two innings - not a mish-mash of sides surviving on the scraps of an outdated system. Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com How the bonus-points system works Points are scored during the first 130 overs of each side's first innings. Five points are available for batting (1 for 200, 2 for 250, up to 5 for 400), and three for bowling (1 for 3 wkts, 2 for 6, 3 for 9). Last season points were scored over the first 120 overs and the split was four and four (1 batting point for 200 runs, up to 4 for 350; 1 bowling point for 3-4 wkts, 2 for 5-6, 3 for 7-8, 4 for 9-10).",

And Bryan Robson would have probably been rolled in to replace him. So is it any wonder that the hardened tabloid hacks decided to give Koog's 'honesty is the best policy' policy a strangely easy ride earlier today? \"I have not set the world on fire so far with my management skills but I still get the opportunity to do that in a World Cup,\" was Koogan's opening gambit. \"I have learned things, it would be sad if I hadn't.\" Quite right, thought the Fiver. Sadly, the only thing he seems to have learned is how to pass the buck. \"The last thing I am going to do is say anything detrimental about the players in the hotel,\" he said. \"I picked the best 22 players available to me. But we were not good enough.\" Kelv then accused the Premiership of not \"fitting in with the style of international football\", before insisting that it would be a waste of time to fill the team with fresh talent... and of course he prepared for the tournament properly! Is it any wonder, then, that the Fiver's mailbox is bursting with readers pleading with us to be the vanguard of a 'Bring back Hod' campaign or a 'Bring back Venables' campaign? Luckily, there's been no call as of yet to launch 'Bring back Taylor', but with Koog in this form it's probably just a matter of time.

The day was fine and the family was gathered for about the first outdoor day after a rainy spring and dreary winter. John was only just walking; in fact, this was his first outdoor ambulant season after a winter spent cruising around furniture. The Sunday roast was in the oven; we were all relaxing. </p> <p>It happened very fast. John's father was playing tennis on the court across from the garden. Everyone else was having coffee indoors. John was suddenly gone. No one could find him. But he wasn't missing long. His mother found him face down in the pond. He had died instantly, they said afterwards, on impact with the icy water. A dry drowning it's called. </p> <p>That moment began a long agony for our family that we will never fully recover from. My sister was in a desperate world of grief. The priest came to be with us. Things seemed unreal. Hardly a religious family, we now prayed in despair, holding on to each other for help, clasping hands together for support - inchoate and appalled. But there is no help when a small child dies. There is only the endless regret, the quiet intense introspective reproaches, the silent searching for someone to blame. </p> <p>Suffering like this should never happen to any family. It's un natural and, in a very true sense, unnecessary. Every second thought is punctured by the real rage of thinking \"what if\" - what if I had come in that door five minutes earlier, what if the tennis had been a more conclusive score and they had knocked off in time to see the child as he headed for his death, what if the pond had been filled in earlier (it was next on the list after the dead tree had been dragged off). </p> <p>And when it wasn't \"what if\", it was \"if only\". If only I had said I thought the pond was rather deep, if only I had taken the children for a walk, asked them to my house, suggested a holiday. If only X had come in a moment sooner or Y left a second later. There is no end to the recriminations passed in whispers around the family. </p> <p>Before the funeral, I watched my sister coming down the long staircase in her black dress. Suddenly the large outside door swung open and there was my husband Andy, who had just arrived. She hurled herself into his arms with a terrible cry, the first we had heard from her in two days. In my life I have never seen anyone suffer more, or heard anything more chilling as when the child's father one night wandered into the garden and simply howled. </p> <p>No one should go through this. Families must check and check again on swimming pools and ponds because to rely on one's own vigilance is to court disaster. No one can be 100% alert and the enviroment around small children has to be literally fenced, safe and riskfree. </p> <p>Toddlers are utterly reckless, ludicrously careless of their own lives. And the best parents in the world cannot be vigilant all the time. So accept that you might fail your children. Realise you are human and liable to relax your guard. Then check the enviroment and leave nothing to human chance. Be ruthless. If you can't properly fence off that pond, fill it in. Abolish that stylish water feature. Fork out and fence the swimming pool you are so convinced they would never go near.

      "body": "<p>If you're one of those parents who insists on getting down on the floor to join in your offspring's games, take heed: according to the American Psychological Society, which met last week in Miami, gatecrashing on children's play stifles the very creativity you are probably trying to foster. Parental involvement turns play into something structured, the researchers found, and the child's primary concern then becomes pleasing the parent, rather than following their instincts. To foster creativity and imagination, leave the kids alone, the society was told, and give them opportunities to explore their inner feelings without fear. </p> <p>This message didn't surprise Christian Kerr, a London teacher who has long believed that too much structure and interference puts a lid on children's natural creativity. Her answer: meditation for children. </p> <p>Kerr's classes always start with a physical activity - a ball game, perhaps - after which the children sit or lie down for a 10-minute meditation. \"I help them with ideas about what to focus on and how to do it, and it's amazing how still and quiet they can become. The other day a class came in full of beans and I thought they'd never settle. But they did a breathing exercise, and then I got them to visualise being in a rocket going into space. They were incredibly silent, and the stories they came back with were really colourful and original: one had seen aliens eating marshmallow sandwiches, another had seen a king and queen in a golden palace. These days there's so much emphasis on the spoken and the written word that it's easy to forget that we can use our creativity in other ways, too.\" </p> <p>Given that most primary school children rarely seem to sit still these days, teaching them to meditate sounds a tall order. Or, looking at it another way, a jolly good idea. After all, we all need a bit of silence in our lives - and if children don't learn the value of peace and quiet when they're young, when will they learn it? What's more, meditation is a stressbuster - and with more than half of Britain's under-11s now suffering from school-related stress, and one in five suffering a stress-related health disorder, it clearly has its work cut out. \"Constant activity is very much the norm for our kids,\" says Kerr. \"They're always at this class or that class, and there's so much pressure on them. But almost everything they do is about the external world, and there's very little attention to finding out about yourself, on looking inward for a change. </p> <p>\"Meditation teaches children that it can be useful to be quiet and still sometimes. It can help them to learn to settle down at night and sleep better. It also makes them more self-aware, which helps confidence - and it helps boost their imagination, too.\" </p> <p>Learning to use breathing to keep calm and relaxed helps children to deal with the unforeseen situations life throws at them, Kerr believes. According to mother-of-three Helen Kemmitt, whose son Alex, seven, and daughter Hannah, five, have both attended Kerr's classes, even when children are initially reluctant, they can be drawn in and can benefit. </p> <p>\"The other day my son was really upset by some dispute over Pok\u00e9mon cards, and I said we'd try some meditation. He wasn't keen so I just went ahead with my daughter. We did one of those exercises where you tense up every part of your body and then relax it bit by bit. After a few minutes, Alex joined in and got really into it. His worries just floated away - it was something specific he could turn his attention to, it really took his mind off it.\" </p> <p>So should we all be signing our children up for meditation classes? According to psychologist Professor David Fontana, co-author of Meditation for Children (Element), meditation appeals to some children and not others in the same way it appeals to some adults and not others - but he does think that many more young people could benefit from learning to listen to their inner voice. </p> <p>\"I think the time to introduce it is around the age they start school. There's no doubt it can increase a child's attention span and, as a result, improve memory. It allows the child to recognise the value of silence, and it teaches them to allow their body to relax and their mind to relax.\" </p> <p>But just as important as helping children with the here and now, believes Fontana, is preparing them for the future. Many of the tensions that beset adults, he says, first make their appearance in childhood, so teaching youngsters to deal with stress today could mean creating calmer, more relaxed adults tomorrow. </p> <p>Given his enthusiasm for the benefits of meditation, it's not surprising that Fontana would like to see trainee teachers tutored in its use, and schoolchildren taught its benefits; currently just a handful of schools have classroom meditation sessions. </p> <p>But, he advises, meditation isn't something that has to be left to experts: anyone with any experience of it through yoga, or time to read about its benefits, could start to meditate and learn alongside their child or children. Here are his tips: </p> <p>\u0095 Never force a child to meditate, or use it to punish a child for disruptive behaviour (or anything else). </p> <p>&amp;#149 Choose your moment: bedtime is often best for a child who finds it hard to settle at night. On the other hand, 75% of adults who meditate prefer to do so in the morning; some children are too irritable for it at night. </p> <p>&amp;#149 Begin by concentrating on simple breathing techniques, gradually progressing to visualisation. </p> <p>\u0095 Christian Kerr's classes, Calm For Kids, are held at Chiswick Library in London.

      "bodyText": "If you're one of those parents who insists on getting down on the floor to join in your offspring's games, take heed: according to the American Psychological Society, which met last week in Miami, gatecrashing on children's play stifles the very creativity you are probably trying to foster. Parental involvement turns play into something structured, the researchers found, and the child's primary concern then becomes pleasing the parent, rather than following their instincts. To foster creativity and imagination, leave the kids alone, the society was told, and give them opportunities to explore their inner feelings without fear. This message didn't surprise Christian Kerr, a London teacher who has long believed that too much structure and interference puts a lid on children's natural creativity. Her answer: meditation for children. Kerr's classes always start with a physical activity - a ball game, perhaps - after which the children sit or lie down for a 10-minute meditation. \"I help them with ideas about what to focus on and how to do it, and it's amazing how still and quiet they can become. The other day a class came in full of beans and I thought they'd never settle. But they did a breathing exercise, and then I got them to visualise being in a rocket going into space. They were incredibly silent, and the stories they came back with were really colourful and original: one had seen aliens eating marshmallow sandwiches, another had seen a king and queen in a golden palace. These days there's so much emphasis on the spoken and the written word that it's easy to forget that we can use our creativity in other ways, too.\" Given that most primary school children rarely seem to sit still these days, teaching them to meditate sounds a tall order. Or, looking at it another way, a jolly good idea. After all, we all need a bit of silence in our lives - and if children don't learn the value of peace and quiet when they're young, when will they learn it? What's more, meditation is a stressbuster - and with more than half of Britain's under-11s now suffering from school-related stress, and one in five suffering a stress-related health disorder, it clearly has its work cut out. \"Constant activity is very much the norm for our kids,\" says Kerr. \"They're always at this class or that class, and there's so much pressure on them. But almost everything they do is about the external world, and there's very little attention to finding out about yourself, on looking inward for a change. \"Meditation teaches children that it can be useful to be quiet and still sometimes. It can help them to learn to settle down at night and sleep better. It also makes them more self-aware, which helps confidence - and it helps boost their imagination, too.\" Learning to use breathing to keep calm and relaxed helps children to deal with the unforeseen situations life throws at them, Kerr believes. According to mother-of-three Helen Kemmitt, whose son Alex, seven, and daughter Hannah, five, have both attended Kerr's classes, even when children are initially reluctant, they can be drawn in and can benefit. \"The other day my son was really upset by some dispute over Pok\u00e9mon cards, and I said we'd try some meditation. He wasn't keen so I just went ahead with my daughter. We did one of those exercises where you tense up every part of your body and then relax it bit by bit. After a few minutes, Alex joined in and got really into it. His worries just floated away - it was something specific he could turn his attention to, it really took his mind off it.\" So should we all be signing our children up for meditation classes? According to psychologist Professor David Fontana, co-author of Meditation for Children (Element), meditation appeals to some children and not others in the same way it appeals to some adults and not others - but he does think that many more young people could benefit from learning to listen to their inner voice. \"I think the time to introduce it is around the age they start school. There's no doubt it can increase a child's attention span and, as a result, improve memory. It allows the child to recognise the value of silence, and it teaches them to allow their body to relax and their mind to relax.\" But just as important as helping children with the here and now, believes Fontana, is preparing them for the future. Many of the tensions that beset adults, he says, first make their appearance in childhood, so teaching youngsters to deal with stress today could mean creating calmer, more relaxed adults tomorrow. Given his enthusiasm for the benefits of meditation, it's not surprising that Fontana would like to see trainee teachers tutored in its use, and schoolchildren taught its benefits; currently just a handful of schools have classroom meditation sessions. But, he advises, meditation isn't something that has to be left to experts: anyone with any experience of it through yoga, or time to read about its benefits, could start to meditate and learn alongside their child or children. Here are his tips: \u0095 Never force a child to meditate, or use it to punish a child for disruptive behaviour (or anything else). \u2022 Choose your moment: bedtime is often best for a child who finds it hard to settle at night. On the other hand, 75% of adults who meditate prefer to do so in the morning; some children are too irritable for it at night. \u2022 Begin by concentrating on simple breathing techniques, gradually progressing to visualisation. \u0095 Christian Kerr's classes, Calm For Kids, are held at Chiswick Library in London.

Schools have spent so much time making sure girls feel comfortable, she says, that they have lost sight of what it is that boys need. While teachers fuss about sexual harassment, and otherwise try to impose \"new versions of manhood\" on their charges, boys are left lagging seriously behind their sisters. What is needed now, she insists, is a return to \"discipline, respect and moral guidance\". </p> <p>Take a close look, however, and her analysis quickly runs into the sand: the fact is, male under-achievement at school predates modern feminism by centuries. Way back in 1693 John Locke was bewailing the fact that boys had such trouble learning Latin while girls took so easily to French (he saw it as a failure of method, not a failure of intellect). A schools inquiry in 1868 commented, \"Girls come to you to learn; boys have to be driven.\" And as recently as the 60s the boys' 11 plus results were \"skewed\" to make sure that grammar schools weren't filled with diligent girls. </p> <p>Feminism did have an impact, though - on the ambitions of girls. During the 80s girls' maths and science results really took off; and by the beginning of the 1990s, they were level pegging with boys. This might not have mattered had it not taken place within a rapidly changing industrial and social scene. Boys who prefer action to books can no longer be absorbed into the shrinking manufacturing sector and the army. The world of work wants soft skills not hard muscles. </p> <p>It is against this background that Hoff Sommers wants to return to a golden age in which boys are boys and girls know their place. In an earlier article in Atlantic Monthly Hoff Sommers said: \"To impugn his desire to become 'one of the boys' is to deny that a boy's biology determines much of what he prefers and is attracted to.\" </p> <p>This view of masculinity as something pre-programmed, immutable, and yet at the same time capable of being fatally damaged by too much contact with femininity, lay at the heart of much of the initial reaction to \"the gender gap\" in this country in the mid 90s. Male education experts called for recruitment campaigns to get more men into teaching and for changes in the literature curriculum (not so many chick books like Wuthering Heights). They then jumped all over a single experiment in which Eastwood school at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, divided its boys and girls for a number of key subjects. The results showed the same sort of improvements that might have been achieved by any reasonably focused managerial change (the fact that the improvement was much greater for girls was somehow glossed over) and gender separation was hailed as a way forward for boys. David Blunkett promised to \"consider encouraging similar schemes\". </p> <p>Perhaps he then took a look at the rather larger-scale experiments in the inner cities in which some boys and girls have always been educated separately - single-sex schools. The evidence here is a lot less encouraging. Parents and children alike have voted with their feet. A macho all-male environment is not popular and doesn't improve results for boys. Indeed most of the worst results in the country are to be found in the boys' schools. In Hackney all but one of them have now closed; in Islington, one of the most famous - Highbury Grove - is now a co-ed and, in Tower Hamlets, where a large Asian population ensures a higher level of parental support for single sex schooling, all three boys schools are considered by Ofsted to be failing. One is already in \"special measures\" and the other two have \"serious weakness\". </p> <p>In boys' schools, leaders emerge. They quickly establish an alternative authority, in opposition to the school, and they exact obedience to this anti- school ethos from the lower ranks. And it is the boys in the lower ranks who suffer. It is they who are bullied, teased, and forced to conform to the dominant masculine ideology of the group. </p> <p>Parents whose sons have been recruited into the ranks of the anti-school army are rightly alarmed by this effect. The boys know what is happening but most feel powerless against the effect of peer group pressure. I asked a group of 14-year-olds at a school in Hackney what would happen if half the boys in the school thought that scoring goals in football would make them appear less hard, less manly. They all responded in the same way: the boys would avoid scoring. Not one boy suggested that winning would be more important than being laughed at. As one said: \"They would do very badly. Most people are always out to look good. Most of their decisions depend on it.\" </p> <p>So what is a parent to do? Those who are watching their daughters read Proust while signing up for classes in rocket science are hardly likely to buy the Hoff Sommers approach. Holding girls back is not going to push boys forward. Yet it is dispiriting to find that, at the age of 12, your son's language skills have gone into reverse and he seems to be interested only in mixing music or playing football. Hoff Sommers is right to recognise that this is now a problem both for boys themselves and for society at large, but it is the goal posts that have moved, not the players. In firing a broadside against feminist educationalists she is attacking the very people who are closest to finding a way through. </p> <p>Madeleine Arnott, from the University of Cambridge school of education, has spent the last four years running a research project aimed at improving boys' attitudes to education. For Arnott, the issues lie in the different ways in which boys and girls regard school and themselves: \"Girls want different things from education; they are seeking autonomy, autonomy is the pay off for literacy. What is the pay off for boys? How can we help boys to recognise that the world has changed, to adapt to it, and find a path through?\" </p> <p>It is this kind of thinking that is so desperately needed in schools. Martin Cribb is head of learning and school development in Tower Hamlets, London, and knows that providing a more \"masculine\" environment for boys is not the answer. Indeed it is a traditional, macho, masculine style that lies at the heart of the problem: \"It is hard to recruit staff into a tough, inner city school. You don't want macho staff, you want people who are good teachers.\" </p> <p>According to Arnott's research this is the right emphasis: \"There is evidence that the major problem for boys is that they are holding on to very traditional masculine identities. Some are changing but very few compared to the girls. The world has changed. The question we have to ask is, are schools addressing this, are they helping the boys to change or are the traditional masculine values of the schools actually holding change back? Research indicates that it is not the sex of the teacher that matters but the approach. Male teachers with traditional views on masculinity may actually be confirming and colluding with laddish culture rather than challenging it.\" </p> <p>Arnott is right, Hoff Sommers is wrong. As Adrienne Katz discovered in her research into teenage boys (Leading Lads, 1999) it is the boys who are less traditional in their masculinity, who are happier, more confident and more engaged with school. Perhaps it is time then, to start working with boys in schools on more useful ways of \"looking good\". Projects aimed at getting boys to talk about masculinity and what it means to them have now started in a handful of schools. It is too soon to tell whether they will close the gender gap but one thing we do know is that the boys like it. They don't want to be disciplined, they want to be listened to.</p>",

At Christmas they drew \u00a310 each out of their bank accounts and went Christmas shopping - they bought me a garlic sausage. Verdict: \u00a31.50",

I can see the headlines now: \"Barren columnist snorts drugs in BHS bog.\" Unfortunately, my secret drug habit doesn't give me any kind of buzz. Nor does it improve my social life. It just makes me feel sad. I shouldn't have to hide. </p> <p>Of course, I indulge my infertility drug habit openly at home. But I've told my seven-year-old daughter I'm sniffing Suprefact (a sex hormone-reducing drug) for hayfever, which I've never suffered from. The subterfuge involved in concealing IVF treatment is considerable. Mysteriously, the most discreet method of medication - pill-popping - is the only one not included on my IVF action plan. I have to sniff, and will soon inject and insert things in places they aren't normally inserted. Of all the leaflets available in the Assisted Conception Unit it's a shame there isn't a list of excuses to give when I go in for my egg retrieval or embryo replacement, if I get that far. </p> <p>Why do we hide our infertility? It's presumed to be because being barren is too big a stigma to bear openly. But the reason is not how I feel, but how the fertile world feels about me. The assumption is other people's happiness makes me unhappy. </p> <p>Pregnant friends - uncharacteristically for people who are pregnant - don't prattle on to me about their morning sickness or sleepless nights. Women with small children don't tell me when they first walk, or talk. They don't want to upset me. I know this avoidance of toddler talk is meant kindly, but what these potent women don't understand is that it's the not talking to me that's so upsetting. I'm doubly excluded. First, for not having the joy of the first-hand experience myself. Then, because they're preventing me from enjoying their joy. </p> <p>Perhaps I feel like this because I already have a daughter. I know childless women who cross the road rather than walk past Mothercare. But I can say, quite honestly, that I do not feel resentment, jealousy or whatever else it's imagined I might feel when I see swollen bellies or a child on a swing. But I can also say, quite honestly, that I know exactly what the fecund world feels for me. Pity. And it is being pitied that I do, very fiercely, resent. </p> <p>That is one reason why I write this under a pseudonym. I have to protect my small but perfectly formed family from the crumbs of misplaced sympathy that would fall their way. They don't feel like sufferers. My infertility doesn't define or destroy them any more than it does me. Yet in the office corridor, as I pass those who \"know\", I notice the shake of a head and a whisper: \"Such a nice girl, too . . .\" </p> <p> But my feelings towards other people's fecundity aren't the only feelings others read wrongly. My many miscarriages are also misread. Each loss is treated as bereavement. But I've never felt like I have lost a baby, even though I've had many a loss. It's rather the loss of plans I was barely aware I'd made. Even in early pregnancy, you stop buying snug-fitting clothes in case they won't fit in a few weeks. You rub out that pencilled-in holiday requiring jabs a pregnant woman shouldn't have. It was the loss of my future life, not another's, that I missed. </p> <p> The hospital tried to recognise and respect my \"blighted ovums\". After each miscarriage, my boyfriend and I would be shown into a very small, softly decorated room, with just two comfortable chairs, a book and a mighty box of Kleenex. In the book, which looked like a wedding photo album, other couples had recorded their own miscarriages and stillbirths, raw outpourings written at the greatest moment of grief. My boyfriend dubbed it The Dead Baby Room. After a couple of visits, we asked not to be shown inside any more. It wasn't because it was too painful; it was too maudlin. We didn't want our feelings to be elevated beyond what they were, a brief spell of straightforward sadness. </p> <p>I may keep my barrenness to myself. But I do not mope about it. So please save your pity for yourself. I've got a life to get on with.</p>",

Anyway, you don't tell Liberal Democrats how to use their votes so I'll let the other candidates worry about second preferences. </p> <p><b>A000457:</b> What's your catchphrase going to be? </p> <p><b>SK:</b> Kramer can do it! (Do the job and win the race) </p> <p><b>A000457:</b> It's not exactly catchy, is it? Surely a shorter one would be \"Kramer can do the job and come third in the race\"? </p> <p><b>markwhitehouse:</b> Susan, how long do you think it will be before the mayor and the assemly will actually gain some substantive powers rather than the token 'face-of-London' which the next incumbent will assume? Also, would you go along with the previous LibDem policy and lobby to have the mayor sitting in the assembly and chosen by its members rather than Londoners generally?</p> <p><b>SK:</b> markwhitehouse, it's crucial that the mayor doesn't go off on an ego trip. Even though the powers of the assembly are weak, I would work with the assembly to get real scrutiny on problems in London, like inequality in the health service, and ask assembly members, for example, to join advisory boards to achieve our goals on the environment, like doubling recycling. This new government level will only make sense if it forgets prize fighting politics and works with Londoners, businesses, the voluntary sector, etc. to get problems solved. </p> <p>Interestingly, Liberal Democrats will hold the balance of power in the assembly, which is the best guarantee that it will be effective. </p> <p> <b>bazac:</b> How much cooperation do you expect to receive from the government if elected? </p> <p><b>SK:</b> Londoners want a voice and I have always said I will put responsibility to Londoners ahead of any party interests. I expect the government to take the same view which means we should find it relatively easy to work together in the interests of 7m Londoners. I prefer using quiet persuasion and rational argument. It is not my intention to make the government lose face, to score points. But my whole working experience has taught me to be very tough when necessary. </p> <p>Just a note of encouragement, if you look in other countries mayors of one party tend to be very successful in working with governments of another party.

People are addicted to their cars and are not being tempted away by public transport on its own.

It will apply only to central London on working days during working hours. I will not introduce it for at least two and a half years so that Londoners can see improvements already beginning in public transport. Every penny will go to public transport. I want to use a travelcard approach so that when you pay to use the road you can then use bus, tube and train for free. </p> <p>Please email me with other transport questions including expanding the system.

I will use the money for regeneration which comes to the mayor to reinforce and re-establish genuinely mixed communities. New developments will need to include social and affordable housing right alongside homes for private ownership. At this moment I am joining residents in Tooley Street who have been threatened with the demolition of their community by Southwark council so that the land can be sold for private development. Ironically, the rise in the value of Tooley Street is largely due to its proximity to the new, grand building for the mayor. </p> <p>We can increase the amount of affordable housing in London by changing planning rules.

Anyway, you don't tell Liberal Democrats how to use their votes so I'll let the other candidates worry about second preferences. A000457: What's your catchphrase going to be? SK: Kramer can do it! (Do the job and win the race) A000457: It's not exactly catchy, is it? Surely a shorter one would be \"Kramer can do the job and come third in the race\"? markwhitehouse: Susan, how long do you think it will be before the mayor and the assemly will actually gain some substantive powers rather than the token 'face-of-London' which the next incumbent will assume? Also, would you go along with the previous LibDem policy and lobby to have the mayor sitting in the assembly and chosen by its members rather than Londoners generally? SK: markwhitehouse, it's crucial that the mayor doesn't go off on an ego trip. Even though the powers of the assembly are weak, I would work with the assembly to get real scrutiny on problems in London, like inequality in the health service, and ask assembly members, for example, to join advisory boards to achieve our goals on the environment, like doubling recycling. This new government level will only make sense if it forgets prize fighting politics and works with Londoners, businesses, the voluntary sector, etc. to get problems solved. Interestingly, Liberal Democrats will hold the balance of power in the assembly, which is the best guarantee that it will be effective. bazac: How much cooperation do you expect to receive from the government if elected? SK: Londoners want a voice and I have always said I will put responsibility to Londoners ahead of any party interests. I expect the government to take the same view which means we should find it relatively easy to work together in the interests of 7m Londoners. I prefer using quiet persuasion and rational argument. It is not my intention to make the government lose face, to score points. But my whole working experience has taught me to be very tough when necessary. Just a note of encouragement, if you look in other countries mayors of one party tend to be very successful in working with governments of another party. It forces everyone to behave like a grown up. nigellewis: Transport is the burning issue of the campaign, it seems, mainly because that is the only important issue the mayor will be able to influence.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Despite numerous attempts over the past months on the part of formidable gatherings of rural dwellers intent on bringing home to city types the deprivations they suffer, no one believes them. Living in the country, it seems, is still seen by those who live in cities to be an advantage that far outweighs what small sacrifices are suffered. </p> <p>Many city dwellers entertain the fantasy that because the country is wonderful for a weekend, one day they will make their homes there. White-painted cottage, pub around the corner, golf nearby, perhaps even sailing if one combines seaside with country. So when the country folk start shouting and saying that life is not all cream teas and happy hay rides, do they have a point? And who's listening? </p> <p>Well, I am, for one. For more than 20 years I lived miles from the nearest town, in the under-populated back of beyond. When I left it, I wept. But I also rejoiced. I was finally going to get to be a townie, fashionable, social, comfortably off, have-it-all. </p> <p>When you first hit town after a life in the sticks, the single biggest thing you miss is permission to be an individual. Fitting in becomes the yardstick, the collective is more important than the one. In the country, you can believe that life in the big world is made up of small groups of people like you relating to each other. From simple courtesies with acquaintances which create the backdrop of your own personal drama, to the live, loving and hating within relationships of family and friends - you matter. You matter because there are so few people about that everyone becomes known - name, work, quirks, your family, your life. </p> <p>Even if you are a private person, in a rural community you are seen, commented on, more often than not left alone, if that's what you want - but you matter, because you are part of a very small world. My social life in the country was 100% better, and my idea of fashionable was regarded as eccentric perhaps, but not, like here, downright odd. Here in the city it is label and cost that matter with clothes, not style or uniqueness. Conformity in all things holds when you get here, despite what many believe. </p> <p>Comfortably off? Not quite, but better than the living I could earn in the country. Have it all? You jest. Urban life stinks. Why don't people say so? The size of it and the numbers of people in it, and the need for all those people to try to be the same - all led by the same must-haves, from labels to lap-tops to this year's car, makes for competitive living which is destructive and dangerous. </p> <p>Last week I went back for a visit.

      "bodyText": "Despite numerous attempts over the past months on the part of formidable gatherings of rural dwellers intent on bringing home to city types the deprivations they suffer, no one believes them. Living in the country, it seems, is still seen by those who live in cities to be an advantage that far outweighs what small sacrifices are suffered. Many city dwellers entertain the fantasy that because the country is wonderful for a weekend, one day they will make their homes there. White-painted cottage, pub around the corner, golf nearby, perhaps even sailing if one combines seaside with country. So when the country folk start shouting and saying that life is not all cream teas and happy hay rides, do they have a point? And who's listening? Well, I am, for one. For more than 20 years I lived miles from the nearest town, in the under-populated back of beyond. When I left it, I wept. But I also rejoiced. I was finally going to get to be a townie, fashionable, social, comfortably off, have-it-all. When you first hit town after a life in the sticks, the single biggest thing you miss is permission to be an individual. Fitting in becomes the yardstick, the collective is more important than the one. In the country, you can believe that life in the big world is made up of small groups of people like you relating to each other. From simple courtesies with acquaintances which create the backdrop of your own personal drama, to the live, loving and hating within relationships of family and friends - you matter. You matter because there are so few people about that everyone becomes known - name, work, quirks, your family, your life. Even if you are a private person, in a rural community you are seen, commented on, more often than not left alone, if that's what you want - but you matter, because you are part of a very small world. My social life in the country was 100% better, and my idea of fashionable was regarded as eccentric perhaps, but not, like here, downright odd. Here in the city it is label and cost that matter with clothes, not style or uniqueness. Conformity in all things holds when you get here, despite what many believe. Comfortably off? Not quite, but better than the living I could earn in the country. Have it all? You jest. Urban life stinks. Why don't people say so? The size of it and the numbers of people in it, and the need for all those people to try to be the same - all led by the same must-haves, from labels to lap-tops to this year's car, makes for competitive living which is destructive and dangerous. Last week I went back for a visit. I returned to the empty wilderness where I had lived. Just as when I left, employment remains low, money is still desperately tight. Friends and family who are still there live as they always did, pretty much from hand to mouth. They still pick up any kind of temporary work they can - sometimes quite unsuitable for them, sometimes way below their abilities, and the pay is minimal. They live in breathtakingly lovely places with views that bring tears to your eyes, but they're broke. They were broke then and they're broke now. Justifying to my country friends why I choose to live in an unquestionably less-than-beautiful urban environment, I am forced to admit that I hate it. But I also recognise that poverty is an even more despicable state than the obstacles one has to take on board in the city. They shake their heads - how can anyone value money higher than a healthy, natural environment? Living in an area where employment is high and reasonably paid has advantages. You don't feel suicidal when the electricity bill arrives. You don't have to count pennies every time you buy a coffee or put petrol in the car. But the price is high. Because, whatever the advantages, they are ultimately subsumed by the anonymity of it all, the pointlessness of life, heightened by the incapacity to move freely, to speak to a stranger, to walk in spaces that aren't thronging with other people, where there is no room to breathe without breathing on someone else.

      "body": "<p><strong> In the Land of Youth </strong></p> <p><strong>There are pleasant places, </strong></p> <p><strong>Green joyful woods and fields...</strong> </p> <p> These lyrics are from the libretto of the 1914 opera, The Immortal Hour, the best-known work of the bohemian composer, Communist party member and self-styled English Wagner, Rutland Boughton. He was the organiser of the original Glastonbury Festival, which ran from 1914 to 1926 (interrupted only by the first world war), offering Arthurian legend and a form of alternative Englishness to audiences which included George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Hardy. </p> <p>When Boughton was in town, the area was invaded by long-haired alternative types, music lovers rumoured to run naked round Glastonbury Tor at sunrise, enthusiasts for free love, spiritualism and vegetarianism. Sound familiar? Shaw warned Boughton against \"introducing Glastonbury to Moscow\", while members of the Workers' Theatre Movement described him as \"up to his neck in money and down to his ass in long hair\". </p> <p>The Avalonian spirit of festival returned half a century after Boughton, when a nearby farmer, Michael Eavis, put on a mini-rock festival in September 1970, inspired by the sixties' tribal gatherings such as Monterey, Woodstock and the Isle of Wight. Today, Glastonbury remains an eccentric English space, where the ley line meets the leylandii, where King Arthur's resting place, the Isle of Avalon, is disturbed this weekend only by, well, 100,000 pairs of feet, a similar number of mo bile phones, superloud rock music and even louder techno - the massed ranks of the me and E generations combined. </p> <p>Yet there are other ways of looking at Glastonbury. The spiritualist writer Dion Fortune was an admirer of Boughton's project there. An early champion of female spirituality, Fortune recognised that \"the veil is thin\", that Glastonbury is a spiritual hotspot where we can glimpse the genius loci of our preference, whether pagan or Christian, Arthurian or new age. She wrote in her 1934 paean to the town, Avalon in the Heart, that \"the past lives on at Glastonbury. All about us it stirs and breathes, quiet, but living and watching.\" For Andrew Blake, professor of cultural studies at King Alfred's College, Winchester, that past is political: the Glastonbury festivals of both Boughton and Eavis are \"involved in a historic imaginary which stretches back through the long history of Arthurian literature and music . . . to propose an imagined rural, mystical and at least semi-pagan Britain\". </p> <p>It's no surprise then, in this atavistic rural space, to find peace and green campaign movements favoured. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was founded in 1958 with what we can see now as a strong yearning for lost British global authority. CND's nostalgia was for a less technologically dangerous age, of course, but was also inflected with a British sense of moral superiority, the flipside of Empire. JB Priestley wrote at the time that nuclear war \"is not war as it used to be\" - presumably because the upstart US, with its showy hydrogen bomb, now ruled the waves. David Widgery described the first CND Aldermaston March of Easter 1958 as \"a student movement before its time, a marching pop festival\". </p> <p>Contrary to its earnest image, perhaps, CND has always embraced festival culture, been open to what the 1960s called \"play power\", what the 1990s called \"party and protest\". The introduction of US-controlled Cruise missiles in the 1980s sparked the campaign's second great surge of popular support. Alternative lifestyles contributed significantly to CND, from Greenham Common to the Peace Convoy, from the anarchopunk movement to the Glastonbury Festival. Glastonbury then was \"the CND festival\"; the 1987 programme cover gave Elvis Costello and CND chairman Bruce Kent equal billing. The \u00a31m raised by the festival for CND during the decade helped underwrite spectacular events such as the London CND carnivals, as well as the more mundane national structure of regional offices. </p> <p>In some ways, CND made Glastonbury. Prior to the campaign's involvement in 1981, the festival had only happened three times, once as a free event and on the other two occasions losing money. Michael Eavis acknowledges that \"1981 was our breakthrough: 24,000 people turned up, delivering a \u00a320,000 profit\". CND's international profile and relative organisational sophistication meant transatlantic headliners, efficient ticket sales, and a large pool of committed volunteers over festival weekends. By the end of the decade though, \"CND was getting smaller as the festival was getting bigger,\" recalls Tony Myers, of CND. \"Couple that with serious internal tensions within CND to do with the Gulf war and you see how things just moved apart.\" </p> <p>Glastonbury changed its main beneficiaries in 1992 to Greenpeace and, because of its campaigning against the arms trade, Oxfam. Greenpeace had started in 1969, with a ship trying to obstruct US nuclear testing at Amchitka Island, so that thread remains. Festival finances are available on the official website ('glasnostbury', as someone said a few years ago). </p> <p>For 1999, out of a total budget of around \u00a37m, \u00a32.5m was spent on entertainment and \u00a3600,000 donated to the big international campaigns and to less glamorous local groups. Wookey Hole Cricket Club got \u00a32,880, Shepton Mallet Christmas Lights Fund got \u00a32,000, for instance. Such embracing of global and local concerns is characteristic of the way the festival operates, is part of its ideology and of its eccentric charm. Interestingly, \u00a31.5m was spent on policing and other security. \"It's a police benefit gig,\" said some of the more hardline countercultural figures. </p> <p>Yet Eavis hasn't shied away from some of the more difficult groups who make a claim on the festival either. In the mid-1980s, when the Stonehenge Free Festival was banned and new travellers were seriously demonised by police, Glastonbury festival was a temporary haven for them on more than one occasion. Until 1990, new travellers were given free access, though more recently they have been directed to fields a few miles from the main festival site. </p> <p>Eavis told me: \"I've worked with the [Peace] Convoy and with travellers over the years, negotiated with them one-to-one, accommodated them when I could or when I've had to. My approach is a bit different to [Stonehenge guardians] English Heritage's, isn't it?\" While relations between the festival and new travellers are not easy, the fact that the festival makes the effort is a sign that it tries to practise what it preaches. </p> <p>Glastonbury's environmental ambitions were expressed by co-organiser Andrew Kerr at the legendary 1971 free Glastonbury Fayre: \"If the festival has a specific intention it is to create an increase in the power of the universe, a heightening of consciousness and a recognition of our place in the function of this, our tired and molested planet.\" </p> <p> The eco-awareness returned in 1984, when the old Green Party Gatherings, which had sometimes been held at Worthy Farm, relocated to the festival itself. These transformed into the Green Fields, where today you encounter tepee circles, wood turning and new age inner-self workshops. These solar-powered spaces offer a mishmash of instant histories to cater for the most atavistic deep green tastes, best symbolised perhaps by the 1990s neo-megalithic stone circle that wouldn't be out of place in a faux past theme park. In fact, didn't Legoland in Windsor have a Stonehenge scene for a while, complete with new travellers and police? </p> <p>The Glastonbury Festival's links with CND and with eco-groups such as Greenpeace, are evidence of a longer-lasting effort to present or explore different ideas and solutions, possibly counter-modern ones, by re-examining alternative traditions from real and mythic pasts alike. This merging of past and politics is one of the festival's lasting achievements. </p> <p>Each year, it seems, rumours spread that this will be the last. Michael Eavis is in his sixties now, while his wife Jean sadly died last year. In spite of my research, I don't know what the future holds for Glastonbury Festival, though I'm pretty sure I'd rather it simply stopped than got taken over by one of the commercial festival organisations. After all, there are worse options for an atavistic culture and politics than to become part of the past.</p> <p>\u0095 George McKay is professor of English and American studies at the University of Central Lancashire.

      "body": "<p>According to opinion polls, one of the biggest cities in the world - Brazil's sprawling industrial centre, S\u00e3o Paulo - is set to elect a mayor who will open budget decisions directly to the people. While we are used to responding to appeals for the street children of Rio, the idea that the south can teach us political and technical lessons is a novel one. </p> <p>Last month, Manchester council and its neighbour, Salford, were host to Evanildo Da Silva, from a radical church network that assists the direct involvement of communities in their cities' budgets across Brazil. For 15 years, in about 80 cities, the radical Workers' Party (Partido Trabhalidores, or PT) has been working with smaller parties and community movements to create the process of participatory budgeting. One city, Porto Alegre, won the UN Habitat prize for the best-governed city. The process is now, under community pressure, implemented by conservative governments - as in Recife, where Da Silva is based. </p> <p>The brokers for Da Silva's visit were Oxfam's UK poverty programme and Community Pride, an action research group created by Church Action Against Poverty and the main Manchester churches, specifically, according to organiser Ed Cox, \"to discover how far participatory budgeting could be applied to British cities\". </p> <p>The town halls on either side of the River Irwell differ on how far local people should be involved in running their cities. Manchester's approach is explicitly about customer care - improving the quality of services run by the council. Kath Robinson, the council's deputy leader, says: \"We do not devolve decision-making, but we do consult. We have introduced co-ordinators of ward plans who work with customers.\" </p> <p>Salford, on the other hand, is devolving 2% of the council's budget - including its regeneration funds - to be decided by community committees. The council's deputy leader, John Merry, argues: \"We want more direct participative involvement in budgeting than the formal electoral process allows.\" But he adds: \"We're not about to dissolve ourselves into community committees; it's a question of the right level of decision-making for the appropriate problem.\" </p> <p>Councillors and officials from both cities were impressed by Da Silva. Not surprisingly, perhaps, because what makes the Brazilian experiment so important is that it achieves the goals of customer care - an efficiently run city - through sharing power with the community. </p> <p>The commitment to popular democracy stems from the history of the 600,000-strong PT, the main opposition to the \"third way\" party of President Fernando Enrique Cardoso. The PT's socialist ideology comes from liberation theology and the new left, rather than orthodox Marxism or conventional social democracy, and looks to popular movements for its vision of democracy. </p> <p>The PT's prospective mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Martha Supplicy, explains: \"As we got near to government we believed we had to share political power with [popular movements] and the community.\" They started with the budget, she says, because it was where corruption thrived in its secrecy. </p> <p>In Porto Alegre, around 15% of the budget - \"the investment plan\" - is subject to the participatory process. In general it is a yearly cycle that begins with neighbourhood meetings that debate their needs and elect delegates to regional forums which negotiate priorities, applying criteria that have been agreed with the city government the previous year. These meetings elect representatives to the budgetary council, where government and community representatives meet weekly to thrash out a proposal, which then goes to the municipal council for a final round of open negotiations and agreement. </p> <p>The importance of the \"participatory budgets\" in the PT-run municipalities is that, through trial and error, they have developed an effective institutional framework for sharing power. They have created a democratic public sphere which is not just an influence on government but an independent source of democratic power, making the state more accountable to society than the periodic vote could ever do. </p> <p>Tarso Gennaro, one originator of the process, says it is not easy. \"There are many conflicts of interest. Some officials feel that the participatory budget is a bit of a nuisance. They want things done quickly.\" </p> <p>Quick fixes would not have achieved the first significant redistribution of public resources towards the urban poor, nor big improvements in housing and education, as well as municipal developments in transport, recycling and telecommunications. Global surveys confirm that participatory budgeting has meant efficient, democratic government. </p> <p>The Brazilian experience confounds conventional wisdom that the management of industrial societies is incompatible with popular participation. On the contrary, the redistributive benefits and increased citizens' awareness suggests that participatory democracy is necessary to overcome a growing gulf between increasingly reluctant voters and the state. No wonder that Salford and Manchester, concerned about turnouts of below 25% in the May local elections, are keen to learn from the south. </p> <p>\u0095 Hilary Wainwright is a senior research associate at Manchester University's International Centre for Labour Studies.</p>",

      "bodyText": "According to opinion polls, one of the biggest cities in the world - Brazil's sprawling industrial centre, S\u00e3o Paulo - is set to elect a mayor who will open budget decisions directly to the people. While we are used to responding to appeals for the street children of Rio, the idea that the south can teach us political and technical lessons is a novel one. Last month, Manchester council and its neighbour, Salford, were host to Evanildo Da Silva, from a radical church network that assists the direct involvement of communities in their cities' budgets across Brazil. For 15 years, in about 80 cities, the radical Workers' Party (Partido Trabhalidores, or PT) has been working with smaller parties and community movements to create the process of participatory budgeting. One city, Porto Alegre, won the UN Habitat prize for the best-governed city. The process is now, under community pressure, implemented by conservative governments - as in Recife, where Da Silva is based. The brokers for Da Silva's visit were Oxfam's UK poverty programme and Community Pride, an action research group created by Church Action Against Poverty and the main Manchester churches, specifically, according to organiser Ed Cox, \"to discover how far participatory budgeting could be applied to British cities\". The town halls on either side of the River Irwell differ on how far local people should be involved in running their cities. Manchester's approach is explicitly about customer care - improving the quality of services run by the council. Kath Robinson, the council's deputy leader, says: \"We do not devolve decision-making, but we do consult. We have introduced co-ordinators of ward plans who work with customers.\" Salford, on the other hand, is devolving 2% of the council's budget - including its regeneration funds - to be decided by community committees. The council's deputy leader, John Merry, argues: \"We want more direct participative involvement in budgeting than the formal electoral process allows.\" But he adds: \"We're not about to dissolve ourselves into community committees; it's a question of the right level of decision-making for the appropriate problem.\" Councillors and officials from both cities were impressed by Da Silva. Not surprisingly, perhaps, because what makes the Brazilian experiment so important is that it achieves the goals of customer care - an efficiently run city - through sharing power with the community. The commitment to popular democracy stems from the history of the 600,000-strong PT, the main opposition to the \"third way\" party of President Fernando Enrique Cardoso. The PT's socialist ideology comes from liberation theology and the new left, rather than orthodox Marxism or conventional social democracy, and looks to popular movements for its vision of democracy. The PT's prospective mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Martha Supplicy, explains: \"As we got near to government we believed we had to share political power with [popular movements] and the community.\" They started with the budget, she says, because it was where corruption thrived in its secrecy. In Porto Alegre, around 15% of the budget - \"the investment plan\" - is subject to the participatory process. In general it is a yearly cycle that begins with neighbourhood meetings that debate their needs and elect delegates to regional forums which negotiate priorities, applying criteria that have been agreed with the city government the previous year. These meetings elect representatives to the budgetary council, where government and community representatives meet weekly to thrash out a proposal, which then goes to the municipal council for a final round of open negotiations and agreement. The importance of the \"participatory budgets\" in the PT-run municipalities is that, through trial and error, they have developed an effective institutional framework for sharing power. They have created a democratic public sphere which is not just an influence on government but an independent source of democratic power, making the state more accountable to society than the periodic vote could ever do. Tarso Gennaro, one originator of the process, says it is not easy. \"There are many conflicts of interest. Some officials feel that the participatory budget is a bit of a nuisance. They want things done quickly.\" Quick fixes would not have achieved the first significant redistribution of public resources towards the urban poor, nor big improvements in housing and education, as well as municipal developments in transport, recycling and telecommunications. Global surveys confirm that participatory budgeting has meant efficient, democratic government. The Brazilian experience confounds conventional wisdom that the management of industrial societies is incompatible with popular participation. On the contrary, the redistributive benefits and increased citizens' awareness suggests that participatory democracy is necessary to overcome a growing gulf between increasingly reluctant voters and the state. No wonder that Salford and Manchester, concerned about turnouts of below 25% in the May local elections, are keen to learn from the south. \u0095 Hilary Wainwright is a senior research associate at Manchester University's International Centre for Labour Studies.",

Well, it was to be a partnership between the UNDP and some 15 global corporations, including Dow Chemical, mining giant Rio Tinto, energy conglomerate ABB and biotech leader Novartis.

Last week, a High Court judge approved a \u00a3180,000 payout to 304 local people, including 55 children, following an October 1995 hydrogen sulphide gas leak, when people suffered vomiting, nausea, headaches, asthma attacks, sore throats and stinging eyes. For many, it was a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 senti; the previous year, there had been another leak and Flexsys had had to pay significant compensation to 300 people. \"The case highlights the importance of community civil actions in deterring similar, or more serious, incidents from arising in the future, a role unlikely to have been achieved by the criminal prosecution of the company\", said a lawyer from the Leigh Day practice in London who worked with the community. </p> <p>To add insult to injury, within days of the payout, Flexsys announced it would make 160 people redundant. </p> <p>\u0095 For many people in Britain, last week's news that Germany is to phase out nuclear power was a good reason to celebrate green governance. But the deal threatens to actually destroy the whole movement, according to many German commentators. Here, from Friends of the Earth activist Daniel Miittler, are six reasons why it's not just lousy but \"a disaster, and an \"historic sham\": </p> <p><strong> 1.</strong> The agreement is reversible. </p> <p><strong> 2.</strong> The nuclear industry can carry on for 32 years. By then, all reactors will have reached the end of their \"natural\" life - that is, no reactor will be forced to shut. </p> <p><strong> 3.</strong> The government guarantees \"smooth operations\" and renounces its right to tighten security standards. So, if there were a future accident, the government could not respond with higher standards. For Greenpeace, therefore, \"this agreement makes nuclear power less safe\". </p> <p><strong> 4.</strong> Reprocessing nuclear fuel will now go on until 2005, even though last year the Greens promised to end reprocessing by the end of 2000.

Another 7,000 tons will be generated before the phase-out. </p> <p><strong> 6.</strong> Two waste dumps will not be halted, despite doubts about their geological safety. </p> <p>\"This is not a shutdown programme, but an insurance policy for the nuclear industry\", says veteran anti-nuclear campaigner Wolfgang Ehmke. If the Green party passes this policy at a congress next week, its end could be in sight, he says.

      "trailText": "<p>David Walker on how Oxford, 'the home of lost causes', has finally embraced sociology</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Oxford has at last entered the 1960s. Decades after the archetypal sixties' discipline of sociology was first recognised by other British universities, Oxford University has accepted it as a legitimate field of study by launching a separate department for the subject. Even Cambridge, long resistant, began teaching sociology as a separate subject in 1970. </p> <p>And at the very moment that Oxford colleges are under fire for excluding students from working-class backgrounds, the university has appointed as its head an expert in social mobility who is openly critical of the \"third way\", says that \"the brute facts of class have not declined\" and dismisses the government's efforts at improving access to higher education as \"tinkering\" which fails to address fundamental inequalities in British society. </p> <p>In his inaugural lecture last week, Anthony Heath vowed to make the distribution of income, opportunity and life chances a focus of his new job. He promised more \"longitudinal\" studies of attitudes and behaviour over time. The department would also favour quantitative analysis of voting, elections and choices among political parties. Oxford - sometimes referred to as the home of lost causes - would never, he said, cease to pay attention to subjects which the government was not willing to pay to have researched, especially social class. </p> <p>Heath, a fellow of the British Academy, criticised sociologists who were more interested in \"theory\" than going out and gathering evidence. He also castigated \"gurus\" who wrote books about society without asking people questions, or about \"globalisation\" without making any statements or propositions that could be subjected to proper scientific tests. Members of his audience were left in little doubt that he was referring to Antony Giddens, director of the London School of Economics, whose work has influenced Tony Blair. </p> <p>Oxford undergraduates will not yet be able to take a degree in sociology. Instead, the new department will provide courses and lectures for other degrees, including PPE (philosophy, politics and economics), and teach postgraduates and Oxford's recently created degree in human sciences. The department will insist its researchers are versed in the latest mathematical and statistical techniques and emphasise skills necessary to undertake survey work. </p> <p>Sociology has existed at Oxford since the 1950s, when Peter Collison wrote his famous study, The Cutteslowe Walls: A Study in Social Class. This told the story of a barrier put in place by a property developer to stop council house tenants walking through a private estate. But sociology's existence in the ancient university has been marginal. For some time, it was housed under the disguise of \"social and administrative\" or confined to Nuffield, the postgraduate college founded after the war with a bequest from the car magnate William Morris (Lord Nuffield) to specialise in social and economic studies. </p> <p>The college provided a base for, among other sociologists, AH Halsey, who has written extensively on schools and higher edu cation and served as a special government adviser on education. The college's professorial fellow, John Goldthorpe, has led large-scale examinations of job mobility. Another leading light of Nuffield has been David Butler, who stimulated the serious study of parliamentary elections. </p> <p>Heath, who also comes from a Nuffield background, is well known for his work on the relationship of class and party preferences in voting, the effect of schools on life chances and as co-director, with Roger Jowell, of the Centre for the Study of Elections and Social Trends, which collaborates in the indispensable annual British Social Attitudes survey. </p> <p>In his lecture, Heath called upon sociologists to emancipate themselves from ways of thinking about society borrowed from the discipline of economics, especially the assumption that people act rationally after making a careful calculation of the balance of advantage to them personally of, say, voting or consuming a particular product.

      "bodyText": "Oxford has at last entered the 1960s. Decades after the archetypal sixties' discipline of sociology was first recognised by other British universities, Oxford University has accepted it as a legitimate field of study by launching a separate department for the subject. Even Cambridge, long resistant, began teaching sociology as a separate subject in 1970. And at the very moment that Oxford colleges are under fire for excluding students from working-class backgrounds, the university has appointed as its head an expert in social mobility who is openly critical of the \"third way\", says that \"the brute facts of class have not declined\" and dismisses the government's efforts at improving access to higher education as \"tinkering\" which fails to address fundamental inequalities in British society. In his inaugural lecture last week, Anthony Heath vowed to make the distribution of income, opportunity and life chances a focus of his new job. He promised more \"longitudinal\" studies of attitudes and behaviour over time. The department would also favour quantitative analysis of voting, elections and choices among political parties. Oxford - sometimes referred to as the home of lost causes - would never, he said, cease to pay attention to subjects which the government was not willing to pay to have researched, especially social class. Heath, a fellow of the British Academy, criticised sociologists who were more interested in \"theory\" than going out and gathering evidence. He also castigated \"gurus\" who wrote books about society without asking people questions, or about \"globalisation\" without making any statements or propositions that could be subjected to proper scientific tests. Members of his audience were left in little doubt that he was referring to Antony Giddens, director of the London School of Economics, whose work has influenced Tony Blair. Oxford undergraduates will not yet be able to take a degree in sociology. Instead, the new department will provide courses and lectures for other degrees, including PPE (philosophy, politics and economics), and teach postgraduates and Oxford's recently created degree in human sciences. The department will insist its researchers are versed in the latest mathematical and statistical techniques and emphasise skills necessary to undertake survey work. Sociology has existed at Oxford since the 1950s, when Peter Collison wrote his famous study, The Cutteslowe Walls: A Study in Social Class. This told the story of a barrier put in place by a property developer to stop council house tenants walking through a private estate. But sociology's existence in the ancient university has been marginal. For some time, it was housed under the disguise of \"social and administrative\" or confined to Nuffield, the postgraduate college founded after the war with a bequest from the car magnate William Morris (Lord Nuffield) to specialise in social and economic studies. The college provided a base for, among other sociologists, AH Halsey, who has written extensively on schools and higher edu cation and served as a special government adviser on education. The college's professorial fellow, John Goldthorpe, has led large-scale examinations of job mobility. Another leading light of Nuffield has been David Butler, who stimulated the serious study of parliamentary elections. Heath, who also comes from a Nuffield background, is well known for his work on the relationship of class and party preferences in voting, the effect of schools on life chances and as co-director, with Roger Jowell, of the Centre for the Study of Elections and Social Trends, which collaborates in the indispensable annual British Social Attitudes survey. In his lecture, Heath called upon sociologists to emancipate themselves from ways of thinking about society borrowed from the discipline of economics, especially the assumption that people act rationally after making a careful calculation of the balance of advantage to them personally of, say, voting or consuming a particular product. The antidote, he said, was to study the dynamics of how people related to one another inside communities.",

The move not only questions the widespread assumption that the trend away from mutuality in the building society and insurance sector is irreversible, it also challenges the basis of privatisation of public services beyond water, such as Railtrack, and throws a new idea into the fierce debate about financing London's tube network. </p> <p> This is not about taking back the assets into government ownership, but it is a radical approach to private finance of public assets. Kelda announced last week that it was to create a registered community asset mutual (RCAM) to hold the monopoly water assets of the Yorkshire region - the reservoirs, pipes and treatment works. </p> <p> The operations will be run by a conventional company, which will initially be Kelda, but subsequently will be the winner of a competitive tender. This split mimics the approach to energy and railways, where ownership of the infrastructure is separated from delivery of the service. </p> <p> The RCAM is a novel structure based on the consumer co-operative model pioneered in Rochdale in the mid-19th century. It is designed to place ownership of the assets in the hands of the community which uses them, bypassing government structures and going directly to the customers. But while this will be a consumer-owned business, there are important differences from the Co-op. The differences are designed to satisfy the water regulator's demands to protect consumers against indolent or self-interested executives and against political interference in the business. It is also important to protect against the \"carpet-baggers\" who have forced many building societies and insurers to abandon mutuality so that the accumulated wealth of previous generations can be paid out to current members. </p> <p> Peter Bryant, chairman of utility regulation experts United Capital, which is behind the idea, said: \"We had to develop a brand new set of rules. When you are dealing with real public assets you need a brand new model.\" </p> <p> Like the co-ops which run grocery shops and other businesses up and down the country, the RCAM will be governed by industrial and provident society law. And as with the co-ops, the members will be its customers. </p> <p> Unlike the co-ops, however, the members' powers will be limited to some extent. First, the RCAM will not be allowed to pay out any profits in the form of dividends. Any surplus will be \"repaid\" in the form of lower prices - for the benefit of all customers. In practice, the customers and members are likely to be the same, but it is possible that some customers may turn down the chance to grab a share of their local water company, even though they will have to pay only a token price. After all, there is no money in it, unlike privatisations and demutualisations. </p> <p> The second constraint will limit the extent to which members can elect the board. While all directors will have to be approved by the members, they can propose only two. The other directors will be chosen by headhunters, according to specifications designed to ensure a suitable mix of skills and experience - and to exclude takeover of the board by any factional interests. </p> <p> Non-executives will be in the majority on the board, with the aim of mimicking share holder pressure for maximum efficiency and avoiding sleepy executives running the business in their own interests rather than those of the customers. </p> <p> While there are some differences from conventional consumer co-ops, the model is essentially the same. It strikes a powerful blow against the apparently inexorable advance of shareholder power at a time when the co-op movement is in the middle of a navel-gazing exercise to try to understand its place in 21st century capitalist society. </p> <p> It is no surprise to discover, however, that Kelda has not come up with this innovation out of altruism or some ideological antagonism to the stock market world. Money is behind it, plus a desire to bring competition to bear on what is a natural monopoly. The problem is that stock market investors expect steady growth in profits, and demand returns - in the form of dividends - to reflect the risk inherent in business. The water regulator, on the other hand, wants prices to stay down and investors expect steady growth in profits, and demand returns - in the form of dividends - to reflect the risk inherent in business</p> <p>The water regulator, on the other hand, wants prices to stay down and investment to go up. He has demanded a 14% cut in prices and a \u00a31.5bn spending programme over the next five years. That is not a recipe for profit growth. (Kelda also announced last week that it made \u00a3222m profit, just \u00a31m more than the previous year.) The result is that the debt share capital is more expensive than borrowing, so long as the debt can be raised at relatively low interest rates. And since water is a steady business which more or less guarantees regular cash flows, if not always water flows, lenders are likely to provide the \u00a32bn-plus to finance the RCAM at rates which will cut its borrowing costs by more than one percentage point. </p> <p> Kelda's Richard Emmott says: \"What we are really saying is that equity is not the right way to fund this kind of business.\" </p> <p> Bryant is keen to stress that competition is an important motivation behind the Kelda split. \"The idea is to maximise the amount of real competition,\" he says. \"We came to realise that competition has little relevance where there is a real monopoly.\" His answer - possibly for other privatised services as well as water - is to put the core of the monopoly into an RCAM and open the remainder of the operation to competition. </p> <p> It is a model which is being actively considered by other water companies, such as Anglian.

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has spent any time teaching introductory sociology will know that one of the first tasks is to persuade students of the need to abandon their obsession with purely psychological explanations of social phenomena. There is nothing particularly mysterious or blameworthy about such an obsession. </p> <p>The world is stuffed with individualistic explanations of such matters as poverty, deviance, mental illness and personal unhappiness, and it requires a considerable imaginative effort to abandon these homely accounts for the less immediate and more abstract stories that sociologists have to tell about the influence of culture and social structure upon our everyday lives. </p> <p>But, of course, our readiness to tell psychological stories about the world, stories that rely upon reference to personal emotions and the subjective self, is not a constant. At a time when even politicians bow down before \"inexorable\" market forces, it is hardly surprising that citizens increasingly succumb to the belief that the only real changes that can be made to their lives are at the personal or emotional level. </p> <p>With the possible exception of Richard Sennett, few contemporary sociologists have addressed this predicament with such a sense of urgency as Zygmunt Bauman, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Leeds.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has spent any time teaching introductory sociology will know that one of the first tasks is to persuade students of the need to abandon their obsession with purely psychological explanations of social phenomena. There is nothing particularly mysterious or blameworthy about such an obsession. The world is stuffed with individualistic explanations of such matters as poverty, deviance, mental illness and personal unhappiness, and it requires a considerable imaginative effort to abandon these homely accounts for the less immediate and more abstract stories that sociologists have to tell about the influence of culture and social structure upon our everyday lives. But, of course, our readiness to tell psychological stories about the world, stories that rely upon reference to personal emotions and the subjective self, is not a constant. At a time when even politicians bow down before \"inexorable\" market forces, it is hardly surprising that citizens increasingly succumb to the belief that the only real changes that can be made to their lives are at the personal or emotional level. With the possible exception of Richard Sennett, few contemporary sociologists have addressed this predicament with such a sense of urgency as Zygmunt Bauman, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Leeds. In his new book The Individualised Society (published later this year by Polity) Bauman provides this vivid portrait of the contemporary dilemma. \"In our 'society of individuals' all mess into which one can get is assumed to be self-made and all hot water into which one can fall is proclaimed to have been boiled by the hapless failures who have fallen into it.\" But, of course, the problem with these individualistic stories is that while promising to bring some sense of meaning to our lives, they simultaneously disguise the genuine sources of our anxieties and discomfort. We drive ourselves into \"a blind obliviousness with social games, psychological tricks and personal preoccupations so far removed from the reality of our situation that they are forms of madness - agreed madness, shared madness, disguised and dignified madness, but madness all the same\". Sociology seeks to remedy this by reminding us that there \"are more ways of telling a story than are dreamt of in our daily story-telling\". Its task is to bring back into view the areas that have been banished into the background by our obsession with the private and personal. \u0095 Laurie Taylor talks to Zygmunt Bauman about the individualised society on Radio 4's Thinking Allowed at 4pm today.",

In the course of the study, over 20 months, 123 female and male drug rape victims were interviewed:</p> <p>\u0095 70% said they had been attacked by someone they knew; <br> \u0095 47% of attacks took place in a club or pub; <br> \u0095 More than half the drugs were administered with alcohol; <br>\u0095 In some cases drugs were hidden in milk or drinking chocolate.</p> <p>Of the victims, 14 were male.

      "bodyText": "New legislation is needed to deal with the increase of drug rapes, a study funded by the Home Office urged today. The report into drug-assisted sexual offences calls for \"a new look at sexual assaults through 21st century eyes\". Scotland Yard Detective Chief Inspector Peter Sturman, who compiled the report, says the legislation used to prosecute offenders - the Sexual Offences Act 1956 - is 44-years-old and it is time for a \"complainant driven\" approach. In the course of the study, over 20 months, 123 female and male drug rape victims were interviewed: \u0095 70% said they had been attacked by someone they knew; \u0095 47% of attacks took place in a club or pub; \u0095 More than half the drugs were administered with alcohol; \u0095 In some cases drugs were hidden in milk or drinking chocolate. Of the victims, 14 were male. Of the women, 42% were in their thirties, and many had just survived a divorce or partnership break-up and were looking for a new relationship. The other largest represented group were students - 20% of victims were at university at the time of the attack. Mr Sturman's report calls for a national database of drug rape statistics and training of police officers in what is a relatively new crime. While the problem is not of epidemic proportions, it is on the increase in the UK, he says. Among 71 recommendations are calls for consecutive sentences for multiple offenders and life sentences commensurate with the human life span. Calls for a lesser offence for acquaintance rape are rejected and banning drugs traced in drug rape incidents, like GHB, are also dismissed. But Mr Sturman does call for more stringent controls and further research into the effects of drugs like GHB. Evidence that a drug has been used in an assault is often extremely difficult to prove. Drugs stay only a few days in the system and many victims take weeks to report the attack. New techniques, like hair sampling, should be used to screen for the presence of drugs days after an attack. A network of 24-hour sexual assault treatment centres should be set up across the country, where victims can receive medical attention, counselling and make a statement to police under one roof. The report urges police officers to take any complaint seriously, no matter how bizarre or incredible the allegations seem. \"The allegation that appears to be quite bizarre may be evidence of an attack by a very experienced, serial offender,\" the report warns. Even if a victim feels he or she has consented under the influence of the drug, it should be treated as rape, the report adds. Of those interviewed for the study, more than half felt their treatment at the hands of the police was poor, or very poor. Among male victims, 71% rated their treatment as very poor. The rise of drug rape has led to creation of the Drug Rape Trust by journalist Sharon Doughty, who became involved in Mr Sturman's report during the course of making a documentary on drug rapes. She warns: \"We know offenders are using the Internet to find information on how to commit these crimes.\" The Trust is setting up its own web site to supply information and support to victims. An advice list being issued to students and through the Drug Rape Trust warns those at risk never to leave drinks unattended and to appoint a \"nominated drinks watcher\" when out in pubs and clubs.",

I feel I am setting a bad example to all youngsters who might get into gambling, so with my last few quid I will do my best to land a big win. 14-1 seems good odds to me for a match Spain have to win and Yugoslavia only draw to be sure of qualification. I can see Spain scoring early, but they were almost punished by Slovenia when they failed to kill the game off, and I can see Savo Milosevic's extremities nicking something.",

      "body": "<p>Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, was today struggling to assemble a coalition that would allow him to press ahead with a peace deal with the Palestinians.</p> <p>His government was on the point of collapse after four members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Shas party submitted their resignations from the cabinet yesterday in a dispute over funding and control of Shas's school system. The ministers quit despite winning promises of extra funds for their scandal-ridden school system and the legalisation of the Channels of Holiness radio network.</p> <p>Without Shas's 17 seats, Mr Barak stands to lose his 68-52 majority in parliament. Under Israeli law, the resignations take effect in 48 hours, leaving the sides until tomorrow afternoon to engage in brinkmanship. If his parliamentary majority disappears, Mr Barak would find it nearly impossible to stay in power for long while pursuing peace.</p> <p>Shas and its rightwing supporters view the West Bank, captured in war 33 years ago, as part of biblical Israel. But the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, would back Mr Barak's ceding land to Palestinians in order to preserve Jewish lives.</p> <p>Mr Barak said yesterday that the sides had agreed on \"90% of the problems\". Elected last year to accelerate negotiations, Mr Barak affirmed Israel's commitment to forging a permanent peace with the Palestinians. Shas carried out its threat to leave the government weeks after Mr Barak was hailed as a hero at home for ending Israel's 22-year occupation of south Lebanon and at a critical juncture in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.</p> <p>Without Shas, Mr Barak would probably enlist the six-seat, secular Shinui party with an avowed policy of fighting ultra-Orthodox influence into a shrunken coalition. He would have to rely on the outside support of Arab parties in pursuing peace. He might try to form a so-called \"national unity government\" with the rightwing Likud party, the second largest in parliament.</p> <p>But the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, demands a full partnership in decision-making, making any land-for-peace deal Mr Barak might envisage extremely difficult. With polls showing Mr Barak ahead of Mr Sharon, he could call early elections. But there is no guarantee that he would forge a more cohesive coalition now than he did after defeating the Likud prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu in May 1999.</p> <p>Israel and the Palestinians aim to sign by September a treaty solving the most difficult issues at the heart of their conflict - Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders and Jewish settlements. Mr Arafat has said he will declare a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip later this year with or without a peace agreement with Israel, which occupied the two areas in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, was today struggling to assemble a coalition that would allow him to press ahead with a peace deal with the Palestinians. His government was on the point of collapse after four members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Shas party submitted their resignations from the cabinet yesterday in a dispute over funding and control of Shas's school system. The ministers quit despite winning promises of extra funds for their scandal-ridden school system and the legalisation of the Channels of Holiness radio network. Without Shas's 17 seats, Mr Barak stands to lose his 68-52 majority in parliament. Under Israeli law, the resignations take effect in 48 hours, leaving the sides until tomorrow afternoon to engage in brinkmanship. If his parliamentary majority disappears, Mr Barak would find it nearly impossible to stay in power for long while pursuing peace. Shas and its rightwing supporters view the West Bank, captured in war 33 years ago, as part of biblical Israel. But the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, would back Mr Barak's ceding land to Palestinians in order to preserve Jewish lives. Mr Barak said yesterday that the sides had agreed on \"90% of the problems\". Elected last year to accelerate negotiations, Mr Barak affirmed Israel's commitment to forging a permanent peace with the Palestinians. Shas carried out its threat to leave the government weeks after Mr Barak was hailed as a hero at home for ending Israel's 22-year occupation of south Lebanon and at a critical juncture in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. Without Shas, Mr Barak would probably enlist the six-seat, secular Shinui party with an avowed policy of fighting ultra-Orthodox influence into a shrunken coalition. He would have to rely on the outside support of Arab parties in pursuing peace. He might try to form a so-called \"national unity government\" with the rightwing Likud party, the second largest in parliament. But the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, demands a full partnership in decision-making, making any land-for-peace deal Mr Barak might envisage extremely difficult. With polls showing Mr Barak ahead of Mr Sharon, he could call early elections. But there is no guarantee that he would forge a more cohesive coalition now than he did after defeating the Likud prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu in May 1999. Israel and the Palestinians aim to sign by September a treaty solving the most difficult issues at the heart of their conflict - Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders and Jewish settlements. Mr Arafat has said he will declare a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip later this year with or without a peace agreement with Israel, which occupied the two areas in the 1967 Middle East war.",

      "bodyText": "England were knocked out of Euro 2000 in the most dramatic fashion last night when a penalty two minutes from the end gave Romania a 3-2 victory. Ioan Viorel Ganea scored the goal that ended Kevin Keegan's dream of a quarter-final date with Italy on Saturday after a clumsy challenge by the England defender Phil Neville gave away the penalty. There were no reports of any violence from England fans in Charleroi before or during the match, which was played in a festive atmosphere amid nail-biting tension. England, who needed just a point to qualify for the quarter-finals, fell behind to a goal from Christian Chivu in the 21st minute and looked to be going out of the tournament in a first half dominated by the Romanians. But in the 39th minute Alan Shearer gave Keegan a lifeline with his 30th goal for his country, joining Tom Finney and Nat Lofthouse as the fourth highest goalscorers for their country. The England captain started the move that led to the goal when he fed the ball into the path of Paul Ince, who was brought down by Chivu. The referee instantly pointed to the penalty spot. Up stepped Shearer to send the goalkeeper, Stelea, the wrong way. In first-half injury time England completed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes when Michael Owen put them ahead. Paul Scholes played the ball over the defence into the path of Owen who kept his head as he clipped the ball wide of the advancing Stelea before turning it into an empty net from an acute angle. Three minutes into the second half, however, the Romanians drew level when Munteanu volleyed home after a weak punch by the goalkeeper, Nigel Martyn - who was only playing because David Seaman injured himself in the pre-match warm up. In sweltering temperatures of over 30c before the kick-off, England fans partied instead of causing trouble. In Charleroi's main square, the scene of most of the violence before the game with Germany on Saturday afternoon, there was a carnival atmosphere as bands played and fans enjoyed the sunshine dancing in fountains. Around 2,000 police officers were on duty and all tables and chairs had been removed from the main square. Uefa, European football's governing body, and the Belgian authorities became embroiled in controversy in the run-up to last night's match over the serious trouble caused by Turkish fans in Brussels on Monday night. Several bars were smashed and there were a number of skirmishes between fans and police, but Gerhard Aigner, Uefa chief executive, described the events as a giant party that went wrong. Francois-Eavier de Donnea, the mayor of Brussels, said after the violence that the initial trouble caused by English fans over the weekend was to blame. He added: \"There were people still looking for British hooligans for revenge. They still feel they were psychologically attacked by British hooligans. It was not a good idea to provoke them. It started a chain reaction that was hard to stop.\" The comments were attacked as a \"disgrace\" by Kevin Miles of the Football Supporters Association.

      "bodyText": "Conservative leader William Hague today made a bid for the religious vote with a promise to address what he calls the government's \"disregard for the faith dimension in national life and the failure to promote the family\". Mr Hague accused public policies of \"riding roughshod\"' over the common sense values of families in Britain and calls for \"a more generous acknowledgement of the role of faith communities\" in an article in the Times. Modern families' concerns, he said, include broadcasting standards, drugs, relationships and education. The Tory leader cited the government's recent abolition of the married couple's allowance as an example of the \"wrong message\" being given about the importance of family life. \"The consequences of government policy's subversion of the public's values are most serious for those people who can least afford it,\" Mr Hague said. Britain's poorest communities, where the support structures are often very weak, have to rely on churches and other faith communities to pioneer \"innovative projects to help people overcome multiple disadvantages.\" But the Conservative leader argued that successful faith-based programmes are often denied government funds because of their \"spiritual foundations\", while the European Union's proposed employment directive could imperil their independence. \"I will fight to protect the independence of faith-based projects as well as the right of potential users of such programmes to choose a secular alternative,\" Mr Hague promised. His comments were timed to coincide with the Tory leader meeting some of the principal advisers behind the \"compassionate conservatism\" doctrine of US Republican presidential candidate George W Bush. Mr Bush has promised greater freedom for religious charities working with the poor and proposed that Christian organisations would be paid by the government to run drug treatment, health care, child care or homelessness hostels. Presbyterian church elder Marvin Olasky, Mr Bush's adviser on welfare and social policy, will brief Mr Hague on his work in getting Christian religious groups involved in tackling inner city problems such as housing, family breakdown and drugs. Professor Olasky, a Texas University lecturer who is being accompanied on his trip to London by Don Willett, Mr Bush's special projects director, are also expected to meet other shadow cabinet members. Mr Olasky told the Today programme that he had discussed his ideas with Mr Hague's aides and believed that they were applicable to the UK. He said: \"The state should make greater use of folks who are willing to volunteer to help their neighbours. \"Our experience in America is that people in churches and mosques are very willing to come forward and that has been the most effective form of poverty-fighting, using one-to-one help rather than going to a bureaucracy. \"In recent years in America, we have been able to reduce the number of people on welfare by half, with families being helped and children seeing that there is an alternative to welfare dependency. \"The emphasis is on people doing all they can to work and to be citizens. It has been very helpful in the US and from what I hear it would help in the UK too.\"",

      "body": "<p>In a way, Alexandra Shulman is absolutely right: you do not catch anorexia from Vogue magazine. At today's summit meeting, she and the other editors of fashion magazines can sit down, safe in the knowledge that the pages of their publications do not carry some kind of bacteria that will make their readers anorexic. </p> <p>Anorexia and bulimia are not trendy, zeitgeist illnesses. There are records of anorexics from as far back as the 16th century, so there is no point in trying to relate the cause of the illness to current pop-cultural issues. </p> <p>No one would argue that alcoholism is caused by beer advertisements, and the concern that Trainspotting would lead to kids shooting up on the streets is now, at last, widely scorned. Nevertheless, lazy commentators still make the simplified assumption that too much Kate Moss is bad for your health. The truth is far more complicated. I know from painful experience - I suffered from severe anorexia through most of my teenage years, spending almost four of them in hospital. All because I, quite simply, stopped eating. </p> <p>As studies routinely prove, the underlying causes of anorexia (as much as any psychologist can ascertain) are depression and childhood trauma. It can even be genetic. Far more complex, in other words, than the simple desire to fit into a size eight. </p> <p>Like alcoholism and drug addiction, eating disorders tear families apart. Parents, husbands, children, wives (an increasing number of men suffer from eating disorders) watch with a desperate helplessness as their loved ones slowly, seemingly wilfully, kill themselves. To suggest that all this misery is caused by a jealousy of Kate Moss or out of petulant vanity is insulting. </p> <p>So yes, the fashion industry can pat itself on the back: it is not from reading too many copies of a magazine that people decide to starve themselves to death. </p> <p>And yet. When models are becoming increasingly bony, when the ideal clothing size is diminishing every year, with actresses proudly showing off their hip bones and clavicles at this year's Academy Awards, when actresses and models who still need to wear a bra are called \"curvy\", there is something very unhealthy going on. To watch the current series of Ally McBeal on television is a particularly fascinating experience, with actress Calista Flockhart's tendons becoming more prominent each passing week. Yet she is being celebrated as an icon of feminine beauty and independence in at least two magazines this month. People in the fashion and entertainment industries are deliberately and belligerently missing the point when they storm that they don't \"cause\" anorexia. </p> <p>An eating disorder is a mental illness. It is characterised by the sufferer's belief that they are too fat, that to survive on 500 calories a day is the norm, that doctors are trying to make them fat, that weighing more than seven stone is obese and unacceptable. So far, so paranoid. </p> <p>Yet the current culture of skinniness legitimises the anorexic's beliefs. That is where the danger lies. Once a person becomes severely anorexic, they are usually too locked into their own little world to care if Jennifer Aniston is now a size six, or to read about Jodie Kidd's protruding hip bones. But when they try to recover, it is very difficult to shake off these old beliefs when every other magazine cover seems to validate them. </p> <p>Unquestionably, models and actresses are now expected to be thinner than ever before, and we are becoming inured to the situation. When these women become dangerously, bone-jutting skinny, they garner more publicity, more adulation, more success. This then becomes a vicious circle, with such images of skinniness being seen as the image of a Successful Woman. Calista Flockhart, Portia de Rossi, Lara Flynn Boyle, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Elizabeth Hurley, Courtney Cox and Jennifer Aniston were all, at most, moderately well-known actresses before their ribcages began to show. Now, particularly in the case of Flockhart and Aniston, they are to be seen marching down red carpets, clad in Versace dresses, beaming out from magazine covers, feted in high-fashion magazines which had previously ignored them. One US fashion magazine is said to have splashed out on a Marc Jacobs cashmere jumper to disguise what even it recognised as excessive skinniness during a cover shoot with Flockhart. Thousands of models walk down the catwalks every year, yet it was Jodie Kidd who grabbed the press's attention when she strutted down, vertebrae visible to all. </p> <p>These women then become caught: the media focuses on them, with a mixture of fascination, adulation and voyeurism, so they are unable to put on any weight without making headlines. They are not to be attacked for being so thin; nor should they be blamed for making teenage girls push away uneaten plates of food, as Kate Moss was five years ago. They are simply manipulating (consciously or not) today's culture to their advantage, and the blame for this culture lies firmly on the heads of the media. Instead of pitying actresses and models who look pale, wan, ill, they are feted as symbols of wealthy, successful women. Incredibly, some fashion magazines have even made this a moral issue, claiming that they are defending a woman's right to be thin. Of course, no one should be criticised for their natural body shape. However, to look at some of the women in today's fashion and media industries is a painful experience. Everything about them, from their sunken eyes, thinning hair, bony arms and pigeon chests is a visual emblem of their self-denial and the misogyny propagated by this culture of thin. Women are not meant to look like women, they should resemble pre-pubescent boys. </p> <p>My own anorexia kept me in hospital almost continuously for four years and I never imagined it was possible to be so unhappy. I weighed five stone and yet still exercised compulsively up to six hours a day. My day was built around how to avoid eating (\"If I say I'm meeting someone for coffee, my mum won't make me eat breakfast\"), how to exercise as much as possible (always take the stairs, never the lift) and just how to make it through the day. I was always cold - a cold that ripped through my increasingly visible bones, rather than one I could block out with my beloved baggy clothes. </p> <p>While my school friends, with whom I quickly lost touch, were going to parties and having their first snogs, I wasted these years crying on a hospital bed. I was always the youngest patient on the ward, and my closest friends were women and men 20 years older than me who had been ill for decades. At least three of them have died since my last admission. I took my GCSEs sitting cross-legged in a consulting room while a teacher from my school stood outside, asking the nurses to \"keep the patients a bit quieter, please\". This is not a part of my life of which I am particularly proud. However, I find it easier to talk about anorexia than to sit back quietly when people claim that it is entirely to do with models, or, conversely, that the current veneration of thinness is blameless. Both positions are simplistic. </p> <p> When I was in hospital, the other patients and I hardly ever talked about models. The doctors and my parents would try to assure me that all of my fears about fatness and food and my beliefs about the importance of thinness were the illness talking. Yet when I was finally discharged, I was amazed to find myself in a culture which seemed to disprove all of the doctor's assurances. These images had been irrelevant to me when I became ill, but, now that I was trying to recover, they fed into all of my thoughts. </p> <p>I read articles in women's magazines that could have been written by me when I was locked on the ward at the Maudsley Hospital. There were models in magazines who looked like my former fellow patients. There was Elizabeth Hurley saying she would commit suicide were she as fat as Marilyn Monroe. I felt like the paranoid in a horror movie who realises that his worst fears are, in fact, real. There is something very wrong when society condones an attitude reminiscent of the beliefs I held when I was ill. </p> <p>For a while, I used this as an excuse not to get better. If models, actresses and other women didn't eat and obsessed about weight, then why should I have to change? Why were doctors picking on me? </p> <p>When I was finally discharged from hospital I weighed about six-and-a-half stone. Although most people commented on how thin I was, dozens of women used to do so with a tone of envy. I remember a group of women coming up to me in the street to congratulate me on my \"sticky legs\", counselling me not to put on any weight because \"you can wear anything and look good when you're so thin\". I went into a shop and cried. </p> <p>I finally began to recover when I realised that I could no longer bear being so unhappy, and accepted that this meant eating on a regular basis. I had to stop myself reading women's magazines, at least while I was putting on the weight, and stop desperately scanning magazine diet (or \"health\") articles and gazing at the models. </p> <p>When I look at these women now, I no longer feel the instinctive pang of envy, but rather one of pity. I remember, all too clearly, what it felt like to have that constant roar of hunger in my head and that feeling of being totally trapped and helpless. In their eyes, beneath the carefully applied eyeshadow and concealer, there is a familiar misery reflected back at the camera. The memory of that feeling girds me against ever letting myself slip back into the illness again. </p> <p>Ironically, I now work in fashion journalism, which is why I feel even more strongly about this issue. Fashion does not need to present dangerously ill images of women. Fashion is about beautiful clothes, and fashion editors risk alienating their audiences and losing touch with any concept of reality with their needless promotion of the bony look. </p> <p>Models don't cause anorexia, but that does not mean that the fashion industry is off the hook and that we should maintain the status quo. We have to ask, why are women who weigh seven stone venerated as icons of beauty? The common reply from fashion magazines is that the sample sizes of clothing they receive are getting smaller, so they need to use models who can fit into a size eight or six. If this is the case, then they need to insist on sample sizes being bigger - this is not a difficult situation to resolve, and it needs to be resolved soon. </p> <p>Should we hang, draw and quarter magazine editors? Of course not. But we have to ask, do we really want to live in a culture in which the icons of beauty resemble patients in a hospital?</p>",

To observers of Teutonic culture, though, the return of Basil Fawlty to German screens - he has already goose-stepped across them once in a dubbed version of the British comedy classic - is the latest sign of a subtle but significant change. At last, the Germans seem to be getting our jokes.</p> <p>For years, the stereotypical view of Germans has been of a race utterly devoid of a sense of humour - the sort of character typified by Harry Enfield's contrite yet overbearing J\u00fcrgen the German. Yet over the past few years, a new brand of German comedy has been developing. The humour of the younger generation, especially those who have grown up since reunification, is much more western, more ironic, less considered - even frivolous.</p> <p>No one knows what makes the Germans laugh better than Professor Hans-Dieter Gelfert, fellow of English literature at the Freie University in Berlin. Gelfert's book, From Max to Monty, offers a historical analysis of the difference between the British and German senses of humour. Spanning four centuries, this scrupulous study traces the evolution of humour in the two countries through literature, philosophy, and popular culture.</p> <p>\"Traditional German humour is often marked by Gem\u00fctlichkeit - a cosiness. It's an unencumbered, warm-hearted humour, and it has dominated practically everything,\" he says. \"This humour still survives today, but chiefly among the elderly and the more conservative middle classes. For this reason, 'cosy' humour is still the predominant form of humour in our TV programmes.\"</p> <p>Another aspect of traditional German humour, says Gelfert, is its tendency to moralise. He cites political cabaret as an example. \"It's very different from English political satire, which is often cruel and amoral. The English laugh at themselves and at their most sacred values, and are always keen to challenge authority - that's what foreigners love about the English. And that's the exact opposite of German humour. Our political cabaret, however cruel it may be, is totally in favour of the authority of the moral system.\"</p> <p>Germans, meanwhile, are puzzled by the British fondness for eccentricity - the mad granny, the alcoholic aunt. \"The Germans want to keep these characters backstage, because eccentricity means tension, deviation from the norm.\"</p> <p>Then there is our predilection for punning and wordplay. This is more common in English, says Gelfert, because of the greater number of homophones and monosyllabic words in the Anglo-Saxon language.</p> <p>Perhaps most important of all is the difference in irony. \"English irony is the subtle irony of understatement; they go below what they mean. The Germans, on the other hand, go above what they mean; they practise irony by overstatement.\"</p> <p>Increasingly, though, many of these characteristics are being superseded by a new brand of German humour, says Gelfert. \"Urban, rebellious, anarchic\" - all systems and authorities are viewed with disdain. The growing band of self-mythologising young pop writers in Germany are a case in point. In witty novels such as Generation Golf and Relax, they display a studied disregard for all that has gone before. Their humour is fast and superficial. There is no longer the same degree of respect for the profound, ordering principles of society. The straight-faced German could soon be a thing of the past.</p> <p>Another example is the singer-comedian, Stefan Raab, who graced our screens in his glittery suit and oversized specs in this year's Eurovision Song Contest. The song, philosophically entitled Wadde Hadde Dudde Da? (loosely: What Have You Got There?), exemplified another new aspect of comedy which the Germans call Bl\u00ffdelei (meaning foolishness). It's a comedy that incorpo rates funny sounds and gestures and is roughly akin to English slapstick. Raab's song even contained one stanza in English by way of comedic homage.</p> <p>Raab is something of a star in Germany. He has his own comedy show during which he lampoons his guests, and he used to be a presenter on Viva (the German MTV), where he mocked the pop star guests. His jokes are simple, disposable and mildly offensive. Needless to say, the Eurovision audiences were slightly baffled.</p> <p>A few people in Germany aren't so sure either. The Bild-Zeitung (the German equivalent of the Sun) ran the headline \"Germany divided over Stefan Raab\". He has caused a rift beween the followers of traditional German humour, who despise him, and the acolytes of the new style of comedy that is colourful, loud, and nonsensical. Younger Germans in particular adore him.</p> <p>Gelfert believes the new brand of German humour could help chip away at the outmoded, caricaturish stereotypes that the British and Germans foist on each other. \"The German idea of Englishness is old-fashioned, obsolete: a gentleman in a suit with a copy of the Times.\" Yet the younger generation looks to England for inspiration in fashion and music. For them, an Englishman is a Britpop fan carrying a copy of the NME.</p> <p>\"There has never been a time when so many people have been working for a mutual understanding between the two countries,\" says Gelfert. He should know. In 1996 he received an award for helping to improve Anglo-German relations with his thoughtful, comparative studies. Who knows, perhaps John Cleese will be up for next year's prize.</p>",

The English laugh at themselves and at their most sacred values, and are always keen to challenge authority - that's what foreigners love about the English. And that's the exact opposite of German humour. Our political cabaret, however cruel it may be, is totally in favour of the authority of the moral system.\" Germans, meanwhile, are puzzled by the British fondness for eccentricity - the mad granny, the alcoholic aunt. \"The Germans want to keep these characters backstage, because eccentricity means tension, deviation from the norm.\" Then there is our predilection for punning and wordplay. This is more common in English, says Gelfert, because of the greater number of homophones and monosyllabic words in the Anglo-Saxon language. Perhaps most important of all is the difference in irony. \"English irony is the subtle irony of understatement; they go below what they mean. The Germans, on the other hand, go above what they mean; they practise irony by overstatement.\" Increasingly, though, many of these characteristics are being superseded by a new brand of German humour, says Gelfert. \"Urban, rebellious, anarchic\" - all systems and authorities are viewed with disdain. The growing band of self-mythologising young pop writers in Germany are a case in point. In witty novels such as Generation Golf and Relax, they display a studied disregard for all that has gone before. Their humour is fast and superficial. There is no longer the same degree of respect for the profound, ordering principles of society. The straight-faced German could soon be a thing of the past. Another example is the singer-comedian, Stefan Raab, who graced our screens in his glittery suit and oversized specs in this year's Eurovision Song Contest. The song, philosophically entitled Wadde Hadde Dudde Da? (loosely: What Have You Got There?), exemplified another new aspect of comedy which the Germans call Bl\u00ffdelei (meaning foolishness). It's a comedy that incorpo rates funny sounds and gestures and is roughly akin to English slapstick. Raab's song even contained one stanza in English by way of comedic homage. Raab is something of a star in Germany. He has his own comedy show during which he lampoons his guests, and he used to be a presenter on Viva (the German MTV), where he mocked the pop star guests. His jokes are simple, disposable and mildly offensive. Needless to say, the Eurovision audiences were slightly baffled. A few people in Germany aren't so sure either. The Bild-Zeitung (the German equivalent of the Sun) ran the headline \"Germany divided over Stefan Raab\". He has caused a rift beween the followers of traditional German humour, who despise him, and the acolytes of the new style of comedy that is colourful, loud, and nonsensical. Younger Germans in particular adore him. Gelfert believes the new brand of German humour could help chip away at the outmoded, caricaturish stereotypes that the British and Germans foist on each other. \"The German idea of Englishness is old-fashioned, obsolete: a gentleman in a suit with a copy of the Times.\" Yet the younger generation looks to England for inspiration in fashion and music. For them, an Englishman is a Britpop fan carrying a copy of the NME. \"There has never been a time when so many people have been working for a mutual understanding between the two countries,\" says Gelfert. He should know. In 1996 he received an award for helping to improve Anglo-German relations with his thoughtful, comparative studies. Who knows, perhaps John Cleese will be up for next year's prize.",

You matter a lot.</p> <p>Some people will say (though not to your face), that your powers will be purely \"ceremonial\". Don't believe a word of it. Talk to your granny instead: she'll set you right. She's understood for nearly half a century that she occupies a central place in the British constitution. In a deadlocked situation, she gets to choose which party leader should be given first shot at forming a government - or even to call fresh elections. She signs the bills which become our laws. Don't be fooled, William. We still live in a land ruled by crown prerogative, with vast authority concentrated at the very top.</p> <p>There's another word to watch out for, besides ceremonial. Defenders of your birthright will use it often. The monarchy no longer matters, they'll say: it's only symbolic. They're half right. Right that it's symbolic - wrong that it's \"only\". As I suspect you already know, symbols matter, especially to a nation. They tell the rest of the world - and ourselves - who we think we are.

To publish these across 12 Daily Mail pages, including long analyses decoding the hidden meaning of responses such as \"I don't know\" or \"I haven't really thought about it\" is a kind of national humiliation.</p> <p>It's not you, I promise.

You have no such freedom. You can't be snapped with a glass in hand, lest you look like a lush. You can't dye your hair or pierce an ear without setting off a national debate.

When Gordon Brown goes on about creating a society where young people can be whatever they want to be, you should plug your ears - because it doesn't apply to you. Just as a century ago the son of a miner had no choice - he had to become a miner - so you, too have no choice. Never mind your talents or dreams, they will all come to nought. Your course has been set. You will be our head of state; you have no say.</p> <p>I admit it, this is a new line for us republicans. For centuries the very word has evoked images of Jacobin execution squads, hooded men plotting to place you and your kin at the mercy of the guillotine. Even in your own, brief lifetime republicans have seemed, if not thirsty for blue blood, then at least unbothered by the plight of your family. Throughout the 90s, anti-monarchists too often came across as resentful green-eyes who wished ill fortune on an already blighted dynasty.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be that way. There is no contradiction between a desire to fill Britain's ultimate job by democratic means and an empathy for the family who've been saddled with it for the best part of a millennium - your family.

We could wish her a long and healthy life and promise that, when the time comes, we will give her a full state funeral, with all the honours. But we could also promise, at that same moment, to bury this fairytale institution with her. Not just for our sake, but for all of you.

Both Mr Speight and the military, led by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, have told local Fijian media that the latest round of negotiations are the closest they have reached to bringing the crisis to an end, which began when armed rebels took control of parliament on 19 May. Mr Speight's spokesman Jo Nata confirmed that \"a preliminary accord has been drafted and has been gone through by lawyers and all the parties, and could be signed by this afternoon.\" Mr Nata refused to reveal a timetable for the release of the hostages, including the ethnic Indian prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry, saying, \"The release of the hostages is not of importance to us.\" The hostages have been held inside Fiji's parliament for 34 days and are showing signs of trauma caused by isolation and fear for their safety, reported the director of Fiji's Red Cross branch John Scott. \"Some people have become withdrawn, to say the least,\" said Mr Scott, the only person apart from the captors who has been allowed regular visits with the hostages. Despite progress in the negotiations, the decision to dismiss Mr Chaudhry and abandon Fiji's 1997 constitution, which guaranteed equal rights for indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians, is seen as a blow to race relations in the country. \"The power of the gun must not be allowed to dictate policy,\" said an editorial Tuesday by The Fiji Times newspaper.

Today Mr Speight backed away from that statement. \"Our very strong view, which is the reason why this whole coup happened, is that no non-Fijian should be included in lawmaking or the promulgation of a new constitution,\" he said. Commodore Bainimarama has announced a plan to restore civilian rule by appointing an interim administration to oversee a recasting of the constitution and hold elections within two years. The United States, Australia and New Zealand have said they will impose sanctions on Fiji if it does not return to full democracy. The country is already losing millions of dollars a day in lost tourism revenue and the refusal by Australian unions to handle cargo to and from Fiji - cutting off the country's garment industry from its principal market. Fiji's unions are also boycotting this year's harvest of sugar cane - one of the country's biggest industries - until the hostages are released.",

Indigenous rebel leader George Speight said he expected to sign a deal with the Fijian military by the end of this week. An agreement is believed likely to give him and his leaders protection from arrest, as well as some role in an interim government. Both Mr Speight and the military, led by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, have told Fijian media that the latest round of negotiations are the closest they have reached to bringing the crisis to an end, which began when armed rebels took control of parliament on May 19. Mr Speight's spokesman Jo Nata confirmed that \"a preliminary accord has been drafted and has been gone through by lawyers and all the parties, and could be signed by this afternoon\". Mr Nata refused to reveal a timetable for the release of the hostages, including the ethnic Indian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry. \"The release of the hostages is not of importance to us,\" he said. The hostages have been held inside Fiji's parliament for 34 days. They are showing signs of trauma caused by isolation and fears for their safety, said John Scott, the director of Fiji's Red Cross branch, who has been allowed regular visits with the hostages. Despite progress in the negotiations, the decision to dismiss Mr Chaudhry and abandon Fiji's 1997 constitution, which guaranteed equal rights for indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians, is seen as a blow to race relations in the country. The military and the rebels are haggling over how to implement the demands of Mr Speight, who led the May 19 armed takeover of parliament amid widespread looting and street violence.

Fortunately for movie- and theatre-goers, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel and Ellen Burstyn would beg to differ. The three actors have taken over the leadership of the world's best-known theatre workshop, the Actors Studio, home of the Method, once derided as \"armpit acting\". The 53-year-old New York school, founded by the late Lee Strasberg, was based on the principles of Constantin Stanislavsky, who preached assimilation of character through mental exercises rather than the conventions of the 19th century. Brando was its best-known student but others associated with the school and its attachment to realism include Paul Newman, James Dean, Montgomery Clift, Anthony Quinn, Marilyn Monroe, Robert Duvall, Robert De Niro, Lee Grant and Dustin Hoffman. Strasberg's big idea was to train actors to draw on sense memory to recreate emotions on stage or screen. But Newman, a former president of the studio, is equivocal about its influence and said of Strasberg: \"I found everything that he was teaching fascinating, but I could never really make it work for me.\" Pacino, Keitel and Burstyn have been named as co-presidents to replace the director Arthur Penn, who is leaving to produce a television series. Mr Penn said: \"There was a period there that the torn undershirt and Brando's mumbling became sort of fair game for making fun of the studio.\" Mr Penn was instrumental in opening up the once-inscrutable institution, which now has a spin-off cable television series of interviews with actors and a master's degree course. It was conceived in 1947 by Elia Kazan, Cheryl Crawford and Robert Lewis as a place where actors could experiment and develop their work and now the studio wants to return to their aesthetic code, liberated from the demands of commerce. \"We want to work toward making it that kind of place again, a place of refuge from the commercial world,\" said Estelle Parsons, the artistic director.",

Birmingham Rep's production of Baby Doll moves into London's Albery Theatre tonight and Orpheus Descending opens next week at the Donmar Warehouse. But then, I never really felt that Williams had been away: his sympathetic surveys of desperation, loneliness and beleaguered idealism have been part of our theatrical landscape ever since The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire opened in Britain in the late 40s. Yet although Williams has been with us for half a century, one still wonders whether we get him precisely right. </p> <p>Initially, he was seen in Britain as a lurid sensationalist. When Streetcar was first produced here in 1949, one critic wrote that he felt as if he had \"crawled through a garbage heap\". The play was denounced in parliament as \"low and repugnant\" and dubbed \"salacious and pornographic\" by the public morality council. </p> <p>Nine years later, when Peter Hall directed the British premiere of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the Comedy Theatre had to be turned into a private club in order to circumvent the prying attentions of the theatrical censor, the Lord Chamberlain; a Pulitzer prize-winning play acquired the reputation of a banned shocker. But Williams also made Americans go hot under the collar: when Elia Kazan's film of Baby Doll was released in 1956 Time magazine called it \"just about the dirtiest American-made motion picture that has ever been legally exhibited\" and Cardinal Spellman denounced it as \"immoral and corrupting\". </p> <p>With enemies like that, Williams scarcely needed friends: the hysteria his plays and films generated helped to turn them into box-office hits. But just because Williams was mistakenly seen as a salacious sensationalist, his apologists were forced to treat him rather gushingly, as if he were a theatrical Mother Teresa overflowing with Christian love. In fact he did have a religious instinct: in his later, drug-fuelled years, Tallulah Bankhead once wittily remarked, \"Tennessee, you and I are the only constantly high Episcopalians I know.\" It is also true that Williams shows great charity to life's walking wounded. But, to me, he was both a more comically caustic and a more instinctively political writer than our theatre generally acknowledges. </p> <p>Williams certainly viewed his own life through a comic prism. We tend to see The Glass Menagerie as fragile poetry, but there are stories of managements being asked to remove Williams from public performances because of his disruptive chuckles. I also once had the unnerving experience of trying to summarise the plot of Williams's Vieux Carre on a radio programme while he sat opposite me. As I described the autobiographical hero's sad early struggles in New Orleans, I was confronted by dismaying explosions of laughter. Williams clearly looked back on his own life not with anger but with a buoyant hilarity. </p> <p>Undeniably, Williams was deeply sensitive to life's pain and cruelty. But he also has the eldritch humour that is part of the southern gothic tradition. In Small Craft Warnings, which shows a group of human flotsam convening in a seedy Pacific beach-bar, an ageing beautician dumps herself down beside a broody gay couple and barks, \"Well, boys, what went wrong?\" More famously, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof deals with people who refuse to face the truth of life; but it also mocks a grotesque Mississippi delta family whose teeming children are characterised as no-neck monsters. \"It's too bad because you can't wring their necks if they've got no necks to wring,\" cries the frustrated Maggie. Williams's famous compassion was always accompanied by a sly awareness of the human comedy that has often gone unrecognised by British directors - with signal exceptions such as Peter Hall and Richard Eyre. </p> <p>Alongside the comedy goes a keen awareness of the deep injustice of American life. It is fascinating how many of Williams's plays revolve around the corrupt power structures of the Deep South. And A Streetcar Named Desire, far from being a sensationalist story of an ex-prostitute raped by her brother-in-law, is actually about a confrontation of values. Blanche Dubois may have her pretensions, but she represents poetic sensibility and feeling; Stanley Kowalski, on the other hand, embodies destructive animal force. </p> <p>Harold Clurman, writing about the original Broadway production with Marlon Brando and Jessica Tandy, is the only critic I've come across who grasped the play's social and political resonances. \"Stanley,\" he wrote, \"is the unwitting Antichrist of our time, the little man who will break the back of every attempt to create a more comprehensive world in which thought and conscience are expected to evolve from the old Adam. His mentality provides the soil for fascism, viewed not as a political movement but as a state of being.\" </p> <p>My gut feeling that underneath Williams's lyricism and comedy lay a writer with a social conscience who hated the stench of injustice was confirmed by the National's excellent revival of the almost unknown Not About Nightingales. Written in 1938 and set in a Philadelphia County jail where a group of inmates go on hunger strike, the play had the bold outline of a Warner Brothers melodrama. But what hit me was Williams's acute understanding of power. The prison was run by an unhinged autocrat backed by state troopers. The inmates were equally dominated by a charismatic ringleader named Butch. Williams shows the prison warden and Butch as class-opposites; he also demonstrates the natural complicity of power - both men are compared to Mussolini - which he clearly detests. </p> <p>I suspect we have often misunderstood Williams in Britain. First we treated him as if he were a quasi-pornographer. Then we turned him into a woozy mystic. For me Williams is something rather different: both a sardonic observer of life's absurdities - in particular of the grotesqueness of southern reality - and an instinctive radical who was always on the side of the oppressed. He frequently succumbed to rhetoric, but he also had a tough, clear-eyed understanding of the victimisation of the weak by the strong. And it is by his comprehension of the flaws in the American social and political system, as well as by his complex compassion, that all future productions should be judged. </p> <p>\u0095 Baby Doll opens at the Albery Theatre, London WC2 (020-7369 1740), tonight.

EUROTALK \"In a negative sense the icing on the cake for me was that England went out as well\" - Erich Ribbeck not in any way bitter after Germany were stuffed 3-0 by Portugal reserves. That's 3-0. By some reserves. THE EURO-TORIAL At 9.36pm last night, England crashed out of Euro 2000. And sadly - no correct that, shamefully - a vast number of the Great British public will have crashed out with them. \"With our boys gone, what's the point?\" sums up the national mood of indifference this morning. But why the performance of the England team should make a difference we don't know. Because so far we've enjoyed a great tournament. It's better than Euro 96, which was permeated by safe and soulless 0-0 draws. And it's certainly better than Italia 90, which produced some of the most negative and tedious football ever seen on the big stage.

Squashed in between boxes and leaflets, cycle helmets and child car seats are a tired-looking woman trying to decipher a benefits agency decision and a colleague cheerfully answering the phone. In short, Health First is your typical small community development organisation - except, to hear people talk, you'd think it a place of miracles. </p> <p>\"If it hadn't been there, if people hadn't got involved, I really don't think I'd be here,\" says Lynda Smith. She describes struggling to bring up three children, with a disabled husband, on benefits, and spending \"nearly a year indoors on anti-depressants\". Now she is involved in the local credit union and a neighbourhood management committee. She has done some training and \"might even get a job\". And in that shift from despair to optimism lies something of arresting simplicity. </p> <p>Smith comes from a part of Norwich comprising three pre-war council estates - West Earlham, Marlpit and Larkham. A short hop from the charming city centre, the area known derisively as Monkey Island could be light years away for all it shares in terms of opportunity and wealth. Low pay, unemployment and poverty make a breeding ground for health and social problems, such as drug addiction and mental illness. Psychological disorders, such as agoraphobia, anxiety, bulimia and depression, are rife. </p> <p>Twelve years ago, a local GP's wife decided to do something about the ill health her husband and his colleagues saw daily. Eilay Laurie felt that the doctors were only scratching the surface. She says: \"GPs see symptoms, but I'm interested in causes.\" </p> <p>She talked to people in the waiting room and found that \"top of their list was not clinical services but worry, stress, poverty, a lack of control and a sense of being second-class citizens\". She wheedled some health promotion funding out of the practice and set about organising activities with a handful of local women. Their expertise was crucial. \"Local people knew what the problems were and largely what the solutions would be,\" she says. \"They just needed facilitating.\" </p> <p>Kim Brown was there at the start and knew the issues at first hand. \"I've crawled across the floor with the kids to avoid being seen by the rent man,\" she says. \"I've been beaten by men and thrown downstairs when pregnant.\" </p> <p>Brown and fellow Health First employee, Freda Sheehy, can reel off stories of others hauling themselves out of isolation and desperation through volunteering - others such as the battered and depressed young woman who initially described herself as \"just a slug in the mud\", but now runs children's activities. </p> <p>Taking part when feeling that low takes a huge effort. Sheehy, Smith's sister, says she virtually \"dragged her, kicking and screaming\". But Smith did get involved in the activities springing up under the Health First umbrella. </p> <p>One of the first was Coffee Break. Conceived as a breathing space - with free coffee and cr\u00e8che - for isolated young mothers, the group invited speakers to talk about topics that concerned them, such as domestic violence, eating disorders and child abuse. Health First has since run art classes, a fitness group, a healthy lunch club, first aid training, advice sessions and a helpline, child safety lessons and a credit union. </p> <p>For many, isolated by low self-esteem, poverty and sometimes violence, community involvement has fostered a sense of worth and greater control. Some have developed skills that have led to paid employment. And there does seem a sense of stronger community ties. </p> <p>It's this nurturing of individual and community wellbeing that interests the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, which today publishes On Your Doorstep, its research into the role non-mental health organisations can play in drawing people with mental illnesses back into the community and even ameliorating their symptoms. </p> <p>Louise Villeneau, the report's author, says: \"Health First is not commissioned to do mental health work. But they promote emotional resilience in families and communities and encourage those with common mental health problems, such as depression, to involve themselves in community development.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, says Villeneau, promoting social integration through community engagement is rarely seen as appropriate for mainstream mental health services. It is understandable but short-sighted, she argues. People with serious, chronic, mental disorders are among the most socially and economically alienated, with a heavy psychological toll. And, put simply, having friends and doing interesting things can reduce stress and protect against ill-health. </p> <p>While the spotlight has been on tragic but rare cases of mentally ill killers, new national standards not only highlight safety and targeted mental health services, but also health promotion, early intervention and social inclusion. These, and the government's commitment to \"joined-up\" working, especially through local health improvement programmes, dovetail with community development, the report says. </p> <p>Paul Henderson, practice development director of the Community Development Foundation, sees advantages in a generic approach for vulnerable people who fear being identified as mentally ill. \"Community development offers a non-stigmatising context. One of its basic principles is 'de-labelling' people and neighbourhoods,\" he says. </p> <p> Villeneau says that, with \"creative\" funding and voluntary and statutory partnerships, community development and mental health care are potentially complementary. Schools and leisure centres are prime sites for activities, she argues. </p> <p>That \"creativity\" must cut both ways. Welfare to work aside, most major social inclusion programmes, such as action zones and the New Deal for communities, lack a mental health dimension. The Sainsbury report argues that specialist mental health staff are best placed to help generic organisations work with mental illness. </p> <p>There are obstacles. Not least is community mistrust, which requires a light touch that doesn't come naturally to statutory agencies. But, for now, in Norwich, they're positive.

The Prince of Wales and Mrs Parker-Bowles, 52, hosted a gala dinner in Shoreditch, east London, in honour of the Prince's Foundation, one of Charles's charities. The couple have appeared together in public before, but this was believed to be their first attendance at a semi-official function. They arrived at the headquarters of the Prince's Foundation, which is in a newly-restored warehouse in Shoreditch, by car, where around 100 photographers were waiting. Mrs Parker-Bowles, who smiled broadly, was wearing a pale pink embroidered full-length gown - believed to be designed by Versace. A group of anti-monarchy demonstrators shouted and waved placards as the couple walked into the building. The couple had been expected to pose for photographers when they arrived at the dinner but were apparently startled by the noise of the Movement Against the Monarchy protesters on the other side of the road and disappeared quickly inside the building. Guests at the gala included the fashion designer Donatella Versace, the model Elle Macpherson, the racing driver David Coulthard and his fi ancee Heidi Wichlinski, the screen legend Lauren Bacall, Sir Richard and Lady Branson and the comedian Joan Rivers. Last night's event came two weeks after the queen met Mrs Parker-Bowles for the first time in years at a lunch for the ex-Greek King Constantine. \u0095The Queen Mother will make a live television address to the nation during the pageant marking her 100th birthday, the Sun newspaper reported last night. Her 60-second speech will be broadcast by ITV which stepped in to televise the pageant on July 19 after it was turned down by the BBC.",

It's do-or-die time for the perennial under-achievers - they have to win this match. Fran in space through the middle at a modest pace and Jugovic makes up 10 yards to close him down. Early encouragement for Spain.<br><strong>3</strong> Free kick to Yugoslavia on the left. Mihajlovic, delivering with pace, almost picks out Milosevic at the far post. Spain concede a corner. The centre is cleared but only as far as Mihajlovic, who drives a rising shot over the bar.<br><strong>6</strong> Milosevic, pulling his unfortunate marker this way and that, almost gets on the end of a Mijatovic cross from the left. A half-chance. Goal kick.<br><strong>8</strong> A corner to Spain from the left. Fran takes, but scuffs the centre and the Yugoslavs clear with ease. The Spanish pick it up again in their own half and the ball is fed through to Helguera, centre-left, who manages to turn whilst surrounded by three defenders and he gets the shot off, just wide of Kralj's right-hand upright.<br><strong>10</strong> Mihajlovic, caught back-pedalling, fouls Guardiola 25 yards out centre-right. Fran chips the ball in and the Spanish go bezerk appealing for a handball. No dice from the French referee, and the Spaniards feel hard done by.<br><strong>13</strong> An early <strong>substitution</strong> for Yugoslavia, as a limping Djorovic leaves the field, replaced by Stankovic (J).<br><strong>15</strong> Pretty cynical tackling by the Yugoslavs as Mendieta, in full flight down the left, is scythed down. The free kick, taken by Guardiola, is flicked on by Mendieta for Alfonso, who can only deflect the ball wide. Another good half-chance gone begging.<br><strong>19</strong> Alfonso misses the best chance of the game so far - a low, raking cross from Mendieta on the left is slightly behind the Spanish forward, 5 yards out. Stretch as he might, he could not make any meaningful contact.<br><strong>23</strong> Fran, cut from an earlier clash, can take no further part in the match. He is <strong>subsituted</strong> and Etxeberria comes on in his place.<br><strong>28</strong> A harsh free kick against Komljenovic, on the left. Guardiola takes and his drifting cross eludes Paco and Abelardo, both with seemingly free headers 10 yards from goal.<br><strong>29</strong> Down the other end now, as Yugoslavia attack in the shape of Mijatovic, who sends a long ball through for Milosevic. Canzaries is nowhere to be seen and Paco clears off his own goal-line. The Spanish defence is looking shambolic. <br><strong>31 GOAL! Yugoslavia 1 - 0 Spain</strong> Spain's nightmare tournament continues, as Drulovic's cultured left foot curls in a perfect cross for that man again, Milosevic, who powers an unstoppable header under Canzaires from 10 yards out. Salgado, the Spanish right-back, was way off the pace after picking up a knock.<br> <strong>35</strong> Spain are enjoying a lot of possession. A free kick is won on the left, near the corner flag.

Substitutes: Bunjevcevic, Cicovic, Dudic, Govedarica, Korac, Kovacevic, Nadj, Saveljic, J. Stankovic, D. Stankovic. Spain: Canizares, Salgado, Abelardo, Helguera, Sergi, Mendieta, Paco, Fran, Guardiola, Perez Munoz, Raul. Substitutes: Aranzabal, Casillas, Engonga, Etxeberria, Gerard, Hierro, Molina, Munitis, Urzaiz Aranda, Velasco, Valeron. Referee: Gilles Veissiere (France) 1 min Spain kick off. It's do-or-die time for the perennial under-achievers - they have to win this match. Fran in space through the middle at a modest pace and Jugovic makes up 10 yards to close him down. Early encouragement for Spain. 3 Free kick to Yugoslavia on the left. Mihajlovic, delivering with pace, almost picks out Milosevic at the far post. Spain concede a corner. The centre is cleared but only as far as Mihajlovic, who drives a rising shot over the bar. 6 Milosevic, pulling his unfortunate marker this way and that, almost gets on the end of a Mijatovic cross from the left. A half-chance. Goal kick. 8 A corner to Spain from the left. Fran takes, but scuffs the centre and the Yugoslavs clear with ease. The Spanish pick it up again in their own half and the ball is fed through to Helguera, centre-left, who manages to turn whilst surrounded by three defenders and he gets the shot off, just wide of Kralj's right-hand upright. 10 Mihajlovic, caught back-pedalling, fouls Guardiola 25 yards out centre-right. Fran chips the ball in and the Spanish go bezerk appealing for a handball. No dice from the French referee, and the Spaniards feel hard done by. 13 An early substitution for Yugoslavia, as a limping Djorovic leaves the field, replaced by Stankovic (J). 15 Pretty cynical tackling by the Yugoslavs as Mendieta, in full flight down the left, is scythed down. The free kick, taken by Guardiola, is flicked on by Mendieta for Alfonso, who can only deflect the ball wide. Another good half-chance gone begging. 19 Alfonso misses the best chance of the game so far - a low, raking cross from Mendieta on the left is slightly behind the Spanish forward, 5 yards out. Stretch as he might, he could not make any meaningful contact. 23 Fran, cut from an earlier clash, can take no further part in the match. He is subsituted and Etxeberria comes on in his place. 28 A harsh free kick against Komljenovic, on the left. Guardiola takes and his drifting cross eludes Paco and Abelardo, both with seemingly free headers 10 yards from goal. 29 Down the other end now, as Yugoslavia attack in the shape of Mijatovic, who sends a long ball through for Milosevic. Canzaries is nowhere to be seen and Paco clears off his own goal-line. The Spanish defence is looking shambolic. 31 GOAL! Yugoslavia 1 - 0 Spain Spain's nightmare tournament continues, as Drulovic's cultured left foot curls in a perfect cross for that man again, Milosevic, who powers an unstoppable header under Canzaires from 10 yards out. Salgado, the Spanish right-back, was way off the pace after picking up a knock. 35 Spain are enjoying a lot of possession. A free kick is won on the left, near the corner flag. Guardiola to take. A lazy cross is floated in and Kralj claims with aplomb. 37 Stojkovic and Mendieta are having a personal tussle all over the pitch, off the ball. 39 GOAL! Yugoslavia 1 - 1 Spain We've got a real game on here. A reckless tackle by Jokanovic turns possession over to Spain in the form of a free kick. Guardiola finds Raul just outside the area.

About 300 buildings were burned down or otherwise destroyed.</p> <p>He said it was one of the worst incidents in the 18 months of sectarian fighting in the region. Church groups said \"very many\" Christian women and children had been put on trucks and taken away.

Very many women and children who were not killed were forced to get on to trucks and were taken away. Others managed to flee into the forest.\"</p> <p>No local Muslim leader was willing to comment on the attack, and the army spokesman, Major Puguh, could not say where the captives had been taken or whether they were still alive.</p> <p>Soldiers arrived after about an hour and were attacked while trying to restore order.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of militant Muslims fighting a holy war on the Indonesian spice islands killed more than 100 people and destroyed most of a Christian village on Monday morning, it was reported yesterday. An army spokesman in the Molucca islands said 114 people were killed and 70 injured in the dawn raid on Duma, on Halmahera. About 300 buildings were burned down or otherwise destroyed. He said it was one of the worst incidents in the 18 months of sectarian fighting in the region. Church groups said \"very many\" Christian women and children had been put on trucks and taken away. At least 500 were involved in the attack, they added. The Rev Jerda Djawa of the Halmahera Gospel Church in Tobelo said that on two-way radio \"we heard bombs going off and shooting for two hours non-stop\". A church sheltering at least 200 people was bombed and burned down, he said. \"They were attacked with petrol bombs, guns, bows and arrows and machetes. \"Many were killed. Very many women and children who were not killed were forced to get on to trucks and were taken away. Others managed to flee into the forest.\" No local Muslim leader was willing to comment on the attack, and the army spokesman, Major Puguh, could not say where the captives had been taken or whether they were still alive. Soldiers arrived after about an hour and were attacked while trying to restore order. Muslim fighters were killed by Christians defending themselves and soldiers driving them away. The attackers were mostly members of Liskar Jihad, a group from western Indonesia who have declared a holy war against the Christians in the Moluccas, one of the few places in predominantly Muslim Indonesia where Christians are in the majority. Laskar Jihad began its offensive in Halmahera about six weeks ago. Its six big attacks have followed the same pattern: dawn assaults from several directions at once. The regional governor, Saleh Latuconsina, says the group appears to be \"connected to some political elite\" in Jakarta, because the authorities have not prevented its members travelling to the Moluccas. Mr Djawa accused the army of siding with the Muslims on Monday. \"The army had been patrolling the boundary between the Christian area and the Muslim base following attacks in the last few weeks,\" he said. \"If they were really neutral then the Muslims would not have been able to reach the Christian area.\" Similar accusations have been made by both sides throughout the conflict, which has claimed several thousand lives. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the Moluccas and tens of thousands are sheltering in camps in the region.

Early favourite Infogrames is understood to have looked at buying Eidos and possibly driving a three way merger with <a href=\"http://www.activision.com\">Activision</a> of the US but decided against it. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\">Microsoft</a>, which is said to be looking for content ahead of the launch of its own X-box games console, denied an interest. Gameplay, the games portal, is also believed to have contemplated a bid but is no longer interested. </p> <p>Eidos was forced to admit that it was \"in the early stages of discussions which may or may not lead to an offer\" after a sharp rise in its share price. Chief operating officer Mike McGarvey said only last week that the company did not favour a merger at this time and it is unclear if any offer will materialise. </p> <p>Nevertheless Eidos shares closed up 27% at 544p on the news, valuing the company at \u00a3534m. Analysts believe any offer would have to be pitched at about 750p per share with a large proportion of cash. </p> <p>Eidos was one of the star performers on the stock market last year, largely thanks to the success of Tomb Raider and its heroine Lara Croft, and became Europe's first \u00a31bn computer games company. </p> <p>The shares have slumped following a series of profit warnings amid a general downturn in the computer games market as consumers postpone buying games until new consoles have been introduced. The allure of Lara is also said to be waning. At the end of last month the shares traded as low as 250p, compared to a high of \u00a313.20 in December. </p> <p>Analysts cited <a href=\"http://www.infogrames.com\">Infogrames</a> as the likeliest bidder. It recently issued 350m euros (\u00a3222m) worth of convertible bonds, has a record of expanding aggressively through acquisition and is keen to expand its presence in Britain. Sources close to Infogrames indicated that talks had taken place but the French company was no longer in dialogue with Eidos. </p> <p>Microsoft, which is said to have been targeting one of the largest Japanese publishers, ruled itself out of the running. Analysts said Havas was the most likely remaining bidder. </p> <p>\"Eidos would make a complementary fit for Havas,\" said Nick Gibson, analyst at Durlacher. \"Havas is very PC driven and lacks a console focus. It also needs a greater presence in the European games development market. Eidos with its exposure to a variety of delivery platforms fulfils those criteria.\" </p> <p>Last week, Eidos warned for the third time this year of tough trading conditions. It posted an operating loss for the year to March 31 of \u00a326.8m compared to an operating profit of \u00a339.2m in the previous year. </p> <p>However, analysts say the company has a solid list of upcoming releases, including worldwide publishing rights to <a href=\"http://www.playstation.com\">Sony's PlayStation</a> and PC versions of the animated feature film Chicken Run. They add that the computer games industry is at the bottom of a regular cycle and Eidos's fortunes should improve once faster consoles and Microsoft's new machine start to go on sale from the end of this year.</p>",

Nevertheless Eidos shares closed up 27% at 544p on the news, valuing the company at \u00a3534m. Analysts believe any offer would have to be pitched at about 750p per share with a large proportion of cash. Eidos was one of the star performers on the stock market last year, largely thanks to the success of Tomb Raider and its heroine Lara Croft, and became Europe's first \u00a31bn computer games company. The shares have slumped following a series of profit warnings amid a general downturn in the computer games market as consumers postpone buying games until new consoles have been introduced. The allure of Lara is also said to be waning. At the end of last month the shares traded as low as 250p, compared to a high of \u00a313.20 in December. Analysts cited Infogrames as the likeliest bidder. It recently issued 350m euros (\u00a3222m) worth of convertible bonds, has a record of expanding aggressively through acquisition and is keen to expand its presence in Britain. Sources close to Infogrames indicated that talks had taken place but the French company was no longer in dialogue with Eidos. Microsoft, which is said to have been targeting one of the largest Japanese publishers, ruled itself out of the running. Analysts said Havas was the most likely remaining bidder. \"Eidos would make a complementary fit for Havas,\" said Nick Gibson, analyst at Durlacher. \"Havas is very PC driven and lacks a console focus. It also needs a greater presence in the European games development market. Eidos with its exposure to a variety of delivery platforms fulfils those criteria.\" Last week, Eidos warned for the third time this year of tough trading conditions. It posted an operating loss for the year to March 31 of \u00a326.8m compared to an operating profit of \u00a339.2m in the previous year. However, analysts say the company has a solid list of upcoming releases, including worldwide publishing rights to Sony's PlayStation and PC versions of the animated feature film Chicken Run. They add that the computer games industry is at the bottom of a regular cycle and Eidos's fortunes should improve once faster consoles and Microsoft's new machine start to go on sale from the end of this year.",

The IRC-Stages \"worm,\" or virus, which replicates itself and sends out multiple emails does not damage computer files but could clog email systems, the United States government's National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) insisted yesterday. Although the virus has been circulating for nearly a month, the NIPC and anti-virus software companies upgraded their assessment of the virus to to high-risk, based on the number of samples received. The NIPC said it and the FBI were launching inquiries into the new virus. The government-sponsored agency, Computer Emergency Response, said thousands of computers or systems were likely to have been affected. Another company, Trend Micro, said the new virus could \"easily fool the user into believing it is an innocent text file because the extension is not shown and the file assumes the icon of a text file\". The email generally has the title \"life Stages\" \"funny\" or \"jokes\", and might add either \"Fw:\" to the beginning or \"text\" to the end of the subject. Resembling a harmless text file, the so-called Stages virus has infected systems at corporations from Asia to Australia to the US, including the cable network, CNN. The virus does not harm computer files. Instead it replicates itself, sending a copy to every user listed in the infected computer's address book, behaving similarly to the so-called Love Bug virus which clogged many email systems in May. Stages uses Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express email programs to spread. It can also infect systems via chat rooms or AOL's instant messaging software. The email message contains \"funny\", \"life stages\" or \"jokes\" in the subject line. The text of the message reads \"the male and female stages of life,\" with an attachment, \"life-stages.txt\" or \"life-stages.txt.shs.\" The attachment contains a joke about advancing age. The Hong Kong government has warned domestic computer users not to open emails containing such messages.",

The Lords voted to reject a Liberal Democrat amendment proposing to exempt journalists from the bill's requirement to notify the police of any information they receive about potential terrorist acts. Lib Dem frontbencher Lord Goodhart QC told peers the provision would inhibit journalistic investigations into the source of terrorist funds and would be an attack on the right of journalists to protect their sources. He said: \"We regard this bill, insofar as it applies to journalists, as being a serious infringement of freedom of speech and a serious infringement of the freedom of the press.\" But Cabinet Office minister Lord Falconer countered that journalists had a \"degree of responsibility to society\", and that the Lib Dem amendment would create a \"potential loophole\" in the bill. The amendment was rejected by 145 votes to 65. Peers did, however, agree various government amendments aimed at extending the anti-terrorism legislation, including action to counter cyber-terrorism. The Lords voted to extend the definition of terrorism to include the use or threat of action \"designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system\". Such action would be covered under the bill if it was done for political, religious or ideological purposes and if it aimed to influence government or intimidate the public. The bill was also amended to allow such offences in Northern Ireland, under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, to be heard in non-jury Diplock courts. Lord Cope, a former Tory Northern Ireland minister, said: \"Financial rackets involved in computers and so on can be just as damaging and just as much of a weapon in the hands of the terrorists in Northern Ireland as bombs and guns are.\" Lord Goodhart, for the Lib Dems, welcomed the changes as an improvement but warned that his party would seek further changes at the bill's third reading. Pressed by Tory peer Lady Blatch on whether the new definition of terrorism could include threats by animal rights protesters to staff and shareholders of the Huntingdon Life Sciences Company, Lord Bach indicated that it could. The minister said: \"Whether it's covered by this legislation depends on the nature of the attack, obviously. Certainly, if serious violence were used and the public was put in fear and the motivation was religious, political or ideological, it could be caught by the bill.\"",

Mr Zhu said that the Taiwan issue was entirely a Chinese affair. Talks with Mr Chen could only take place if he accepted that \"there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it\". Mr Chen's is regarded with deep suspicion by Beijing because he represents the pro-independence Democratic Progressive party, though he carefully avoided calling for independence both in his campaign and after being elected in March. During his inauguration speech he gave a pledge not to declare the island independent during his term of office as long as China does not take military action. Mr Chen repeated yesterday that he was prepared to agree on a loose definition of Beijing's \"one China\" principle as long as it was \"acceptable to both sides\". Calling for \"wisdom and creativity\", he effectively proposed that they should fudge the issue.

He also offered to support China's bid to host the 2008 Olympics and said that Taiwan could co-host some events. While hailing the success of the Korean summit, and attempting to claim some of the credit for diplomatic moves to encourage it, Beijing insists that there is no parallel between a divided Korea and a divided China. Mr Jiang is said to have given advice to the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, during his visit to Beijing shortly before the summit, on how to combine an open-door policy towards the outside world with maintaining tight political control at home. To Beijing, which likes to think that the \"Chinese model\" is relevant to Korea, the idea that the \"Korean model\" might be relevant to China is offensive. Many ordinary Chinese would like some of the spirit with which the two Korean leaders embraced to be transferred to the edgy relationship across the Taiwan straits. But objective Asian opinion concedes that the two situations are very different. \"The two Koreas do not have a problem of whether there is one Korea or whether they are Korean,\" says Chang King-yuh, a former China policy-maker in Taiwan. \"I would say that the likelihood of a summit across the straits is very slim.\" Observers in Seoul last week were struck by the strength of nationalist sentiment across the 39th parallel.

      "bodyText": "The BBC was paralysed by a massive power cut last night - hours before it was due to screen exclusive coverage of England's crunch Euro 2000 match. The power cut at Television Centre also affected other parts of Shepherd's Bush and Acton in west London. The Six O'Clock News on BBC1 went off air, and BBC News 24 was also struck as well as Radio 4. Emergency generators were switched on but they also failed. The gap left by normal BBC transmission was filled by UK Today regional programmes until 7pm. Thousands of staff were evacuated from the building because the fire alarms were disabled by the power failure. Transmission of the football was switched to Birmingham and live coverage continued as normal. The news teams remained after the main power failed at 5.30pm. Emergency generators kicked in but lights and computers were not on full power and finally gave up at 6.20pm. A spokeswoman said news journalists had been dispersed to Millbank studios in south London and to Birmingham. Last night a BBC worker said: \"All of a sudden the lights, computers and air conditioning failed. All the top news people were standing around looking ashen faced.\" The power failure also blacked out around 20,000 homes as well as paralysing traffic lights. Hammersmith hospital switched to emergency generators. A London Electricity spokesman said the fault was traced to a substation in Acton.",

Detectives conducting a manslaughter investigation were last night continuing to question the driver of the Dutch-registered vehicle in which the bodies of 54 men and four women, all in their 20s, were discovered at midnight on Sunday. Two young men who survived the ordeal are still being treated in hospital for the effects of the intense heat in the lorry's refrigeration unit, which was switched off as temperatures soared outside. They have indicated to officers that the doomed human cargo was from the south China coastal province of Fujian, and were yesterday being questioned further through an interpreter. None of the victims' relatives have yet approached police, who have appealed for help identifying them. Detective Superintendent Dennis McGookin, the senior investigating officer, said at a dockside press conference yesterday: \"The main lines of inquiry are to identify these people and try to establish exactly what happened, to try to contact the families and loved ones of these people. \"Despite the fact that they come from the other side of the world we are determined to carry out a thorough and efficient investigation and those responsible for the deaths of these young people will be brought to justice. \"It may be that there could be relatives living in this country and I would make an appeal to the Chinese community that if anyone is concerned that one of the victims may be one of their loved ones, I would ask them to contact the casualty bureau where they can speak to people in Chinese dialect.\" \"We have got to remember that these young people died a horrifying death and we need to find their families.\" He continued: \"Two young men survived this horrific ordeal and both of them are still in hospital. Both are recovering under medical attention. \"These two young men are vital to our investigation and we will have to look after all of their needs.\" Three Dutch police officers are in Britain assisting as English officers interview the driver, a Dutch national, who is being held at a police station in Kent. Police have authority to hold him until 6pm today. Mr McGookin refused to confirm the identity of the driver and would not say whether he had been cooperating. He said police in Beijing had been \"very supportive\". A Chinese embassy spokeswoman said yesterday that police had confirmed to them that the two survivors are from China and that consular officials had travelled to Dover to assist the detectives. It was not known if the officials would be speaking to the survivors. The spokeswoman said: \"The Chinese government is shocked at this tragedy.

The examinations of the bodies are expected to continue into today. More than 60 police officers and forensic experts are working on the inquiry and DNA samples and fingerprints have been taken from the bodies to help confirm their identities. A vigil was due to be held last night at the bay on Dover's Eastern Docks where the white Mercedes lorry was searched. The Rev Norman Setchell, one of Dover's port chaplains, said many in the town wanted to focus attention on the human tragedy. The United Reformed Church minister said he had spoken to ambulance workers called to the docks who described having to prise dead bodies apart. Worshippers from Dover's Christian churches who have volunteered to help refugees and asylum seekers in the town are expected to attend, along with port workers. Mr Setchell, who is chairman of the Asylum Seekers Support Group, said: \"We are reflecting really on the fact that this is suffering humanity and not just people labelled as refugees or asylum seekers. \"People have been phoning me and feeling that with all the conversation to do with either political things, or financial things or illegal trafficking, we shouldn't forget this is one of many painful things that are going on. \"It is a brutal shocking event in the midst of lots of other horrendous stories that we hear from people travelling here from other parts of the world seeking asylum or seeking justice or seeking a better life.\" Anyone who fears one of their relatives may be among the dead are asked to contact the Kent police casualty bureaux on 0645 441551.",

It has everything the baseball fan could want - except a decent team. Even the church next door exhorts the passing faithful to pray for the Tigers. </p> <p>Mr Archer could use a prayer or two, as well. A Democrat now into his second stint at city hall, he turned down a place in the Clinton cabinet in his determination to add Detroit to the list of smokestack US cities which have shrugged off years of decline and turned themselves round. Detroit may not be as far along as the likes of Cleveland or Philadelphia but Mr Archer is determined to get it there. </p> <p>With the fervour of a conviction politician he shrugs off suggestions that in the era of the new economy the US's premier industrial city - his description - may struggle to cope. He says there is still a lot to do but Detroit is on the way. Detroit's partnership between public and private sector will be a winner. </p> <p>Since 1994 he calculates some $12bn (\u00a38bn) has been invested in the city. Others, he says, put the figure much higher. The debt-rating agencies used to have Detroit's bonds on the \"non-investment grade\" list. Now the city's paper has the first A rating since 1962. \"We have brought a positive fundamental change in a situation that had been in decline.\" </p> <p>So what if the next census - just completed but not yet published - shows Detroit's population has dropped below 1m. The city won't slide into the river as a result, he says. The big three car makers, General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler on which Detroit's economy still depends are able to take on any challengers. They are investing heavily both on their own plants and with new, local, suppliers. That means good, well paid jobs. Not too long ago unemployment was 16%, now it is down to 5.3% - though that is still above the surrounding areas as well as the national average. </p> <p>Like many another politician faced with a contracting industrial base, the mayor talks hopefully of \"smart Detroit\". For now that means a handful of internet companies moving into the city's downtown office blocks but the mayor hopes for more. A couple of casinos have added to the city's night life - as well as providing several hundred jobs. </p> <p>But the mayor is thinking of the future. Education is a top priority. Mr Archer sees Detroit's future centred on the education of its children. \"Our public schools are going to be able to deliver to business the educated youngsters business needs. They are no longer going to have to spend ungodly amounts of money on training.\" </p> <p>Though the mayor is committed to Detroit he cannot pass up the chance of a party political broadcast on behalf of his friends in Washington. The national economy is in great shape, thanks to the \"excellent domestic policies of president Clinton and vice-president Gore\". But he is quickly back on the Motown theme. </p> <p>\"I'm very pleased with where we are and, more importantly, where we are going,\" he says. \"There's an excitement about the city.\" </p> <p>Parts of Woodward Avenue back up the mayor's contention. Around the baseball stadium cluster a selection of the city's theatres - Detroit boasts more theatre seats than any US city except New York - alongside libraries in neo-classical stone finery as well as galleries offering anything from Van Gogh to African modern. For those for whom art comes on a plate there are swanky restaurants where you can dine in style for $200 a head. </p> <p>Further along parts of Wayne County University stand alongside a colour-coded veterans facility which would make even the avant garde designers of Paris's La Defense blink. In neat counterpoint is a stand of 1930s skyscrapers built as a lasting testimony to Detroit's economic power. </p> <p><strong> Unhappy reminders</strong><br> </p> <p>But in between the architectural signposts of the city's pomp and circumstance are other, unhappier, reminders that Detroit's is a mixed heritage and that the mayor still has a huge task. Small low-rise factories stand apparently abandoned, their landmark water towers looming over them like giant rusting spiders. It was a city that was once home to almost 2m people. Now it is half that. In poorer neighbourhoods the signs of blight are everywhere. Houses built in a hurry when Detroit was a boom town at the beginning of the century are showing their age. Others, abandoned, are fire marked and tottering. The city's infrastructure is hardly in an encouraging condition. Motor city's roads don't bear thinking about. More than 60% of the city's housing was built before 1950. There is little public transport. </p> <p>Yet Mayor Archer is a persuasive force. The message to business is simple. \"If you want to make money you should come to Detroit.\" But so far he had been operating against the background of a growing US economy and friends in the White House.

It's a nondescript two storey red brick flat above a bicycle repair shop, and pot plants crowd homely window sills which look down on to a busy road in this rather swanky suburb of the city. A Sunday school sits directly opposite while a small town Dutch church nestles nearby. A local cafe owner, shocked by the affair, tells a story of a god fearing family which attends a church in a nearby suburb at least twice every Sunday. Arjan van der Spek's father is a quiet and gentle man called Wout, who works in the sprawling bike shop to make ends meet. But his son, according to locals, has never been able to hold down a job for long because boredom always becomes too much for him. Known as Arie, the 24-year-old worked on a local farm as boy. Little is known about his older brother or his younger sister, Erika, who is thought to be 17. His mother has already told the local press that she does not believe her son is guilty. Her son, she maintains, is the victim of an elaborate criminal organisation which has appropriated his address and his passport for the sake of one illegal smuggling operation.

SSRA chairman Sir Alastair Morton said: \"Our guiding principle is to improve service, not to introduce change for change's sake. \"What we are proposing is a map that will revitalise the network, with franchise areas designed to relate better to each other and to provide improved accessibility for passengers.\" The changes are announced as the SSRA copes with the replacement of the 18 short-term franchises existing under the current rail map. \u0095 Fiat's restructuring took another step yesterday when it sold control of its rolling stock business to French industrial combine Alstom, writes Mark Milner . The sale of the 51% stake is likely to be followed by acquisitions in other areas. Under the deal Fiat receives euro360m (\u00a3228m), including debt, for the 51% stake. Last year the rail business had earnings of euro375m, less than 10% of the group total.",

Leo, there's no place in this column for that sort of tawdry log-rolling (Boycs, 350pp, \u00a316.99, \"A fascinating book\" - the Daily Mail). \u0095We all know that the United States' economy dominates the rest of the world - but would you believe that the head of research at the World Bank is Mr Dollar?",

Bad though it seems, their performance was not as bad as Labour's in 1983. John Major still managed 31%; Michael Foot emerged with just 28%. But when it came to seats, Major was far worse off - just 165 to Foot's 209.</p> <p>There are two reasons for this. First, Tory support fell more where the party was strongest (the opposite of what happened to Labour in 1983). Second, Labour and Liberal Democrat voters were willing to switch tactically to whichever opposition party was best capable of defeating the local Tory. As a result, the Tories lost 43 more seats than the swingometer would have predicted.</p> <p>If Labour is to win the next election on a small lead, these two patterns need to remain in place. And the result in the Romsey byelection last month has led many to speculate that this is precisely what will happen.</p> <p>But in truth Romsey seems to be atypical. In the council elections across England, anti-Tory tactical voting was on the decline. The rise in the Lib Dem vote (and the fall in Labour's) was above average in wards Labour was defending against the Tories. Labour's vote fell by less than the average - and the Lib Dems also lost ground - only where the Tories and the Lib Dems shared the top two places.</p> <p>At the same time, the Tories gained ground most where they could profit - that is to say, where they started off first or second. William Hague's recent tactics have been criticised because they appear designed simply to appeal to his party's traditional heartlands. But reconnecting with the Tory party's heartlands was one of the major tasks Major bequeathed him. The impact of these two patterns on Labour's local election performance was dramatic. Labour lost up to twice as many seats as it would have done if the swingometer had been working. And the effect could be equally dramatic in a general election.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that Labour never does very well in local elections, last month's results suggested Labour might have a two- to three-point lead if a general election were called now - very similar to the figure recently produced by Mori. As the chart shows, if this happened and the swingometer worked, Labour would still have an overall majority of 55. But if the variation found in the local elections were repeated, such a lead would leave Labour nine short of a majority - and dependent on the support of the Lib Dems to remain in office in some sort of coalition. In short, a small lead would not be enough to give a secure second term.</p> <p>But why should we take any notice of the local elections? After all, there was yet another record low turnout, whereas in the parliamentary by-election in Romsey more than half the electorate voted. There is one simple reason. The two patterns that led to the Tory disaster of 1997 were apparent in every round of local elections between 1993 and 1996. Little noticed by commentators at the time, those local elections were the writing on the wall for the Tories. It would be unwise to ignore the message this time too.</p> <p>Not that a repeat of the local election pattern is inevitable. How much tactical switching there is between Labour and the Lib Dems will depend in part at least on how much difference voters think there is between the two parties.

If Tony Blair were to reaffirm the pledge, relations might warm up once again. If he decided to scrap the referendum, cooperation would probably die.</p> <p>So Labour faces a paradox. First past the post would still deliver a second term even if the party only has a narrow victory. But that will only happen if Labour continues to benefit from tactical switching.

      "bodyText": "A postmaster fought off a robber armed with a sawn-off shotgun yesterday, stabbing him to death and forcing the gang of three robbers to flee empty handed. The man who died was one of three men with sawn-off shotguns who tried to steal thousands of pounds in cash from the post office in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster, Worcestershire. He was later found dying 10 miles away in the parked getaway car with several stab wounds to his upper body. The gang arrived at the post office in a blue Ford Sierra at about 10am yesterday. One of the men walked into the shop and threatened Richard Watkins, 50, with a single-barrelled shotgun. Mr Watkins was alone behind the counter in the family-run store when the man burst in and demanded cash. The robber, who has not been named, struggled with Mr Watkins, during which he hit the postmaster on the head with the butt of his gun. Mr Watkins, who is 6ft 4in tall and of stocky build, was able to snatch the shotgun from the robber in the struggle and grab a knife used for cutting open newspaper bundles. Police said the robber was stabbed several times on the upper part of his body. When their accomplice failed to appear, one of the two remaining gang members went into the post office and helped the injured man escape, lifting him into the back of the car and driving away empty handed, leaving the shotgun in the post office. Mr Watkins, who suffered a gash to his head that needed three stitches, immediately called the police. An hour later, West Mercia police received an anonymous 999 call from a telephone box telling them where to find the getaway car. Officers found the seriously injured robber in the vehicle in Forge Lane, in Wallheath, where attempts were made to resuscitate him but he was dead on arrival at Russell's Hall hospital, Stonebridge. Assistant chief constable Peter Neyroud would not say if the gun had been fired but confirmed that the robbers left the scene empty handed. Police appealed for witnesses who might have seen the gang, their blue getaway car or anyone with any information about a black BMW 520i, registration J537 WDA - seen leaving the scene where the blue car was abandoned - to get in contact. West Mercia and West Midlands officers are considering a possible link with a robbery in Halesowen on Monday night in which three masked raiders, armed with a shotgun and a chisel, terrorised store staff and stole \u00a3342. Mr Watkins, who is unmarried and has lived with his sister and elderly mother in the village for many years, was described by police as \"an extremely well respected and well known member of the community\". Last night he was recovering at his brother's home while a police forensic team examined the scene. His sister Sue, who helps run the post office, said: \"Fortunately there weren't any customers in the post office at the time. \"They thought Richard was just going to hand over the money but they picked the wrong man.\"",

      "bodyText": "A huge and costly corruption inquiry into \"Robocop\" Superintendent Ray Mallon, the pioneer of zero tolerance policing in Britain, ended in fiasco last night with the announcement that the man feted by Labour and Conservative leaders will not face criminal charges. There were immediate calls for a public inquiry into the alleged waste of up to \u00a35m on an investigation said by critics to be motivated by petty jealousies, which has seen the former scourge of burglars and violent criminals suspended for 2 years. Labour MP Ashok Kumar, whose Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency saw a big fall in crime, said: \"There have been catastrophic errors in this persecution of a fine police officer.\" He demanded Mr Mallon's immediate reinstatement and an audit of the Operation Lancet investigation, which has been dogged by delays and bungles. Seven other detectives in the \"Robocop\" squad are also understood to have been cleared of using criminal means, including heroin dealing, to get information from the Teesside underworld. But the chief constable of Cleveland, Barry Shaw, said that Mr Mallon and other officers would remain suspended while internal disciplinary proceedings were discussed with the area's police authority. Mr Mallon, whose Middlesbrough police station was used by Tony Blair for Labour's final election photocall, was celebrating privately last night with his wife Carole, 45, and daughters Victoria, 18, and 15-year-old Lois. He said: \"I am naturally delighted that at last my name has been cleared though I do not believe I should ever have been suspended in the first place. \"I want to thank my family and the people of Teesside for their support over the past 2 years which has been of great help.\" His hard-edged drive against all petty crime and anti-social behaviour, drawn from zero tolerance schemes in the United States, has been a powerful influence on changes introduced by the home secretary, Jack Straw. In particular, Mr Straw's insistence in 1998 on crime reduction as a police performance indicator stemmed directly from his pre-election visit to Middlesbrough. Mr Mallon had promised to cut crime by 20% in 18 months, a target he reached in half the time. But the officer's high profile caused resentment at key levels in the Cleveland force which - his supporters say - triggered Operation Lancet. He was allegedly seen as a glory hunter and there was resentment at his view that better brains were more important to the police than extra resources and manpower. Mr Mallon was suspended on December 1, 1997, seven months after posing with Mr Blair, his wife Cherie and the actress Helen Mirren, a Labour supporter. Cleveland's assistant chief constable, Robert Turnbull, said that the superintendent and seven CID colleagues were accused of \"alleged activity that could be construed as criminal\". Forty frontline officers were initially drafted into the inquiry which was eventually to enlist supervisors from four other police forces. It centred on claims that the Robocop drive was as ruthless with legal niceties as it was with criminals - a vulnerable area given the inevitable wiles of detectives trying to tease information from hardened offenders. The allegations, primarily of heroin-for-grassing deals, were based on evidence from convicted criminals which also fingered an astonishing 600 other officers, all of whom were given formal notice that they could face investigation. Mr Mallon has always vigorously denied any wrongdoing and last year challenged Operation Lancet's managers to \"put up or shut up\" as their hunt for evidence began to appear increasingly futile. He has been backed throughout by outraged public opinion in Cleveland and police colleagues, with 30,000 people signing a reinstatement petition within months and BBC Radio Cleveland listeners voting him Man of the Year, beating Mr Blair. The Cleveland branch of the Superintendents' Association also called early on for a public inquiry. The inquiry bill will be met by council taxpayers in Cleveland, with Operation Lancet already been blamed for a 30% rise in the police precept. And crime rates have risen to pre-Mallon levels. Timetable 1996 Mallon appointed to Middlesbrough, Cleveland's crime hotspot. Zero tolerance wins attention. Crime falls 20% in nine months October 1997 Two Middlesbrough detectives suspended over alleged trade of heroin for information on crime December 1997 Mallon suspended for alleged failure to act on heroin allegations March 1998 Five more detectives suspended, 58 under investigation June 2000 crown prosecution service rejects all allegations of criminal behaviour by Mallon",

The Conservative leader is keen to take on board welfare theories promoted by Marvin Olasky, the Christian guru whose ideas influenced Republican presidential candidate George W Bush. Among the ideas influencing Mr Hague are moves to shift help for the poor away from state welfare and towards local faith-based organisations which the Tory leader argues can better help people \"tackle problems in their own way\". Professor Olasky has come under fire in the US for some of his proposals, amid claims that his view of the poor is a rightwing caricature of irresponsible teenage mothers, able-bodied but workshy men and drunks and addicts unwilling to tackle addiction. In a 1995 interview, he said the poor in the US were the \"victims and perpetrators\" of illegitimacy, \"alienation and loneliness; but they are not suffering from thirst, hunger or nakedness, except by choice, or insanity or parental abuse\". Policies put forward by Prof Olasky include supporting welfare programmes which help the \"respectable poor\", or bring those in need back to a fold defined in Christian terms. Government-run assistance is counter-productive, he argues, because only charity that is directly personal, requires the able bodied to work and includes explicit spiritual counselling can succeed. The visit is certain to lead to accusations that Mr Hague is searching for inspiration from the US religious right.

      "body": "<p>When hundreds of Scottish children went to school yesterday morning they were met at the gates by adults handing out reading material. It was not, however, the sort of literature most parents would be happy to have their kids peruse over playtime snacks.</p> <p>The cover appeared innocuous enough: a cosy infantile rendition of a house with an over-large sun shining down from above, mummy and toddler stand guard in the foreground. Only the \"why is abortion wrong?\" title, in faux crayon, hints at what is to come.</p> <p>Turn the page and the cartoons continue, but the language becomes altogether more adult. There's the passage on how terminations are performed, which describes the woman's cervix being dilated before \"the child is cut to pieces with the curette knife\". Or, if the pupil's stomach is strong enough to read on, they can be told that in an evacuation \"the baby is manually crushed so he can fit through the cervix... a pliers-like instrument is used to crush the skull, legs and arms\".</p> <p>Distributing 50,000 of these leaflets to Scottish schoolchildren is the latest US-style tactic employed by the militant anti-abortion group Precious Life. The graphic confrontation of their message is nothing new - when they first formed in Scotland last autumn they managed to put off clients of an Edinburgh Brook centre to such an extent that it had to close for the day - but this is the first time Precious Life has taken its propaganda to the school gate.</p> <p>And there is more to come. Now it has laid its foundations in Scotland - the first, serious, militant anti-abortion group on the British mainland - the group plans to travel south. A branch in Liverpool is just about established; on Saturday leaders of the Scottish HQ are off to London to meet activists there. It will be, according to Jim Dowson, the group's de facto leader, the start of a militant, UK-wide campaign.</p> <p>Dowson has a long association with militancy. There's his defining trio of anti-Catholicism, loyalism and Orangeism - even the grand secretary of the Orange Lodge of Scotland, which has entirely dissociated itself from him, says he is a \"zealot\". He talks in the fiery vocabulary of a fanatic - abortion is akin to the holocaust, family planning officials are officers of the Gestapo.</p> <p>Already Dowson's group, which he claims numbers 1200, regularly pickets family planning centres. Mostly male, middle-aged men, they stand in lines chanting slogans and bearing placards featuring aborted foetuses. The tactics yield an ironic result. \"We find the numbers visiting our centres go up when these people protest; all the noisy chanting lets people know where we are,\" says Juliet Hillier of Brook.</p> <p>The next logical step in Precious Life's campaign would be to picket clinics where terminations are performed, harassing doctors in the style so common in the United States. The problem is that abortion clinics don't really exist in Britain in the way they do in the US. \"He would have to stand outside gynaecology wards in mainstream hospitals, which even to him must seem a bit futile,\" says Ann Marie McKay, director of the Family Planning Association Scotland.</p> <p>But Dowson says he is prepared to do that, and he has other, more direct, plans. He has vowed to post on the internet the names and addresses of doctors who perform terminations; picketing the houses of surgeons, nurses and councillors will follow.</p> <p>If you are involved in an industry where you are killing human beings you should be quite open about it. If doctors are not ashamed of what they do they shouldn't be worried about people confronting them,\" he says. Dowson has made such threats before. Shortly before Christmas, he announced he planned to step up his campaign, targeting pro-choice politicians and family-planning workers. Many senior figures admitted to being intimidated. \"He is not prepared to allow anyone else to have their opinion,\" says McKay.</p> <p>Those who know Dowson say his current foes have cause for concern. Perhaps that is why Scottish health minister Susan Deacon has come down hard on him. She warned militant anti-abortion groups to \"back off\" or face legal action. Until yesterday, the government's combative stand appeared to be working. Aside from bi-weekly picketing of the pregnancy advisory clinics, the group was largely quiet. Then came the leafleting campaign mounted by 46 volunteers in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Stirling. Edinburgh is to get its turn today.</p> <p>The impetus for the action is a Family Planning Association leaflet entitled \"Abortion just so you know\". Dowson claims it has been distributed to every school in Scotland. It has not: the pamphlet is for sale to teachers who want to include it in their sex education curriculum. \"The pamphlet reduces the moral fabric of our society by enticing children into believing that abortion is nothing,\" he says. \"We have a right to make sure they get the true facts.\"</p> <p>So yesterday morning and afternoon, and again today, secondary school pupils, regardless of age or sex, were given the leaflets. Teachers provided the first reaction. \"Parents and teachers would agree that their youngsters should be able to go to school without being accosted by pressure groups. This is wholly inappropriate conduct,\" said Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the EIS, Scotland's biggest teaching union.</p> <p>\"The young people they are approaching could be vulnerable, they could have had an abortion. That may be of no concern to them, but I find the prospect deeply worrying,\" says McKay.</p> <p>But no matter what the criticism, Dowson plans to expand his activities in a militant campaign. He is now the public face of Precious Life and is unashamed of his extremism. \"Gassing Jews in the 30s and 40s was legal, that doesn't mean it was right.

      "bodyText": "When hundreds of Scottish children went to school yesterday morning they were met at the gates by adults handing out reading material. It was not, however, the sort of literature most parents would be happy to have their kids peruse over playtime snacks. The cover appeared innocuous enough: a cosy infantile rendition of a house with an over-large sun shining down from above, mummy and toddler stand guard in the foreground. Only the \"why is abortion wrong?\" title, in faux crayon, hints at what is to come. Turn the page and the cartoons continue, but the language becomes altogether more adult. There's the passage on how terminations are performed, which describes the woman's cervix being dilated before \"the child is cut to pieces with the curette knife\". Or, if the pupil's stomach is strong enough to read on, they can be told that in an evacuation \"the baby is manually crushed so he can fit through the cervix... a pliers-like instrument is used to crush the skull, legs and arms\". Distributing 50,000 of these leaflets to Scottish schoolchildren is the latest US-style tactic employed by the militant anti-abortion group Precious Life. The graphic confrontation of their message is nothing new - when they first formed in Scotland last autumn they managed to put off clients of an Edinburgh Brook centre to such an extent that it had to close for the day - but this is the first time Precious Life has taken its propaganda to the school gate. And there is more to come. Now it has laid its foundations in Scotland - the first, serious, militant anti-abortion group on the British mainland - the group plans to travel south. A branch in Liverpool is just about established; on Saturday leaders of the Scottish HQ are off to London to meet activists there. It will be, according to Jim Dowson, the group's de facto leader, the start of a militant, UK-wide campaign. Dowson has a long association with militancy. There's his defining trio of anti-Catholicism, loyalism and Orangeism - even the grand secretary of the Orange Lodge of Scotland, which has entirely dissociated itself from him, says he is a \"zealot\". He talks in the fiery vocabulary of a fanatic - abortion is akin to the holocaust, family planning officials are officers of the Gestapo. Already Dowson's group, which he claims numbers 1200, regularly pickets family planning centres. Mostly male, middle-aged men, they stand in lines chanting slogans and bearing placards featuring aborted foetuses. The tactics yield an ironic result. \"We find the numbers visiting our centres go up when these people protest; all the noisy chanting lets people know where we are,\" says Juliet Hillier of Brook. The next logical step in Precious Life's campaign would be to picket clinics where terminations are performed, harassing doctors in the style so common in the United States. The problem is that abortion clinics don't really exist in Britain in the way they do in the US. \"He would have to stand outside gynaecology wards in mainstream hospitals, which even to him must seem a bit futile,\" says Ann Marie McKay, director of the Family Planning Association Scotland. But Dowson says he is prepared to do that, and he has other, more direct, plans. He has vowed to post on the internet the names and addresses of doctors who perform terminations; picketing the houses of surgeons, nurses and councillors will follow. If you are involved in an industry where you are killing human beings you should be quite open about it. If doctors are not ashamed of what they do they shouldn't be worried about people confronting them,\" he says. Dowson has made such threats before. Shortly before Christmas, he announced he planned to step up his campaign, targeting pro-choice politicians and family-planning workers. Many senior figures admitted to being intimidated. \"He is not prepared to allow anyone else to have their opinion,\" says McKay. Those who know Dowson say his current foes have cause for concern. Perhaps that is why Scottish health minister Susan Deacon has come down hard on him. She warned militant anti-abortion groups to \"back off\" or face legal action. Until yesterday, the government's combative stand appeared to be working. Aside from bi-weekly picketing of the pregnancy advisory clinics, the group was largely quiet. Then came the leafleting campaign mounted by 46 volunteers in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Stirling. Edinburgh is to get its turn today. The impetus for the action is a Family Planning Association leaflet entitled \"Abortion just so you know\". Dowson claims it has been distributed to every school in Scotland. It has not: the pamphlet is for sale to teachers who want to include it in their sex education curriculum. \"The pamphlet reduces the moral fabric of our society by enticing children into believing that abortion is nothing,\" he says. \"We have a right to make sure they get the true facts.\" So yesterday morning and afternoon, and again today, secondary school pupils, regardless of age or sex, were given the leaflets. Teachers provided the first reaction. \"Parents and teachers would agree that their youngsters should be able to go to school without being accosted by pressure groups. This is wholly inappropriate conduct,\" said Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the EIS, Scotland's biggest teaching union. \"The young people they are approaching could be vulnerable, they could have had an abortion. That may be of no concern to them, but I find the prospect deeply worrying,\" says McKay. But no matter what the criticism, Dowson plans to expand his activities in a militant campaign. He is now the public face of Precious Life and is unashamed of his extremism. \"Gassing Jews in the 30s and 40s was legal, that doesn't mean it was right. We have to protect our children, by whatever means,\" he says.",

The prime minister's office said yesterday that there would be \"no surrender to Shas\" and that Mr Barak would begin exploring other coalition possibilities, but the show of bravado does not ring true, given the frantic manoeuvring of recent days, and his evident desperation to keep his coalition intact. Without Shas's 17 MPs he cannot make the concessions needed to reach a deal with Yasser Arafat before the Palestinian leader declares an independent state later this year.

Hattersley abuses me in your pages for a story that appeared on the Mirror web site (Comment, June 20). I tried to write a piece about the residual animosity that exists in this country towards Germany. This is not the same as xenophobia, incitement to violence or beating up policemen.</p> <p>I wrote a story about growing up in the shadow of the second world war and what that was like for those of us whose fathers fought in that war. I know that we are all Cappuccino drinkers now, but it is patently absurd to pretend that this country has the same relationship with the Germans as it does with the Swedes or the Chinese.</p> <p>In the piece I said, \"Something inside me has always cringed at the combat metaphors that get wheeled out for football matches,\" and \"I happen to be one of those Englishmen whose stomach turns when he sees all those working-class boys belting out, God Save the Queen\" and \"Football matches - especially football matches against the Hun - are often an excuse for cheap patriotism.\" But your correspondent doesn't quote any of that - apart from one word, the ironic use of \"Hun\" - because it doesn't suit his tabloid-bashing thesis.</p> <p>I also said, \"It is not condoning xenophobia to say that it is perfectly understandable that a nation can bear a lingering animosity towards another nation.\" That animosity exists and I tried to write about it in a way that was infinitely more calm and reasonable than Hattersley's ham-fisted attempt. <br><b>Tony Parsons </b><br> The Mirror</p> <p>\u0095 Hugo Young attributes English football hooliganism to tabloid-induced xenophobia imposed on a people alleged to be historically \"military\" (Comment, June 20). This is hard to reconcile with (a) the popularity of foreign footballers, many black and almost all fluent in English, in our leading clubs; (b) the absence of bad behaviour in Europe by Scottish or Welsh fans, English supporters before 1970 or English/British fans of rugby or any other sports; (c) the centuries-old aversion to a large standing army or to national service which made the English amongst the most peaceful peoples on earth.</p> <p>Football hooliganism occurs uniquely when English clubs or teams play abroad. It is historically the product of post-imperial angst, and media-led consumerism following England's 1970 world cup defeat (by Germans). The ending of empire and a philistine culture of introverted decline has left them a world fit for Charlie Whelan to live in. <br><b>Kenneth O Morgan</b><br>Witney, Oxon</p>",

      "bodyText": "Roy Hattersley is having a very bad Euro 2000. If Roy was a footballer, then he would be the Belgian goalkeeper. Hattersley abuses me in your pages for a story that appeared on the Mirror web site (Comment, June 20). I tried to write a piece about the residual animosity that exists in this country towards Germany. This is not the same as xenophobia, incitement to violence or beating up policemen. I wrote a story about growing up in the shadow of the second world war and what that was like for those of us whose fathers fought in that war. I know that we are all Cappuccino drinkers now, but it is patently absurd to pretend that this country has the same relationship with the Germans as it does with the Swedes or the Chinese. In the piece I said, \"Something inside me has always cringed at the combat metaphors that get wheeled out for football matches,\" and \"I happen to be one of those Englishmen whose stomach turns when he sees all those working-class boys belting out, God Save the Queen\" and \"Football matches - especially football matches against the Hun - are often an excuse for cheap patriotism.\" But your correspondent doesn't quote any of that - apart from one word, the ironic use of \"Hun\" - because it doesn't suit his tabloid-bashing thesis. I also said, \"It is not condoning xenophobia to say that it is perfectly understandable that a nation can bear a lingering animosity towards another nation.\" That animosity exists and I tried to write about it in a way that was infinitely more calm and reasonable than Hattersley's ham-fisted attempt. Tony Parsons The Mirror \u0095 Hugo Young attributes English football hooliganism to tabloid-induced xenophobia imposed on a people alleged to be historically \"military\" (Comment, June 20). This is hard to reconcile with (a) the popularity of foreign footballers, many black and almost all fluent in English, in our leading clubs; (b) the absence of bad behaviour in Europe by Scottish or Welsh fans, English supporters before 1970 or English/British fans of rugby or any other sports; (c) the centuries-old aversion to a large standing army or to national service which made the English amongst the most peaceful peoples on earth. Football hooliganism occurs uniquely when English clubs or teams play abroad. It is historically the product of post-imperial angst, and media-led consumerism following England's 1970 world cup defeat (by Germans). The ending of empire and a philistine culture of introverted decline has left them a world fit for Charlie Whelan to live in. Kenneth O Morgan Witney, Oxon",

      "body": "<p> France has the best health service in the world, while the UK ranks 18th out of 191 and the United States 37th, sandwiched between Costa Rica and Slovenia, according to a highly controversial report from the World Health Organisation. </p> <p>It is the first time the WHO has produced such a league table, which will shame some governments and offend others because of their low ranking and clustering with nations they do not admire. </p> <p>There had been political pressure on the WHO to abandon its radical and ambitious plans to publish the report, but after much soul searching it is understood that the director general, Gro Harlem Brundtland, took the decision a couple of months ago to go ahead and take the flak. </p> <p>The World Health report in previous years has focused on levels of disease, with tables of significant indicators such as life expectancy, fertility and infant mortality in different countries. All the data came from the countries, and was accepted without question, even if there were doubts among officials about the accuracy of the cholera or TB rates. </p> <p>But in the last two to three years, with Dr Brundtland at the helm, the organisation has collected its own figures, made its own analyses and come to its own conclusions. Dr Brundtland believes the WHO should be doing its best to make governments accountable to their people for the health service they provide. </p> <p>\"The main message from this report is that the health and wellbeing of people around the world depend critically on the performance of the health systems that serve them,\" said Dr Brundtland. \"Yet there is wide variation in performance, even among countries with similar levels of income and health expenditure. It is essential for decision-makers to understand the underlying reasons so that system performance, and hence the health of populations, can be improved. </p> <p>\"The difference between a well-performing health system and one that is failing can be measured in death, disability, impoverishment, humiliation and despair,\" she says in the report. </p> <p>\"Dollar for dollar spent on health, many countries are falling short of their performance potential. The result is a large number of preventable deaths and lives stunted by disability. The impact of this failure is born disproportionately by the poor.\" </p> <p>Virtually all countries can do better, says the report, based on estimates for 1997. While the UK does very well in providing healthcare free at the point of access to the entire population, it falls down on inequalities - affluent, middle-class people are more likely to live longer, disease-free lives than those who are worse off. </p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Milburn, was pleased with the UK's ranking. The report \"provides a ringing endorsement of the principles of the NHS - free and fair care for all. The WHO analysis confirms our own analysis of the strengths of the NHS. The report shows we have much to be proud of,\" he said. </p> <p>It also shows, he said, that there is a lot more to do to improve the way the health service responds to the changing needs of the public. \"However, we are not prepared to trade off being fair and free for efficiency and responsiveness to the demands of patients.\" </p> <p>One of the biggest success stories is Oman, placed 8th in the table. In 1970, child mortality was high but government investment has paid off - Oman tops a second table for the way in which expenditure on health succeeds in delivering disease-free life expectancy, above Malta, Italy and France. The UK is 24th; the US 72nd. </p> <p>Money plays a big part in the success of any country in treating its sick, the WHO acknowledges. It suggests that there is a baseline investment of $60 (\u00a339) per head per year, below which healthcare is not going to be adequate. </p> <p>The bottom of the table is dominated by African countries, with war-torn Sierra Leone last. Healthcare systems in some of them are grossly overburdened by Aids. The WHO knows there is little these countries can do to improve their placing, but hopes that donor countries will take note. </p> <p>The WHO freely acknowledges that its league table will not be completely accurate. It compares each country's system to what the experts estimate is the most that could be achieved in that country with the level of resources available. This methodology breaks new ground, but officials believe it is valid and will become more accurate in years to come as better data is accumulated. </p> <p><strong>The WHO findings</strong></p>

      "body": "<p>So who'd have thought it? The human race has been stomping round the planet in imperialistic fashion for centuries now, putting paid to other species. Stands to reason we should get our come-uppance in the end. But it's not lions and tigers and bears who are now wreaking their revenge. It's bugs. And we're not talking caterpillars here. </p> <p>Bacteria and humans have had a tense, but now it turns out symbiotic relationship ever since we evolved to join them. They massively pre-date us on earth. Any scientist will tell you bacteria are the most successful life form on earth, evolving rather more rapidly than we do to meet every challenge. </p> <p>But in the last nanoseconds of the history of the planet, we have discovered their existence, thanks to Louis Pasteur, and decided to take them on. As <strong> Eat Dirt!</strong> (Channel 4, Tuesday) succinctly demonstrated, instead of being satisfied to clear out the real killer bugs that used to slaughter people wholesale like TB, by improving hygiene and water supplies as well as vaccinations, we have gone to war on the whole lot. And some of them, it is claimed, are friend, not foe. </p> <p>The weapons of mass destruction are Domestos, Flash and lately, the programme told us, anti-bacterial handwashes too. There were some wonderful, flesh-crawling old ads from the 50s in the programme, demonstrating the not so subtle pressure on the post-war back-to-the-sink \"housewife\" to eliminate every last germ and prove to the neighbours she wasn't a sloven. </p> <p>But in the war against the hidden enemy, we may be damaging ourselves. As bacteria is chased from the home and infections disappear from childhood, allergies are massively on the rise. Many (though not all) asthma researchers have gradually come round to the hygiene hypothesis - that our immune systems are not getting enough to do - and they are turning on our own internal organs instead. Children become sensitised to pollens and dust. Where are the allergies in infection-ridden parts of Africa, ask the scientists?

      "bodyText": "So who'd have thought it? The human race has been stomping round the planet in imperialistic fashion for centuries now, putting paid to other species. Stands to reason we should get our come-uppance in the end. But it's not lions and tigers and bears who are now wreaking their revenge. It's bugs. And we're not talking caterpillars here. Bacteria and humans have had a tense, but now it turns out symbiotic relationship ever since we evolved to join them. They massively pre-date us on earth. Any scientist will tell you bacteria are the most successful life form on earth, evolving rather more rapidly than we do to meet every challenge. But in the last nanoseconds of the history of the planet, we have discovered their existence, thanks to Louis Pasteur, and decided to take them on. As Eat Dirt! (Channel 4, Tuesday) succinctly demonstrated, instead of being satisfied to clear out the real killer bugs that used to slaughter people wholesale like TB, by improving hygiene and water supplies as well as vaccinations, we have gone to war on the whole lot. And some of them, it is claimed, are friend, not foe. The weapons of mass destruction are Domestos, Flash and lately, the programme told us, anti-bacterial handwashes too. There were some wonderful, flesh-crawling old ads from the 50s in the programme, demonstrating the not so subtle pressure on the post-war back-to-the-sink \"housewife\" to eliminate every last germ and prove to the neighbours she wasn't a sloven. But in the war against the hidden enemy, we may be damaging ourselves. As bacteria is chased from the home and infections disappear from childhood, allergies are massively on the rise. Many (though not all) asthma researchers have gradually come round to the hygiene hypothesis - that our immune systems are not getting enough to do - and they are turning on our own internal organs instead. Children become sensitised to pollens and dust. Where are the allergies in infection-ridden parts of Africa, ask the scientists? Why is it that asthma is not a disease of pollution but of development? Vaccines made from African dirt are now being developed and seem to have helped the breathing problems of adult asthmatics. Some very small early trials show similar injections may have a beneficial effect on multiple sclerosis and skin cancer - in both of which the immune system is damaged. We could be looking towards dirt injections in the early weeks of life alongside diphtheria and whooping cough.

Levity is the name of a vast PVC inflatable, covering 800 square metres, designed by Alan Parkinson after 19th-century anatomical drawings of jellyfish. </p> <p>From the outside it doesn't remotely resemble a jellyfish; I doubt that anything in the natural world comes in quite this combination of red, blue, green, yellow and steely grey. Levity is more like a circus tent that has undergone sinister genetic mutations: it has domes, turrets, teat-like protuberances and a central chamber with inverted teapot spouts. It looms ominously in the centre of what was until recently the Inland Revenue's car park: the Tellytubbies' mothership has landed, and they are after their tax refund. </p> <p>The appeal of Levity is less the outside appearance than the way its insides engulf you - it is an inflatable to wander around, the stomach of a bouncy castle. There is a definite purity to it - after all, there is nothing to look at except air and daylight filtered through translucent plastic. Hidden speakers pump out an ambient soundtrack of sub-aquatic whispers and gurgles - music for manatees. What with the constant rush of air from the pumps that keep the structure aloft, the place has a strangely gastric atmosphere. </p> <p>Levity feels something like a family-outing version of James Turrell, the American artist who captures light and frames it, or hangs it in the air like a vapour. If Turrell deals in the sublime, Levity offers a more accessible \"wow\" factor. The only time the colour here quite achieves the paradoxically vaporous solidity of Turrell's work is when you enter the red dome, and the colour briefly roasts your eyeballs like a hot gas. The effect is only brief, but it is quite unnerving. I found it so addictive that I had to keep retuning my pupils in the green and blue domes, then going back for maximum effect. There is a subtle touch in the central chamber, where the teapot spouts divert the daylight from outside and cast soft coloured glows on to the darkened grey dome: here it is a little bit Anish Kapoor. </p> <p>Levity was only in town for four days, but over a longer period you wonder what social rituals might have evolved around it. People behave differently, slower perhaps, once they take off their shoes and walk inside - not least because the high concentration of oxygen in the pumped air makes them a little spacey. Men in white shirts and braces (Levity is a big draw with the Revenue people) sit cross-legged in the coloured alcoves or slide gently down the glowing walls. A group of young design types spread out picnic-style and hold a business meeting. Several people sprawl in erotic- infantile reverie: one woman curls up with a soft toy, out for the count. </p> <p>This sort of edifice is all metaphors to all people. In a different context - at a festival, say - the prevailing mood would be New Agey and druggy, but pitching camp in the middle of Somerset House's sobriety makes you see the structure in a more pensive architectural light. On a balmy London summer afternoon, Levity is relaxing above all, but it needn't be just that. You might like to rent it for an orgy (the surfaces are wipe-dry, after all) or you could lock someone inside and see how long it took until they cracked. </p> <p>Last week, though, Levity functioned mainly as a balmy playpen-cum-oasis for harassed city dwellers, a reminder that the \"chill-out zone\" now seems to have become the space that Londoners most fervently dream of. The Relaxation Zone at the Millennium Dome or the \"Quiet Clubs\" sketched out by Brian Eno at the Hayward Gallery's current Sonic Boom show are just the start of it. Other cities have cafes where you can lounge all day, but London requires more extreme artifice to block out the urban racket. </p> <p>What I especially like about Levity is its precariousness. The sounds of the outside world are filtered out, but only just: you still hear the odd plane overhead, or a church bell ringing. You lean against the walls, feeling air-filled skin wobble beneath you: it could be, given the teething troubles of the Millennium Bridge, that the wobble is the thrill that Londoners are really crying out for. If you like, there's even a touch of memento mori about the experience: recline and lose yourself in primary-coloured bliss, but remember that there's just a thin PVC membrane between you and the Inland Revenue.

      "body": "<p>Yes it was, as Tony Blair said, something of a triumph for Gordon Brown. He may not wear black tie at the Mansion House, but in his successful battle against the withholding tax on cross-border savings he has proved himself a dear friend of the City of London. He fought hard and, by some accounts, even resisted moves within Whitehall to compromise. Finally, yesterday, the Treasury's recipe became a policy option for the 15.</p> <p>But we must not get carried away. The deal involved nudges and winks about lifting diplomatic sanctions against Austria. It is pretty conditional, too, with a seven-year delay till full implementation. The accord provides for member states to exchange information on financial holdings; but in this \"globalised\" world that can only work if reciprocal arrangements are agreed with non-EU jurisdictions, including Switzerland and eventually the United States. This is potentially a recipe by which progressive government can fight back against tax evasion even in a borderless world. One bonus is ending the cult of bank secrecy - which, among other things, prevented justice for Holocaust survivors for too many years. Yet the Blairite stand would look a lot more coherent if the government's latest statement of proposed rules on taxing offshore corporate accounts were clearer. What happens when Mr Brown's praise of \"tax competition\" is taken literally and companies threaten to vacate the United Kingdom?

He may not wear black tie at the Mansion House, but in his successful battle against the withholding tax on cross-border savings he has proved himself a dear friend of the City of London. He fought hard and, by some accounts, even resisted moves within Whitehall to compromise. Finally, yesterday, the Treasury's recipe became a policy option for the 15. But we must not get carried away. The deal involved nudges and winks about lifting diplomatic sanctions against Austria. It is pretty conditional, too, with a seven-year delay till full implementation. The accord provides for member states to exchange information on financial holdings; but in this \"globalised\" world that can only work if reciprocal arrangements are agreed with non-EU jurisdictions, including Switzerland and eventually the United States. This is potentially a recipe by which progressive government can fight back against tax evasion even in a borderless world. One bonus is ending the cult of bank secrecy - which, among other things, prevented justice for Holocaust survivors for too many years. Yet the Blairite stand would look a lot more coherent if the government's latest statement of proposed rules on taxing offshore corporate accounts were clearer. What happens when Mr Brown's praise of \"tax competition\" is taken literally and companies threaten to vacate the United Kingdom? Step forward Chris Gent of Vodaphone, the man rewarded upfront in telephone numbers for being in the right seat at the right time when the lottery wheel of corporate restructuring turned.

That was a joke: I was worried I was losing you. So what are his chances of being plinthed? Low. The Bede-ites accuse Livingstone of displaying \"a cavalier metropolitan bias\" to the north east's great historian. The latest plan is to put an inverted resin copy of the plinth on the plinth, called Plinth. Not to be confused with: The Vulnerable Beard (Frank Dobson). Most likely to say: \"Thegns ain't what they used to be.\" Least likely to say: \"I can see the London Eye from up here.\"",

About 30,000 Britons work in Saudi Arabia and there are more than 90 UK-Saudi joint venture companies. With a growing, youthful, population and increasing unemployment, the kingdom is keen to encourage foreign investment. Amnesty, which in March published a damning report on human rights practices in Saudi Arabia, argues that violations contribute to social instability and increase the risks affecting investment. Companies which operate in the kingdom are likely to come under scrutiny with regard to the human rights aspects of their operations. In a booklet, Amnesty says: \"Those companies that have an appropriate policy framework in place will be in a strong position to avoid damage to their reputation.\" Several multinationals, including BP Amoco and Royal Dutch/Shell, have already adopted such policies. Amnesty's checklist, which is designed to help companies formulate policies, includes procedures to protect the legal rights of employees, including their right to life; to ensure that the company's products are not used to violate peoples' right to life, liberty or personal security; guidelines to prevent collaboration with enterprises that use unpaid labour, renege on employment contracts or deny employees access to their travel documents and to protect employees' freedom of religion.

Kevin and Anne Atkinson, who have been beef farmers for 10 years, started their badger watching business three years ago in order to diversify away from complete reliance on the crisis hit beef sector. They spent \u00a312,000 setting up the venture, including a purpose built hide on a hillside where visitors can see around 10 of the animals in the evenings. Now it is so successful - and the beef business so bad - that they are selling their 24 cattle and devoting their time and efforts to the badgers.

      "bodyText": "Heavily armed gunmen kidnapped the brother of one of the lead negotiators in the Colombian government's peace talks with Marxist rebels after a day-time shootout in which two people were killed, authorities said. The high-profile abduction on Monday came less than a week after Colombia's main rightwing paramilitary force had accused the victim's brother, Fabio Valencia Cossio, of being \"excessively generous\" to rebels and promoting their interests at the negotiating table. Between six and 10 gunmen seized Guillermo Leon Valencia, 44, after a high-speed car chase and gunfight with his trio of bodyguards on a street in a residential sector of Medellin, police said. General Alfonso Arellano, chief of operations for the national police, said one of the police bodyguards was killed in the shootout along with one of the kidnappers, who was armed with an Israeli-made automatic assault rifle. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the abduction of Mr Valencia, who like his brother is a politician and powerful leader of the centre-right Conservative party in north-west Antioquia province. But it came just five days after the ultra-right United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC) issued a strongly worded statement accusing Fabio Valencia, Guillermo Leon's brother and a close ally of the Colombian president, Andres Pastrana, of siding with guerrillas in their slow-moving peace talks with the government. In a statement referring to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), Latin America's largest and oldest guerrilla army, which opened talks to end Colombia's long-running civil conflict a year and a half ago, the AUC told Mr Cossio: \"Not only have you been excessively generous with the Farc, you have also defended the interests of the subversives.\" The conflict, which has taken 35,000 lives during the past decade, pits the Farc and two smaller insurgent groups against the military and paramilitary groups, which have killed leftists and suspected rebel sympathisers with impunity since the mid-1980s. Nearly 3,000 abductions occurred last year in Colombia, Latin America's third most populous country with 40m people and with a reputation as the kidnap capital of world.",

What is striking about Farc now is the number of women in its ranks, currently about 30% and, according to a senior spokesman, Simon Trinidad, \"increasing all the time\". Some Farc units are already headed by women commandantes, and most of its road-blocks in this 16,000 square mile area of Colombia, which has been temporarily ceded to Farc by the government as part of a peace initiative, are organised by women. The Farc office in the centre of San Vicente, the unofficial capital of 'Farclandia' as the demilitarised zone is known, is run by Nora: a nom de guerre, as all the names of those in Farc are: a practice intended in part to protect their families, who are targeted by far-right paramilitary groups. Nora has the task of dealing with problems brought to her by the townspeople of San Vicente, greeting visitors to the peace process - a busload of mainly black law students from Cali arrived while we were in town - and handling the press.

The money seized during kidnaps or paid in ransom for kidnap victims goes towards running Farc. Sometimes Colombian journalists are kidnapped to be taken to see the site of a massacre carried out by the paramilitaries, who wipe out villages considered sympathetic to Farc. From its origins as a peasant guerrilla movement under Manuel \"Tiro Fijo\" (sure-shot) Marulanda in July 1964, Farc has evolved into this army which is neither well enough supported to take over the country nor small enough to be defeated militarily. Mr Marulanda, who is still alive and in charge and the subject of a tall portrait in the San Vicente office, is a party to the painfully slow peace talks with the government. When Farc previously re-entered conventional politics as a political party, Union Patriotica, in the 80s, it learned a painful lesson: 13 of its 18 elected mayors were assassinated and more than 3,000 members were killed, depriving the party of much of its intellectual leadership. Only a few of those responsible for the killing, mainly carried out it is believed by the military, have been charged. Since then Farc has been involved in many killings of its own.

      "bodyText": "New tough laws which will make even the unaccepted offer of a bribe a criminal offence at home and abroad were announced yesterday by Jack Straw, the home secretary. MPs accepting bribes will also face up to seven years in prison under the proposed changes following the Guardian's exposure of the \"cash for questions \" scandal which led to the resignation of disgraced ex-Tory ministers Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith. If proposed laws had been in force at the time, it is likely that Mr Hamilton, Mr Smith, lobbyist Ian Greer and Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed could all have been prosecuted over the \u00a350,000 paid in cash to the two Tory MPs to ask questions in the Commons. The new laws will both redefine bribery and corruption and extend prosecution of British citizens caught offering or giving bribes to officials abroad to gain contracts. The government has decided to bow to international pressure - particularly from America and countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - to pursue British citizens abroad. Under the law they could be extradited to Britain to stand trial. Ministers will also have the power under other legislation now going through parliament to seize encrypted emails and intercept mobile phone messages and conversations in pursuing companies suspected of authorising foreign nationals to bribe people abroad to get round the law. Announcing the proposals in the Commons, Mr Straw told MPs: \"Corruption is like a deadly virus. It has no boundaries. We need to fight it wherever it is found. \"For too long dishonest individuals have profited at the expense of undermining the integrity of professional and public life in this country. The international business community increasingly realises that a culture of corruption is a disincentive to investment and trade.\" The new law will exempt corporate hospitality. It will also make clear that tipping people like taxi drivers, hairdressers, waiters, hotel staff or car park attendants to secure better services would also be outside the scope of the new corruption laws. The inclusion of the phrase \"trading in influence\" - as a definition of corruption - suggests that a parliamentary lobbyist who regularly entertains a minister or civil servant, or invites them on expensive trips, might get caught under the new laws. In this case, the law would target the lobbyist rather than the recipient - unless the person accepted a bribe. Ministers, however, emphasise that the law is not specifically directed at any reform of parliamentary lobbying. The proposals, expected to be put before parliament later this year, will simplify and clarify the law embodied in the three corruption acts of 1889, 1906 and 1916. The Home Office minister Charles Clarke said yesterday: \"There is a greyish area at the bottom of what might be involved in this. It is a question of judgments that need to be made in this area.\" The legislation will mean the right of parliamentary privilege, brought in to protect MPs' and Lords' freedom of speech, will no longer protect them from allegations that they acted corruptly in the Houses of Parliament. \"What we are doing is removing parliamentary privilege from MPs who seek to use membership of parliament to protect themselves from these allegations,\" said Mr Clarke. \"From now on there'll be no advantage in being an MP in protecting you from these charges.\" The plans will also treat corruption in the public and private sectors in the same way for the first time. The presumption of corruption for public servants contained in the 1916 act will be abolished so that prosecutors will have to prove they were motivated by a bribe just as they would in cases against those working in the private sector. No charges will be able to be brought against any individual without the consent of government law officers - thus ruling out any private prosecutions.",

The heads of both the National Trust and English Nature trekked from London to a Yorkshire smallholding to honour the work of Walter Umpleby and his scythe. Tucked beyond the reach of slurry wagons and fertiliser sales agents, the patch of Malham Moor was declared the country's newest national nature reserve at a farmyard ceremony surrounded by swaths of wood cranesbill, melancholy thistle and the greater butterfly orchid. Scientists have been astonished by the wealth of plants preserved by Mr Umpleby's \"outstanding\" management of one of the last true hay meadows in the northern uplands. Martin Drury, director general of the National Trust, said: \"We call this an agri-environmental benefit. \"But in truth it is a great national treasure, as fragile, rare and important to this country as an ancient building or work of art.\" The survival of the meadows at New House Farm, almost 2,000ft above sea level, is due to Mr Umpleby's dogged use of traditional meadow management for 40 years, a period when 99% of the habitat in Britain succumbed to modern intensive farming.

Politicians and diplomats from Britain and abroad joined the brigadier's widow Heather and his daughters, Nicola, 15, and Catherine, 13, at the funeral which was held with full military honours. The coffin, draped with the union flag, was carried from the hearse by six pall bearers before being met by a guard of honour from the soldier's former regiment, the Royal Gloucestershire Berkshire and Wiltshire regiment. Among those attending the service were Geoffrey Hoon, defence secretary, Robert Key, shadow defence spokesman, Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, General Sir Michael Walker, chief of general staff, and General Sir Mike Jackson, commander in chief of UK land forces. A private family service and burial will take place today. The urban guerrilla group November 17 claimed responsibility for the brigadier's killing, saying it was retribution for Britain's role in the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia last year.

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors demanded an 18-month prison sentence yesterday for the disgraced former governor of Osaka in the biggest sexual harassment case Japan has ever seen. \"Knock\" Yokoyama, a former comedian who came to power on a promise to clean up the city's scandal-tainted politics, has admitted molesting a female student during an election campaign last year. At a hearing at the Osaka district court, prosecutors said he was guilty of a \"shameful act on an unprecedented scale for a man in his position\". His 22-year-old victim - a former member of his election team - has testified that the governor groped her for about 30 minutes in the back of a campaign truck. Prosecutors said this proved that Mr Yokoyama had abused his authority to carry out a \"vicious crime\". The judges were also asked to take account of the fact that the governor attempted to bribe and bully his victim. Mr Yokoyama offered the woman designer bags in return for her silence. When she spoke out - an unusual step in Japan, where shame prevents many women from complaining about harassment - he initially accused her of lying and lodged a counter claim in the courts. \"The accused has shown no respect for the dignity of the victim,\" the prosecutors said. \"He only apologised and admitted his guilt at the last moment to win leniency.\" The court must decide on a fitting sentence for Mr Yokoyama. Eighteen months in prison would be one of the most severe punishments ever handed down to a former governor, but it is well short of the maximum penalty, which is seven years in prison. Mr Yokoyama's lawyers are likely to repeat the former governor's claim that he was unaware that his actions were causing his victim any suffering. \"She did not resist much when I slipped my hand inside her pants,\" he has said. In pleading for leniency, they will also argue that Mr Yokoyama has been punished enough. As well as being forced to step down, a civil court has ordered him to pay 11m yen (\u00a367,000) in damages, the largest award in a sexual harassment case in Japan. The district court's decision is the subject of intense interest in Japan because sekuhara (sexual harassment) has only recently been recognised as a serious offence. In the past 10 years, there have been only about 100 harassment suits, but in a sign of changing attitudes the government passed new laws last year to try to stamp out workplace molesting.",

      "body": "<p>In the end England threw themselves out of the European Championship. Just when it seemed that Kevin Keegan's team had survived the best of Romania's attacking efforts to hold on for the draw that would have taken them to the quarter-finals, Phil Neville needlessly gave away a penalty and it was all over. </p> <p>Thus penalties and England remain synonymous with failure in major international tournaments. At least this time nobody missed one in a shoot-out; in fact Alan Shearer, given a chance to bring the scores level from the penalty spot in the first half, took it as coolly as you like. </p> <p>England were seldom as composed as this. For long periods of the match, and especially in the second half, they wore an air of desperation as Romania's superior passing and movement swept through their midfield as though Keegan's men were not there. Indeed this was often the case. </p> <p>The fateful lunge by the younger Neville which sent Viorel Moldovan tumbling as the Romanian striker tried to cut past the Manchester United full-back near the left-hand byline was an aberration waiting to happen. Neville did not need to make such a challenge in that situation, but he panicked and was done for. </p> <p>As Ioan Ganea, one of the Romanian substitutes, whacked the ball past Nigel Martyn the collective breath of England's supporters was taken away. You could hardly blame them. This was the cruellest of low blows. </p> <p>Yet it was difficult to contest the justice of the victory which will take Romania to Brussels on Saturday to meet Italy in the quarter-finals. For much of last night's match they were the more accomplished, better organised, more composed team. Whereas Romania usually knew what they were about, with England it was more a case of guesswork. </p> <p>As to the luck England were always going to need, it was just about even. In a bizarre prologue David Seaman hurt a leg during the warm-up and was replaced by Martyn, who was lost when Romania scored their first goal and at fault with their second. Against that England scored twice in seven minutes at the end of the first half after Romania lost Gheorghe Popescu, their best defender. </p> <p>In some ways last night's match was reminiscent of the 3-2 defeat England suffered against Portugal in Eindhoven in their opening game. England's failure to hold an advantage was again down to shortcomings in midfield and defence. </p> <p>Keegan could have become the first man in charge of England to get them out of the group stage in a European Championship played abroad. He failed because his players never mastered the art of closing a game down when ahead. </p> <p>Last night England defended with the determination they had shown in holding on a 1-0 lead against Germany here three days earlier. The difference was that Romania were far more likely than that wretched German side to find the skill and wit to break England down. Perhaps it would have been kinder had they not allowed Keegan's spirited but ingenuous team to get so close to the result they needed but did not really deserve. </p> <p>At least there will be no illusions about how much still has to be done before England can seriously be considered a significant force again in international football. Beating Germany for the first time in a tournament for 34 years may have stirred hearts but intelligent heads are more urgently needed, on and off the field.</p> <p>Last night's performance was no more profound than most of England's previous European Championship matches. They looked what they were, a team that had struggled to qualify and then begun the tournament proper on borrowed time. </p> <p>Individually there were some limited successes: Martin Keown again sound in defence, Paul Ince strong at the back of the midfield, Paul Scholes the astute provider of a goal for Michael Owen which briefly recalled memories of England's recovery against Argentina in the last World Cup. </p> <p>Yet David Beckham was never the influence he had been against Portugal and Germany. The longer the match progressed, moreover, the more Shearer and Owen became isolated as Dorinel Munteanu took over the conductor's baton from the suspended Gheorghe Hagi and orchestrated the game to a Romanian tune. </p> <p>Keegan had called for better passing from his players but did not get it. Romania's build-ups were quicker, slicker and more imaginative. Their players did not have to glance up to see where colleagues were; they knew. </p> <p>After 22 minutes Cristian Chivu gave Romania the lead in bizarre circumstances. A corner had been half-cleared and the England defence was slow to react when Chivu gained possession. </p> <p>For once Keown was not around to close down the danger as Chivu clipped the ball towards the far post, where Moldovan was lurking. In the event all Moldovan had to do was watch the ball strike the inside of the post and rebound across the goalline with Martyn a hapless spectator. </p> <p>All England groaned but after Popescu had been forced off after a tackle with Beckham there was a crack in the ramparts. In the 40th minute Shearer slipped the ball inside to Ince, who was brought down by Chivu's clumsy tackle. In went Shearer's penalty and the point England sought looked on again. </p> <p>Indeed first-half stoppage-time left the predominantly English crowd convinced that they would get through with three. Scholes gained possession midway inside the Romanian half and caught the defence moving up too late with a lob which Owen touched past the advancing Bogdan Stelea and tapped into the net. </p> <p>The second half quickly dispersed English optimism. Within three minutes Martyn, partly impeded by Keown as he went to meet Dan Petrescu's cross, punched the ball out weakly and straight to Munteanu, who drove Romania level once more. </p> <p>The rest, for England, was all about sweat and substitutions until Phil Neville's error and Ganea's composure with the penalty brought Romania the win they deserved, leaving Keegan to wonder how much kudos there was left from beating the Germans. That triumph now looks a mite hollow.</p>",

In a bizarre prologue David Seaman hurt a leg during the warm-up and was replaced by Martyn, who was lost when Romania scored their first goal and at fault with their second. Against that England scored twice in seven minutes at the end of the first half after Romania lost Gheorghe Popescu, their best defender. In some ways last night's match was reminiscent of the 3-2 defeat England suffered against Portugal in Eindhoven in their opening game. England's failure to hold an advantage was again down to shortcomings in midfield and defence. Keegan could have become the first man in charge of England to get them out of the group stage in a European Championship played abroad. He failed because his players never mastered the art of closing a game down when ahead. Last night England defended with the determination they had shown in holding on a 1-0 lead against Germany here three days earlier. The difference was that Romania were far more likely than that wretched German side to find the skill and wit to break England down. Perhaps it would have been kinder had they not allowed Keegan's spirited but ingenuous team to get so close to the result they needed but did not really deserve. At least there will be no illusions about how much still has to be done before England can seriously be considered a significant force again in international football. Beating Germany for the first time in a tournament for 34 years may have stirred hearts but intelligent heads are more urgently needed, on and off the field. Last night's performance was no more profound than most of England's previous European Championship matches. They looked what they were, a team that had struggled to qualify and then begun the tournament proper on borrowed time. Individually there were some limited successes: Martin Keown again sound in defence, Paul Ince strong at the back of the midfield, Paul Scholes the astute provider of a goal for Michael Owen which briefly recalled memories of England's recovery against Argentina in the last World Cup. Yet David Beckham was never the influence he had been against Portugal and Germany. The longer the match progressed, moreover, the more Shearer and Owen became isolated as Dorinel Munteanu took over the conductor's baton from the suspended Gheorghe Hagi and orchestrated the game to a Romanian tune. Keegan had called for better passing from his players but did not get it. Romania's build-ups were quicker, slicker and more imaginative. Their players did not have to glance up to see where colleagues were; they knew. After 22 minutes Cristian Chivu gave Romania the lead in bizarre circumstances. A corner had been half-cleared and the England defence was slow to react when Chivu gained possession. For once Keown was not around to close down the danger as Chivu clipped the ball towards the far post, where Moldovan was lurking. In the event all Moldovan had to do was watch the ball strike the inside of the post and rebound across the goalline with Martyn a hapless spectator. All England groaned but after Popescu had been forced off after a tackle with Beckham there was a crack in the ramparts. In the 40th minute Shearer slipped the ball inside to Ince, who was brought down by Chivu's clumsy tackle. In went Shearer's penalty and the point England sought looked on again. Indeed first-half stoppage-time left the predominantly English crowd convinced that they would get through with three. Scholes gained possession midway inside the Romanian half and caught the defence moving up too late with a lob which Owen touched past the advancing Bogdan Stelea and tapped into the net. The second half quickly dispersed English optimism. Within three minutes Martyn, partly impeded by Keown as he went to meet Dan Petrescu's cross, punched the ball out weakly and straight to Munteanu, who drove Romania level once more. The rest, for England, was all about sweat and substitutions until Phil Neville's error and Ganea's composure with the penalty brought Romania the win they deserved, leaving Keegan to wonder how much kudos there was left from beating the Germans. That triumph now looks a mite hollow.",
