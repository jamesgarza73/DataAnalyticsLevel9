The Reagan Legacy Project, which has its headquarters in Washington, states without any qualification that \"Ronald Reagan was America's greatest president\". Its aim is to ensure \"naming something significant after President Reagan in each of the 50 states and in every county of America.\" Among the achievements it claims so far are everything from a US Navy aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is due for completion in 2002, to the Ronald Reagan Fundamental school in Yuma, Arizona. Other commemorations include the Ronald Reagan professorship at California's Pepperdine University, the college which invited the former independent counsel Kenneth Starr to become its principal, and the Ronald Reagan Foundation for Conservative Studies at the Texas A&amp;M University in Bryan, Texas, also home to the George Bush Presidential library. Some supporters of the project make clear that they will not be truly content until they have had a head of President Reagan added to the Mount Rushmore monument in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt are commemorated. To achieve their goal of a Reagan memorial on the Mall, Republicans have drafted a bill which brushes aside all existing procedures and checks and balances for commemorations in the capital.

      "body": "<p>While ministers have been battling to limit fallout from the fuel crisis, they have been able to take some consolation from having avoided the bane of all previous Labour administrations: a good old-fashioned sterling crisis. </p> <p>Indeed, to the extent that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have had a problem with the pound it has been that it has been too strong rather than too weak. A rising currency makes exports dearer and the government has been given a fearful earbashing by manufacturers over the past couple of years about lost orders, declining profitability and job losses. </p> <p>But while ministers are aware of the problems caused to exporters by sterling, they would prefer to be in their current predicament rather than the one the Tories were in eight years ago today, when George Soros was preparing for the speculative attack that blew the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism. On the plus side, the strength of the pound has lowered the cost of imports - adding to the purchasing power of consumers - and helped keep the lid on inflation. Although they are wary of admitting it, the government quite likes a strong pound. Given the political torture that was inflicted on Labour as a result of the financial crises in 1931, 1949, 1967 and 1976, this is not surprising. </p> <p>But recent developments on the foreign exchanges may well have sent a tremor through Whitehall. Over the past month, sterling has not been strong at all. It has been so weak in fact that in the league table of 54 global currencies produced by Bloomberg, the pound was propping up the rest in 54th place. </p> <p>The public has yet to wake up to the fact that sterling's downward lurch has occurred primarily against the US dollar rather than against the euro - which itself has been going through another weak phase. However, sterling's weakness has certainly been noticed by dealers in the City and other global financial centres, because it has brought to an end a prolonged period in which sterling has not moved against the greenback. Since the election in May 1997, the pound has appreciated sharply against European currencies but held rock-steady against the dollar, trading in a 6% range around a central value of $1.55. </p> <p>That era now seems to have come to an end. The pound slipped quietly below $1.50 against the dollar in August, and earlier this week fell below $1.40, its lowest level in 14 years. Even in the aftermath of Black Wednesday the pound managed to keep its head just above $1.40. Yesterday the pound was trading at around $1.41. </p> <p>This downward move is long overdue. Although the UK economy has been doing well since 1992, it has not been doing as well as the American, which is attracting huge flows of capital that are boosting the value of the dollar. \"The evidence does suggest the pound should be in a lower range against the US dollar. UK economic performance, in terms of growth and productivity, does not compare with that in the US,\" says Tony Norfield of City firm ABN-AMRO. \"UK productivity growth is trending at around 2.5% compared to the recent 5%-plus numbers for the US.\" </p> <p>In addition, interest rates in the UK are below those in the US and the last occasion this happened for any sustained period - in the mid-1980s - sterling was trading at around its current levels against the dollar. </p> <p>The combination of the pound's weakness against the dollar and its over-valuation against the euro means that industry is currently suffering the worst of both worlds.

      "bodyText": "While ministers have been battling to limit fallout from the fuel crisis, they have been able to take some consolation from having avoided the bane of all previous Labour administrations: a good old-fashioned sterling crisis. Indeed, to the extent that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have had a problem with the pound it has been that it has been too strong rather than too weak. A rising currency makes exports dearer and the government has been given a fearful earbashing by manufacturers over the past couple of years about lost orders, declining profitability and job losses. But while ministers are aware of the problems caused to exporters by sterling, they would prefer to be in their current predicament rather than the one the Tories were in eight years ago today, when George Soros was preparing for the speculative attack that blew the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism. On the plus side, the strength of the pound has lowered the cost of imports - adding to the purchasing power of consumers - and helped keep the lid on inflation. Although they are wary of admitting it, the government quite likes a strong pound. Given the political torture that was inflicted on Labour as a result of the financial crises in 1931, 1949, 1967 and 1976, this is not surprising. But recent developments on the foreign exchanges may well have sent a tremor through Whitehall. Over the past month, sterling has not been strong at all. It has been so weak in fact that in the league table of 54 global currencies produced by Bloomberg, the pound was propping up the rest in 54th place. The public has yet to wake up to the fact that sterling's downward lurch has occurred primarily against the US dollar rather than against the euro - which itself has been going through another weak phase. However, sterling's weakness has certainly been noticed by dealers in the City and other global financial centres, because it has brought to an end a prolonged period in which sterling has not moved against the greenback. Since the election in May 1997, the pound has appreciated sharply against European currencies but held rock-steady against the dollar, trading in a 6% range around a central value of $1.55. That era now seems to have come to an end. The pound slipped quietly below $1.50 against the dollar in August, and earlier this week fell below $1.40, its lowest level in 14 years. Even in the aftermath of Black Wednesday the pound managed to keep its head just above $1.40. Yesterday the pound was trading at around $1.41. This downward move is long overdue. Although the UK economy has been doing well since 1992, it has not been doing as well as the American, which is attracting huge flows of capital that are boosting the value of the dollar. \"The evidence does suggest the pound should be in a lower range against the US dollar. UK economic performance, in terms of growth and productivity, does not compare with that in the US,\" says Tony Norfield of City firm ABN-AMRO. \"UK productivity growth is trending at around 2.5% compared to the recent 5%-plus numbers for the US.\" In addition, interest rates in the UK are below those in the US and the last occasion this happened for any sustained period - in the mid-1980s - sterling was trading at around its current levels against the dollar. The combination of the pound's weakness against the dollar and its over-valuation against the euro means that industry is currently suffering the worst of both worlds. Most UK imports of fuel and raw materials are priced in dollars, so a falling pound adds to industry's costs. But the strength of the pound against the euro means it is hard to export to euroland. The size and speed of capital flows in liberalised markets mean that once dealers scent blood they can send currencies plunging with alarming swiftness. And even before money was free to move around the globe, the pound had some sticky moments. As Nick Parsons of Commerzbank put it: \"The history of sterling crises is that they happen suddenly and extend further than ever thought imaginable.\" Some analysts therefore believe that sterling has a lot further to fall against the dollar and might be trading at around $1.25 within a few weeks. In such circumstances, the Bank of England would consider whether to defend the pound with higher interest rates. With the economy showing signs of slowing and an election looming, Mr Parsons said the chances of \"defending the pound with a rate rise are close to zero. After all, if 15% did not save sterling in 1992, then a hike from 6% will do nothing today.\" But if tighter domestic monetary policy is unlikely to prevent further sterling weakness against the dollar, then international events just might. The United States is not only running a colossal and burgeoning trade deficit, but is also showing signs of slowing down. It is no longer the case that the American economy is growing rapidly while euroland is in recession; both are expanding at pretty much the same rate according to the latest data. As a result, logic suggests that the dollar should start to fall on the foreign exchanges at some point soon - and that the euro will be the main beneficiary. In a perfect world, the pound would then rise against the dollar to around $1.50 but fall against the single currency to the equivalent of three German marks. But it is not a perfect world and there could be more choppy water ahead for sterling. Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

Action Spectacular have been much lauded, but waiting for them to begin their live London debut it is easy to wonder whether their choice of moniker was wise. </p> <p>The Sheffield-based five-piece are known for their wacky stunts. Singer Jim Muir and co arrive wearing baggy suits, seaside comedy glasses and wide grins, so we're not disappointed. Well, those of us who find baggy suits and silly glasses amusing aren't. And Muir is certainly pleased with himself, standing with his arms in the air, an all-conquering hero. </p> <p>\"Good evening, Castle Donnington!\" he proclaims, as a slab of funk plays behind him. Then it's straight into a spoken intro paying homage to Elvis and the 70s in an early morning voice. It's gruff and off-key. But then Action Spectacular pride themselves on their quirkiness. General Lee begins as a gentle nursery rhyme before jumping into deep indie-pop territory, jangly guitars against a jaunty country melody. </p> <p>It's as if Britpop never died, with shades of the Charlatans and the vaudeville side of Blur backing up a lyrical style that Jarvis Cocker copyrighted in 1994. \"We are the new Menswear, except better looking,\" says Muir. </p> <p>Except Action Spectacular can play.

      "bodyText": "\"Spectaculars\" rarely live up to their name. When you expect fireworks, you get rain. Action Spectacular have been much lauded, but waiting for them to begin their live London debut it is easy to wonder whether their choice of moniker was wise. The Sheffield-based five-piece are known for their wacky stunts. Singer Jim Muir and co arrive wearing baggy suits, seaside comedy glasses and wide grins, so we're not disappointed. Well, those of us who find baggy suits and silly glasses amusing aren't. And Muir is certainly pleased with himself, standing with his arms in the air, an all-conquering hero. \"Good evening, Castle Donnington!\" he proclaims, as a slab of funk plays behind him. Then it's straight into a spoken intro paying homage to Elvis and the 70s in an early morning voice. It's gruff and off-key. But then Action Spectacular pride themselves on their quirkiness. General Lee begins as a gentle nursery rhyme before jumping into deep indie-pop territory, jangly guitars against a jaunty country melody. It's as if Britpop never died, with shades of the Charlatans and the vaudeville side of Blur backing up a lyrical style that Jarvis Cocker copyrighted in 1994. \"We are the new Menswear, except better looking,\" says Muir. Except Action Spectacular can play. Bassist Paul Flaherty stands sideways, rocking backwards and forwards, a danger to both himself and guitarist Martin Hirons, who's perilously close to him. Paul Galpin adds some Happy Mondays-style psychedelia with his keyboards - and it's in this stoner's paradise that the band work best. The problem is that they're besotted with their record collections and too eager to please too many people. As the laid-back charm of Music in the Sun gives way to the embittered rant of Half Empty Bottle, Action Spectacular cease to be interesting, despite an on-off light show and some impassioned playing.

      "bodyText": "Britain's employers will have to find an extra \u00a3700m a year to fund pensions because people are living much longer, the Department of Social Security warned yesterday. The extra burden is part of a sweeping overhaul proposed by the DSS yesterday of the \"minimum funding requirement\", or MFR, introduced in 1995 Pensions Act to protect the 12.5m people in company pension schemes after Robert Maxwell plundered \u00a3400m from the Mirror's schemes. New mortality figures suggest that pensioners are now expected to live two years longer than thought in 1995, increasing the pension burden for employers by 6.5%. But actuaries said the extra cost may further accelerate moves by employers to ditch final salary pension schemes in favour of pay-as-you-go \"money purchase\" schemes, where benefits to pensioners are often much lower. However, the DSS stepped back from implementing immediate changes to the MFR in favour of further consultation, delaying new rules until at least 2002. It also indicated that it may abandon the MFR entirely, opting instead for an insurance-based scheme. The DSS welcomed proposals in an Institute of Actuaries report for a change in the calculation basis for future pension liabilities amid concern that they have created a squeeze in the gilts market and pushed yields to artificially low levels. City analysts had expected the IoA to recommend wider use of top grade corporate bonds but were surprised yesterday when the proposals went further and included all investment grade bonds. \"No one will be selling corporate bonds today,\" said Barclays Capital, but Deutsche Bank said that the proposals will be negative for holders of long-term gilts. \u0095 CGNU yesterday admitted that it has made a multimillion-pound error with a pension fund.

Minuses Allegedly doesn't get on with Ken Bates, has a murky business past and hasn't coached a top club since 1991 at Spurs. Recently Australia coach, Portsmouth chairman and Crystal Palace head coach - hardly reasons to be managing Chelsea. Aim\u00e9 Jacquet 8-1 Pluses Greatest moment two years ago when he combined a vintage crop of French players and home advantage to win the World Cup. Minuses Happy in back-seat role as French FA's technical director. Now aged 60 is unlikely to relish the pressure of club management again. Has not managed at club level since 1989 at Bordeaux. Dino Zoff 16-1 Pluses Impressed in Euro 2000 by taking Italy to the final. Coached at top club level with Juventus and Lazio. Not in a job at the moment. Minuses Tactics at Euro 2000, though effective, were negative and out of keeping with Chelsea tradition.

A mob of managerial candidates has swarmed around Stamford Bridge, refusing to move until they are granted a multi-million pound contract that could be cancelled at any moment depending on the whim of Ken Bates. Huddling around flaming motorcars, and singing crude chants - \"Who do we want? Jose Antonio Camacho! When do we want him? By the end of the month so he can prepare for the second round of Euro-Vase!\" - the mob claims it has the complete support of the British public. And God help Tony Blair if he gets in their way.</p> <p>Not really, folks: one earth-shaking crisis is enough for this week. But, nevertheless, the field of candidates for the Chelsea job is getting ever wider. Spanish coach Camacho is the hottest name at the moment, not only for his impressive record in charge of Spain, but for the intricacies of his contract which make him easy to poach. A representative of the Spanish FA confirmed: \"It is public knowledge that a pact exists between ourselves and Camacho, stating that he can leave if he is no longer happy in his position.\" Other new names to be touted about are Johan Cruyff, currently unemployed, and former Celtic coach Wim Jansen - ditto.</p> <p>One candidate who looks like dropping off the list is Fiver favourite Terry Venables. Top of the bookies' charts only yesterday, Tel popped his own bubble when he confessed: \"According to my sources, Chelsea are going to appoint a foreign coach.\" But despite being foreign, Ruud Gullit doesn't expect to get a call. The former Chelsea boss, not on the best of terms with Vialli when he left the club, talked to his pals at the Mirror this morning. \"People ask me if I have any sympathy for Gianluca Vialli,\" he said. \"The blunt answer is no.\"</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>EMERGENCY WARD FIVER</strong></p> <p>After a couple of weeks when serious injuries have hogged the headlines - Luc Nilis's shattered leg, Harry Kewell's problem Achilles, Gianluca Vialli's bruised ego - the Fiver is glad to finally have the chance to relay some better news. Lucas Radebe, who last night collided with Michael Duberry as his Leeds team were being thrashed out of sight by Barcelona in Big Cup, has been given a clean bill of health despite sustaining what looked like pretty serious neck knack.</p> <p>After the aforementioned collision, Radebe remained motionless for several minutes before being carted off the pitch in a neck brace, and initial dark whispers suggested the Leeds captain had broken his neck. Happily, however, x-rays found no serious damage and the Leeds captain will be available for this Saturday's Premiership match against Ipswich. \"Although he took a blow to the head and was disorientated,\" a Leeds spokesman said, \"the good news is he has no concussion so he will today travel home with the rest of the squad.\"</p> <p>And the happy news doesn't stop there, either, because shortarsed hedonist Diego Maradona also managed to survive a car crash in Cuba late last night. The jeep he was driving along a badly-lit and rainy road collided head-on with a tourist bus and, despite the driver's side being badly damaged, the chubby little trickster escaped with only bruises to his knee and ankle. \"Fortunately, he's fine,\" said friend Guillermo Coppola. \"He's a bit shook up by the impact but it's nothing important.\" Even his septum was not shaken out of place. Amazing.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>QUOTE OF THE DAY</p> <p>\"We can play so much better\" - Frank De Boer after Barcelona's 4-0 thumping of Leeds. Let's face it, nobody does arrogance better than the Dutch.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>UNCOMFORTABLE RINGS</strong></p> <p>It's all go at the Olympics today. IOC head honcho Juan Antonio Samaranch (think of him as a thinner, and even more upstanding Sepp Blatter) has revealed he is in talks with Fifa about changing the rules for the Olympic football competition. The plan is to abandon current age limits which allow countries to have only three players aged 23 or over in their squad. This has already alerted the organisers of the Scarborough Seniors six-a-side tournament who worry they could lose many of their star attractions to future Olympic games. </p> <p>Of course, a relaxation of the rules would in effect mean the creation of a new international tournament to rival the World Cup, European Championships, Copa America etc. The possible consequences could also be sizeable. Nigerian experts predict that Nwankwo Kanu would be involved in so many tournaments worldwide that he would actually spend his entire life on a plane. Meanwhile, Dean Windass is said to be considering petitioning parliament for the creation of a Great British team so that he and Trevor Sinclair could get an international cap.</p> <p>With all that news a-going on, we had no time to contact Toadfish (again) and so we are forced to use the official report on today's matches (again). \"The banana boys of Brazil goaled their way to an opening 3-1 victory against the Slovs of Slovakia this evening/morning/afternoon. Goals from Arsenal friend Edu and Parma pal Alex were enough to make coach Wanderley Luxemburgo breathe another breath of victory. Elsewhere, Chile were hot as they burnt Morocco 4-1 with a three-goal flamer from Ivan 'to score more goals' Zamorano. Big up the back of the net!\"</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Barcelona are considering buying 21-year-old Uruguayan defender Fernando Carreno from Penarol - just so they can use him to prise Rio Ferdinand from West Ham. Planet Football claims Carreno would be loaned out to the Hammers on a long-term basis if they agree to part with the \u00a314m-rated Ferdinand.</p> <p>Coventry have targetted 26-year-old Honduran defender Milton Reyes. A deal will be struck providing Jairo Martinez and Ivan Guerrero, the two Hondurans already at Highfield Road, have no trouble obtaining their work permits.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>The coach of Nigeria has criticised Arsenal in the wake of his team's poor start to the Olympic Games. \"A team like Nigeria has no chance if Fifa are prepared to let the big clubs get away with flouting the rules,\" Jo Bonfrere said after the current holders of the Olympic title drew 3-3 with unfancied Honduras. \"Kanu promised us he would play here and that was the case until the very last moment when Arsenal put pressure on him. They put him in a position where it was impossible for him to play for us. The club are selfish and won't even look at the big picture. We were counting on Kanu.\"</p> <p>Manchester City have announced that their match against Middlesbrough will go ahead on Sunday despite the current fuel crisis.</p> <p>Gregory Vignal, a 19-year-old former French Under 18 international full back, has joined Liverpool from Montpellier for \u00a3467,000. </p> <p>Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given has signed a new three-year contract with the club.</p> <p>Bradford full-back Andy Myers is out for six weeks after pulling his hamstring in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Highbury on Saturday.</p> <p>Galatasaray midfielder Gheorge Hagi could miss the Turkish side's Big Cup game against Rangers after being sent off against Monaco for allegedly elbowing an opponent. Uefa will decide whether to give him a two-match suspension tomorrow.</p> <p>Roberto Baggio has signed a two-year contract with newly promoted Serie A club Brescia.

IOC head honcho Juan Antonio Samaranch (think of him as a thinner, and even more upstanding Sepp Blatter) has revealed he is in talks with Fifa about changing the rules for the Olympic football competition. The plan is to abandon current age limits which allow countries to have only three players aged 23 or over in their squad. This has already alerted the organisers of the Scarborough Seniors six-a-side tournament who worry they could lose many of their star attractions to future Olympic games. Of course, a relaxation of the rules would in effect mean the creation of a new international tournament to rival the World Cup, European Championships, Copa America etc. The possible consequences could also be sizeable. Nigerian experts predict that Nwankwo Kanu would be involved in so many tournaments worldwide that he would actually spend his entire life on a plane. Meanwhile, Dean Windass is said to be considering petitioning parliament for the creation of a Great British team so that he and Trevor Sinclair could get an international cap. With all that news a-going on, we had no time to contact Toadfish (again) and so we are forced to use the official report on today's matches (again). \"The banana boys of Brazil goaled their way to an opening 3-1 victory against the Slovs of Slovakia this evening/morning/afternoon. Goals from Arsenal friend Edu and Parma pal Alex were enough to make coach Wanderley Luxemburgo breathe another breath of victory. Elsewhere, Chile were hot as they burnt Morocco 4-1 with a three-goal flamer from Ivan 'to score more goals' Zamorano. Big up the back of the net!\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Barcelona are considering buying 21-year-old Uruguayan defender Fernando Carreno from Penarol - just so they can use him to prise Rio Ferdinand from West Ham. Planet Football claims Carreno would be loaned out to the Hammers on a long-term basis if they agree to part with the \u00a314m-rated Ferdinand. Coventry have targetted 26-year-old Honduran defender Milton Reyes. A deal will be struck providing Jairo Martinez and Ivan Guerrero, the two Hondurans already at Highfield Road, have no trouble obtaining their work permits. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The coach of Nigeria has criticised Arsenal in the wake of his team's poor start to the Olympic Games. \"A team like Nigeria has no chance if Fifa are prepared to let the big clubs get away with flouting the rules,\" Jo Bonfrere said after the current holders of the Olympic title drew 3-3 with unfancied Honduras. \"Kanu promised us he would play here and that was the case until the very last moment when Arsenal put pressure on him. They put him in a position where it was impossible for him to play for us. The club are selfish and won't even look at the big picture. We were counting on Kanu.\" Manchester City have announced that their match against Middlesbrough will go ahead on Sunday despite the current fuel crisis. Gregory Vignal, a 19-year-old former French Under 18 international full back, has joined Liverpool from Montpellier for \u00a3467,000. Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given has signed a new three-year contract with the club. Bradford full-back Andy Myers is out for six weeks after pulling his hamstring in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Highbury on Saturday. Galatasaray midfielder Gheorge Hagi could miss the Turkish side's Big Cup game against Rangers after being sent off against Monaco for allegedly elbowing an opponent. Uefa will decide whether to give him a two-match suspension tomorrow. Roberto Baggio has signed a two-year contract with newly promoted Serie A club Brescia. The former Italian international, who joins on a free transfer, has been out of contract since the end of June after a two-year spell with Internazionale. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World Football (2.25am) Open your eyes, then your mind.

      "body": "<p>The trouble with art is that the act of buying something to hang on your wall, put on your shelf or install in your garden has, for centuries, been encoded by the art world into a language that mystifies the work and its significance. Not its meaning - we've long been told how this isn't necessarily important anymore - but its significance, something far more important and the one issue that many curators and dealers of contemporary art find difficult to answer. Or if they do answer it, they often do so in a language delighting in obscure post-modern jargon (\"challenges conventions\", \"transgresses boundaries\", \"questions notions of . . .\") that forms a protective cocoon around the art work itself. No wonder, then, that many people get flustered and defensive when asked what it is they like about art. </p> <p>So what is a first-time collector to do? Probably the best advice is to ignore the label next to the work in question, put aside the exhibition catalogue and just look at the piece carefully. What does it do for you? If your feelings about it aren't immediately forthcoming, try coming back to it later. </p> <p>People have got into the idea that there has to be something behind the work, some intention, motivation, or point of origin, when in fact it might be at the very surface of the piece that its power lies. Alternatively, don't be taken in by appearances alone: forced casualness of execution - so very fashionable right now - often hides a lack of talent or imagination, just as a highly-worked intricacy in a work of art can, in some instances, suggest an inability to see the wood for the trees. </p> <p>There aren't any easy answers for the would-be collector. Anthony Reynolds, who has sold work by many of today's leading contemporary artists from his gallery in London's West End, says that he finds his best artists by \"not looking for anything in particular. It is usually quite surprising when I find something I like. You never know when it's going to hit you.\" </p> <p>Reynolds, who launched the careers of artists such as Steve McQueen, Mark Wallinger, Richard Billingham, Keith Tyson and Georgina Starr (whose new exhibition, \"The Bunny Lakes are Coming\", is on show at his gallery until the end of this month), says \"it's important to remain open to any possibility. By seeing a lot of work at shows, you get a measure of what's going on and you can then make your judgements accordingly.\" </p> <p>For Reynolds, meeting young artists and talking to them about their work is vital to him forming a view about them. For buyers, however, meeting an artist whose work interests them can be both rewarding and difficult. The romantic notion of visiting an artist in his or her own studio - seeing them in their element, poised with paintbrush in hand - is appealing, but most artists dread open studio events, says David Gilmour, director of Delfina Studios, Bermondsey. </p> <p>\"It can be so dispiriting if they have to sit in their studios waiting for someone to poke their head around the door, who then sniffs and walks away. The artists at Delfina decided to stop the open event we once ran. People still like coming around to see an artist they've got to know, or whose work they've bought, but they shouldn't think it'll cost them less than it would through an art gallery, since artists are loyal to the gallery. After all, it's in their own interest to be so.\" </p> <p>The Whitechapel Open, a regular annual event which coordinated public access to a large number of artists' studios around the east end and south London, has now ended - \"it always got slated by the press and it wasn't very professional,\" says Gilmour - and will be replaced by the London Invitational, a new collaboration that is due to start next year. Commercial gallery owners will be invited to show work by previously unexhibited artists selected by the Whitechapel Gallery, which will have its own curated show serving as the hub of the event. Visitors to the gallery will be provided with a map indicating the location of these commercial galleries, so that art enthusiasts will be able to explore new artistic talent with ease. </p> <p>Whether this project will succeed remains to be seen, but it is evident that few artists - Tracey Emin, and Sarah Staton whose Supastore project sold artworks by a variety of artists direct to the public, are among the exceptions - find they have the time or necessary skills to publicise and sell their work outside the gallery system. Although large numbers of artists show at the ACME Studio spaces across London, for example, it is very difficult to find out what they are doing or if you can come and view their work, as the artists are poorly coordinated. With so many contemporary art spaces now open in London, first-time buyers are probably best advised to brave the system and trawl around the galleries. </p> <p>But there are alternatives: you could visit the end of year degree shows held by most of the art and design colleges in your area - they will be happy to supply you with the dates. Much of the work is for sale, and you can enjoy the thrill of being a key early patron of an artist you believe in. </p> <p>Art fairs provide another useful survey of new work, often at a range of prices from the affordable to the mortgageable, and tend to show a broader range of styles of work than you would find in the fashionable contemporary spaces. Advertised in art world publications such as Art Monthly and the Artist's Newsletter, and in local papers, these fairs often mix craftwork with paintings, drawings and sculptures. There are international art fairs (in Berlin, Basle and Kassel) showing the latest in contemporary art, and the Art Fair held every January at the Business Design Centre in London brings together a large number of dealers showing a very wide spectrum of art works. </p> <p>But remember: however much something looks fantastic on a display stand, you might feel differently when it gets home. Any decent dealer will let you try a piece out at home first, if required. When all is said and done, if the work doesn't move you at that point, then think hard about proceeding any further.

They badly needed this boost. The whole move of modernising government, e-government or joined-up government seemed to me to be running into the sand. </p> <p>I was becoming more and more convinced that the canker came from within, that Sir Humphrey Appleby was out to scupper it all. </p> <p>My first suspicion came from the e-envoy's monthly reports to Tony Blair on how the UK is becoming the best in the world at e-commerce and e-government. These reports, published on the web, were very bullish, with ministries announcing new e-government initiatives each month. But one of the tasks assigned to Alex Allan, when he started work in January, remains obstinately uncompleted after eight months. This was to set up a management board, \"bringing together a small core group of departments with major e-commerce and e-Government responsibilities.\" </p> <p>It should have been a simple task, to find a few forward-looking fellow spirits at a very high level in the ministries. Only in this way could he effect the necessary culture shift in the Civil Service. If he had any difficulty in recruiting, he could wave this prime ministerial instruction in their face and, one might have thought, they would have accepted this great challenge with enthusiasm. Their careers would take off if they were to join this great enterprise, and they would be assured of a knighthood. </p> <p>But no. After six months no one rose to the challenge, and Alex Allan was still on his own, with no board to help him hack his way through the cross-departmental jungle. He claimed that individual ministries all \"bought in\" to the joined-up government agenda, but I became more convinced that he was being stitched up by Sir Humphrey and his pals. </p> <p>My suspicions were confirmed by the absurd reason given for the task being behind schedule. This went: \"The office of the e-envoy are considering further how best to rationalise the various existing groups and to involve key departments and industry representatives.\" This strikes me as a choice example of Humphreyesque gobbledygook. What on earth have these things to do with appointing a management board? In fact, I can't see how the e-envoy on his own can possibly \"rationalise existing groups\". That surely would be a task for the board, once it was set up. </p> <p>But then, all became clear. I saw Sir Humphrey, Sir Frank and Jumbo, deep in their arm chairs at the Athenaeum, with large brandies in their hands, discussing the threat posed by this young chap Allan to the God-given independence of their individual ministries. \"The damned chap knows all about these computer thingies, and wants to put them between us and the man in the street. Where does that leave us? You won't catch me on his management board.\" But, because Blair has been talked into this \"modernising government\" nonsense by some spin-doctor, the Athenaeum Three know they had to be careful. The best strategem is the old Whitehall trick of stalling. </p> <p>\"So, let's tell Allan that we are, of course, desperate to join his show, but before we do, he really must define more carefully what all the various departments are supposed to do, and how we are all to interact with each other. That should take about nine months. That should see us out to the next election.\" At this, the three of them fall about laughing. So, Alex Allan remained without a management board. </p> <p>Imagine the glee that the three must have felt when they got the news last week that Alex Allan had resigned, and that his successor would be appointed by a public selection procedure. Another three or even six months wasted. </p> <p>Two months ago, I heard a senior member of the Central IT Unit, the e-envoy's technical powerhouse, tell a meeting of the Parliamentary IT Committee that a new plan will put joined-up IT strategies \"on the mental agenda of very senior people in Whitehall\". But, surely, senior people in Whitehall like Sir Humphrey should have had electronic government on their mental agenda for nearly four years, ever since November 1996, when the Tory government published the \"Government.direct\" green paper. This first propounded the idea of putting citizens at the centre of government processes, so that if they married or went bankrupt they would only have to fill in one form, preferably on a screen, rather than several for many different ministries. At the time, I remember Roger Freeman, then minister for the cabinet office, say: \"we have got Sir Humphrey terrified\". </p> <p>After May 1997, Tony Blair accepted the message of Government.direct, and followed it up with a White Paper called Modernising Government in May 1999, and numerous strategy documents have followed. So, there are only three reasons why Sir Humphrey should not have e-government on his mental agenda. Either he is not prepared to accept it, or he, with his Oxbridge-Arts background, has not the mental apparatus to understand it. </p> <p>A third, more Machiavellian, interpretation, confirming my Yes Minister scenario, is that Sir Humphrey has had e-government very firmly fixed on his mental agenda since 1996, and, with his chums, has devoted his energies to stalling it for four years. </p> <p>To help Sir Humphrey, constant cabinet reshuffles have injected at least a year's delay, from David Clark to Jack Cunningham to Mo Mowlam. So we have had a minister who lost the confidence of Tony Blair, an \"enforcer\" who could not enforce, and a much-loved lady who confesses she is bored by her joined-up job. This is no way to change the way the whole civil service operates. Ian McArtney and Pat Hewitt, the e-ministers responsible, know what has to be done, but you need a big beast of the jungle to stop Sir Humphrey messing it all up. Such big beasts, other than Tony Blair, are not around. </p> <p>Last Monday, Tony Blair also released Alex Allan's annual progress report and swan song as e-envoy. I note that the idea of a management board has vanished. Clearly, Allan has realised that any dream he might have had of achieving joined-up government as a partnership between the reformers and those to be reformed has gone. Instead, the report plays hard-ball. It emphasises the \"strategic role\" of the office of the e- envoy by \"releasing funds to departments and agencies only on condition that departments have drawn up detailed, e-business strategies, and the e-envoy has confirmed to the Chief Secretary that these are aligned with the Government's overall strategic vision\". No more Mr Nice-guy. Sir Humphrey depends on the future e-envoy for his cash. </p> <p>This is rough stuff. But Tony Blair has still to find someone tough enough and subtle enough to play hardball with Sir Humphrey. And then, even if he/she does win the battle of educating or silencing the senior people in White hall, when will they get around to training the rank and file? In 2002 or 2003? I keep reading surveys of civil servants, which show they do not believe that Blair's target of 100% e-government by 2005 is feasible. With Sir Humphrey still at the helm, e-government could yet turn into the mother of all public-sector computer disasters.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain's trade unions yesterday urged the government to end the \"humiliating and stigmatising\" system of food vouchers for asylum seekers and to relax the stringent conditions forced on refugees.</p> <p>Bill Morris, Transport Union leader and self-proclaimed son of a Jamaican economic migrant, denounced the voucher system after accompanying Pedram, an Iranian asylum seeker, on his weekly shop in central Glasgow.</p> <p>Pedram, a 30-year-old GP and religious refugee from Tehran who entered Britain in June, has been surviving on \u00a326.34 in food vouchers and \u00a310 in cash a week and on charities.</p> <p>\"I am single but many of my friends are married and some are being forced to live on even less than I get,\" he said. \"They wonder whether they should leave Glasgow and get a job on the black market in London in order to survive.\"</p> <p>Displaying the cheap, \"value\" goods in his shopping bag, some of them reduced because they were close to their sell-by date, he said the vouchers put a barrier between asylum seekers and the rest of the community.</p> <p>\"Sooner or later we will be members of the community so we have got to know the rules, especially as we tend to come from non-democratic countries ... we don't seek people's mercy but just their help and we don't deserve their hatred and contempt which this system of vouchers intensifies.\"</p> <p>Mr Morris, who later electrified the congress with a call to stamp out racism, including within unions, condemned the system under which asylum seekers got no change from their vouchers.</p> <p>He also criticised the system whereby refugees got \u00a38 in exchange for a \u00a310 voucher on the black market. \"Whoever dreamed up the voucher system should be forced to live on it for a year.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We have got a government which is subsidising Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's, and that's not the redistribution of wealth I voted for on May 1 1997. This voucher system degrades our humanity and should be scrapped now.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Ellis, an Oxfam campaigns manager, said: \"It is outrageous that supermarkets are allowed to make a profit from one of the most vulnerable groups in our society.\"</p> <p>Mr Morris said Pedram (not his real name) could not afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, relying instead on tinned goods. At the check-out he was constantly looking over his shoulder to see who was watching him. \"The staff try to be friendly but this system is inherently stigmatising.\"</p> <p>Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the British Refugee Council, said: \"Every single day, asylum seekers are ringing us describing incidents of harassment and racism, children bullied at school, people being beaten up, houses being fire-bombed.\"</p> <p>Later, delegates were warned by John Monks, TUC general secretary, that they had a mountain to climb to combat racism within their own ranks. They reacted with shame and disgust as actors from the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, east London, read out harrowing accounts of discrimination given over the TUC's racism hotline.</p> <p>Mr Morris, introducing a motion condemning opposition leaders for fanning the flames of racism and demanding government action to abandon provisions of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, won a standing ovation for his impassioned plea for the government to give asylum seekers full human rights and to work for a greater understanding of the plight of refugees.</p> <p>\"When I hear the words bogus and flooding it sends a shiver down my spine. When I hear the words economic migrant, I think of my mother who came to Britain 46 years ago after the death of my father.</p> <p>\"She was an economic migrant. We were a family of economic migrants. As I look back I hope we have contributed more than we have taken from our great country,\" he said.</p> <p>Glenroy Watson, a London Underground worker and RMT rail union delegate, said he was an economic migrant too. \"My mother didn't come here for the lovely weather but to improve her standard of living - and human beings have the right to seek improvement.\"</p> <p>The TGWU-led motion, which the union is to submit to Labour's annual conference later this month, demands the scrapping of the plan to impose a \u00a310,000 bond on those seeking UK entry from certain countries as \"morally wrong and inherently racist\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's trade unions yesterday urged the government to end the \"humiliating and stigmatising\" system of food vouchers for asylum seekers and to relax the stringent conditions forced on refugees. Bill Morris, Transport Union leader and self-proclaimed son of a Jamaican economic migrant, denounced the voucher system after accompanying Pedram, an Iranian asylum seeker, on his weekly shop in central Glasgow. Pedram, a 30-year-old GP and religious refugee from Tehran who entered Britain in June, has been surviving on \u00a326.34 in food vouchers and \u00a310 in cash a week and on charities. \"I am single but many of my friends are married and some are being forced to live on even less than I get,\" he said. \"They wonder whether they should leave Glasgow and get a job on the black market in London in order to survive.\" Displaying the cheap, \"value\" goods in his shopping bag, some of them reduced because they were close to their sell-by date, he said the vouchers put a barrier between asylum seekers and the rest of the community. \"Sooner or later we will be members of the community so we have got to know the rules, especially as we tend to come from non-democratic countries ... we don't seek people's mercy but just their help and we don't deserve their hatred and contempt which this system of vouchers intensifies.\" Mr Morris, who later electrified the congress with a call to stamp out racism, including within unions, condemned the system under which asylum seekers got no change from their vouchers. He also criticised the system whereby refugees got \u00a38 in exchange for a \u00a310 voucher on the black market. \"Whoever dreamed up the voucher system should be forced to live on it for a year.\" He said: \"We have got a government which is subsidising Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's, and that's not the redistribution of wealth I voted for on May 1 1997. This voucher system degrades our humanity and should be scrapped now.\" Jonathan Ellis, an Oxfam campaigns manager, said: \"It is outrageous that supermarkets are allowed to make a profit from one of the most vulnerable groups in our society.\" Mr Morris said Pedram (not his real name) could not afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, relying instead on tinned goods. At the check-out he was constantly looking over his shoulder to see who was watching him. \"The staff try to be friendly but this system is inherently stigmatising.\" Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the British Refugee Council, said: \"Every single day, asylum seekers are ringing us describing incidents of harassment and racism, children bullied at school, people being beaten up, houses being fire-bombed.\" Later, delegates were warned by John Monks, TUC general secretary, that they had a mountain to climb to combat racism within their own ranks. They reacted with shame and disgust as actors from the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, east London, read out harrowing accounts of discrimination given over the TUC's racism hotline. Mr Morris, introducing a motion condemning opposition leaders for fanning the flames of racism and demanding government action to abandon provisions of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, won a standing ovation for his impassioned plea for the government to give asylum seekers full human rights and to work for a greater understanding of the plight of refugees. \"When I hear the words bogus and flooding it sends a shiver down my spine. When I hear the words economic migrant, I think of my mother who came to Britain 46 years ago after the death of my father. \"She was an economic migrant. We were a family of economic migrants. As I look back I hope we have contributed more than we have taken from our great country,\" he said. Glenroy Watson, a London Underground worker and RMT rail union delegate, said he was an economic migrant too. \"My mother didn't come here for the lovely weather but to improve her standard of living - and human beings have the right to seek improvement.\" The TGWU-led motion, which the union is to submit to Labour's annual conference later this month, demands the scrapping of the plan to impose a \u00a310,000 bond on those seeking UK entry from certain countries as \"morally wrong and inherently racist\".",

      "bodyText": "The first trials in China's biggest corruption scandal began yesterday under a veil of secrecy intended to minimising the Communist leadership's embarrassment. Court officers in Fujian province confirmed that proceedings had begun in the 50bn yuan (about \u00a34bn) smuggling case believed to involve up to 600 government officials, several of whom are likely to be sentenced to death. Some of the key figures in the scandal have fled overseas and there is widespread scepticism that others, who have close links to the leadership in Beijing, will be charged. The case centres on the smuggling of fuel, tobacco, cigarettes and rubber by the Yuanhua Group of Hong Kong, in cooperation with corrupt police, customs and party officials. The court building in Xiamen, one of the five centres where the trials are being held, was closed to everyone without official passes yesterday, including most of the court staff, in an effort to keep the proceedings secret. Internet chatrooms were buzzing with discussion of one of the country's biggest news stories of the year, but the mainland media were warned not to report the case without official approval. A duty officer at another court, in Zhangzhou, said it seemed \"very mysterious\". \"I heard that if they tried one person a day they would never get through this case in a year,\" a resident of Xiamen, Chen Changjian, said. So far the courts have confirmed very few prosecutions: six in Xiamen and a further 12 in Putian. They include Cao Xinghai, general manager of the Orient Group in Fujian, which is accused of providing the smugglers with trading documents in return for a nearly \u00a32m annual payoff. The head of Yuanhua, Lai Changqing, who is alleged to have spent heavily on official protection, fled China before he could be arrested and took refuge in either Burma or Canada, according to Hong Kong press reports. The deputy mayor of Xiamen, Lan Fu, reportedly made it to Australia. Other suspects seem to enjoy the protection of powerful patrons. When website reports linked the Beijing Communist party chief and politburo member Jia Jinglin, who is politically close to President Jiang Zemin, to the corruption investigation, the state propaganda machine was quick to clear him. There is no sign of any of the senior officials detained, including a former head of military intelligence, General Ji Shengde, and the immigration chief, Xu Ganlu, being brought to trial. There are unconfirmed reports that Beijing has decided to limit the political fallout by focusing on middle-rank provincial officials. Beijing has launched a highly publicised crackdown on corruption in recent months. President Jiang said it represents a \"life and death\" struggle for the party. In July a former vice-chairman of parliament, Cheng Kejie became the most senior official ever to be sentenced to death, and yesterday the state media reported that a corrupt cadre in Sichuan province had also been condemned. The Beijing Youth Daily predicted this week that 10 more would be executed after the latest trials. Other reports suggest that only four will face the death penalty, including a former Xiamen customs chief and a former provincial deputy director of police. Such an outcome will only increase the popular suspicion in China that lower-level officials are being made the scapegoats for the crimes of more senior leaders politically too well connected to be brought to justice. Nevertheless there is hope in Fujian that the trials will finally let the relatively prosperous province, which has benefited greatly from closer economic links with Taiwan, put away the scandal that has tainted its name. \"One thing I would like to stress is that Xiamen is not relying on smuggling to get rich,\" the city's new deputy mayor, Chen Conghui, said yesterday. \"If you cut off a branch infected with insects the health of the whole tree improves.\"",

They voted by a show of hands against re-electing chief executive Gavin Casey - and his future at the exchange was being decided by a poll vote to be announced later today. </p> <p>Don Cruickshank's position as chairman was passed, but it is also subject to a further vote. During the meeting Mr Cruickshank vigorously defended his position after this week's collapse of the merger which would have created an exchange called iX. </p> <p>On Tuesday it pulled out of the merger plans to concentrate on defending itself against the \u00a3808m hostile bid from Sweden's OM Gruppen. </p> <p>Mr Cruickshank told shareholders that the OM bid would offer \"exceptionally poor\" value and would fail totally to satisfy its customers. The LSE would be preparing a detailed defence over the next 10 days. </p> <p>Mr Cruickshank added: \"In the meantime, we shall continue to work on communicating better and on building trust between the company and its shareholders and customers. </p> <p>\"Warm words will not do. It's about delivering what we said we would do - whether it's something directly in management's control, like improving the efficiency of our markets, or whether it's not directly within management's control, like cross-border settlement costs.\"</p> <p>In withdrawing from the merger, the LSE had been responding to concerns about the impact the exchange would have on customers' business, he said. </p> <p>Mr Cruickshank said the LSE's markets had grown by 18% during the last decade. Group turnover had increased by 10% over the last three years from \u00a3146m to \u00a3176m. Pre-tax profits had grown sixfold in the same period from \u00a38m to \u00a349m.

      "bodyText": "The chairman of the London Stock Exchange today faced a barrage of criticism from shareholders over the failed merger with Germany's Deutsche Borse. At the group's annual meeting, shareholders expressed their anger with the recent decisions made by the board. They voted by a show of hands against re-electing chief executive Gavin Casey - and his future at the exchange was being decided by a poll vote to be announced later today. Don Cruickshank's position as chairman was passed, but it is also subject to a further vote. During the meeting Mr Cruickshank vigorously defended his position after this week's collapse of the merger which would have created an exchange called iX. On Tuesday it pulled out of the merger plans to concentrate on defending itself against the \u00a3808m hostile bid from Sweden's OM Gruppen. Mr Cruickshank told shareholders that the OM bid would offer \"exceptionally poor\" value and would fail totally to satisfy its customers. The LSE would be preparing a detailed defence over the next 10 days. Mr Cruickshank added: \"In the meantime, we shall continue to work on communicating better and on building trust between the company and its shareholders and customers. \"Warm words will not do. It's about delivering what we said we would do - whether it's something directly in management's control, like improving the efficiency of our markets, or whether it's not directly within management's control, like cross-border settlement costs.\" In withdrawing from the merger, the LSE had been responding to concerns about the impact the exchange would have on customers' business, he said. Mr Cruickshank said the LSE's markets had grown by 18% during the last decade. Group turnover had increased by 10% over the last three years from \u00a3146m to \u00a3176m. Pre-tax profits had grown sixfold in the same period from \u00a38m to \u00a349m. On the alternative investment market the number of trades by August 2000 was already double that for the whole of last year, he said. But shareholders were highly critical of the LSE board. One said: \"In the last few years the management and strategy errors have seemed to accelerate.\" Another said: \"A board which makes so many errors cannot expect to retain the confidence of shareholders.\"",

Steve Oram, director of the Newspaper Publishers Association, said that renewed optimism following the ending of the lorry drivers' blockade could be unfounded, with petrol supplies taking too long to trickle through. \"We rang the Department of Trade and Industry and told them about the gap between our current position and what it will be like when supplies eventually get through. We do not know how much fuel the hauliers have left,\" said Mr Oram. An emergency meeting between national newspaper circulation departments and newspaper associations was held this morning to draw up contingency plans for distributing weekend editions. Mr Oram would not reveal the emergency plans, but ruled out dropping magazines and supplements from the editions. David Newell, director of the Newspaper Society, which represents regional and local titles, is hoping the government will review its decision to give fuel priority to emergency services only. \"The situation will be containable provided the fuel gets through to distributors tomorrow,\" said Mr Newell.",

      "body": "<p>The paintings and engravings of Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes include some of the most terrifying visions in the history of art. Goya's early work, as Spain's court painter, is all rococo jollity and pastoral frolics, peasants dancing, Madrilenos picnicking. But as he got older, his perceptions became ever darker. He did a series of engravings, Los Caprichos (The Caprices, 1797-1799), whose nightmare imagery includes an artist collapsed over his work with the merciless eyes of owls and cats coming at him out of the night. The series is tagged with the legend: \"The sleep of reason produces monsters.\" Towards the end of his life, he covered the walls of his house outside Madrid with what would become known as his Black Paintings - horrid decorations, wide murals in which ugly faces approach from the surrounding darkness, witches gather around Satan, Christian pilgrims whose fervour looks like madness stumble towards us. </p> <p>What went on in Goya's long life (1746-1828) to produce these visions? In the winter of 1792, when he was in his late 40s, a serious illness left him deaf. Did this isolate and depress him? The fact that he still painted portraits and continued in his job as court painter suggests otherwise; but something changed. Perhaps it was not a turning away from society but a response to what went on around him. Goya saw Napoleon invade and the Spanish rise up, saw (or was told about) and later depicted the atrocities committed by both sides in the Peninsular War. Then, of course, there's that old standby, thwarted love. Did Goya's work turn dark because he was rejected by his young and beautiful patron, the Duchess of Alba? </p> <p>The Spanish director Carlos Saura attempts to answer this question in his latest film, Goya in Bordeaux. We first meet Goya, played by Francisco Rabal, as an old man in exile in France, where the liberal painter fled to avoid trouble from the reactionary regime in Spain after Napoleon's defeat. The scene shows Goya hallucinating his past; seeing himself working late at night on his Black Paintings, wearing a hat with candles in its rim (copied from a Goya self-portrait), wandering through a blue-tinted slide show of his Caprichos, and - the most obviously juicy titbit - enjoying an affair with the Duchess of Alba, the richest, most powerful and reputedly most beautiful woman in late 18th-century Spain. </p> <p>Goya filled a sketchbook with explicit images of the Duchess lifting up her skirts to show her backside, sitting naked in bed and arranging her hair in the morning. He painted her pointing to the ground where she has written the words \"Solo Goya\" (\"Only Goya\") in the sand. But there is no proof that they actually had a relationship. The art historian Janis Tomlinson is cruelly sceptical: \"It might be asked what the the 34-year-old beauty, recently widowed, would have seen in a 50-year-old artist, deaf and somewhat infirm.\" </p> <p>Saura has no doubts, however. He sees the Duchess of Alba as the key to Goya's life and art. He portrays her modelling for The Naked Maja (c1800), exchanging saucy remarks with the painter, and implies that all Goya's traumas were to do with losing her. Of all the explanations that have ever been offered for Goya's darkening palette, it's this did-they-didn't-they affair that seems to capture the imagination of film-makers - such as Bigas Luna in his recent Volaverunt </p> <p>Though Goya in Bordeaux does not provide the answer to this mystery, it is at least an improvement on The Naked Maja (1959), a vehicle for Ava Gardner in which Goya is portrayed as an untutored peasant whom the duchess transforms into a famous painter. A contemporary critic called it \"this travesty of Goya's life, country and period\". </p> <p>The lives of the great artists have provided cinema with some of its most hilarious moments, from Jose Ferrer shuffling on his knees as Toulouse-Lautrec in John Huston's Moulin Rouge (1952) to Anthony Hopkins as a Welsh Picasso in Merchant-Ivory's Surviving Picasso (1996) to the Pope remarking to Charlton Heston as Michelangelo in The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965): \"You dare to dicker with your pontiff?\" </p> <p>Yet there's an awful pleasure in watching even the worst of these films. Basquiat (1997), a film about the 80s New York painter Jean-Michel Basquiat made by fellow artist Julian Schnabel, tells us less about Basquiat's life than about the artworld monsters who surrounded him: David Bowie plays Andy Warhol, Dennis Hopper an art dealer and Gary Oldman a thinly disguised version of Schnabel himself. Even though this film was made by an artist it recycles the same cliched ideas of creativity and suffering. Basquiat is a genius, he dies young, but the details of his art are ignored. </p> <p>Paintings are intentionally mysterious things: they tell unfinished stories, reveal fragments of an unexplained visionary world that cannot be translated into words even by their creator. Yet there are great films about artists that seem to get inside their minds just by looking hard at the works of art. Alexander Korda's Rembrandt (1936) starring Charles Laughton is a case in point. Laughton must have spent hours looking at Rembrandt's self-portraits and thinking his flesh into Rembrandt's painted flesh, as he takes on the weary, vulnerable humanity of those paintings. </p> <p>Another example is Vincente Minnelli's Van Gogh biopic Lust for Life (1956), Hollywood's attempt to understand the cult of the expressive modern artist in post-war America; it was released in the year of Jackson Pollock's violent death. Its scene of Kirk Douglas shooting himself in a yellow cornfield menaced by crows is a brilliant dramatisation of Van Gogh's painting. Van Gogh's letters are read over much of the action and the film gives pride of place to his paintings. There have been more respectably arty attempts to film Van Gogh's life, including Robert Altman's Vincent and Theo (1990) but I'll stick with the humourless intensity of Minnelli's vision. </p> <p>The best film ever made about an artist, however, is not about an expressive modern western genius but about a 15th-century Russian icon painter and monk. Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev (1966) presents its subject as a mystery, his paintings as miracles. We witness atrocities culminating in the massacre of a congregation taking refuge in a church. Through all this Rublev is a near-silent figure. We don't see his paintings at all in the black-and-white film - until at the end it bursts into colour and the camera moves slowly over the surfaces of Rublev's real paintings, presenting a collage of gilded, enigmatic images. The film poses the question of the artist's responsibility to his own time: how should Rublev do the best for his society? In the end he can't just watch; he kills a man. As a monk, he condemns himself never to paint again in repentance for this intervention. </p> <p>The film Goya deserves would be as visionary as Tarkovsky's: it would let Goya's terrible (and lovely) images speak for themselves. The great Goya film was nearly made: in the 1920s, the Goya Society of Saragossa invited Luis Bunuel to make a film about his compatriot just before the director filmed Un Chien Andalou with Salvador Dali. If anyone could put the sleep of reason that produces monsters on screen, it was Bunuel. But the film never happened. </p> <p>The best moments in Saura's film submit to the sleep of reason. Goya is painting the terrifying murals in his house late at night and goes insane. People crawl around him in masks that make them look like the hideous mutants in the painting known as the Pilgrimage of St Isidore (c1821-3). In another scene, Goya's Naked Maja is shown illuminated at night in the house of a politician and art collector, using a strange apparatus, a primitive cinematic device that makes the paintings look like projections in darkness. This is what Goya's Black Paintings must have looked like to visitors to his house who saw them by candlelight in dark rooms. </p> <p>Art historians have even suggested that Goya's panoramic murals may even have been inspired by the Phantasmagoria - an early cinematic spectacle that came to Madrid from France in the years he was painting them. We can imagine these paintings as a kind of cinema before cinema, surrounding the spectator with images that seemed to leap out of the darkness on all sides - the Devil's Imax.</p>",

Art historians have even suggested that Goya's panoramic murals may even have been inspired by the Phantasmagoria - an early cinematic spectacle that came to Madrid from France in the years he was painting them. We can imagine these paintings as a kind of cinema before cinema, surrounding the spectator with images that seemed to leap out of the darkness on all sides - the Devil's Imax.",

      "body": "<p>Tim Adams: <strong>Explain the motivation behind the Richard Bachmann books. </strong> </p> <p>SK: I wanted to see what was in the name, but I also wanted to publish those books. They thought I would clog the market. They weren't really Stephen King books as it was then understood, they were short for a start. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Do you worry that there is an element of chance in your success? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Not worried, but curious. Curious to know whether there's something in me, or whether I just won the publishing lottery. And I guess its both. But primarily a lot of things came together for me at around the time of Carrie. The book, and the film that was successful. But even then I was not the blue-eyed boy of the season. Peter Benchley was. And where is he now? </p> <p>TA: <strong>Did you feel a pressure to repeat the success, after your career took off? </strong> </p> <p>SK: No it was always a pleasure to write. I can never think of a time when I just hacked something out to fulfil a contract or meet a deadline. I might have hacked things out, but it was always stuff I loved. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Did the alcohol ever get in the way? </strong> </p> <p>SK: With alcohol I was just an alcoholic personality. But it was a slow growing thing, compared to the drugs, that is I drank x amount in 1975 and in 1976 it was maybe x plus 20. </p> <p>TA: And always beer? </p> <p>SK: Well, beer was what I wanted, but if I couldn't get beer, I'd drink anything else really. The drugs were different. With cocaine, one snort, and it just owned me body and soul. Something in my system wanted that, and once cocaine was there it was like the missing link: click. Like when you turn on lights it's on or off, there's no half way. Cocaine was like my 'on' switch. I started in 79 I guess. Did it for about eight years. Not a terribly long time to be an addict I guess, but it is longer than World War II. [Laughs] And that's how it felt a lot of the time. I didn't really hide my drinking, but I hid my drugs because I knew right away it was a problem. Nobody lives one day at a time like a drug addict. You don't think yesterday or tomorrow. You just think now, where is it. I was high much of the eighties, and I'm not a very reflective person, so it never crossed my mind that it was an existential thing, or that it was wasteful or anything else. It was just what I was doing that day </p> <p>TA: <strong>In your book you talk about the effect drinking had on the books. What effect did it have on family? </strong></p> <p>SK: It's tough to say. I hid it pretty well, in that they never really knew what was distorting my mood. The tide goes in, the tide goes out and if you don't know that its the moon pulling those tides you still know when its safe to go to the beach. </p> <p>TA: Were you lucid most of the time? </p> <p>SK: My wife has told me since that I was hungover every mornng until about two in the afternoon, and from five until midnight I was drunk out of my mind. So she says there was this period of about three hours when she could talk to me like a rational human being... </p> <p>TA: That must have been pretty tough on her and the kids? </p> <p>SK: Well, I suppose it must have had an effect. I was never the guy who said 'lets have a gin and tonic before dinner.' I'd have to have like twelve gin and tonics and then I'd have to say 'fuck dinner' and have twelve more. So I guess that was difficult to live with from time to time. </p> <p>TA: Why did she stay with you? </p> <p>SK: Well she stuck. But she made it clear that she wouldn't stick if I didn't clean up my act... But that was after maybe twenty years. I mean the first time we ever went out I got loaded. </p> <p>TA: <strong> What kind of a drunk were you. Was Jack Torrance [of The Shining] for example, ever close to home? </strong> </p> <p>SK: It never about swinging from the chandeliers or throwing people through the window, or getting laid, or partying. I didn't go to bars much. One drunken asshole was all I could handle and that was me. I wrote. I don't remember a lot of it. The kids accepted my drinking as a part of life. Not a particularly pernicious part. I didn't beat up on them. Basically I don't think I was so different from a lot of dads who have three or four martinis when they get in from work, wine with dinner and so on. </p> <p>TA: Well, maybe a little different... </p> <p>SK: There's a story I loved about this big blizzard in 76, much worse than the perfect storm, it paralysed everything. The outside world looked like fucking Venus or something: no houses, just snow. Boston was shut down for 12 days and the commuter trains were stranded, and the commuters were taken to school gymnasiums. And that night, the police were forced to break into liquor stores, no word of a lie, because these businessmen were getting delirium tremors, they were scaring the children, because they were not used to life where they couldn't get a shot of whiskey at five or six o'clock. So its a fairly oiled society. And I wasn't much more out of control than anyone else. </p> <p>TA: <strong>What about your health... have their been lasting effects? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I like to think my coke addiction was a blessing in disguise, because I think without coke, I'd have gone on drinking until about the age of fifty-five and it would have been in the New York Times, 'writer Steven King dies of stroke'. Once you add the coke, you eventiually tip over, because I know from experience that stuff eats you from the inside out... </p> <p>TA: <strong>When that point came, when your wife emptied all your empties and crap on floor in 1987, did you clean up straight away? </strong></p> <p>SK: Not really... At that time I was this very successful author, and that kind of success does not really lead you humbly to say 'yeah, I guess you're right. I'm an asshole.' It rather leads you to say 'who the fuck are you to tell me to settle down. Don't you understand? I'm king of the fucking universe, you know. So it took me about a year to get my shit together, get back on track. The worst of it was 87 to 88 when I was looking for a detente, a way I could live with booze and drugs without giving them up altogether. Needless to say I was not successful in this. </p> <p>TA: <strong>But the writng stayed constant throughout this time? </strong></p> <p>SK: There were nine months when I was out of gas, depressed. And despite what some people say depression is not conducive to good writing or to bad writing. But then it came back. When I gave up dope and alcohol, my immediate feeling was 'I've saved my life, but there'll be a price because I'll have nothing that buzzes me any more. But I enjoyed my kids. My wife loved me and I loved her. And eventually the writing came back and I discovered that the writing was enough. Stupid thing is that probably it always had been. </p> <p>TA: <strong>After the accident were you tempted to back to drinking? </strong></p> <p>SK: Nah never. If that guy had hit me in 1986 he'd have killed me on the spot because my body was already fucked then, but I was in pretty good shape when he hit me, I exercised a lot. You come out of something like that and you don't think about alcohol. You think about how you hurt like a bastard all the time. </p> <p>TA: <strong>When you are fit I understand you plan to take it out on the truck that hit you. Do you feel the same way about its driver? </strong></p> <p>SK: Well, this is a guy who only has a little bit of brains. I can't blame the guy. If he'd hit me on purpose sure. I mean I sometimes have fantasies about confronting the guy. But Brian Smith is like Gertrude Stein said about LA: 'There's no there, there'. </p> <p>TA: <strong>It almost seemed scripted, the whole accident in a grim kind of way. Has it changed your ideas of fate? </strong></p> <p>SK: That a big question, Tim. I don't know. I lean more toward the idea that some force is running things than not. Call it fate, call it god. There are so many things: if I'd left the house five minutes later, or if Tabby had come along as she often did, and maybe I'm then walking a little further out on the shoulder; you go on with the variables. So what you're left with is this guy who hits me on an empty road when say NASA can't get a missile to land on Mars with all the brains and technology in the world, then maybe you think there's something going on. Or maybe NASA should just hire Brian Smith. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Has the accident given you a new subject? </strong></p> <p>SK: It's given me new things to write about, sure. Gruesome though it is to say. you have to put it to work for you. Otherwise it doesn't mean anything. And jeez I could probably walk a mile wihtout the crutch. So that's OK. I'm fine. </p> <p>TA: <strong>You must feel differently about death too? </strong></p> <p>SK: In a way you sort of feel like you have a free pass. the number next to yours came up. You missed the draft. </p> <p>[Break. King goes to next door office to answer phone] </p> <p>TA: <strong>What made you want to publish yourself on the internet? </strong></p> <p>SK: I did it once before with 'Riding the Bullet'. That had 500,000 hits but in some cases they gave the thing away, trying to pump e-book readers. It was encrypted, but it broke down under the weight of the encryption. It was like a fucking dinosaur. And that drove me crazy. But the publisher loved that part. They say, like a rallying cry, \"Don't get napstered\". Don't let the fruits of your artistic endeavour, ie our money, get stolen. You know as well as I do that publishers, music publishers, studio heads, they could not give a shit for the writer, the creator. They care about their bankbooks and that's about all they care about. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Have you been frustrated over the years with the way you have been published? </strong></p> <p>SK: Ohhh. The short answer is no. I've tried in a polite way to work against that. If I see the red gels and the underlighting come out when someone comes to photograph me, I walk out these days. All that shit to make me look spooky. I ask them if when they are photographing a black writer they bring a watermelon and a barrel for him to sit on, you know. It's degrading to be treated as someone who's one dimensional. But you've got to be careful if you go down that route. Once they decide you're a whore, they want to put you in a skirt don't they?' </p> <p>TA: <strong>So The Plant was a response to that? </strong></p> <p>SK: I thought I'd just put it out on the website. Marsha [his assistant] is coming along in a moment to help me put the first chapter on just now. Can you steal it? Yes. Do you have to lie to steal it? Yes. So if you feel good about cheating me out of a buck go ahead. I'm as nervous as I was before we did the serial novel The Green Mile... Its been a headache and a hassle for me because there's a lot of people on the publishing side who hope I will fail. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Do you see the era of the book coming to an end? </strong></p> <p>SK: I like books, and I think publishing is vital and that books will continue to be the most important cultural touchstone of our society for years. There's all these guys, these Kingsley Amis kind of guys, who for years have been saying, you know: 'books are dead, society going down hill, blah blah, cultural wasteland, idiots, idiots, TV, pop music, degradation' and then something comes along like Harry Potter, fucking thing is 734 pages long, and it sells five million copies in twelve hours. That's up there with Britney Spears and Eminem. So the only recourse these people have is to say [Kingsley again...] 'well, JK Rowlings or Stephen King is not Literature.' Well, I'm sorry! It may not be Literature in their terms but it's sure as hell a few rungs up from 'The Real Slim Shady', and that's from someone who loves that Eminem album... The age of the book is not over. No way... But maybe the age of some books is over. People say to me sometimes 'Steve, are you ever going to write a straight novel, a serious novel and by that they mean a novel about college professors who are having impotence problems or something like that. And I have to say those things just don't interest me. Why? I don't know. But it took me about twenty years to get over that question, and not be kind of ashamed about what I do, of the books I write... There'll always be a market for shit, of course. Just look at Jeffrey Archer! He writes like old people fuck doesn't he?</p>",

It may not be Literature in their terms but it's sure as hell a few rungs up from 'The Real Slim Shady', and that's from someone who loves that Eminem album... The age of the book is not over. No way... But maybe the age of some books is over. People say to me sometimes 'Steve, are you ever going to write a straight novel, a serious novel and by that they mean a novel about college professors who are having impotence problems or something like that. And I have to say those things just don't interest me. Why? I don't know. But it took me about twenty years to get over that question, and not be kind of ashamed about what I do, of the books I write... There'll always be a market for shit, of course. Just look at Jeffrey Archer! He writes like old people fuck doesn't he?",

      "body": "<p>Tim Adams: <strong>You've just come from the hospital, how are you feeling now?</strong></p> <p> Stephen King: I'm great in lots of ways. I'm still getting what they call chronic pain in the leg and the hip, but I'm getting a lot of motion back... When I drove up here when you get out, you're totally stiff. It's like my body is 52 years old except for my hip where it's about 85 now. I never think anymore 'I'm going to New York,' its like 'I'm taking my leg to New York.' But I've been off crutches for two or three weeks now... </p> <p>TA: Do you need to have more surgery and so on? </p> <p>SK: The doctor just did some more X-rays. They always get around to blaming you. 'All that metal,' he says 'wouldn't bother you so much if you were heavier, if you had fat over that part of your body...' So it's my fault for not gaining weight... </p> <p>TA: <strong>I really enjoyed your memoir [On Writing], did you find it hard to write? </strong> </p> <p>SK: It was a lot harder to write than I thought it would be. For years I've had people saying to me how do you do this or that. And so I thought I'll write a book and I won't have to answer these same questions over and over anymore. I got about 150 pages in and then what I wanted to say kind of drifted away from me, and I stopped and then I was about ready to go back to it when I had the accident. </p> <p>TA: How did it compare to writing fiction? </p> <p>SK: One of the things that happened half way through the writing book was that there was a novel I really wanted to write. I mean its like sex in a way: you'd rather do it than write about it. But I hope the book will be valuable. I sort of hope it will be a renegade primer. I don't think teachers will get away with assigning it to 13 year olds, but I hope the 13 year olds will find it on their own. </p> <p>TA: <strong>What made you want to include the autbiographical elements of the book? </strong> SK: I wanted to address that central question: why do you write the awful things that you write? and there's no direct way to answer that question, in a way its like saying 'why do you like broccoli?' You can't explain that, its wired into your system, it's genetic. But I think there are a set of experiences that turn a potential writer into a working writer, and then there are places in your life were you start to recognise what you want to do. </p> <p>TA: Was it a therapeutic thing to do? </p> <p>SK: I wasn't trying to clear things up with this book. I'm not a big fan of psychoanalysis: I think if you have mental problems what you need are good pills. But I do think that if you have thinks that bother you, things that are unresolved, the more that you talk about them, write about them, the less serious they become. At least that's how I see my work in retrospect. [Laughs] This was not an attenmpt to write about my life, but in a way I can't separate, of course, the life from the work. I called the first section of the book CV because I wanted to say, here are my references, 'here's where I've been. This is how I got here.' </p> <p>TA:<strong> What else have you been working on? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I've been finishing a novel called Dreamcatcher, and I'm working on a book with Peter Straub called Talisman II </p> <p>TA: How does that colaboration work? </p> <p>SK: It's like playing tennis, we drew the court, a synopsis, and now we just bat this thing back to each other on e-mail </p> <p>TA: Whose voice dominates? </p> <p>SK: At the moment to me the voice that this book has seems more Peter Straub, so I'm trying to wrestle it back a bit... </p> <p>TA: <strong>You seem at pains to try new things. Before your accident you were talking about giving up writing all together. Is that still a possibility? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Well, I'm like a drug addict, I'm always saying I'm going to stop, and then I don't, what I've said consistently is that I hope I know when to stop: when it starts to get repetitive. And I do know that I'm a lot closer to the end than I am to the beginning. I have these Dark Tower books that I'd like to finish, but then things come along and you get interested in them. </p> <p>TA: What kind of things? </p> <p>SK: There's this rock and roll guy, John Mellenkamp, he got in touch with me last November and said 'I have an idea for a musical, a play,' so he came over to the house, tuned my guitar for me - and it never sounded better - and he told me this story, a ghost story, sounded great. So then we kind of worked something out. So now he's sent me a CD of a demo he'd done. So I got charged up by that. I've never written for music... And if you want ghosts I guess I'm the \"go to\" guy... I don't have a problem with that, but I am interested in trying new things. For a long time I've thought about the stage. Misery, for example, is almost a play in a book. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Are you still finding time to play your own music? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Well The Remainders are going to go out this fall and play with Roger McGuinn of The Byrds. Very odd. So no, I'm not playing enough really. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Did you dream of being a rock star as a kid? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I was never really good enough. I played keyboards in a group, and I played a lot of coffee house guitar, you know in that period when Donovan was into his denim look. And then I didn't play for a long time. Then we got the band together for the American Booksellers convention in 93, and after a while we got pretty good, to the extent that drunks wouldn't throw things at us. Probably. </p> <p>TA: What's your repertoire? </p> <p>SK: We do American garage music from the sixties; 'Louie, louie'. They get me to do things like 'Last Kiss' a lot of Bo Diddely stuff... </p> <p>TA: <strong>Reading your book, it seems that there was never a doubt you'd become a storyteller. It feels very much like a writer's childhood. </strong> </p> <p>SK: I was talking about this with my daughter in law recently. We once gave my son a sax, because he had an idea he wanted to be in the E Street Band, but he never really wanted to play. You've got to be hungry for it. My mother said that when she was pregnant with me she'd go out to the road and take the tar up, and chew the tar, because there was something in that tar, that, she, I, needed. It's like a craving. We like to think about how smart we are. But I think talent as a writer is hard-wired in, it's all there, at least the basic elements of it. You can't change it any more than you can choose whether to be right handed or left handed. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Your dad wrote stories, do you think some of your talent was inherited? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I never saw any of my dad's stories. My mother said he had piles and piles of manuscripts. He was in the merchant marine before that. And he used to send these things to magazines like Argosy, and True. Magazines that don't really have an equivalent now, with, like, pictures on the front of guys fighting off grizzly bears with knives. But I never knew that till later... Both of my sons write fiction. My wife's published five novels, and I've done 35 or 36. It's a gene, like the colour of your eyes...' </p> <p>TA: <strong>Do you think in that sense genetics has altered our ideas of fate, suggested our lives are predetermined? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I don't know. To a degree. But still there are all sorts of possible variations. Our daughter, for example, is in Divinity School. </p> <p>TA: <strong>What kind of stuff do your sons write? </strong></p> <p>SK: My younger son is on the fiction program at Columbia grad school. He writes stuff somewhere between bret Easton Ellis and Laverne and Shirley, I guess. Funny, cockeyed stuff. Like that guy T. Coraghessan Boyle... My elder son does a lot of different stuff. Crazy stuff, but great.. </p> <p>TA: Did you encourage or dissaude them from writing? </p> <p>SK: I wouldn't want to be blocking their sun, so to speak, but writing is a great job, no heavy lifting, though the pay for most writers isn't that great, but still, hey, its great, its fine... </p> <p>TA: <strong>You seemed incredibly driven from the time you started out... Were there ever periods of doubt, when you thought it might not happen? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I had a period where I thought I might not be good enough to publish. I started to sell short fiction to men's magazines while I was in college. I got married six or seven months after graduating, and for two years I sold maybe six stories a year, and I had the money I was making teaching, too, and it was a decent income. And then I sort of got out of the Zone. And for a year or so, I couldn't sell anything, and I was drinking a lot, wasn't drugging, couldn't afford it, and I was writing mostly shit, and then Carrie came along and I was OK again. But during that one year, I just thought I'm going to be a high school teacher, and nothing's ever going to happen to me. </p> <p>TA:<strong> Can you remember the point where the drinking became a problem? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Well I always drank, from when it was legal for me to drink. And there was never a time for me when the goal wasn't to get as hammered as I could possibly afford to. I never understood social drinking, that's always seemed to me like kissing your sister. To this day I can't imagine why anyone wants to be a social drinker. </p> <p>TA: <strong>There seemed to be a lot of anger in you in your teenage years. Was the drinking a symptom of that? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Not really. I had a very innocent childhood. Very bucolic. I grew up in a small town. Innocence would describe it. No drugs, no needles, no gang fights. It was a big deal for us if our parents were out and we could play spin the bottle with the girls. Put a few records on. The Sting Rays would play Saturday nights at the Grange Hall. </p> <p>TA: <strong>So where did the darkness of some thing like Rage come from? </strong></p> <p>SK: I was 18 when I wrote that. I was coming out of the high school experience. I think anger is a key or governing emotion in boys from say 14 to 18. A lot of rage, a lot of hormones. The only reason I think that in England there haven't been Eric Harrises and Dylan Kliebolds, you know the kids who cleaned up Columbine High is that English kids don't have access to guns. It's interesting if you go back to a high school reunion, and this happened to me. There were women at this reunion who, you know, as a 15 or 16 year old girls I felt like throwing myself at their feet yelling about their beauty or something. And they will talk about those times now and say that they felt ugly and they didn't have any friends and everyone was talking behind their backs. </p> <p>TA: If only you'd known then... </p> <p>SK [Laughs]: Exactly. But everyone has that rage, has that insecurity. Rage allows people to find some catharsis </p> <p>TA: <strong>It sounds like you were sort of on the edge of things at school. Both an insider and an outsider...</strong> </p> <p>SK: That's exactly right. I was in enough to get along with people. I was never socially inarticulate. Not a loner. And that saved my life, saved my sanity. That and the writing. But to this day I distrust anybody who thought school was a good time. ANYBODY. You can be happy at 8 or even at 28. But if you say you were happy at 16, I'd say you were a fucking liar, or you were abnormal, disturbed... </p> <p>TA: <strong>What was the motivation behind you keeping a scrapbook on Charlie Starkweather, the serial killer? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Well, it was never like 'Yeah go Charlie, kill some more.' It was more like 'Charlie: if I ever see anyone like you, I'll be able to get the hell away.' And I do think that the very first time I saw a picture of him, I knew I was looking at the future. His eyes were a double zero. There was just nothing there. He was like an outrider of What America might become. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Do you think that impulse - to keep the scrapbook - was a similar one to that which prompted you to write? </strong> </p> <p>SK: The writing was an outlet certainly. I was always fascinated by tales of violence and suspense and horror. Now maybe that's because I have a particular double x chromosome, or something, and maybe if it wasn't for the writing I would be an extremely dangerous person. Certainly I've written enough really nasty stuff to make that a possiblity. But I've tried to be a good citizen, in the sense that I had an ability to talk about these things, and as long as you can keep talking everything will be OK... </p> <p>TA: <strong>Were you ever consciously writing visions of the American future? </strong> </p> <p>SK: No it was always more about situational stuff. Take Rage, it was like what happens if you take a kid, give him a gun, and put him in the class. And then you think well what kind of a kid would do that. And you think well, fucked up, probably, and brilliant, probably. and then you work the whole thing out. The book was the Stockholm Syndrome before the Stockholm Syndrome. These kids all start to swing over to his side. The supposition of the book is that kids at 16 are crazy. Essentially crazy. And I think they are... </p> <p>TA: <strong>Was Lord of the Flies a big influence? </strong> </p> <p>SK: It was. It had a strong influence.. </p> <p>TA: <strong>To what extent did you feel you inhabited a character like Charlie Decker in Rage. Or did he inhabit you? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Was Charlie Decker me? Well yes of course in that all the characters are me. The women are me in skirts I guess. But there's another element involved. It's that element of inspiration which lifts you past the point where the characters are just you, where you do achieve something almost transcendental and the people are really people in the story. They walk off. That happened the first time in Rage. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Can you create the conditions for that imaginative leap to happen. Can you predict it? </strong> </p> <p>SK: It usually takes you by surprise. When I sat down to work on Dreamcatcher I was in terrible pain, taking all these heavy drugs by the jarful, and I was on crutches, a brace on my leg, and all I knew was when I went to bed at night, I would lie there and I'd think of this guy on a hunter stand, in a tree, like a shooter's platform, where you go when you've been hurt sometimes. And I thought here's this guy, it's starting to snow, he wants to get his deer because it's hunting season, and here comes this thing he thinks is a deer, but it's a person... That's all I had. I didn't know more than that. And I started to write it long hand, not expecting much, hoping it might help with the pain a bit. And suddenly I had this huge, huge book, a thousand pages long. All out of that one situation. </p> <p>TA: <strong>So the story was really a metaphor for your own pain? </strong> </p> <p>SK: It's related in two ways. The character in the tree stand had been hit by a car and was recuperating, I knew how that felt. And then when I wrote about it, I didn't think about the pain as much. It's like being hypnotised... </p> <p>TA: <strong>Do you ever fear what might come out when you are in that state? </strong> </p> <p>SK: On a couple of occasions I've shocked myself. Pet Sematery was appalling when it first came out on to the page. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Is there ever a self-censor at work? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I think I've pretty much stunned him into submission [Laughs]... </p> <p>TA: <strong>You must, in that sense have great faith in human nature, trusting yor instincts. </strong> </p> <p>SK: To some degree. There are things in Dreamcatcher which has become an extremely gruesome book, where I found myself pulling back a bit. But I'm older now, it's a bit harder to do that stuff. Still, I'd hate to think I'd got so case-hardened I couldn't scare myself. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Has it become harder to stay ahead of real life horrors? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Well certainly since I've been writing, I don't think that society has become any finer. Have you seen that programme Survivor. Pretty close to Lord of the Flies. They kick one guy off the island every week. They don't actually chase him with sharpened sticks, but you get the feeling they'd kind of like to. I started a book like that about 15 years ago. It was called On the island, and it was about rich people who talked these street kids into going to an island and being hunted, with paintballs. And they get there and they find these guys are actually shooting live rounds,and in my story there were two or three who escaped and waited for these rich guys to come back. I've got it on the shelf somewhere. Survivor is a sort of a Stephen King idea, and its a huge hit. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Is there a satirical element in books like that? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I'm not a satirist. I have a sense of humour but I'm very much an American, and in love with my country for better or worse. I'm in this cultre up to my eyeballs. New York isn't America. LA isn't America. This is America. New york is just buzz, just this gaseous hype, there's no story there, not really. The stories are all here, if you know where to look. I can't satirise my fellow Americans. I am them. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Do you get away from Maine much? </strong> </p> <p>SK: My wife and I have got a place in Florida. So we've been down there. Still we are here eight, nine months of the year. I think there was a time when I liked New York and LA more. When I'm in Bangor people treat me as a neighbour not as a celebrity freak with two heads, and that's too good to give up. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Is that one of the reasons, do you think, for the tremendous loyalty of your readership? </strong> </p> <p>SK: I'm the literary version of the Grateful Dead, I guess... </p> <p>TA: <strong>No one else, no other novelist really, has such a loyal following... What do you put that down to? </strong> </p> <p>SK: John Grisham's only been in the business ten years... But, no, he doesn't really have that connection. It really is a kind of Jerry Garcia phenomenon. Whatever they are getting from me in the stories, from my voice, is something that makes them feel comfortable, safe. And that's funny when you think what it is I write. But that has to be the case. </p> <p>TA:<strong> Do you ever fear your stories will get into the wrong heads? </strong> </p> <p>SK: Every now and then something strange will happen. Some years ago I went to Philadephia with my son to see a basketball game. Tabby was here, and she heard the windonw break and there was this guy there and he claimed he had a bomb (in fact it was a bunch of pencils and erasers and stuff and paperclips). He was an escapee from a mental instititution and he had this rant about how I'd stolen Misery from him. Tabby fled in her bathrobe and the police came... And every now and then there'll be a letter from someone who is obviously out there in the ozone, people who are convinced I've stolen their ideas. One lady wrote to explain how I had overflown her house in a U2 plane and stolen her thoughts for The Shining. But no one has ever actually threatened to kill me, knock on wood. Though there's a guy out in California, Steven lightfoot, who believes that me and Ronald Reagan conspired to kill John lennon... </p> <p>TA: Do you get paranoid about such things? </p> <p>SK: No. I'm not afraid of unusual things. I'm not a compulsive hand-washer, I don't think there are aliens hearing our thoughts, and I don't think anyone is coming to kill me. There are things I've used that I am afraid of or revolted by: spiders, bats. So no I'm not unusual in that way. </p> <p>TA: <strong>Reading you book your uncles and aunt seemed tremendous characters. </strong> SK: Everybody that I knew told stories it seemed, or maybe I just liked the stories and remembered them. </p> <p>TA: Did they tell stories about yor Dad? </p> <p>SK: No he was like an unperson. </p> <p>TA: Did you want to hear more stuff about him? </p> <p>SK: I think we were ashamed not to have a father. I think my mother was deeply ashamed to have been left, with these two young boys, when her other sisters kept their husbands. And I think shame is the most readily communicable of emotions and I think she communicated that shame to us. When we went off to school I can remember her very clearly saying to us, 'now, if anybody asks about your father, tell them he's in the navy. That's not a lie.' Now it wasn't a lie as far as we knew. But I got the point. I did have a father. No I wasn't a bastard. So that's what I said word for word and, of course, there was never any divorce either. </p> <p>TA: Did you never attempt to find out what happened to him? </p> <p>SK: Well we did find him, actually. My brother found him. What happened was this. The CBS TV network does these celebrity bios, they're generally unauthorised, but they are softball, they don't give you a hard time. They did one about me a little while ago, and they talked to my brother, and my brother had, he remembered, my dad's social security number, and one of these documentary guys went out and found him... Or I should say at least he found out what had happened to him. My father, it turned out, apparently died in Pennsylvania in the mid-eighties. We even got some pictures of him. He had started a new family: three boys and a girl. My half brothers and my half sister. </p> <p>TA: You've never met? </p> <p>SK: Not at all. No. Never. They don't know of my existence, and I think that's the way it should be.' </p> <p>TA: Why? </p> <p>SK: Well, the woman that my father married, and remember he never divorced my mother, the woman was a Brazilian - very beautiful from the pictures I saw - and its reasonable to assume she was Catholic. In that case bigamy is a very serious thing, and it would have serious consequences for those children, and I couldn't do that to them, couldn't bring that knowledge. Let sleeping dogs lie, I say... I haven't talked about all this before because I don't want that story widely published in the United States, for obvious reasons...' </p> <p>[Goes next door for a few moments] </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/stephenking/story/0,7763,368466,00.html\">Stephen King interview part two</a></p>",

So then we kind of worked something out. So now he's sent me a CD of a demo he'd done. So I got charged up by that. I've never written for music... And if you want ghosts I guess I'm the \"go to\" guy... I don't have a problem with that, but I am interested in trying new things. For a long time I've thought about the stage. Misery, for example, is almost a play in a book. TA: Are you still finding time to play your own music? SK: Well The Remainders are going to go out this fall and play with Roger McGuinn of The Byrds. Very odd. So no, I'm not playing enough really. TA: Did you dream of being a rock star as a kid? SK: I was never really good enough. I played keyboards in a group, and I played a lot of coffee house guitar, you know in that period when Donovan was into his denim look. And then I didn't play for a long time. Then we got the band together for the American Booksellers convention in 93, and after a while we got pretty good, to the extent that drunks wouldn't throw things at us. Probably. TA: What's your repertoire? SK: We do American garage music from the sixties; 'Louie, louie'. They get me to do things like 'Last Kiss' a lot of Bo Diddely stuff... TA: Reading your book, it seems that there was never a doubt you'd become a storyteller. It feels very much like a writer's childhood. SK: I was talking about this with my daughter in law recently. We once gave my son a sax, because he had an idea he wanted to be in the E Street Band, but he never really wanted to play. You've got to be hungry for it. My mother said that when she was pregnant with me she'd go out to the road and take the tar up, and chew the tar, because there was something in that tar, that, she, I, needed. It's like a craving. We like to think about how smart we are. But I think talent as a writer is hard-wired in, it's all there, at least the basic elements of it. You can't change it any more than you can choose whether to be right handed or left handed. TA: Your dad wrote stories, do you think some of your talent was inherited? SK: I never saw any of my dad's stories. My mother said he had piles and piles of manuscripts. He was in the merchant marine before that. And he used to send these things to magazines like Argosy, and True. Magazines that don't really have an equivalent now, with, like, pictures on the front of guys fighting off grizzly bears with knives. But I never knew that till later... Both of my sons write fiction. My wife's published five novels, and I've done 35 or 36. It's a gene, like the colour of your eyes...' TA: Do you think in that sense genetics has altered our ideas of fate, suggested our lives are predetermined? SK: I don't know. To a degree. But still there are all sorts of possible variations. Our daughter, for example, is in Divinity School. TA: What kind of stuff do your sons write? SK: My younger son is on the fiction program at Columbia grad school. He writes stuff somewhere between bret Easton Ellis and Laverne and Shirley, I guess. Funny, cockeyed stuff. Like that guy T. Coraghessan Boyle... My elder son does a lot of different stuff. Crazy stuff, but great.. TA: Did you encourage or dissaude them from writing? SK: I wouldn't want to be blocking their sun, so to speak, but writing is a great job, no heavy lifting, though the pay for most writers isn't that great, but still, hey, its great, its fine... TA: You seemed incredibly driven from the time you started out... Were there ever periods of doubt, when you thought it might not happen? SK: I had a period where I thought I might not be good enough to publish. I started to sell short fiction to men's magazines while I was in college. I got married six or seven months after graduating, and for two years I sold maybe six stories a year, and I had the money I was making teaching, too, and it was a decent income. And then I sort of got out of the Zone. And for a year or so, I couldn't sell anything, and I was drinking a lot, wasn't drugging, couldn't afford it, and I was writing mostly shit, and then Carrie came along and I was OK again. But during that one year, I just thought I'm going to be a high school teacher, and nothing's ever going to happen to me. TA: Can you remember the point where the drinking became a problem? SK: Well I always drank, from when it was legal for me to drink. And there was never a time for me when the goal wasn't to get as hammered as I could possibly afford to. I never understood social drinking, that's always seemed to me like kissing your sister. To this day I can't imagine why anyone wants to be a social drinker. TA: There seemed to be a lot of anger in you in your teenage years. Was the drinking a symptom of that? SK: Not really. I had a very innocent childhood. Very bucolic. I grew up in a small town. Innocence would describe it. No drugs, no needles, no gang fights. It was a big deal for us if our parents were out and we could play spin the bottle with the girls. Put a few records on. The Sting Rays would play Saturday nights at the Grange Hall. TA: So where did the darkness of some thing like Rage come from? SK: I was 18 when I wrote that. I was coming out of the high school experience. I think anger is a key or governing emotion in boys from say 14 to 18. A lot of rage, a lot of hormones. The only reason I think that in England there haven't been Eric Harrises and Dylan Kliebolds, you know the kids who cleaned up Columbine High is that English kids don't have access to guns. It's interesting if you go back to a high school reunion, and this happened to me. There were women at this reunion who, you know, as a 15 or 16 year old girls I felt like throwing myself at their feet yelling about their beauty or something. And they will talk about those times now and say that they felt ugly and they didn't have any friends and everyone was talking behind their backs. TA: If only you'd known then... SK [Laughs]: Exactly. But everyone has that rage, has that insecurity. Rage allows people to find some catharsis TA: It sounds like you were sort of on the edge of things at school. Both an insider and an outsider... SK: That's exactly right. I was in enough to get along with people. I was never socially inarticulate. Not a loner. And that saved my life, saved my sanity. That and the writing. But to this day I distrust anybody who thought school was a good time. ANYBODY. You can be happy at 8 or even at 28. But if you say you were happy at 16, I'd say you were a fucking liar, or you were abnormal, disturbed... TA: What was the motivation behind you keeping a scrapbook on Charlie Starkweather, the serial killer? SK: Well, it was never like 'Yeah go Charlie, kill some more.' It was more like 'Charlie: if I ever see anyone like you, I'll be able to get the hell away.' And I do think that the very first time I saw a picture of him, I knew I was looking at the future. His eyes were a double zero. There was just nothing there. He was like an outrider of What America might become. TA: Do you think that impulse - to keep the scrapbook - was a similar one to that which prompted you to write? SK: The writing was an outlet certainly. I was always fascinated by tales of violence and suspense and horror. Now maybe that's because I have a particular double x chromosome, or something, and maybe if it wasn't for the writing I would be an extremely dangerous person. Certainly I've written enough really nasty stuff to make that a possiblity. But I've tried to be a good citizen, in the sense that I had an ability to talk about these things, and as long as you can keep talking everything will be OK... TA: Were you ever consciously writing visions of the American future? SK: No it was always more about situational stuff. Take Rage, it was like what happens if you take a kid, give him a gun, and put him in the class. And then you think well what kind of a kid would do that. And you think well, fucked up, probably, and brilliant, probably. and then you work the whole thing out. The book was the Stockholm Syndrome before the Stockholm Syndrome. These kids all start to swing over to his side. The supposition of the book is that kids at 16 are crazy. Essentially crazy. And I think they are... TA: Was Lord of the Flies a big influence? SK: It was. It had a strong influence.. TA: To what extent did you feel you inhabited a character like Charlie Decker in Rage. Or did he inhabit you? SK: Was Charlie Decker me? Well yes of course in that all the characters are me. The women are me in skirts I guess. But there's another element involved. It's that element of inspiration which lifts you past the point where the characters are just you, where you do achieve something almost transcendental and the people are really people in the story. They walk off. That happened the first time in Rage. TA: Can you create the conditions for that imaginative leap to happen. Can you predict it? SK: It usually takes you by surprise. When I sat down to work on Dreamcatcher I was in terrible pain, taking all these heavy drugs by the jarful, and I was on crutches, a brace on my leg, and all I knew was when I went to bed at night, I would lie there and I'd think of this guy on a hunter stand, in a tree, like a shooter's platform, where you go when you've been hurt sometimes. And I thought here's this guy, it's starting to snow, he wants to get his deer because it's hunting season, and here comes this thing he thinks is a deer, but it's a person... That's all I had. I didn't know more than that. And I started to write it long hand, not expecting much, hoping it might help with the pain a bit. And suddenly I had this huge, huge book, a thousand pages long. All out of that one situation. TA: So the story was really a metaphor for your own pain? SK: It's related in two ways. The character in the tree stand had been hit by a car and was recuperating, I knew how that felt. And then when I wrote about it, I didn't think about the pain as much. It's like being hypnotised... TA: Do you ever fear what might come out when you are in that state? SK: On a couple of occasions I've shocked myself. Pet Sematery was appalling when it first came out on to the page. TA: Is there ever a self-censor at work? SK: I think I've pretty much stunned him into submission [Laughs]... TA: You must, in that sense have great faith in human nature, trusting yor instincts. SK: To some degree. There are things in Dreamcatcher which has become an extremely gruesome book, where I found myself pulling back a bit. But I'm older now, it's a bit harder to do that stuff. Still, I'd hate to think I'd got so case-hardened I couldn't scare myself. TA: Has it become harder to stay ahead of real life horrors? SK: Well certainly since I've been writing, I don't think that society has become any finer. Have you seen that programme Survivor. Pretty close to Lord of the Flies. They kick one guy off the island every week. They don't actually chase him with sharpened sticks, but you get the feeling they'd kind of like to. I started a book like that about 15 years ago. It was called On the island, and it was about rich people who talked these street kids into going to an island and being hunted, with paintballs. And they get there and they find these guys are actually shooting live rounds,and in my story there were two or three who escaped and waited for these rich guys to come back. I've got it on the shelf somewhere. Survivor is a sort of a Stephen King idea, and its a huge hit. TA: Is there a satirical element in books like that? SK: I'm not a satirist. I have a sense of humour but I'm very much an American, and in love with my country for better or worse. I'm in this cultre up to my eyeballs. New York isn't America. LA isn't America. This is America. New york is just buzz, just this gaseous hype, there's no story there, not really. The stories are all here, if you know where to look. I can't satirise my fellow Americans. I am them. TA: Do you get away from Maine much? SK: My wife and I have got a place in Florida. So we've been down there. Still we are here eight, nine months of the year. I think there was a time when I liked New York and LA more. When I'm in Bangor people treat me as a neighbour not as a celebrity freak with two heads, and that's too good to give up. TA: Is that one of the reasons, do you think, for the tremendous loyalty of your readership? SK: I'm the literary version of the Grateful Dead, I guess... TA: No one else, no other novelist really, has such a loyal following... What do you put that down to? SK: John Grisham's only been in the business ten years... But, no, he doesn't really have that connection. It really is a kind of Jerry Garcia phenomenon. Whatever they are getting from me in the stories, from my voice, is something that makes them feel comfortable, safe. And that's funny when you think what it is I write. But that has to be the case. TA: Do you ever fear your stories will get into the wrong heads? SK: Every now and then something strange will happen. Some years ago I went to Philadephia with my son to see a basketball game. Tabby was here, and she heard the windonw break and there was this guy there and he claimed he had a bomb (in fact it was a bunch of pencils and erasers and stuff and paperclips). He was an escapee from a mental instititution and he had this rant about how I'd stolen Misery from him. Tabby fled in her bathrobe and the police came... And every now and then there'll be a letter from someone who is obviously out there in the ozone, people who are convinced I've stolen their ideas. One lady wrote to explain how I had overflown her house in a U2 plane and stolen her thoughts for The Shining. But no one has ever actually threatened to kill me, knock on wood. Though there's a guy out in California, Steven lightfoot, who believes that me and Ronald Reagan conspired to kill John lennon... TA: Do you get paranoid about such things? SK: No. I'm not afraid of unusual things. I'm not a compulsive hand-washer, I don't think there are aliens hearing our thoughts, and I don't think anyone is coming to kill me. There are things I've used that I am afraid of or revolted by: spiders, bats. So no I'm not unusual in that way. TA: Reading you book your uncles and aunt seemed tremendous characters. SK: Everybody that I knew told stories it seemed, or maybe I just liked the stories and remembered them. TA: Did they tell stories about yor Dad? SK: No he was like an unperson. TA: Did you want to hear more stuff about him? SK: I think we were ashamed not to have a father. I think my mother was deeply ashamed to have been left, with these two young boys, when her other sisters kept their husbands. And I think shame is the most readily communicable of emotions and I think she communicated that shame to us. When we went off to school I can remember her very clearly saying to us, 'now, if anybody asks about your father, tell them he's in the navy. That's not a lie.' Now it wasn't a lie as far as we knew. But I got the point. I did have a father. No I wasn't a bastard. So that's what I said word for word and, of course, there was never any divorce either. TA: Did you never attempt to find out what happened to him? SK: Well we did find him, actually. My brother found him. What happened was this. The CBS TV network does these celebrity bios, they're generally unauthorised, but they are softball, they don't give you a hard time. They did one about me a little while ago, and they talked to my brother, and my brother had, he remembered, my dad's social security number, and one of these documentary guys went out and found him... Or I should say at least he found out what had happened to him. My father, it turned out, apparently died in Pennsylvania in the mid-eighties. We even got some pictures of him. He had started a new family: three boys and a girl. My half brothers and my half sister. TA: You've never met? SK: Not at all. No. Never. They don't know of my existence, and I think that's the way it should be.' TA: Why? SK: Well, the woman that my father married, and remember he never divorced my mother, the woman was a Brazilian - very beautiful from the pictures I saw - and its reasonable to assume she was Catholic. In that case bigamy is a very serious thing, and it would have serious consequences for those children, and I couldn't do that to them, couldn't bring that knowledge. Let sleeping dogs lie, I say... I haven't talked about all this before because I don't want that story widely published in the United States, for obvious reasons...'

With the latest polls confirming steady support for the \"no\" campaign, the long-awaited removal of the sanctions cheered \"yes\" supporters even as the plummeting value of the euro emerged as their biggest worry. Many Danes saw last January's decision to impose a quarantine on Austria after the far-right Freedom party joined its coalition government as bullying by bigger nations. This is a sensitive issue in a small country that has always been ambivalent about European integration. The prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, had been pressing fellow EU leaders to act quickly after last weekend's long-awaited report by three \"wise men\" gave Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel's government a clean bill of health, while condemning the Freedom party, formerly led by J\u00f6rg Haider. The Danish leader also made it clear that he had opposed French demands for the creation of a permanent mechanism for monitoring Austrian observance of human rights. But he was criticised by the leader of the opposition Liberal party, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who said: \"If some people want to bestow honour on the prime minister it would be like honouring an arsonist for putting out a fire he started himself.\" If the Danes rejected the single currency on September 28, it would be another blow for the faltering euro. It would also make it much less likely that the British and Swedish governments would embark on their own referendums. This week the euro registered new lows against the dollar, despite insistence by the European Central Bank that the euro-zone's economic fundamentals are sound. Yesterday's polls produced a mixed but still worrying picture for the yes camp: Gallup for Berlingske Tidende newspaper found 45% voting for no and 40% for yes. Vilstrup for Politiken found a dead heat at 41 % each side. Greens for Boersen reported 48% in favour and 44% against.

      "bodyText": "The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, defended Germany's petrol taxes today, as criticism mounted in the country's parliament and on the streets. Hundreds of farmers, truckers and taxi drivers tied up traffic around Germany, demanding relief from high prices. More than 500 vehicles brought traffic to a halt in central Hanover, while a similar convoy to the statehouse in Magdeburg, in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, caused jams there. Lorry drivers maintained blockades set up early this week at border-crossings between Germany and Belgium for trucks. Passenger cars were being allowed through at some crossings, but only with considerable delays, police in Aachen on the Belgian border said. Deliveries were being blocked from two refineries in the northern German cities of Lingen im Emsland and Wilhelmshaven by around 70 farmers on tractors, local authorities said. The demonstrators were demanding the repeal of the \"ecology tax\", which was introduced by Mr Schr\u00f6der's government, adding a few pennies to the price of a litre of petrol each year. Mr Schr\u00f6der told ARD television on Wednesday night that the proceeds of the tax were needed to reduce labour costs and fight high unemployment. However, some form of targeted relief for those whose livelihood was threatened by the rise in energy prices was being considered, he continued. Labour Minister Walter Riester told parliament during a debate today that two thirds of the DM25bn (\u00a37.8bn) that has been collected so far has gone to financing reductions in the contributions employees and companies have to make for pensions, with the rest going to shore up the system itself. Mr Riester said that the government was sticking \"openly and honestly\" to the tax, calling it \"indispensable\". But Horst Seehofer, a member of conservative opposition Christian Social Union party, accused the government of breaking its word by raising the pension contributions next year anyway. The European Central Bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, warned European countries against letting appeals for relief from high fuel prices pull them away from their goal of fiscal discipline. \"Higher oil prices place a burden on the economy as a whole,\" he said. \"Any attempts to shift that burden inside an economy from one sector to another - be it by government, special interest groups, truckers, pilots - does nothing to affect the fact that the burden is still there.\"",

      "body": "<p>The last week must have bewildered those who are convinced that the government is a hotbed of control-freaks.</p> <p>A prime minister who normally slaps down the humblest backbencher for slipping slightly off-message and who writes memos demanding that \"I personally\" be associated with government action seems to have been able to do nothing about Britain's fuel crisis.</p> <p>Petrol is now more easily available in Freetown, Sierra Leone, than in central London: an astonishing turnaround.</p> <p>But is this the prime minister's fault? Not really, is the answer. In theory, Blair should be able to get the trucks moving again at a click of his fingers.</p> <p>This country has no written constitution; the government's authority derives from the crown and, despite our democratic traditions, it is almost unlimited (give or take the odd distraction such as Magna Carta).</p> <p>Bill Clinton has expressed his envy at the prime minister's power: he can order the army into battle, dictate the budget, bully the home secretary\u0085 the options appear endless.</p> <p>In reality, this power is highly constrained. Prime Ministers arrive in the job full of ideas as to what they will be able to do. These hopes do not last long.</p> <p>Prime Ministers must cajole, persuade and campaign: they can rarely order.</p> <p>So what options are open to Tony Blair in the present crisis?</p> <p>First, he commands immense personal authority. Phone calls from the Number 10 switchboard are never refused and he can drag even the most senior oil company executive from his bed in the small hours of the morning.</p> <p>Likewise, he can make repeated personal statements on television - a tactic Blair has used to good effect in his efforts to turn the mood against the blockades.</p> <p>Nobody doubts that Blair has the skills a prime minister needs in this area. But the strikes continue.

      "bodyText": "The last week must have bewildered those who are convinced that the government is a hotbed of control-freaks. A prime minister who normally slaps down the humblest backbencher for slipping slightly off-message and who writes memos demanding that \"I personally\" be associated with government action seems to have been able to do nothing about Britain's fuel crisis. Petrol is now more easily available in Freetown, Sierra Leone, than in central London: an astonishing turnaround. But is this the prime minister's fault? Not really, is the answer. In theory, Blair should be able to get the trucks moving again at a click of his fingers. This country has no written constitution; the government's authority derives from the crown and, despite our democratic traditions, it is almost unlimited (give or take the odd distraction such as Magna Carta). Bill Clinton has expressed his envy at the prime minister's power: he can order the army into battle, dictate the budget, bully the home secretary\u0085 the options appear endless. In reality, this power is highly constrained. Prime Ministers arrive in the job full of ideas as to what they will be able to do. These hopes do not last long. Prime Ministers must cajole, persuade and campaign: they can rarely order. So what options are open to Tony Blair in the present crisis? First, he commands immense personal authority. Phone calls from the Number 10 switchboard are never refused and he can drag even the most senior oil company executive from his bed in the small hours of the morning. Likewise, he can make repeated personal statements on television - a tactic Blair has used to good effect in his efforts to turn the mood against the blockades. Nobody doubts that Blair has the skills a prime minister needs in this area. But the strikes continue. So what else can he do? His second area of strength is his command over the whole government machine: ministers answer to him and civil servants standby to put his policies into action. Since parliament is not sitting, the prime minister's powers in this area are all the greater. The opposition can only challenge him in the TV studios. The trouble is, the crisis is not one that can be solved by a change of government policy, at least not in the short term now that Blair has set his face against caving in to demands to cut taxes. This leaves a third area of power as his only real option: the right to take emergency measures such as calling in the army. Such powers have already been used to set aside fuel supplies for the emergency services. But there is a limit to the lengths the prime minister will be prepared to go in this area. After all, he has an election to win soon; the sight of troops on the streets will not help him with this - and anyway, the army, at full stretch around the world, is far from able to sustain Britain's massive fuel supply network. In 1974, Ted Heath found that he could not prevent the three-day week. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher could not prevent the coal miners striking for almost a year. In the end, Heath lost, Thatcher won. But the result was decided not by the strength - or otherwise - of the government's formal powers but by the character of those running it. This dispute, too, will come down to one question: which side blinks first.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's crisis talks around the cabinet table yesterday were with nine of the men who really run Britain. The prime minister read the riot act to representatives of six oil giants and a tanker fleet operator to urge them to get supplies out of refineries and onto forecourts - fast. BP, which operates 1,600 petrol stations in the UK, sent its group vice president John Manzoni and policy head Nick Butler, once a Fabian Society leading light and a force behind the pro-EU Centre for European Reform, who is close to New Labour. The Shell chief executive Malcolm Brinder was present as were the senior Mobil executive Ansel Coudray, David Cod of Texaco and Conoco's Greg Gough. Total sent Charles Henderson and Malcolm Jones into the prime minister's firing line. The P&amp;O executive chairman, Lord Sterling, whose firm runs a huge fleet of tankers, was also at the meeting. An ardent admirer of Lady Thatcher, Lord Sterling bussed strike breakers through picket lines more than a decade ago during a ferry dispute in Dover.",

John Maguire, a cabbie in central Manchester for 12 years, said he had been forced to protest because rising fuel prices were making it increasingly difficult to survive. \"It doesn't matter if it is the tax on fuel or the fuel companies' charges, but fuel is costing me \u00a3180 per week. My wages have gone down and down and the price has gone up every week.\" Mr Maguire said he now works 13 days out of every fortnight, from which he makes around \u00a3200 per week before tax. \"Something had to be done,\" he said. \"We can only take so much.\" \"If I worked a 40-hour week I would be bankrupt,\" said another taxi driver, who did not want to give his name. \"You have to put in a 70-hour week just to be able to survive.\" One of the first tankers to leave a fuel terminal on Manchester's Trafford Park industrial estate took 38,000 litres of unleaded petrol to a service station in Heald Green, 10 miles south of the city centre. The station ran out of fuel on Saturday and long queues formed as soon as the tanker was spotted on the forecourt. No rationing policy was introduced and managers estimated that tanks would be dry again in 10 hours. Alan McCormick, of Elite Tanning Services, was in pole position in the queue. \"I've only been in business a couple of weeks and if this goes on it's going to cripple me,\" he said. \"I repair sunbeds and I have to work all over the country.\" He put 35.08 litres into his tank and headed for the motorway.",

Sitting in his normal seat in the middle of the polished cabinet table for an emergency meeting, the prime minister's mood was grim as he addressed not his ministers but nine men he believes could get Britain moving again. The oil industry senior executives who filed in at 10.30am had been summoned for what turned out to be a 70-minute dressing down by Mr Blair, who read the riot act. Flanked by the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the home secretary, Jack Straw, and with forecourts continuing to run dry the day after he told the public the crisis would ease within 24 hours, the prime minister's frustration was clear. Sir John Evans of the Association of Chief Police Officers promised that routes would be cleared through demonstrators and escorts provided.

However, it had become clear as Mr Blair went to bed in the flat above the \"shop\" that the blockades had not been lifted. He decided first thing yesterday morning to call in the oil executives for a face to face meeting to demand they order their drivers to start delivering fuel, especially to essential services. Sitting opposite him, however, were stony-faced oil men, employees of huge global corporations who gave only limited assurances with a statement read out on the steps of Downing Street by the Shell chief executive, Malcolm Brinder, falling short of the guarantee to resume supplies that No 10 had wanted. One executive said: \"We were in listening mode, but we pointed out we would not force drivers out if they felt intimidated.\" The civil contingencies committee chaired by Mr Straw met twice - once in the morning and once in the afternoon - to review the position and hear news of severe runs on food, the possibility of mail services coming to an end and reports there would be serious job lay-offs by the weekend. Mr Blair met the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and then spoke to him a couple of times over the phone as the government struggled to get a grip. Government sources by mid-afternoon betrayed their despondency, one pointing the finger of blame at the oil moguls and darkly hinting of unspecified reprisals. \"The plain fact is that the oil companies keep making promises that something is about to happen at particular refineries and then we wait and nothing happens. It's fair to say our patience is beginning to erode,\" he said. No 10 officials admitted, however, that Mr Blair could do little more than plead or try to shame oil companies into delivering fuel because he has little leverage to use on some of the biggest multinationals in the world. As the day wore on and it became increasingly clear the hoped-for breakthrough was not emerging, government strategic planners - meetings had stared at 6am and continued throughout the day - started to work on more drastic options. Some sources said Mr Blair was being pressed to use troops by the weekend, although others pointed out that the army was \"not full\" of service personnel capable of driving petrol tankers. As the contingencies unit was reviewing its possibilities, the government was also considering the public relations battle with the demonstrators. It became clear that the press secretary, Alastair Campbell, had decided he needed to highlight a possible crisis in the NHS to try to reduce public support for the protesters. Mr Prescott had fumed on early morning television, Mr Brown had promised to \"listen\" at lunchtime and last night Mr Blair was defensive as he warned that the protesters were putting lives at risk and urged an end to the blockades.

      "bodyText": "Cargo containers were last night rapidly piling up at Antwerp, Europe's second largest port, as angry Belgian truckers stepped up their nationwide protest against fuel prices and blocked access. Action also looked set to spill over into eastern Europe for the first time as furious Polish truckers demanded that the government slash fuel prices and vowed to stage a massive nationwide go-slow on Friday with 22,500 trucks. One of the country's biggest unions said it would organise blockades, too. Elsewhere in Europe, German haulage firms met in Frankfurt to plot their next move despite the fact that Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6 der has categorically ruled out making any concessions. On a visit to Schwerin in northern Germany, where he was giving a speech to a business group, Mr Schr\u00f6der was jeered by truckers and farmers. Several hundred protesters blockaded the city centre with trucks and tractors as Mr Schroeder arrived by helicopter. He accepted a note from the protesters urging him to lower gasoline taxes, but did not talk to them. In his speech to local business leaders, Mr Schr\u00f6der defended his government's plans to introduce the hotly disputed next stage of an \"ecology tax on fuels on January 1. He blamed the rise in crude oil prices for the current problem. \"I don't belong to Opec,\" he said. He warned protesters to respect the borderline between \"free expression of opinion and coercion\" but stopped short of threatening action by the authorities should protests grow. Dutch lorry drivers continued to block many roads along the Belgian border causing huge tailbacks and promised to demonstrate in the Hague on Friday. But the worst disruption was in Belgium where the country's two largest truckers' unions threatened to bring about chaos and gridlock by the end of the week unless fuel taxes are lowered. Much of Belgium was in any case at a standstill yesterday as truckers moved to sever border crossings with France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands and showed no signs of backing down. The country's biggest oil depot has been cut off since Sunday and TotalFinaElf, the country's leading petrol supplier, said the action had halted 80 % of its normal deliveries. Talks with the government limped on without result yesterday and the seriousness of the situation prompted the European Commission to ask the authorities whether they were still able to guarantee the free movement of goods in a move which can lead to legal action. The centre of Brussels and the entire EU quarter remained a traffic-free zone as large articulated lorries straddled key arteries allowing only pedestrians, cyclists and moped riders to circulate.",

Claiming jobs, mail and food supplies were also under imminent threat, he said it was an affront that picket lines were trying to determine what represented an essential service.</p> <p>He was also forced to admit that only 500 deliveries went through the lines yesterday, probably 5% of the normal supply.</p> <p>Mr Blair refused to rule out the use of troops or the recall of parliament, and last night about 80 military tankers were being deployed around the country should they be needed. In another sign of the deepening crisis, Whitehall will today designate categories of workers who are entitled to receive petrol. It has already earmarked 2,000 petrol stations for essential supplies. The cabinet will meet to discuss the crisis.</p> <p>At a Downing Street press conference, Mr Blair said: \"No government, indeed no country can retain credibility in its democratic process or its economic policy-making were it to give in to such protests. Real damage is being done to real people.\"</p> <p>Trying to avoid accusations of arrogance, he added: \"We will listen, but we will not be intimidated.\"</p> <p>As doctors and health officials went down to the picket lines to appeal for the blockades to be lifted, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, used the NHS as a battering ram to try to turn public opinion against the blockades, saying the NHS was hour by hour closer to being forced to stop all but emergency operations.</p> <p>The blood transfusion service initially denied a crisis in supplies, accusing Mr Milburn of scaremongering for political purposes, but later admitted it was experiencing difficulties. Mr Milburn pleaded with the pickets to go home. \"The problem is going to get worse by the hour,\" he said. \"The people who are meting out the violence have got to stop it.\" He also claimed that the oil company executives - who met Mr Blair and the cabinet secretary Sir Richard Wilson in Downing Street yesterday - \"have got to up their game\".</p> <p>In the battle for public opinion, Downing Street has decisively shifted the focus of its attack from hints of collusion between pickets, oil companies and their drivers to intimidation by pickets. \"Once the public gets to know what is happening on the picket lines, public opinion will start to change,\" said one aide.</p> <p>The oil chiefs - who have been reluctant to answer media inquiries - also blamed intimidation for their inability to persuade their drivers to step up the deliveries.</p> <p>Ministers also said protesters had threatened to post pictures on the internet of drivers who break the picket lines.</p> <p>However, in private the government is deeply frustrated at the inability of the oil companies to deliver on their promises. Mr Blair himself pointedly said one oil company had managed yesterday to get a third of its normal supplies through, adding: \"As today's developments show, where the determination exists, the supplies do get through.\"</p> <p>The Conservative leader William Hague, sensing the possible collapse of the government's credibility, demanded the immediate recall of parliament. He said the revolt represented \"an earthquake in the political argument about tax\". Labour had miscalculated and would be on the wrong side of the argument over tax and spending in the election, he said.</p> <p>Tory officials claimed that 90 minutes before Blair had said 500 tankers were making deliveries, Sky News put the figure at 171. Each carries 30,000 litres, amounting to 5m litres delivered - 3.8% compared with an average day's sale of 131m throughout Britain.</p> <p>With signs of panic buying in the supermarkets and at least one - Safeway - introducing the rationing of bread and milk, agriculture secretary Nick Brown met food industry chiefs to discuss how to maintain supplies.</p> <p>The CBI director-general Digby Jones said: \"We need this sorted out fast. Some companies have today started reducing the size and scope of their operations.\" The London Chamber of Commerce warned the crisis is costing British business \u00a3250m a day.</p> <p>The Royal Mail said it only had supplies for one more day of deliveries in some areas, while in some parts of the country schools have closed.</p> <p>The petrol industry said it could be up to three weeks before supplies were back to normal as fuel tankers, many accompanied by heavy police escorts, trickled through protest lines.</p> <p>By last night deliveries from refineries and depots remained sporadic as the blockades continued. Protesters were still persuading many tanker drivers not to cross their picket lines, while in other areas police officers moved in in force to break up the demonstrations.</p> <p>Britain's main oil companies claimed fuel was beginning to get through, but BP said it was a \"drop in the ocean\" compared to normal. \"We have only managed to get 22 tanker loads of fuel out of picketed refineries and terminals since last night with another 45 loads making their way from terminals not affected by the blockades,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>Demonstrators at the Grangemouth refinery in central Scotland voted to continue their protest despite a plea from the Road Haulage Association to end the picket. Normally the depot, which supplies 90% of Scotland's fuel, dispatches 300 truckloads carrying 2m gallons a day, but by last night only 13 tankers had been allowed through the picket line, all bound for emergency use.</p>",

It has already earmarked 2,000 petrol stations for essential supplies. The cabinet will meet to discuss the crisis. At a Downing Street press conference, Mr Blair said: \"No government, indeed no country can retain credibility in its democratic process or its economic policy-making were it to give in to such protests. Real damage is being done to real people.\" Trying to avoid accusations of arrogance, he added: \"We will listen, but we will not be intimidated.\" As doctors and health officials went down to the picket lines to appeal for the blockades to be lifted, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, used the NHS as a battering ram to try to turn public opinion against the blockades, saying the NHS was hour by hour closer to being forced to stop all but emergency operations. The blood transfusion service initially denied a crisis in supplies, accusing Mr Milburn of scaremongering for political purposes, but later admitted it was experiencing difficulties. Mr Milburn pleaded with the pickets to go home. \"The problem is going to get worse by the hour,\" he said. \"The people who are meting out the violence have got to stop it.\" He also claimed that the oil company executives - who met Mr Blair and the cabinet secretary Sir Richard Wilson in Downing Street yesterday - \"have got to up their game\". In the battle for public opinion, Downing Street has decisively shifted the focus of its attack from hints of collusion between pickets, oil companies and their drivers to intimidation by pickets. \"Once the public gets to know what is happening on the picket lines, public opinion will start to change,\" said one aide. The oil chiefs - who have been reluctant to answer media inquiries - also blamed intimidation for their inability to persuade their drivers to step up the deliveries. Ministers also said protesters had threatened to post pictures on the internet of drivers who break the picket lines. However, in private the government is deeply frustrated at the inability of the oil companies to deliver on their promises. Mr Blair himself pointedly said one oil company had managed yesterday to get a third of its normal supplies through, adding: \"As today's developments show, where the determination exists, the supplies do get through.\" The Conservative leader William Hague, sensing the possible collapse of the government's credibility, demanded the immediate recall of parliament. He said the revolt represented \"an earthquake in the political argument about tax\". Labour had miscalculated and would be on the wrong side of the argument over tax and spending in the election, he said. Tory officials claimed that 90 minutes before Blair had said 500 tankers were making deliveries, Sky News put the figure at 171. Each carries 30,000 litres, amounting to 5m litres delivered - 3.8% compared with an average day's sale of 131m throughout Britain. With signs of panic buying in the supermarkets and at least one - Safeway - introducing the rationing of bread and milk, agriculture secretary Nick Brown met food industry chiefs to discuss how to maintain supplies. The CBI director-general Digby Jones said: \"We need this sorted out fast. Some companies have today started reducing the size and scope of their operations.\" The London Chamber of Commerce warned the crisis is costing British business \u00a3250m a day. The Royal Mail said it only had supplies for one more day of deliveries in some areas, while in some parts of the country schools have closed. The petrol industry said it could be up to three weeks before supplies were back to normal as fuel tankers, many accompanied by heavy police escorts, trickled through protest lines. By last night deliveries from refineries and depots remained sporadic as the blockades continued. Protesters were still persuading many tanker drivers not to cross their picket lines, while in other areas police officers moved in in force to break up the demonstrations. Britain's main oil companies claimed fuel was beginning to get through, but BP said it was a \"drop in the ocean\" compared to normal. \"We have only managed to get 22 tanker loads of fuel out of picketed refineries and terminals since last night with another 45 loads making their way from terminals not affected by the blockades,\" a spokesman said. Demonstrators at the Grangemouth refinery in central Scotland voted to continue their protest despite a plea from the Road Haulage Association to end the picket. Normally the depot, which supplies 90% of Scotland's fuel, dispatches 300 truckloads carrying 2m gallons a day, but by last night only 13 tankers had been allowed through the picket line, all bound for emergency use.",

With little fuel leaving BP's Grangemouth refinery, which receives its crude directly from North sea oilfields, experts believe the complex processing chain will soon become so disrupted that offshore production may have to be cut. Usually 300 tankers a day leave Grangemouth, which is linked by pipeline to the Forties oilfield, 100 miles east of Aberdeen.

Grangemouth is the hub of mainland oil production in Scotland, processing oil for BP and some of the 32 other firms using the Forties pipeline system, which currently handles 870,000 barrels a day. Output from Forties is also exported to Europe and the USA from the Hound Point terminal in the Firth of Forth, near Edinburgh. Crude oil is also dispatched by tanker to refineries at Humberside, Coryton on the Thames, Fawley, near Southampton and Teesport. Grangemouth, which has seen some of the toughest picketing this week, is run with little spare storage capacity, according to experts. John Waterlow, an oil analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, said last night: \"As Grangemouth depends entirely on supplies of crude from the North sea then clearly if it is not delivering refined fuel through the gates there will be a knock-on impact down the line and they could soon have to stop processing crude. That, eventually, would mean storage of crude oil would become a problem. This could potentially impact on the Forties system.\" Another senior analyst in Aberdeen warned: \"If they cannot get rid of refined fuel they are going to have to cut back on production.\" Experts said Grangemouth could be hit by a crisis in days rather than weeks. \"In the interests of efficiency, oil firms try not to run stocks too high and they do not have vast amounts of storage,\" said an analyst. \"They run to just the minimum.\" Earlier this week one BP official acknowledged that problems could arise in Grangemouth over the next few days if picketing was not lifted. But a BP spokesperson denied there was a crisis last night. \"We have ample storage facilities at present,\" she added.",

      "body": "<p>Four months ago, the streets belonged to different people. May Day brought out the massed ranks of environmental protest. They dug up Parliament Square, and laid turf on the road to stop the cars going round. The essence of their case was anti-car, and they certainly hated Big Oil.</p> <p>Coming out of the campaigns against the Newbury and other bypasses, they are the British branch of global protest against the effects of globalisation. They were in Seattle, they're now being beaten up in Australia, soon they will decamp to Prague for the next onslaught against world trade. They are passionate and righteous. Above all they've lost their faith in parliamentary democracy.</p> <p>The campaign against the price of petrol has the same rage, and reflects a similar despair. Direct action, it says, is all that works. But the purpose is entirely the opposite. The blockaders are fervently pro-truck and pro-car. They couldn't imagine a world without growth. They want more petrol, to make more journeys, in pursuit of the only kind of economy they and most of us understand. Their crude protest at the giant forces ranged against them - Opec, Big Oil, the Treasury - is the only way they think they can make known their grave frustration at not being able to pursue these objectives. They take government as their nearest enemy. They too have given up on parliamentary discourse, and the old methods of indirect democracy.</p> <p>These mirror images - the exactness of their contradiction, the equal ferocity with which the opposite opinions are held - make the textbook case for the system the protesters have given up on. The two camps don't engage, don't enter into argument. Each floats in its own world, determined to force its will on the boring old democrats. The place where argument should take place is parliament. The only place where these two extreme views can be mediated towards some kind of workable balance is in the councils of the elected government. That's what governments do. And it's the system governments have no choice but to defend.</p> <p>Up to a point, the Blair government is being successful in this. The May Day events had no discernible consequences for policy. Nothing changed. The only mark was left by a surprising failure, on the part of the royal parks or whoever, to replant the grass. The touristic centre of British democracy remains, perhaps symbolically, a wasteland.</p> <p>The oil barricades are likely to go the same way some time soon. The protesters lack some of the crucial ingredients necessary to impose their will. Though mobile phones make them better organised than they seem, they have no leader. There is no vanguard force at the leading edge of the revolution. Farmers and hauliers are developing some experience in protest, but the Leninist/Scargillite core, so essential to the sheer endurance necessary for direct action, probably does not exist.</p> <p>The objective, moreover, is unfocused. One reason why the poll-tax campaign became the most successful exercise of mass protest in living memory was that its purpose was simple. A critical mass of explosive public energy gathered to change a law. There were few dissenters from the proposition that the existing law was unjust. The streets could be occupied without much threat to normal daily life. The campaign made a passable claim to speak for a grand popular majority.</p> <p>Protest against the oil price is more convoluted, its ramifications are more puzzling. No honest observer can say the government is entirely, or even mainly, to blame. Desperate farmers and hauliers are just lashing out. Naturally, when pollsters ask motorists if they want the petrol price to come down, 90% say yes. What happened to the other 10? But such sympathies would not survive a collapse of essential services at the hands of cowardly Big Oil or self-interested small hauliers. Nor could the alleged support of the public be relied on, for more than a few days, to override the certain rage of the public at not being able to buy petrol.</p> <p>There's another difference from the Thatcher years when direct action reached its peak. The protesters this time face a strong and fairly popular government. A vital contributor to the poll-tax campaign's capacity to overturn her government's plans, and eventually herself, was Mrs Thatcher's fast diminishing credibility. The tax crystallised wider hatreds, the campaign a more general lashing-out.</p> <p>Mr Blair does not face that. On the other hand, it's here that he must be careful. So far, after slow early responses to a crisis that accelerated much faster than anyone predicted, he has done pretty well. He took the right line against an intolerable display of what one might call non-violent force. He reminded Big Oil of its responsibilities, and the police of theirs. Last night he sounded a pleading note to the protesters. But if his bold prediction of early progress towards normality comes true, he will have done what a national leader should do: taken care of the quality of daily life when it's challenged by vested interests acting against the common good. And he will not have watched Britain embrace the French way of political life.</p> <p>But he will not be hailed as a hero. That is his difficulty. For the blockades, though beatable, say something real: that the government hasn't paid enough attention to deep concerns. The lectures about Opec are not enough. The statistics showing how small is the tax element in recent price hikes cut little ice. The juggernaut of facts and promises behind which Gordon Brown has dragged the support of 415 Labour MPs for three years, justifying high and sometimes stealthy taxation, does not always carry the enthusiastic understanding of the mass public in its wake.</p> <p>At the pumps and on the roads, in other words, discontent now rages to the surface among quite a swath of middle Britain. In some circumstances it could get wider. We live in an age when allegiances are shallow, and most voters have the keenest interest in number one. They're disinclined to give governments the benefit of the doubt when they still think they're paying too much for petrol. Mr Blair, even if he wins this one, faces a troubled legacy. But worse than that, he cannot be sure that the failure of direct action will lead to a revival of faith in consultative democracy.</p> <p>A significant accessory to this is the Conservative party. Just think how present discontents ought to suit the Tories. Sierra Man and Mondeo Woman could be returning in droves. Having first voted Labour in 1997, they might not take much persuading, as they sit fuming in cars they cannot drive, that Labour had let them down. The Tory sneer that Labour is out of touch may sit oddly with Tory sarcasm that Labour spends too much time worrying about focus-group opinion, but angry footloose voters could easily overlook such contradictions.</p> <p>That, however, assumes the presence of a Tory party parked on the middle ground of politics. A centrist party would pick up support from people who trusted it to do much of what Labour is doing but better, and for whom the price of petrol was the last straw. Instead, William Hague has driven his party towards a state of unelectability. It is his gift to politics. Searching perhaps for an alternative national leadership, Sierra Man sees only an extremist sect, obsessed with Europe, talking to itself, counting mainly the votes the leader needs to keep his job after he has been smashed at the polls.</p> <p>This is not a happy context in which to be urging direct actionists to renew their faith in the choices at the ballot box. The Tories make their special contribution to democratic decline. But the main challenge is to Mr Blair and New Labour.</p> <p>He will, we may be sure, have listened to the protest. Though he cannot lower taxes just because the barricades are calling, he and Mr Brown will be sensitive in their own good time to the message they've been getting. The signal is surely received. The hint of a promise to hear the voices before November's pre-budget statement will be enough to suck back some popular support. That's the sense in which direct action can be effective. One march by the Countryside Alliance was enough to stall the abolition of fox-hunting. As an act of politics rather than force majeure, mass protest is a perfectly legitimate way of intruding into public decisions.</p> <p>But there's more to do than that. Freed by his huge majority to take parliament for granted, Mr Blair has not been an exponent of open-minded debate. The world views of the May Day diggers and the Grangemouth blockaders remain undiscussed in parliament. Controlling and single-minded, the Blair government is a poor advertisement for deliberative democracy. Arguably, no postwar government has been any better. But these are different times, when the demand to be heard is more desperate, and the deference to leaders, mercifully, less to be relied on.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

Yes, cutting fuel tax would cut public expenditure - and the much-talked-about tax windfall may not happen if the oil price falls. No, the price of oil does not affect the competitiveness of industry in the United Kingdom as all countries are facing the same price rises.</p> <p>But the government has been too defensive. It has not deployed all the arguments it might on behalf of a perfectly sensible and progressive policy.</p> <p>For example, the environmental case for fuel taxation needs to be made. The perception is that the government is using the environment as the excuse for a revenue-raising tax. Gordon Brown needs to demonstrate why this is not the case. The facts are there to back him up.</p> <p>The UK has obligations to meet targets for reducing greenhouse gases. Major cuts in carbon-dioxide emissions will be required in the medium term to prevent climate change. The consumption of road fuel is the fastest- growing source of greenhouse gases and the government has a package of policies to address this.</p> <p>Some say fuel duty has no effect on driving, but fuel taxation is a long-term policy intended primarily to improve engine efficiency. You only have to look across the Atlantic to see that cheap fuel encourages higher fuel use and a culture of gas guzzling and car dependence. In Europe and Japan, where petrol has always been more expensive, cars are more efficient and public transport more widely used. There is a clear correlation between petrol price and fuel use. In the United States in 1995 the price of petrol was 35 cents a litre and fuel consumption per person was 1,600 litres. In most of the European Union and Japan, the price was between 60 and 90 cents and fuel use was nearer 500 litres per person.</p> <p>The ledger of comparative costs and benefits would have to acknowledge infrastructure that has been designed to accommodate and stimulate ever-increasing road traffic - widened roads, bypasses and out-of-town developments. Public spending on these has effectively been subsidy to the road haulage industry and car use. Road accidents cost the NHS. Other on-costs include pollution and congestion.

      "bodyText": "Much of what the government has said and done during the fuel crisis has been right. Ministers cannot be seen to give in to protest. Yes, cutting fuel tax would cut public expenditure - and the much-talked-about tax windfall may not happen if the oil price falls. No, the price of oil does not affect the competitiveness of industry in the United Kingdom as all countries are facing the same price rises. But the government has been too defensive. It has not deployed all the arguments it might on behalf of a perfectly sensible and progressive policy. For example, the environmental case for fuel taxation needs to be made. The perception is that the government is using the environment as the excuse for a revenue-raising tax. Gordon Brown needs to demonstrate why this is not the case. The facts are there to back him up. The UK has obligations to meet targets for reducing greenhouse gases. Major cuts in carbon-dioxide emissions will be required in the medium term to prevent climate change. The consumption of road fuel is the fastest- growing source of greenhouse gases and the government has a package of policies to address this. Some say fuel duty has no effect on driving, but fuel taxation is a long-term policy intended primarily to improve engine efficiency. You only have to look across the Atlantic to see that cheap fuel encourages higher fuel use and a culture of gas guzzling and car dependence. In Europe and Japan, where petrol has always been more expensive, cars are more efficient and public transport more widely used. There is a clear correlation between petrol price and fuel use. In the United States in 1995 the price of petrol was 35 cents a litre and fuel consumption per person was 1,600 litres. In most of the European Union and Japan, the price was between 60 and 90 cents and fuel use was nearer 500 litres per person. The ledger of comparative costs and benefits would have to acknowledge infrastructure that has been designed to accommodate and stimulate ever-increasing road traffic - widened roads, bypasses and out-of-town developments. Public spending on these has effectively been subsidy to the road haulage industry and car use. Road accidents cost the NHS. Other on-costs include pollution and congestion. Estimates of such external costs of road use which are borne by society at large range from \u00a328bn to \u00a361bn. Fuel duty, which raises \u00a323bn a year is only part compensation for these societal costs. Taxing fuel - as part of a wider set of environmental reforms - is a good policy. Where the government has got it wrong is in not presenting this wider picture. People need to be told where revenue from fuel tax is being spent and the opportunity costs of cutting it.

A confidential list of suspected offenders has linked 36 people to abuse in more than one area of the country, suggesting paedophile rings operated undetected for decades. More than 370 men and women are being investigated for a range of serious sexual abuses, and officers have compiled 1,700 names of suspected paedophiles for future inquiries. The details were released yesterday by Chief Superintendent Ian Johnston of Gwent police, which has been instrumental in setting up the national historical abuse database. This was launched last October to help forces coordinate paedophile investigations and follow Gwent's exhaustive inquiry into the abuse of children at the Ty Mawr children's home near Abergavenny in west Wales. By chance, officers found out that some of the people they were investigating were also being investigated by other forces, but there was no central list to which detectives could refer. Twenty-nine forces have so far contributed details of potential offenders to the new database in an effort to pool information. Speaking at the Police Superintendents' Association's annual conference, Mr Johnston said most of the alleged offenders were teachers and some were still working in schools and care homes.

      "body": "<p>Marine archaeologists have found the first evidence of a people who perished in a great flood of the Black Sea that has been linked with the story of Noah's ark. </p> <p>Using robot underwater vehicles more than 300ft below the sea's surface, they have begun to map a rolling landscape, fed by meandering streams and marked with wattle and daub houses, that was flooded more than 7,000 years ago. </p> <p>The discovery was announced yesterday by Robert Ballard, the scientist who discovered the wrecked Titanic. </p> <p>The Black Sea was once a freshwater lake, well below sea level. About 7,000 years ago, according to geological evidence, the rising Mediterranean sea pushed a channel through what is now the Bosphorus, and then seawater poured in at about 200 times the volume of Niagara Falls. The Black Sea would have widened at the rate of a mile a day, submerging the original shoreline under hundreds of feet of salty water. </p> <p>Nearly 100,000 square miles were inundated. Sea shells on the beaches of the modern Black Sea are of marine origin, but deep below the surface there are layers of shells of freshwater molluscs, mute witnesses to the shoreline of the ancient lake. </p> <p>There are many myths concerning a great flood in the region. There was a first mention in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian work. The Romans and Greeks had the legend of Deucalion and Pyrrha, who saved their children and animals by floating away in a giant box. The Hebrew book of Genesis most famously tells the story of Noah, who found grace in the eyes of the Lord, when all around him were wicked. Noah was warned of a forthcoming flood, and built a huge \"ark\" to hold his family and all the animals in pairs. Noah survived when all perished.

      "bodyText": "Marine archaeologists have found the first evidence of a people who perished in a great flood of the Black Sea that has been linked with the story of Noah's ark. Using robot underwater vehicles more than 300ft below the sea's surface, they have begun to map a rolling landscape, fed by meandering streams and marked with wattle and daub houses, that was flooded more than 7,000 years ago. The discovery was announced yesterday by Robert Ballard, the scientist who discovered the wrecked Titanic. The Black Sea was once a freshwater lake, well below sea level. About 7,000 years ago, according to geological evidence, the rising Mediterranean sea pushed a channel through what is now the Bosphorus, and then seawater poured in at about 200 times the volume of Niagara Falls. The Black Sea would have widened at the rate of a mile a day, submerging the original shoreline under hundreds of feet of salty water. Nearly 100,000 square miles were inundated. Sea shells on the beaches of the modern Black Sea are of marine origin, but deep below the surface there are layers of shells of freshwater molluscs, mute witnesses to the shoreline of the ancient lake. There are many myths concerning a great flood in the region. There was a first mention in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian work. The Romans and Greeks had the legend of Deucalion and Pyrrha, who saved their children and animals by floating away in a giant box. The Hebrew book of Genesis most famously tells the story of Noah, who found grace in the eyes of the Lord, when all around him were wicked. Noah was warned of a forthcoming flood, and built a huge \"ark\" to hold his family and all the animals in pairs. Noah survived when all perished. Tradition has it that his ark came to rest on the slopes of Mount Ararat in Turkey. Dr Ballard began exploring the Black Sea in the Hull registered ship Northern Horizon, and used side-scanning sonar to look for interesting shapes on the seabed over a 200-sq-mile area, 12 miles off the Turkish coast, near Sinop. The instruments detected \"targets\" worth a closer look, so video cameras mounted on underwater robot submarines were put to use. \"We found two ancient ships last night,\" said Dr Ballard speaking by phone from his research vessel yesterday. \"What we were trying to do in our wildest dreams - which is exactly what happened - was find a structure that was evidence, not a sunken ship, not trash and not geology, but characteristic of human habitation.\" They found it.

Surgeons treating the five-week-old girls believe that Mary, who is severely disabled and relies on her sister for oxygenated blood, could be drawing nutrition from her twin. The worrying turn of events came on the fourth day of the appeal from the girls' parents against a high court ruling that they should be separated, even though this would lead to Mary's death. Adrian Whitfield QC, who has been arguing the doctors' case that the girls should be separated to save Jodie, said Mary was \"growing normally\" despite her having only a \"primitive\" brain.

      "body": "<p>At just over five feet and weighing a little over seven stone, Paula Barila Bolopa, a swimmer from the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in west Africa, counts herself as one of the most fortunate athletes gathered in Sydney for the Olympic Games.</p> <p>Standing at six feet nine inches and weighing almost 16 stone, Alonzo Mourning, professional basketball player from the United States, can count himself as the richest athlete of the 27th Olympiad.</p> <p>While both can claim to be members of the Olympic family, there is little else these sporting cousins have in common, and the arrival of more than 10,000 athletes for the start of the games tomorrow has once again focused the spotlight on the massive discrepancies that exist between the haves and have nots of the sporting world.</p> <p>While Mourning and other members of the United States basketball squad - known as the dream team - spent last night hidden away in five-star accommodation on the outskirts of Sydney after arriving in a private plane, Bolopa was still recovering from jet lag following an arduous three-day journey to the city. She left the country's capital, Malabo, last week in a bus.</p> <p>After 14 hours on the road to Gabon, Bolopa - one of the four-member team from Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony - boarded the plane to Paris for an eight-hour flight followed by a 13-hour flight to Hong Kong, where a different aircraft then took them on an eight-hour trip to Sydney.</p> <p>The cost of the flights to Sydney for the team and three officials was paid by the International Olympic Committee.</p> <p>Balopa, 18, is a part-time accountancy student who says she has no personal spending money for her two-week stay in Sydney and that her first priority is to find a job once the games are over.</p> <p>Mourning, 21, who won a scholarship to Georgetown Washington university before turning professional, has signed a \u00a375m contract with the basketball team Miami Heat.</p> <p>For Balopa, a 50-metre freestyle swimmer, the dream of a gold medal is a distant one and the playing field is anything but even.</p> <p>\"I am not here to win,\" she said. \"I know that I will never be able to win because I do not have the same facilities as athletes from other countries. I am here to do the best for my country and not let myself down. My spirit is strong. If your spirit is not strong in sport, then you are dead.\"</p> <p>In Malabo there is no Olympic-size pool so Bolopa trains twice a week in a 20-metre pool in a local hotel. At times she cannot use it because there are too many hotel guests.

      "bodyText": "At just over five feet and weighing a little over seven stone, Paula Barila Bolopa, a swimmer from the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in west Africa, counts herself as one of the most fortunate athletes gathered in Sydney for the Olympic Games. Standing at six feet nine inches and weighing almost 16 stone, Alonzo Mourning, professional basketball player from the United States, can count himself as the richest athlete of the 27th Olympiad. While both can claim to be members of the Olympic family, there is little else these sporting cousins have in common, and the arrival of more than 10,000 athletes for the start of the games tomorrow has once again focused the spotlight on the massive discrepancies that exist between the haves and have nots of the sporting world. While Mourning and other members of the United States basketball squad - known as the dream team - spent last night hidden away in five-star accommodation on the outskirts of Sydney after arriving in a private plane, Bolopa was still recovering from jet lag following an arduous three-day journey to the city. She left the country's capital, Malabo, last week in a bus. After 14 hours on the road to Gabon, Bolopa - one of the four-member team from Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony - boarded the plane to Paris for an eight-hour flight followed by a 13-hour flight to Hong Kong, where a different aircraft then took them on an eight-hour trip to Sydney. The cost of the flights to Sydney for the team and three officials was paid by the International Olympic Committee. Balopa, 18, is a part-time accountancy student who says she has no personal spending money for her two-week stay in Sydney and that her first priority is to find a job once the games are over. Mourning, 21, who won a scholarship to Georgetown Washington university before turning professional, has signed a \u00a375m contract with the basketball team Miami Heat. For Balopa, a 50-metre freestyle swimmer, the dream of a gold medal is a distant one and the playing field is anything but even. \"I am not here to win,\" she said. \"I know that I will never be able to win because I do not have the same facilities as athletes from other countries. I am here to do the best for my country and not let myself down. My spirit is strong. If your spirit is not strong in sport, then you are dead.\" In Malabo there is no Olympic-size pool so Bolopa trains twice a week in a 20-metre pool in a local hotel. At times she cannot use it because there are too many hotel guests. During weekends she swims in the sea, watched over by her trainer and team coach, Bernardo Elonga Moliko. \"The hardest part of my training is swimming in the sea,\" she said. \"My coaches have to watch me very carefully because the tide can be very strong and sharks are sometimes in the water.\" Moliko, with \u00a3150 for the three-week stay, is the only member of the Equatorial Guinea team who brought spending money - but two days ago he discovered that some of his notes were counterfeit after the bank in the athletes' village refused toaccept them. The Equatorial Guinea team has no uniforms and when Bolopa takes to the pool next week for her first heat in the 50-metres freestyle, she knows that another vital piece of clothing will be missing, affecting her slim chances of glory. She does not have one of the streamlined swimsuits specially designed for speed that will be used at the games probably by the richest athletes courtesy of their multi-million pound sponsors. Bolopa's best time for 50 metres is about 30 seconds. The current gold medalist, Amy van Dyke, of the US, won in 1996 in 24.87 seconds. \"I don't think anybody will be interested in giving me a suit but there is no doubt that it would help me become faster,\" said Bolopa. \"Athletes like me are already at a disadvantage before the event begins, how can I compete with someone who has the best equipment and coaching?\" Reflecting on the rich and poor gathered under the Olympic flag, Bolopa added: \"I would love to meet Mr Mourning. It is beautiful that we are here at the Olympics together and he is lucky that he is so rich. Maybe he would like to sponsor me?\" A spokesman for the American Olympic team said that Mourning and other members of the US \"dream team\", current gold medalists, and favourites to win again, were not available for interview. The spokesman added: \"He does not need the publicity. He is here like any other American athlete to take the medals home.\"",

The society is supported by the National Pig Association, representing the industry, but the Ministry of Agriculture, advised by its own vets, refused yesterday to change its compulsory slaughter policy, which has so far led to the destruction of 25,000 pigs. These have been animals on the infected farms, on others regarded as \"dangerous contacts\" where there may have been transport links before the first case was identified last month, and on a handful of farms within a kilometre of a cluster of four infected farms near Woodbridge, Suffolk. \"We are not going to carry out slaughter for the sake of it\", a ministry spokeswoman said yesterday. \"If we think there is a risk, we slaughter, if we don't, we don't.\" Farmers whose animals are compulsorily slaughtered get far more compensation than those who have healthy stock but cannot sell them.

      "body": "<p>Friday evening: dusk has fallen over the Holy Land and a three-quarter moon is rising through a cloudless sky. Israel and Palestine are preparing quietly for their very different Friday nights: the start of the Jewish sabbath; the end of the Muslim equivalent. We are driving into the West Bank city of Ramallah.</p> <p>Suddenly, there are the kind of noises that have made the Holy Land famous in our own time: what sounds like rocket fire, glass breaking and rocks being heaved on to the road. Drivers on the dual carriageway - their instincts honed by years of practice during the intifada - screech to a halt, manoeuvre frantically and accelerate away in the opposite direction. The sounds of shouting grow closer and the rock-throwing continues. Eventually, a group of Arab youths become visible, running down the hill towards the giant Marlboro ad by the city limits.</p> <p>It takes a moment to realise that this can't be what it sounds like. There have been no Israeli soldiers in Ramallah for six years. \"What's going on?\" I ask a young man standing on the pavement. \"Man,\" he says, \"it's soooooo crazy. We get rid of the Israelis. Now we have all this shit.\"</p> <p>\"What's it about?\"</p> <p>\"Football,\" he says with contempt.</p> <p>The locals, he explains, have just played the team from the Balata refugee camp near Nablus. There is always bad feeling between the supporters. (And this was nothing, I discovered later, to what happened when a West Bank team played one from the Gaza Strip.) He stops. \"Do you want anything, you know, stuff?\" he asks. \"Or are you straight?\"</p> <p>Giant Marlboro ads, football hooligans, dope dealers . . . welcome to the incipient state of Palestine, a place that in many respects is neither more nor less holy than most of the 190-odd countries which already exist.</p> <p>Of all the weeks in the quadrennial calendar, the one with the Olympic opening ceremony is the one where shows of nationhood have most global resonance. Tomorrow in Sydney a lone athlete will carry the Palestinian flag; marching behind him will be just one swimmer. The two of them might have gone into the stadium emboldened by an official declaration of Palestine's independence. The day earmarked for this was yesterday: September 13. But the moment passed, under the pressure of world politics.</p> <p>It would have been meaningless anyway. Notionally, the Palestine Liberation Organisation declared independence 12 years ago. And a declaration this week would have been equally ignored, not only by Israel, but also by world opinion, which is sympathetic to this Israeli government's efforts to do a deal.</p> <p>But no one doubts now that independence is coming: somehow, sometime soon. The reality of impending Palestine is accepted by everyone except those on the wilder shores of Israeli politics - admittedly a fairly long stretch of coastline, but not one that any longer has the moral or physical strength to withstand the onrushing tide of historical inevitability.</p> <p>There are no trivial times in the Middle East, but the months ahead - specifically, from the end of Israel's High Holyday season in late October until Bill Clinton leaves office in January - are now crucial. Palestinian sovereignty might - just might - come in triumph, with handshakes on the White House lawn, followed by the full-hearted consent of the Israeli and Palestinian people. It might happen amid terrible bloodshed. Things being as they are round here, it will almost certainly be a mess. The arguments about Jerusalem go on but it seems to me that something has changed crucially: Israel no longer has the moral certitude that would allow it to suppress Palestine indefinitely.</p> <p>A nation-state is like an elephant: hard to define - but you know one when you see it. Every day Palestine looks increasingly like the rest of the herd, sometimes depressingly so. When Arafat returned from New York last Saturday for the meeting with his central council that took the decision to delay, he was greeted by the massed band of his security forces, headed by his personal swordbearer and half-a-dozen pipers who struck up The Road to the Isles with charming irrelevance. It could have been anywhere in the developing world.</p> <p>Every week, there are other, quieter signs. Palestine now has its own web suffix: appropriately for a country which is the world's afterthought, it is \"ps\". A few days ago, the children went back to school. And some of them, for the first time, began learning according to a specifically Palestinian curriculum, rather than one borrowed from the Egyptians or Jordanians. A new international telephone code (970 instead of the Israeli 972) is said to be imminent. There are stamps, although the money value - in non-existent Palestinian fils - has to be blacked out if the letter is being sent to Israel.</p> <p>In Gaza and the West Bank cities (excepting always Jerusalem, that most special of special cases), there is no longer any visible hint of a country under occupation. But this is in part an illusion. Arafat's jet flies in and out of Gaza airport by the grace and permission of Ehud Barak's government. And anyone else who wants to leave is allowed to do so only after checking in their self-respect with Israeli officialdom. Passengers from the airport have to be bused to the nearest Israeli border post to get an exit permit.</p> <p>Dr Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, the head of Passia (the Palestine Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs), is regularly invited to speak at international conferences, sometimes with Jimmy Carter or even Bill Clinton. \"If I want to renew my travelling document, I have to go to the Israeli ministry of the interior and start queuing at four in the mornings, sometimes two or three times, and it will cost me $150 to $200. This kind of humiliation is ongoing.\"</p> <p>The political scientist Ghassan Khatib can go to Jerusalem, because his office is there. He cannot, however, invite his wife or mother to the city for dinner. \"Dinner can only be a reason if you have good relations with the right Israeli officers.\" He needs another permit to cross Israel to visit Gaza, where the residents now complain they are currently being denied the right to go to Jerusalem even for prayer.</p> <p>The Palestine that might have called itself independent this week looks like a Rorschach test on the map, reminiscent of the old, mad South African statelet of Bophuthatswana, which the apartheid regime created out of several, unrelated bite-sized chunks. In fact, it is even more complicated than that: the land is divided into A, B and C areas, depending on whether the Palestinians have control over both administration and security (A areas), administration but not security (B areas) or neither (C areas). Even on the most optimistic assessment - and the status of Jerusalem is irrelevant here - it will always be in two parts: the West Bank and Gaza, separated by the width of Israel.</p> <p>Distances in these parts are surprisingly tiny. It takes only an hour to drive from Gaza to Jerusalem, if you don't have to endure obstructive border guards. Putative Palestine is a fraction larger than Oxfordshire. If the original Palestine had been the size of Australia or Siberia, no one would have had to fight anyone.</p> <p>The history of non-contiguous countries is not an encouraging one: witness the fate of Pakistan. And there are already signs of the two wings developing different characteristics. But Palestine and Israel have many things in common, and one of these is the sense of overriding national destiny papering over a thousand underlying fissures.</p> <p>This destiny, however, is created entirely by recent history. Less than 30 years ago, the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir could scornfully deny that the Palestinian people existed. Their sense of nationhood was barely visible before the 20s and was fully fashioned only amid the adversity of the refugee camps and the Israeli occupation. \"They now have different historical experiences, beliefs and myths from any other Arabs,\" says Dr Menahem Klein, lecturer in politics at Israel's Bar-Ian University.</p> <p>\"Palestinians are not instinctively employees, not followers,\" says Mahdi Abdul-Hadi. \"I think we are always demanding to be equal partners. Arafat is known as \"ikhtiya\", the old man, rather than \"ra-ees\", the leader. It is very different from the attitude of somewhere like Egypt, where there are millions of followers. We are talkative and argumentative.\"</p> <p>\"That reminds me of another country around here,\" I murmur.</p> <p>\"Of course,\" he says. \"We have cousins called Israelis.\"</p> <p>Ghassan Khatib agrees with this analysis. \"There is a theory that oppressed people tend to admire their oppressors because they are stronger. I think Palestinians do admire features of Israeli society, and one of them is democracy.\"</p> <p>But democracy has never flowered in the Arab world. Palestine is a cacophony of voices: the town of Nablus alone has nine TV stations. But journalists who shout too loud find that life can get difficult. \"Officially, censorship does not exist,\" says journalist Khaled Abu Aker. \"But we have started to face the need for self-censorship in order not to have problems. There are stories you can hear in Palestinian society that you don't read in the press. Not only stories that criticise the security apparatus and the president, but also social problems and, of course, corruption.\"</p> <p>The country does not feel like a dictatorship. Even the communists sit in Ramallah with the front door open and offer coffee to all-comers under a Che Vive! poster. However, their big hope is municipal elections, and these have been postponed - regularly, indefinitely and mysteriously.</p> <p>Palestine's tortuous route to independence means that the country has endured the disillusionment that inevitably follows liberation without the cathartic joy of actually getting there. The Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza was once the fieriest of revolutionary hotbeds.

      "bodyText": "Friday evening: dusk has fallen over the Holy Land and a three-quarter moon is rising through a cloudless sky. Israel and Palestine are preparing quietly for their very different Friday nights: the start of the Jewish sabbath; the end of the Muslim equivalent. We are driving into the West Bank city of Ramallah. Suddenly, there are the kind of noises that have made the Holy Land famous in our own time: what sounds like rocket fire, glass breaking and rocks being heaved on to the road. Drivers on the dual carriageway - their instincts honed by years of practice during the intifada - screech to a halt, manoeuvre frantically and accelerate away in the opposite direction. The sounds of shouting grow closer and the rock-throwing continues. Eventually, a group of Arab youths become visible, running down the hill towards the giant Marlboro ad by the city limits. It takes a moment to realise that this can't be what it sounds like. There have been no Israeli soldiers in Ramallah for six years. \"What's going on?\" I ask a young man standing on the pavement. \"Man,\" he says, \"it's soooooo crazy. We get rid of the Israelis. Now we have all this shit.\" \"What's it about?\" \"Football,\" he says with contempt. The locals, he explains, have just played the team from the Balata refugee camp near Nablus. There is always bad feeling between the supporters. (And this was nothing, I discovered later, to what happened when a West Bank team played one from the Gaza Strip.) He stops. \"Do you want anything, you know, stuff?\" he asks. \"Or are you straight?\" Giant Marlboro ads, football hooligans, dope dealers . . . welcome to the incipient state of Palestine, a place that in many respects is neither more nor less holy than most of the 190-odd countries which already exist. Of all the weeks in the quadrennial calendar, the one with the Olympic opening ceremony is the one where shows of nationhood have most global resonance. Tomorrow in Sydney a lone athlete will carry the Palestinian flag; marching behind him will be just one swimmer. The two of them might have gone into the stadium emboldened by an official declaration of Palestine's independence. The day earmarked for this was yesterday: September 13. But the moment passed, under the pressure of world politics. It would have been meaningless anyway. Notionally, the Palestine Liberation Organisation declared independence 12 years ago. And a declaration this week would have been equally ignored, not only by Israel, but also by world opinion, which is sympathetic to this Israeli government's efforts to do a deal. But no one doubts now that independence is coming: somehow, sometime soon. The reality of impending Palestine is accepted by everyone except those on the wilder shores of Israeli politics - admittedly a fairly long stretch of coastline, but not one that any longer has the moral or physical strength to withstand the onrushing tide of historical inevitability. There are no trivial times in the Middle East, but the months ahead - specifically, from the end of Israel's High Holyday season in late October until Bill Clinton leaves office in January - are now crucial. Palestinian sovereignty might - just might - come in triumph, with handshakes on the White House lawn, followed by the full-hearted consent of the Israeli and Palestinian people. It might happen amid terrible bloodshed. Things being as they are round here, it will almost certainly be a mess. The arguments about Jerusalem go on but it seems to me that something has changed crucially: Israel no longer has the moral certitude that would allow it to suppress Palestine indefinitely. A nation-state is like an elephant: hard to define - but you know one when you see it. Every day Palestine looks increasingly like the rest of the herd, sometimes depressingly so. When Arafat returned from New York last Saturday for the meeting with his central council that took the decision to delay, he was greeted by the massed band of his security forces, headed by his personal swordbearer and half-a-dozen pipers who struck up The Road to the Isles with charming irrelevance. It could have been anywhere in the developing world. Every week, there are other, quieter signs. Palestine now has its own web suffix: appropriately for a country which is the world's afterthought, it is \"ps\". A few days ago, the children went back to school. And some of them, for the first time, began learning according to a specifically Palestinian curriculum, rather than one borrowed from the Egyptians or Jordanians. A new international telephone code (970 instead of the Israeli 972) is said to be imminent. There are stamps, although the money value - in non-existent Palestinian fils - has to be blacked out if the letter is being sent to Israel. In Gaza and the West Bank cities (excepting always Jerusalem, that most special of special cases), there is no longer any visible hint of a country under occupation. But this is in part an illusion. Arafat's jet flies in and out of Gaza airport by the grace and permission of Ehud Barak's government. And anyone else who wants to leave is allowed to do so only after checking in their self-respect with Israeli officialdom. Passengers from the airport have to be bused to the nearest Israeli border post to get an exit permit. Dr Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, the head of Passia (the Palestine Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs), is regularly invited to speak at international conferences, sometimes with Jimmy Carter or even Bill Clinton. \"If I want to renew my travelling document, I have to go to the Israeli ministry of the interior and start queuing at four in the mornings, sometimes two or three times, and it will cost me $150 to $200. This kind of humiliation is ongoing.\" The political scientist Ghassan Khatib can go to Jerusalem, because his office is there. He cannot, however, invite his wife or mother to the city for dinner. \"Dinner can only be a reason if you have good relations with the right Israeli officers.\" He needs another permit to cross Israel to visit Gaza, where the residents now complain they are currently being denied the right to go to Jerusalem even for prayer. The Palestine that might have called itself independent this week looks like a Rorschach test on the map, reminiscent of the old, mad South African statelet of Bophuthatswana, which the apartheid regime created out of several, unrelated bite-sized chunks. In fact, it is even more complicated than that: the land is divided into A, B and C areas, depending on whether the Palestinians have control over both administration and security (A areas), administration but not security (B areas) or neither (C areas). Even on the most optimistic assessment - and the status of Jerusalem is irrelevant here - it will always be in two parts: the West Bank and Gaza, separated by the width of Israel. Distances in these parts are surprisingly tiny. It takes only an hour to drive from Gaza to Jerusalem, if you don't have to endure obstructive border guards. Putative Palestine is a fraction larger than Oxfordshire. If the original Palestine had been the size of Australia or Siberia, no one would have had to fight anyone. The history of non-contiguous countries is not an encouraging one: witness the fate of Pakistan. And there are already signs of the two wings developing different characteristics. But Palestine and Israel have many things in common, and one of these is the sense of overriding national destiny papering over a thousand underlying fissures. This destiny, however, is created entirely by recent history. Less than 30 years ago, the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir could scornfully deny that the Palestinian people existed. Their sense of nationhood was barely visible before the 20s and was fully fashioned only amid the adversity of the refugee camps and the Israeli occupation. \"They now have different historical experiences, beliefs and myths from any other Arabs,\" says Dr Menahem Klein, lecturer in politics at Israel's Bar-Ian University. \"Palestinians are not instinctively employees, not followers,\" says Mahdi Abdul-Hadi. \"I think we are always demanding to be equal partners. Arafat is known as \"ikhtiya\", the old man, rather than \"ra-ees\", the leader. It is very different from the attitude of somewhere like Egypt, where there are millions of followers. We are talkative and argumentative.\" \"That reminds me of another country around here,\" I murmur. \"Of course,\" he says. \"We have cousins called Israelis.\" Ghassan Khatib agrees with this analysis. \"There is a theory that oppressed people tend to admire their oppressors because they are stronger. I think Palestinians do admire features of Israeli society, and one of them is democracy.\" But democracy has never flowered in the Arab world. Palestine is a cacophony of voices: the town of Nablus alone has nine TV stations. But journalists who shout too loud find that life can get difficult. \"Officially, censorship does not exist,\" says journalist Khaled Abu Aker. \"But we have started to face the need for self-censorship in order not to have problems. There are stories you can hear in Palestinian society that you don't read in the press. Not only stories that criticise the security apparatus and the president, but also social problems and, of course, corruption.\" The country does not feel like a dictatorship. Even the communists sit in Ramallah with the front door open and offer coffee to all-comers under a Che Vive! poster. However, their big hope is municipal elections, and these have been postponed - regularly, indefinitely and mysteriously. Palestine's tortuous route to independence means that the country has endured the disillusionment that inevitably follows liberation without the cathartic joy of actually getting there. The Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza was once the fieriest of revolutionary hotbeds. On the street corners where once there were gun battles, patriotism has been succeeded by a sullen cynicism. \"It was better in the Israeli times,\" grumbles one shopkeeper. \"Then, if you went to prison you knew you were there for fighting the Israelis. Now you go to prison and you don't know why. And it's very hard to get out.\" His voice is an unusually bitter one, but even the most optimistic scenarios for peace cannot solve Palestine's essential problem: how to make a living. \"I used to take 2,000 shekels a day,\" says Abu Ibrahim, a draper. \"Now it's barely 200.\" One of his few customers is Jasir um Mahmoud, a taxi-driver's wife and mother of 12. \"At least we don't have the Israeli army running after our kids,\" she says, \"but the economic situation is still very hard.\" Life is tough the world over for mothers of 12, but that is not such an unusual figure in Gaza, which has the world's highest birthrate.

      "bodyText": "Feng shui is set to migrate to your feet. Jimmy Choo, British accessory designer of the year, in 1999, shoe couturier to the stars, and Buddhist, says he has created footwear with feng shui properties. His Healing Soles shoes, with prices starting at \u00a3240 for a pair of sandals, carry crystals - rocks that for centuries and in ancient religions as well as New Age philosophies, have been credited with special healing and conducting powers. Beatrix Ong, creative director at Jimmy Choo, said: \"We pick out the crystals that are best for our customers and put them on the shoe in a beaded embellishment.\" Rose quartz might be added to help on a relationship; amethyst and clear quartz to promote healing. \"The stones have an energy about them and it's like wearing a feng shui-ed necklace or karma beads,\" Ms Ong added.",

The National Audit Office found that the RAF's fast jet squadrons - the cornerstone of the war efforts in Kosovo and the Gulf - were the worst hit, and are more than 100 pilots short of required strength. The RAF has maintained operational commitments by pilots flying longer hours and having shorter breaks between tours of duty, reducing the planned ratio of pilots to aircraft and drawing on experienced pilots from other units to deploy on operations. But the NAO warns if pilot shortfalls were to continue at current levels, there could be long term implications with \"overstretch\" affecting morale, leading to more pilots leaving the service early. The report found the shortfall was not just confined to fast jets. The armed forces need 250 new pilots each year to fly helicopters for the army; helicopters and fast jets for the Royal Navy and helicopters, fast jets and multi-engined aircraft for the RAF. In recent years the number of pilots entering operational service has averaged 205 - 18% fewer than required.

The \"golden handcuffs\" come just four months after the German bank was forced to lock in its own investment bankers with total payments of \u00a3240m during its failed merger talks with its rival Deutsche Bank. The Wasserstein business, which is based in the US, will be combined with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the German bank's investment bank, under the terms of the deal that was still being negotiated last night. It is a crucial acquisition for the Geman bank which has failed to cement two major deals this year - the merger with Deutsche Bank and then the subsequent attempt to try to merge with its other local rival Commerzbank. The move to buy Wasserstein raised speculation that the German bank was poised to spin off its investment bank ing business, which has already been given greater automony since the aborted mergers earlier this year. The fresh series of lock-ins to highly paid investment banking staff are expected to aply to around half of Wasserstein's US-based staff. Under the terms of the takeover, Bruce Wasserstein, who founded the business with former colleague Joseph Perella in 1988, is expected to be named as co-chairman of the investment bank. Insiders at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London last night insisted that morale had improved dramatically since news of the takeover emerged, even within the mergers and acquisitions department in which Wasserstein is strong. \"It's being very well received,\" one source said. The acquisition will boost Dresdner's investment banking in the US, where the industry is under going a major upheaval following a series of major takeovers and mergers. The latest of which is JP Morgan's takeover by Chase Manhattan. The acquisition by Dresdner led to speculation about the next move for Commerzbank, with which Dresdner failed to merge earlier this year. The bank has built its investment banking business from scratch in London and has also been taking action to prevent key staff from leaving.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Three key points have been overlooked in most coverage of the fuel crisis.</p> <p>First, why have a cartel of giant oil companies turned off the taps just now? They are effectively in collusion with the petrol pickets, to give the government a bloody nose in the run-up to the crucial world climate talks in the Hague in November. Governments must agree carbon dioxide and other emission cuts to tackle climate change. High fuel taxes are necessary to force industry and householders to use fossil fuels much more efficiently and cut pollution: that action bites into oil company profits.</p> <p>Second, why has the political response been so feeble? No minister or opposition leader has yet dared explain that high fuel prices are here to stay and are good for the economy as well as the environment. High prices cut resource waste and inefficiencies of production and consumption. As companies and households run more effectively, their costs go down. As fossil fuels be come dearer, clean vehicle fuels like hydrogen and renewable energy become cheaper to develop, developing new companies and creating jobs.</p> <p>Third, there are better ways to help poorer people who depend on cars than by cutting fuel duty. The Treasury is sitting on at least \u00a34bn of unexpected tax revenue because of crude oil price rises. At least half should be spent on buses and other transport services in rural and suburban areas. Better public transport means fewer drivers on the road, less congestion and quicker journeys for truckers and other professional road users. The government could also tax foreign lorries using our roads to level the playing field for UK hauliers.</p> <p>There is no need for panic. People who care about the environment should use their power as citizens to bring the corporations and politicians to account. <br><b>Charles Secrett</b><br> Director, Friends of the Earth</p> <p>\u0095 High fuel tax is a blunt instrument that fails to distinguish between transport needs and problems in different areas. Whatever happened to road pricing? It can be targeted to discourage commuting into cities by car, while leaving alone rural areas where a car is a necessity. The government could then reduce fuel tax and still have enough revenue to fund its spending programme. Labour failed to back it in its transport review, but it remains a Liberal Democrat policy.<br><b> David Johnson </b><br> Harrogate</p> <p>\u0095 The aim of reducing motor vehicle use could be addressed by petrol rationing. All taxed motor vehicles would receive a ration - for example, private cars 100 litres per month. Over a number of years the allowance would be reduced. This is equal pain for all. On average, rural residents drive less than their urban counterparts. People in rural areas could sell their surplus petrol (coupons) to richer drivers going further. This private petrol trading is equivalent to the proposed company trading of greenhouse gas emissions. It would mean that poorer rural residents could get an income boost from selling their petrol to richer urban residents. <br><b> Prof Lewis Lesley </b><br> Liverpool John Moores University</p> <p>\u0095 Biodiesel, produced from seed crops like flax or rape, is very clean and removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - it even smells nice. The snag is that it currently costs five times as much to produce as oil diesel. However, that hasn't discouraged the Canadians, who are about to open a massive plant in Saskatchewan. <br><b> Dr Brendan Hamil </b> <br> Milnathort, Kinross</p> <p>\u0095 Unlike the UK, many municipal buses in France will be unaffected by the present crisis: they use bio-diesel made from rape seed oil. <br><b>Conrad Cork</b><br> Leicester</p> <p>\u0095 Biomass is an excellent source of energy as it can be converted easily into alcohol and used to produce fuel. There is a plant source that can be grown quickly and easily without fertilisers or pesticides. Unfortunately it is illegal: cannabis.<br><b> Alun Buffry </b><br> Legalise Cannabis Alliance</p> <p>\u0095 California's zero emission vehicle mandate will force car makers to offer 10% of their fleets as electrics from 2003. More than 2,000 electric vehicles run in California.

      "bodyText": "Three key points have been overlooked in most coverage of the fuel crisis. First, why have a cartel of giant oil companies turned off the taps just now? They are effectively in collusion with the petrol pickets, to give the government a bloody nose in the run-up to the crucial world climate talks in the Hague in November. Governments must agree carbon dioxide and other emission cuts to tackle climate change. High fuel taxes are necessary to force industry and householders to use fossil fuels much more efficiently and cut pollution: that action bites into oil company profits. Second, why has the political response been so feeble? No minister or opposition leader has yet dared explain that high fuel prices are here to stay and are good for the economy as well as the environment. High prices cut resource waste and inefficiencies of production and consumption. As companies and households run more effectively, their costs go down. As fossil fuels be come dearer, clean vehicle fuels like hydrogen and renewable energy become cheaper to develop, developing new companies and creating jobs. Third, there are better ways to help poorer people who depend on cars than by cutting fuel duty. The Treasury is sitting on at least \u00a34bn of unexpected tax revenue because of crude oil price rises. At least half should be spent on buses and other transport services in rural and suburban areas. Better public transport means fewer drivers on the road, less congestion and quicker journeys for truckers and other professional road users. The government could also tax foreign lorries using our roads to level the playing field for UK hauliers. There is no need for panic. People who care about the environment should use their power as citizens to bring the corporations and politicians to account. Charles Secrett Director, Friends of the Earth \u0095 High fuel tax is a blunt instrument that fails to distinguish between transport needs and problems in different areas. Whatever happened to road pricing? It can be targeted to discourage commuting into cities by car, while leaving alone rural areas where a car is a necessity. The government could then reduce fuel tax and still have enough revenue to fund its spending programme. Labour failed to back it in its transport review, but it remains a Liberal Democrat policy. David Johnson Harrogate \u0095 The aim of reducing motor vehicle use could be addressed by petrol rationing. All taxed motor vehicles would receive a ration - for example, private cars 100 litres per month. Over a number of years the allowance would be reduced. This is equal pain for all. On average, rural residents drive less than their urban counterparts. People in rural areas could sell their surplus petrol (coupons) to richer drivers going further. This private petrol trading is equivalent to the proposed company trading of greenhouse gas emissions. It would mean that poorer rural residents could get an income boost from selling their petrol to richer urban residents. Prof Lewis Lesley Liverpool John Moores University \u0095 Biodiesel, produced from seed crops like flax or rape, is very clean and removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - it even smells nice. The snag is that it currently costs five times as much to produce as oil diesel. However, that hasn't discouraged the Canadians, who are about to open a massive plant in Saskatchewan. Dr Brendan Hamil Milnathort, Kinross \u0095 Unlike the UK, many municipal buses in France will be unaffected by the present crisis: they use bio-diesel made from rape seed oil. Conrad Cork Leicester \u0095 Biomass is an excellent source of energy as it can be converted easily into alcohol and used to produce fuel. There is a plant source that can be grown quickly and easily without fertilisers or pesticides. Unfortunately it is illegal: cannabis. Alun Buffry Legalise Cannabis Alliance \u0095 California's zero emission vehicle mandate will force car makers to offer 10% of their fleets as electrics from 2003. More than 2,000 electric vehicles run in California. If every European government took the same approach, we could start weaning ourselves off oil. Gerry Woolf Electric Vehicle Association of Great Britain \u0095 I've just seen the smuggest milkman in Wales. Mark Lewney Cardiff \u0095 A hydrogen economy would provide zero-emission transport by utilising renewably produced hydrogen within fuel-cell vehicles. Most motor manufacturers are already developing fuel-cell cars for launch in 2004. Ben Lane Director, Ecolane Transport Consultancy \u0095 We need better public transport, real priority for pedestrians and cyclists and tougher planning restrictions on car-based developments. There can be no return to business as usual after this crisis has passed. Stephen Joseph Director, Transport 2000 \u0095 For half an hour at 4pm on Tuesday, this city suburb felt like a civilised place to be: buses and trains full, local shops bustling, an explosion of cyclists and pedestrians, healthily getting from school and work without risk of being killed by a raging driver. Rebecca Leach Stockport \u0095 I must say I am impressed by the preparations here in the UK in the run-up to Car-Free Day on September 22. Ed Sonsino London \u0095 Having witnessed the behaviour of males on the forecourts this week, I wonder if there is some way of using testosterone to power the combustion engine? Liz Wilde Bromsgrove \u0095 The Learning Journey is already under way in our house (Parents asked to play part in learning, September 12). An empty baby-wipe box is the oil refinery.

      "bodyText": "The Yugoslav government is accusing the opposition candidate in the presidential election on September 24 of being a puppet working for paid Nato stooges. Its latest poster on the walls of Belgrade shows Vojislav Kostunica as a puppet Pinocchio figure standing in front of an alliance flag. Critics say President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign is running out of ideas. It is certainly exploiting old themes. The key theme of his Socialist party (SPS) is the slogan of the party congress earlier this year: Obnova, Razvoj, Reforme (reconstruction, progress and reform). Radomir Vukovic, director of the design company Gras, says that in previous campaigns, the regime hired leading western companies to do their advertising. This time, he says, the party's main campaign message is: \"We don't have enough time to run a campaign, we are rebuilding the country.\" An advertisement on state television for the Yugoslav United Left party, led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, plays strongly on the Nato stooge theme, suggesting that opponents of the regime attracted the Nato bombing raids. Natasa Milojevic, head of the creative team for the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, the coalition of 18 opposition parties which is fielding Mr Kostunica as its presidential candidate, says the regime's leaders began a year ago to portray themselves as patriots rebuilding the country after the bombing, using the state-controlled media as an important part of their strategy. On Tuesday President Milosevic appeared on the campaign trail for the first time, opening a hydroelectric dam, Djerdap II, on the border with Romania. His speech was spread across the front of the state newspaper Politika yesterday and dominated state television news. They said he addressed a crowd of 100,000, but non-government newspapers put the number at 10,000. The president's public appearances are not announced in advance and foreign and non-government journalists only learn of such events after they happen. Taking up his theme of reconstruction, Mr Milosevic said: \"This generation really has something to leave to the generation to come - a 10- year resistance to violence, strongly expressed national solidarity and courageous ability to cope in difficult times.\" Then, in an apparent attempt to steal the clothes of opposition leaders who work with the west, he turned to Europe. \"Europe is here,\" he said. \"It started its life here. It struggled with it here. It started to be united here. Here, east and west decided to find a common language.\" The regime's charge of collusion with the west sticks poorly on Mr Kostunica. He condemned the Nato bombing, has used strong anti-US rhetoric and has a record of nationalism. The polls consistently show him ahead. Mr Milosevic's followers include many pensioners and country people and a campaign video featuring a beautiful woman in a field of corn singing My Serbia and happy people in traditional settings is clearly is designed to appeal to them. One of the challenges to the opposition is to mobilise undecided voters: pollsters say a high turnout will be in its favour. Mr Kostunica's campaign exploits the feature most people see in him: his integrity. His best known advert shows just his eyes, in monochrome, with the words: \"Who can look you in the eye? Kostunica.\" With typical panache the federal information minister Goran Matic , said the eyes were not Mr Kostunica's but Al Pacino's. The next day posters appeared showing the whole of his face, with the slogan: \"Who speaks in the name of all of us? ... Kostunica of course.\" Milosevic supporters have stuck Nato stickers over the eyes and a wag has added to the slogan the words \"... and says nothing.\"",

He just happened to be president at the time. The alleged culprit on this occasion is the president's pastry chef, Roland Mesnier, who is being sued by his assistant, Franette McColoch, for \"severe sexual harassment\". Mr Clinton is mentioned because Ms McColoch's lawyers claim that as her employer he failed to ensure that there was a complaints procedure in place. Ms McColoch says that when she complained to her superiors she was \"deliberately misled\" into believing there was no way of pursuing her claim: that she had no legal recourse and would have to put up with Mr Mesnier's attentions or leave her job making cakes and biscuits for the leader of the free world. The case could cost Mr Clinton, who is already burdened with legal fees from the Monica Lewinsky affair, up to $1m (about \u00a3714,000). Ms McColoch is claiming $1m in damages from Mr Mesnier, who she said made unwanted advances and demanded to know why she would not have sex with him. Once spurned, she said, he was \"hostile and rude\" to her at work, and left dozens of messages on her answering machine.

      "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton's historic attempt to win a seat in the US Senate went into top gear yesterday as she and her Republican rival Rick Lazio held the first of three televised debates. As many as 80% of New York's 13.5m voters were expected to watch the hour-long debate in Buffalo, as was President Clinton, who was due to tune in at the White House after helping to tutor his wife for the first major election debate of her career. More than 120 American reporters were on hand for the event. Despite the millions of dollars already spent on months of campaigning in the state, last night's debate was the first occasion on which the contenders have had the opportunity to compete face-to-face for the voters' attention. \"She's ready. She knows what she has to do. She's excited,\" said an adviser who had been testing Mrs Clinton with questions, Mr Lazio, meanwhile, was said to be mugging up his voting record in the House of Representatives, where he has been a Long Island representative since 1992. Mr Clinton \"dropped in and out\" of his wife's all-day practice sessions on Tuesday, a White House spokesman said. The debate took place less than 24 hours after Mrs Clinton's attempt to become the first First Lady to achieve elected office was confirmed by her party's nomination in a primary run-off against a previously unknown Manhattan surgeon. With 97% of the votes counted in Tuesday's Democratic primary - a contest so inconspicuous that it barely registered even in New York - Mrs Clinton had 82% and Mark McMahon 18%. The fact that almost one in five Democrats voted for an unknown against the most famous woman politician in the US suggests that Mrs Clinton still faces an uphill task persuading some of the voters whose support she needs. The presidential couple cast their votes in a school in Chappaqua, their home in the state. Their daughter Chelsea, who is attending the opening of the Olympic Games in Sydney, cast a postal ballot for her mother. \"I voted for myself for the very first time and I was very excited,\" Mrs Clinton said as she emerged from the voting booth. \"After all these years of her helping me, it was a thrill,\" Mr Clinton told reporters. Mrs Clinton's campaign received a boost from two statewide polls yesterday, which both showed her leading Mr Lazio, who won the Republican primary unopposed. She led Mr Lazio by five points, 49 to 44%, among likely voters in a Quinnipiac University poll. In a separate Marist Institute poll, her lead among likely voters was narrower, 48% to 46%. Both polls show a slight strengthening of her position in the contest compared with previous surveys. An important factor in Mrs Clinton's stronger showing seems to be her big lead among Jewish voters, who make up 12% of the state's electorate. She has a two-to-one lead, 61% to 30%, according to a new survey of Jewish voters. Most of the poll was taken before the publication this week of a photograph showing Mr Lazio shaking hands with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Mrs Clinton will be looking for a further boost among Jewish voters when she campaigns for the first time with the party's vice-presidential nominee Joe Lieberman, who is an orthodox Jew, in New York tomorrow. Mrs Clinton's supporters said yesterday that they believe the polls underestimated her lead because the probable turn-out of the predominantly Democratic black voters is expected to be higher than usual this year. The tightness of the Senate race contrasts with the latest New York state poll on the presidential election, in which the Democrat Al Gore leads the Republican George W Bush by 60% to 31%. This year's New York Senate race is certain to break all previous records for political fundraising for a single state contest. With more than $60m already budgeted by the two candidates, spending in the Clinton-Lazio contest dwarfs the previous spending record of $44 million in the 1994 California senate race between the Democrat Dianne Feinstein and her Republican challenger Michael Huffington.",

      "bodyText": "The cocktail waitresses of the Nevada casinos are finally putting their feet down. Tired of dressing up in skimpy costumes and the highest of heels, they have formed an organisation to campaign for more sensible footwear. The Kiss My Foot Coalition has already persuaded casinos in Reno to allow them to lower their heels. The waitresses complain that the nights of serving gamblers while perched on high heels have given many bunions or hammertoes and has left some requiring knee surgery. Now the coalition, led by a cocktail waitress, Kricket Martinez, is trying to persuade the Las Vegas casinos to follow suit. \"Men waiters don't have to wear high heels - just women,\" Ms Martinez told the Los Angeles Times. \"We're trying to tell casinos where women are walking around in bustiers and thongs that they don't have to endanger the safety of their employees just because someone says sex sells and high heels are sexy.\" The waitresses have traditionally put up with the uncomfortable costumes and the gropes of the gamblers because the tips can be even higher than the hated heels. But the mood in Nevada has changed over the last few years: workers at the casinos and hotels are being unionised as fast as any industry in the US and the city governments in Reno and Las Vegas have been trying to make their hotels appeal more to the family and less to the Family. But some things have not changed and that is why Ms Martinez and her colleagues are taking action. The coalition is now planning a public rally in Las Vegas to gain public support for their stance. If this fails they may look at using equal rights legislation to press their case, on the grounds that men are not required to wear costumes that endanger their health in the same way.",

Adam, for example, was quite happy his mum's face wasn't as \"droopy\" as it used to be (though how his mum's facial muscles had been tightened, one would hope he didn't yet know).

They drink red wine, eat spinach and have cats. They cuddle on their sofa and have a jolly nice back garden. When they first left their husbands for each other, they were, as we say in Scotland, the talk of the steamie. \"We're far too juicy not to talk about\", said one in a saucy moment. </p> <p>Other lesbians, like Ange and Kaz, aren't middle-class at all. They have horrible duvet covers, children with nits and Jack Russells. Still, Ange and Kaz said they loved each other - and that's all that matters - although Kaz wouldn't let Ange go too deep and confessed she might go back to men, but \"only for a screw\". In the end, they went to Clacton, which is as happy an ending as you can expect these days. </p> <p>Kaz could do worse than ask the lads from <strong> DIY SOS Summer Special</strong> (BBC1) for a screw, since they have hefty toolboxes full of everything you'd ever need. Nick Knowles was in Ebbw Vale building a youth theatre group a rehearsal room, while Lowri the wide-mouthed frog was in Stalybridge outside Manchester renovating a Scout Hut, both to a four-day time limit. So far, so Challenge Anneka, but, in what's perhaps an indication that I'm getting soft in my old age, it was rather touching to see Nick and his team crying (in a good way) when the theatre group did a performance for them. Ah, bless. </p> <p>If there's something more snigger-inducing for the immature among us than thinking about lady-on-lady sex, it's thinking about old people having sex. <strong> Modern Times: Falling In Love... Again</strong> (BBC2) explored the whole notion of older people falling in love both straight-forwardly and sensitively, seriously but with just the right amount of humour. From the likes of Lorna, 56, and David, 70, who had just moved in together and frolicked like giddy teenagers on their new bed, to Harry, 70, who sat in his corner bath drinking Mo\u00ebt and scouring the personal ads for a slim, attractive lady with a GSOH, Modern Times once again demonstrated its credentials as the best documentary strand on television which explores contemporary Britain.

Only Ainsley goes off the rails with vomit-inducing camera work, and, cooking alone in his kitchen, as much charisma as a limp lettuce.

Bangs was a friend and mentor to the young Crowe, and his presence in the film - played with low-key brilliance by the laconic Philip Seymour Hoffman - is that of a bluff elder statesman, dropping pearls of wisdom hard won through years of experience. \"God,\" he drawls, \"it's going to get ugly. They'll buy you drinks, you'll meet girls... they'll try to fly you places for free... offer you drugs... I know, it sounds great. But they're not your friends. These are people who want you to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of rock stars, and they'll ruin rock'n'roll and strangle everything we love about it.\" </p> <p>Bangs had been fretting about the future of rock for some years prior to his death. In 1974 he penned a piece for Shakin' Street Gazette entitled How To Be A Rock Critic, offering a blunt guide to would-be music writers. \"You'll get to hobnob with the stars\", he conceded, but went on to add a string of caveats: \"It almost certainly won't get you laid... It doesn't pay much and doesn't lead anywhere in particular.\" </p> <p>A quarter of a century on, much of Bangs' rant still holds true. Music journalists do get to hobnob with stars, or at least snatch a few air-conditioned moments with them at a top hotel. And yes, the position of music journalist on rock's sexual totem pole remains somewhere beneath that of roadies, lighting technicians and even drummers. But what dates the piece is Bangs' comment that music journalism \"doesn't pay much and doesn't lead anywhere in particular\". </p> <p>True, considering it's a profession largely staffed by white male graduates, the financial benefits are comparatively meagre. But these days, being a music journalist leads anywhere but nowhere. In fact, working for the music press has become the entry level point for Britain's latest generation of media newcomers.

And that's before you even begin to consider the still sizeable media presence of such earlier pop press toilers as Tony Parsons, Bob Geldof, Paul Morley, Neil Tennant and, of course, Julie Burchill. </p> <p>It's a situation that's been more than mirrored in the States. Look no further than former Creem writer Nick Tosches, Bangs' one-time peer, who's established himself as the finest biographer at work today, with peerless books on Dean Martin and, most recently, Sonny Liston. Anyone still not convinced should consider the career of Hollywood's resident not-so-enfant terrible Joe Eszterhas who, like Crowe, first gained widespread recognition in the early 70s for his work at Rolling Stone. </p> <p>But in those days the phrase \"career progression\" was far from anybody's mind. \"We'd do a story about corrupt narcotics agents,\" Eszterhas recalls, \"and some of the better-known dope dealers in town would pay us homage by handing us gigantic bags of grass. It was their way of saying 'Good story.' Once I got nearly half a shopping bag of the greatest weed in the world from a dealer who was so excited about my new story, he delivered it himself.\" </p> <p>Eszterhas's tenure at Rolling Stone coincided with that of Crowe, who had been discovered by Bangs a couple of years before when, unaware of his age, Bangs had commissioned him to write a piece about Humble Pie for Creem. And perhaps more than anyone else, it's Crowe, now one of Hollywood's most acclaimed writers and directors, who has disproved Bang's theory about rock journalism's cul-de-sac-style career curve. </p> <p>Now 43, Crowe looks back at those years with a mixture of affection and pain, an emotion he describes simply as \"happy-sad\". In the film, Bangs tells Crowe's alter-ego that the war's over, that rock's becoming a commodity. \"They're trying to buy respectability for a form that's gloriously and righteously dumb!\" he rages. \"And you're smart enough to know that.

Announcing its support, it said the EU had to seek its roots in \"fundamental human values common to all European countries\". But the chairman, Romano Prodi, and his team conspicuously refused to say whether the charter should be incorporated into the treaty of Nice, which is due to seal crucial reforms in December, or be left as a non-binding showcase for existing rights. Britain, suspicious of the charter, has been lobbying hard for it to be just a declaration, fearing that it could be used to create new competences for the EU, feed domestic eurosceptic opinion, and undermine the European convention on human rights. British officials said they believe the majority of the 15 EU members backed a declaration.

It is being drafted by a unique convention composed, with a rare degree of legitimacy, of 62 representatives of the European parliament and commission and national governments and parliaments. Andrew Duff, a leading Liberal Democrat MEP, who wants stronger provisions on the right to strike and other key amendments, said last night: \"Even the most hostile of prime ministers will find it very difficult to argue that the charter is not worth inclusion in the treaty reform negotiations.\" Lord Goldsmith, Tony Blair's representative at the convention, has pressed, with some success, for the deletion of many sections on workers rights, including free collective bargaining and information disclosure. In a separate development, Neil Kinnock, the commissioner for reform, announced a new code of practice for officials: part of the effort to achieve the highest standards of public service in a bureaucracy still reeling from last year's fraud and incompetence scandals. \"The public has a right to good administration and this is another step in developing a culture based on service which is central to all the reforms,\" he said.

      "body": "<b> What's the difference between legalising something and de-criminalising it?</b> <p> * Not much. Actively repealing a law which prohibits something, decriminalises it - an example was the extension of Sunday trading by shops. By contrast, legalising something might either clarify the law where it was previously unclear - the finance acts following the budget usually both create tax exemptions and limit avoidance schemes - or introduce or extend rights, such as abortion, women's suffrage and the reduction in voting age from 21 to 18. </p> <p>Examples of confusion, discrimination and misconceptions in this area are commonplace. Sex between men is still seen by the common law (case law developed over the ages by judges) as a crime of \"gross indecency\". It is decriminalised in only limited circumstances - the men must be 18 or over, there must never be more than two involved and it must be within a very tight definition of privacy, none of which restrictions apply to sex between women and men. Notwithstanding the recent House of Lords rejections of reform, this will not long survive decisions of the European Court nor the Human Rights Act which is about to come into force south of the Scottish border (it is already enshrined in Scottish law). </p> <p>Another distinction to be made is between actual decriminalisation by law change and the practice of enforcement by the authorities. Contrary to popular belief, Dutch law still criminalises possession and dealing in recreational drugs such as cannabis. In practice certain premises - coffee shops - are licensed by councils for the purchase and consumption of small amounts; similarly in the UK it is a crime to exceed the speed limits but prosecution is rare even if the 30mph limit, for example, is exceeded by around one third. Charges of corporate manslaughter (eg following the Paddington rail disaster) are similarly exceptional. </p> <p> Chris Morley, Woodhouse, Leeds. </p> <p> <b> We have \"the Middle East\" and \"the Far East\", but where is \"the Near East\"? And what should we call the area which covers India, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc?</b> </p> <p> * \"Near East\" is the old name for Asia between Turkey and India (ie the area west of the pride of the British Empire). After the second world war, a more precise name was needed, so Israel and neighbouring Arab countries became known as the \"Middle East\". Of course, it all depends where you are standing. Many years ago, on my first visit to India, I was surprised to hear All India Radio talking about the crisis in \"West Asia\" - the Middle East from their standpoint. \"South Asia\" is the name given to the sub-Indian subcontinent, plus Nepal, Sri Lanka, etc, to distinguish it from South-East Asia, formerly Indo-China. </p> <p> Mike Broadbent, Luton, Beds. </p> <p>*In the days before British military withdrawal from east of Suez, the RAF had three separate eastern commands: Far East Air Force; Air Force Middle East and Near East Air Force. The last comprised, from what I recollect, bases on Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar. NEAF HQ was based at RAF Episcopi, Cyprus. The building is still in use but has been re-designated as HQ Joint Services. </p> <p> Tony Cummings (ret. squadron leader), Hough Green, Chester. </p> <p> <b> My butcher told me not to worry about wasps crawling over the meat in his shop, saying \"they're completely germ free, they don't spread anything.\" Was he right?</b> </p> <p> * Before turning up in the shop, wasps are likely to have spent time either on the dead cat in the gutter, the mouldy apple cores and bits of ham sandwich in the litter bin or the cowpat in the meadow. They carry bacteria on their feet and bodies from these to the prime cuts in the butcher's window. </p> <p>Flies and bluebottles do this more visibly by disgorging digestive fluid onto their food to soften it up and also lay eggs (hence maggots) in it - but wasps are just as good at mere germ distribution. Basic hygiene training for butchers seems a good idea. </p> <p> Robina Barson, London NW5. </p> <p> <b> On the eastbound carriageway three miles west of M4 junction 13 is a large exit labelled Works Access Only. It leads to a road, not marked on any map, that disappears over a hill. The millennium map on the internet shows a large array of rectangular structures. Is it anything I should worry about?</b> </p> <p> * Locals maintain that this slip road leads to RAF Welford, which was used as a base by the US during the cold war. This would explain the rectangular shapes on the millennium map - they are missile silos. </p> <p>My mother, who lives near Newbury, has always maintained that the cruise missiles, allegedly at nearby Greenham Common, were in fact based at Welford. This would make sense, if only in terms of transport logistics. Cruise missiles were designed to be mobile and capable of being launched from any part of the country. To reach the M4 from Greenham (in the 80s) necessitated driving through Newbury, whereas Welford has its own private slip road. </p> <p>Perhaps all the women who so persistently protested against the cruise missiles were actually camping in the wrong place after all. </p> <p> Jackie Nickson, Farncombe, Surrey . </p> <p>*Many Access Only roads are in fact motorway police stations and garages. A couple of years ago, I was given a lift to Luton Airport by a Met police detective. He swung off the motorway on to one of these roads promising that it would take many miles off the journey - which it did. Some way up this road, there were rectangular structures, an array of parked police vehicles and officers relaxing with tea and fags. Anyone wishing to try these shortcuts, however, should be advised that you need someone in the car who can show a warrant card. </p> <p> Graham White, Milton Bridge, Midlothian. </p> <p> <b> History books often refer to \"fountains flowing with wine\" during major celebrations. Is there any credible account of how these fountains were operated, or was the term merely an overblown way of saying that drinks were free?</b> </p> <p> * At the opening of the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880-81) by the Marquis of Normanby the fountains outside the purpose-built Royal Exhibition Building in the Carlton Gardens flowed with pink champagne. During the ceremonies, which included the performance of an interminable exhibition cantata, everybody waiting outside got drunk and rioting ensued. Buckets of pink champagne were carried off to the suburbs. I do not think similar hospitalities have since been attempted in Melbourne. </p> <p> Angus Trumble, Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide. </p> <p>* For centuries Exeter's citizen's were supplied with drinking water by a public conduit, an impressive edifice with taps, situated in the centre of the city at the Carfax. On special occasions, such as the visit by Henry VI in 1452 and the coronation of William and Mary in 1689, the conduit ran with wine. This was achieved by inserting a hogshead of claret behind the spout. </p> <p> Hazel Harvey, Exeter. </p> <p>*The town of Marino, near Rome, still has such a fountain. During the Sagra dell'Uva, at the grape harvest in August, the celebrated Fountain of the Moors in the main square is decorated with bunches of grapes, and pumps out wine instead of water. We used to join in the scrum to fill glasses, carafes and gerry-cans with the very drinkable local produce. Economic considerations mean that this free-for-all lasts only about an hour, but I am told that in the past it lasted several days. </p> <p> Mark Langham, Bayswater, London W2. <br><br><b>Any answers?</b><br><br> Given that space is infinite and we are the only inhabitants of the universe, why don't we dump toxic and nuclear waste into space? </p> <p>Paul Cockburn, London SW6. </p> <p> Why did men of fashion in the 18th century wear shoes with scarlet heels?

It leads to a road, not marked on any map, that disappears over a hill. The millennium map on the internet shows a large array of rectangular structures. Is it anything I should worry about? * Locals maintain that this slip road leads to RAF Welford, which was used as a base by the US during the cold war. This would explain the rectangular shapes on the millennium map - they are missile silos. My mother, who lives near Newbury, has always maintained that the cruise missiles, allegedly at nearby Greenham Common, were in fact based at Welford. This would make sense, if only in terms of transport logistics. Cruise missiles were designed to be mobile and capable of being launched from any part of the country. To reach the M4 from Greenham (in the 80s) necessitated driving through Newbury, whereas Welford has its own private slip road. Perhaps all the women who so persistently protested against the cruise missiles were actually camping in the wrong place after all. Jackie Nickson, Farncombe, Surrey . *Many Access Only roads are in fact motorway police stations and garages. A couple of years ago, I was given a lift to Luton Airport by a Met police detective. He swung off the motorway on to one of these roads promising that it would take many miles off the journey - which it did. Some way up this road, there were rectangular structures, an array of parked police vehicles and officers relaxing with tea and fags. Anyone wishing to try these shortcuts, however, should be advised that you need someone in the car who can show a warrant card. Graham White, Milton Bridge, Midlothian. History books often refer to \"fountains flowing with wine\" during major celebrations. Is there any credible account of how these fountains were operated, or was the term merely an overblown way of saying that drinks were free? * At the opening of the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880-81) by the Marquis of Normanby the fountains outside the purpose-built Royal Exhibition Building in the Carlton Gardens flowed with pink champagne. During the ceremonies, which included the performance of an interminable exhibition cantata, everybody waiting outside got drunk and rioting ensued. Buckets of pink champagne were carried off to the suburbs. I do not think similar hospitalities have since been attempted in Melbourne. Angus Trumble, Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide. * For centuries Exeter's citizen's were supplied with drinking water by a public conduit, an impressive edifice with taps, situated in the centre of the city at the Carfax. On special occasions, such as the visit by Henry VI in 1452 and the coronation of William and Mary in 1689, the conduit ran with wine. This was achieved by inserting a hogshead of claret behind the spout. Hazel Harvey, Exeter. *The town of Marino, near Rome, still has such a fountain. During the Sagra dell'Uva, at the grape harvest in August, the celebrated Fountain of the Moors in the main square is decorated with bunches of grapes, and pumps out wine instead of water. We used to join in the scrum to fill glasses, carafes and gerry-cans with the very drinkable local produce. Economic considerations mean that this free-for-all lasts only about an hour, but I am told that in the past it lasted several days. Mark Langham, Bayswater, London W2. Any answers? Given that space is infinite and we are the only inhabitants of the universe, why don't we dump toxic and nuclear waste into space? Paul Cockburn, London SW6. Why did men of fashion in the 18th century wear shoes with scarlet heels? Was it a mark of rank? Angus Trumble, Adelaide, Australia. How did delicate creatures like jellyfish, or soft-skinned vertebrates such as amphibians, survive the environmental catastrophe said to have caused the mass extinctions at the time the dinosaurs died out? Clare Passingham, Oxford. Why are teeth thought worthy of a separate medical profession, when all other parts of the body are looked after by specialist doctors? Phil Woodford, Teddington, Middx. Why is it that, even with today's complex technology, the camera is still said to \"put 10lbs on you\"? And will this problem ever be solved? L Gunby, Sheffield. We include the letter 'u' in the spelling of the numbers 4, 14 and 400. Why is forty different? Graham Hales, Mickleover, Derby.

Jamming with a few friends, an album put together on a shoestring, a few demos sent out to record companies more in hope than expectation. All motivated by a dream that someone will take a chance on an unknown singer and give him a chance to make music for a living. </p> <p>This is Reg Cooper's story. The singer has just signed a \u00a3300,000 recording contract with an independent label, and his first album of country music, Beautiful Day, will be released next month. The talk now is of TV appearances, a slot on the National Lottery show, perhaps even Top of the Pops. </p> <p>But Cooper is not your typical wannabe star. For a start, he's 73 years old. He is also so poorly sighted as to be registered blind, and needs a motor scooter to travel any distance because of arthritis. He lives with his wife, who is deaf and also finds it difficult to get around, on a council estate in Stapleford, Nottingham. Country music has thrown up a few incredible stories in its time, but this one gives them all a run for their money. </p> <p>Born with cataracts and raised partly in an institution, Cooper was later bankrupted when he tried to run a shop with his wife because he could not see the customers. He was reduced to stuffing bristles into brush heads in a home for the blind in order to scrape a living. It was here that he developed his interest in music. \"It's a horrible job, making brushes\", he says without irony. He suggested the home's users start a band - not that he could sing or play an instrument, \"but I was bored\". So he took up the guitar and got a cheap piano to mess around on at home. </p> <p>It seems almost inevitable, as you hear Cooper's life history unfold, that he would be stopped in the street one day by a stranger offering to teach him to sing. The man was a bass baritone who had sung in a Sadler's Wells touring opera. </p> <p>After four decades playing in folk clubs in and around Nottingham - and five years honing his album to a standard he was happy with - Cooper won a contract from the dance label Cleveland City, which launched an independent imprint on which to release it. </p> <p>\"We received a demo from a friend of a friend, and it caught our ears straight away,\" says Rob James, CCM's general manager. \"We didn't know who he was when we got the record. It was only when we took it a stage further and Reg sent us a quick biography that we realised he was registered blind.\" </p> <p>Cooper does not make a drama out of his situation, although it would be difficult to find a richer seam of achy-breaky country heartache. \"I have had numerous operations on my eyes throughout my life, but I've decided I'm too old to have any more,\" he says simply. The cataracts were inherited from his father, and passed on to his daughter. A much-loved son was also lost to cancer. </p> <p>But it diminishes Cooper to concentrate on his age and disabilities. He may have found fame late in life, but he has been closely involved in the Midlands country scene since the 60s. He is warm and funny, a self-confessed evangelist for country music, even if some of his anecdotes have got a little rambling with age. </p> <p>They are worth the retelling, all the same. John Denver recorded one of Cooper's songs, Catch Another Butterfly, on his album Rhymes and Reasons after the pair met at a Philadelphia country festival in the late 60s. Hank Snow recorded another, though Cooper says he never got a penny for either because he didn't know he was entitled to anything. He hosted a country show from 1969 until the early 80s on BBC Radio Nottingham and came to meet Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Roger Miller. Certainly, he is far from the cheerful elderly ingenu that has been portrayed in some press reports, a chirpy Clive Dunn figure with a flat cap and a northern accent. </p> <p>Nonetheless, it was inevitable that a blind pensioner finding success in the music industry would be seized on as a role model. The Royal National Institute for the Blind has offered support. Age Concern has declared Cooper \"an inspiration\" and is urging its 250,000 members to buy a copy of the album. </p> <p>Cooper doesn't seem to mind being portrayed as a torch-bearer for his generation, but feels it is more important that he is plugging a gap in the market for \"well-written, original songs with a melody, which stand on the merits of the words and the tune. There's a very big market of people who can't get hold of the type of music they like to listen to.\" </p> <p>He and his wife have to buy records from cable channel QVC, he says, as local music shops don't stock the sort of music he wants to listen to. \"A lot of people were brought up on the Crosbys and Sinatras and so on. I thought it was important to bring my songs up to scratch, as people are going to measure me on that level.\" </p> <p>Cooper's songs are simple tales of dreams and hopeful endeavour and beautiful days coming. He explains that one track on the album, Singing Gold, was inspired by a Braille book he used to read under the bedclothes in the home in which he lived as a child. It's an odd story to linger in the memory for 60 years - the tale of a couple in Australia who struggled to save enough money to get married, only for the groom to die on the wedding night as he nipped out to buy champagne. Cooper chuckles at the well-worn memory. \"But it was the description of the autumn in that story that I loved: orange and brown, rust and gold.\" He breaks into a few bars. </p> <p>James is anxious not to package Cooper as a heart-warming gimmick, but knows that he'll struggle to interest mainstream music fans in an album sleeve that shows a grinning pensioner in a flat cap and milk-bottle specs driving his scooter along a Nottingham street. \"We've approached major retailers, but, unfortunately, perhaps because of the cover, most of them have not even listened to the record. Universal Records are distributing it, but we still have to transfer that into sales and convince retailers that it's not a novelty act. </p> <p>\"But we have used the sleeve that Reg wanted. We haven't tried to portray him as something he is not. It might not be a normal thing for most record-buyers to drive down the street on a motor scooter, but it's a normal thing if you are Reg Cooper.\"</p> <p> Beautiful Day will be released on CCM next month.</p>",

There's a very big market of people who can't get hold of the type of music they like to listen to.\" He and his wife have to buy records from cable channel QVC, he says, as local music shops don't stock the sort of music he wants to listen to. \"A lot of people were brought up on the Crosbys and Sinatras and so on. I thought it was important to bring my songs up to scratch, as people are going to measure me on that level.\" Cooper's songs are simple tales of dreams and hopeful endeavour and beautiful days coming. He explains that one track on the album, Singing Gold, was inspired by a Braille book he used to read under the bedclothes in the home in which he lived as a child. It's an odd story to linger in the memory for 60 years - the tale of a couple in Australia who struggled to save enough money to get married, only for the groom to die on the wedding night as he nipped out to buy champagne. Cooper chuckles at the well-worn memory. \"But it was the description of the autumn in that story that I loved: orange and brown, rust and gold.\" He breaks into a few bars. James is anxious not to package Cooper as a heart-warming gimmick, but knows that he'll struggle to interest mainstream music fans in an album sleeve that shows a grinning pensioner in a flat cap and milk-bottle specs driving his scooter along a Nottingham street. \"We've approached major retailers, but, unfortunately, perhaps because of the cover, most of them have not even listened to the record. Universal Records are distributing it, but we still have to transfer that into sales and convince retailers that it's not a novelty act. \"But we have used the sleeve that Reg wanted. We haven't tried to portray him as something he is not. It might not be a normal thing for most record-buyers to drive down the street on a motor scooter, but it's a normal thing if you are Reg Cooper.\" Beautiful Day will be released on CCM next month.",

According to Dr Precilla Choi, a feminist psychologist based at Keele University, most women exercise in order to boost their sexual attractiveness rather than their sporting prowess. \"Physical exercise has become the latest commodity in the highly commercialised beauty culture,\" she asserts, in a paper just presented to the British Association. \"Instead of being promoted to women as a way of improving physical and psychological health, it is promoted as a way of improving their sex appeal through losing weight and improving muscle tone and appearance.\"</p> <p>She also claims that attractive sportswomen such as Anna Kournikova are putting women off taking up exercise. \"The belief that beauty will result from exercise can also translate into a belief that one has to be beautiful in order to exercise. This prevents women from exercising.\"</p> <p>This sounds like a sweeping generalisation to me. Is it really fair to blame Kournikova and her \"no bounce\" bra ads entirely for the fact that eight out of 10 British women are not taking enough exercise? After a grim day at work, when we put off going weight-training, are we doing so because, as Choi claims, we suddenly feel there is no point because we will never achieve that level of physical perfection anyway? Or are we avoiding physical exercise because we are lazy and slothful, and the pub sounds like more fun?</p> <p>Aha, I thought so. Yes, gyms tend to attract people who are concerned about their body image, but that goes for muscle-popping men as much as for hollow-cheeked women. It is true that one needs only to spend five minutes in a changing room to realise that weight loss is a major factor in some women's attendance. Female locker rooms are dominated not by personal bests but by endless diet targets. \"Only another 10 pounds to go\" is a depressingly familiar mantra.</p> <p>Yet for every dieter, there is another woman who is there because she actually enjoys the rush of endorphins a good work-out releases. Exercise isn't just about the physical body; sport has been shown to boost self-confidence and self-esteem, and to help reduce self-destructive behaviour such as compulsive eating, drinking and smoking.</p> <p>Back in 1994, a study entitled Perceptions of Female Body Shapes as a Function of Exercising found that exercisers rated themselves as more attractive, confident, healthy and popular, and had much higher body satisfaction than non-exercisers, despite being significantly heavier than the women surveyed who did not exercise. While it is regrettable that women often only think of taking up exercise because they want to lose weight, hopefully many soon ditch the diet once they begin to enjoy mastering their own speed and strength.</p> <p>Personally I love the fact that every time I run a mile, my time gets a tiny, tiny bit faster, allowing for superhero-type fantasies. Ultimately speed is far more thrilling than weight loss. Certainly, a lot of the blame for the exercise-weight loss connection lies with the people who run gyms. \"And how much weight are you wanting to lose?\" is still a stock question during many gym induction programmes, regardless of whether a woman is, heaven forbid, happy with her weight.</p> <p>This is unhealthy because, apart from anything else, it creates a culture of competition between women. \"How much have you lost?\" is such a pointless question when what locker room bonding should be about is sharing gossip and mutual support.</p> <p>In the run-up to the Sydney Olympics, much has been made of the cultural conspiracy that exists to keep women out of sport.

But the tradition of throwing balls at a stationary object is rumoured to go back to Roman times. Motorways, drainage systems, boules. Truly they were a master race. </p> <p> <b> But it took the French to make it an artform? </b> Indeed it is practically the national game, with at least 500,000 players in France alone. </p> <p> <b> And what are the rules of the quaint gallic sport? </b> Boules is a game of two people or teams, played on a pitch some 15m long and 4m wide. Players take turns to throw or roll a ball as close as possible to another ball, known as the cochonnet. A contestant may knock an opponent's ball out of the way, if necessary. Think crown green bowling, with a certain je ne sais quoi. </p> <p> <b> Mmm, sounds like a suitable activity for a leisurely Sunday afternoon. </b> Hardly. Boules is a serious matter. It is Gerard Depardieu's sport of choice. This summer, boules-mania has swept France, with pop stars, film stars and politicians lining up to be snapped mid-p\u00e9tanque. </p> <p> <b> Blimey. Sounds a bit cut-throat. </b> No throats cut as yet, but it's only a matter of time. A boy was recently knocked unconscious by a boule which was flung into the crowd by an irate contestant. This was a considerable distance from the cochonnet, and therefore did not assist his game in any way. </p> <p> <b> And I take it this prompted copycat boule-lobbing attacks across France? </b> Merely days later, a tussle broke out between two players on a campsite in Vif, near Grenoble. Boules were hurled, and a man was shot dead with a rifle. The use of rifles is not permitted in the sport of boules. </p> <p> <b> Do say: </b> Good shot, Monsieur! </p> <p> <b> Don't say: </b> You throw like a girl.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aka: P\u00e9tanque; Jeu Proven\u00e7al; That game some people play on the beach. Age: About 90. But the tradition of throwing balls at a stationary object is rumoured to go back to Roman times. Motorways, drainage systems, boules. Truly they were a master race. But it took the French to make it an artform? Indeed it is practically the national game, with at least 500,000 players in France alone. And what are the rules of the quaint gallic sport? Boules is a game of two people or teams, played on a pitch some 15m long and 4m wide. Players take turns to throw or roll a ball as close as possible to another ball, known as the cochonnet. A contestant may knock an opponent's ball out of the way, if necessary. Think crown green bowling, with a certain je ne sais quoi. Mmm, sounds like a suitable activity for a leisurely Sunday afternoon. Hardly. Boules is a serious matter. It is Gerard Depardieu's sport of choice. This summer, boules-mania has swept France, with pop stars, film stars and politicians lining up to be snapped mid-p\u00e9tanque. Blimey. Sounds a bit cut-throat. No throats cut as yet, but it's only a matter of time. A boy was recently knocked unconscious by a boule which was flung into the crowd by an irate contestant. This was a considerable distance from the cochonnet, and therefore did not assist his game in any way. And I take it this prompted copycat boule-lobbing attacks across France? Merely days later, a tussle broke out between two players on a campsite in Vif, near Grenoble. Boules were hurled, and a man was shot dead with a rifle. The use of rifles is not permitted in the sport of boules. Do say: Good shot, Monsieur! Don't say: You throw like a girl.",

      "body": "<p>John Simpson, who has died aged 83, was one of the most prolific inventors of scientific instruments for space exploration. For more than 40 years, streams of data have flowed back to Earth from the devices he built for more than 30 American and Soviet spacecraft. Some of them will beam information back for over another decade, pushing back the frontiers of knowledge about the distant reaches of the solar system.</p> <p>The first of his instruments was carried into space in 1958; the last two were launched only last year. One of these was on board the Ulysses, a satellite now in orbit round the Sun's south pole. The other was carried on Stardust, a mission to rendezvous in 2004 with Comet Wild-2, a frozen snowball one and a half miles in diameter.</p> <p>But Simpson's career began as a nuclear physicist, when he was recruited by Chicago University for the Manhattan atomic bomb project. At the end of the second world war he abandoned weapons work to become one of the world's leading astrophysicists, and encouraged international cooperation among scientists. Even in the depths of the cold war, he promoted cooperation in research and the free exchange of ideas between Soviet and western scientists. He also turned to campaigning against the use of nuclear weapons, and was co-founder of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, still an influential international forum for debate and lobbying on matters of global security and nuclear issues.</p> <p>Simpson was born in Portland, Oregon. He took his first degree at Reed College in Portland in 1940, and then studied nuclear physics at New York University. From 1943-46 he was a scientific group leader for the Manhattan project at the University of Chicago.</p> <p>On August 7 1945, the day after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Simpson and his colleagues organised the Atomic Scientists of Chicago to oppose the further use of nuclear weapons and promote the peaceful use of nuclear power under international control. Simpson was the group's first chairman. The physicists were fortunate in the support they had from Robert Hutchins, the chancellor of Chicago University; he gave them free rein to organise scientists around nuclear policy issues.</p> <p>Simpson recalled being invited with Eugene Rabinowitch, another Manhattan project scientist, that September to meet a friend of Hutchins. He turned out to be Henry Luce, the influential publisher of Time, Life, and Fortune magazines. After hearing their story, Luce offered the scientists two full pages in Life to tell it.</p> <p>In those pre-TV days, two pages in Life was an unparalleled public platform. The story was a distillation of ideas that many Manhattan project scientists had debated among themselves for over a year. In the October 29 1945 issue of Life, they said that scientists for the first time had recognised a moral responsibility to carry the warning of the danger of any further use of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Hutchins also encouraged the scientists to spend time in Washington, lobbying Congress for the civilian control of atomic energy in the US, and for the international control of atomic energy under UN auspices. Simpson was an adviser to Senator Brien McMahon of Connecticut, chairman of a special committee on atomic energy and sponsor of the McMahon Act of 1946, which called for civilian control of its use.</p> <p>Simpson later revealed that even before the bomb was tested, many Manhattan Project scientists had concluded that they were morally compelled to try to influence, within the constraints of secrecy, how the bomb would be used in the war, or even whether it should be used at all. Before the first test, many of the team at Chicago tried to do just that. They did not want to see the bomb used against Japan unless that nation was fully warned, and suggested various secret channels through which Japanese representatives might witness a demonstration.</p> <p>Only years after the war, as layers of secrecy were lifted and the full military and political aspects came into focus, did it become clear to Simpson that the use of the bomb was not likely to have been influenced by a few dozen scientists in Chicago.

      "bodyText": "John Simpson, who has died aged 83, was one of the most prolific inventors of scientific instruments for space exploration. For more than 40 years, streams of data have flowed back to Earth from the devices he built for more than 30 American and Soviet spacecraft. Some of them will beam information back for over another decade, pushing back the frontiers of knowledge about the distant reaches of the solar system. The first of his instruments was carried into space in 1958; the last two were launched only last year. One of these was on board the Ulysses, a satellite now in orbit round the Sun's south pole. The other was carried on Stardust, a mission to rendezvous in 2004 with Comet Wild-2, a frozen snowball one and a half miles in diameter. But Simpson's career began as a nuclear physicist, when he was recruited by Chicago University for the Manhattan atomic bomb project. At the end of the second world war he abandoned weapons work to become one of the world's leading astrophysicists, and encouraged international cooperation among scientists. Even in the depths of the cold war, he promoted cooperation in research and the free exchange of ideas between Soviet and western scientists. He also turned to campaigning against the use of nuclear weapons, and was co-founder of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, still an influential international forum for debate and lobbying on matters of global security and nuclear issues. Simpson was born in Portland, Oregon. He took his first degree at Reed College in Portland in 1940, and then studied nuclear physics at New York University. From 1943-46 he was a scientific group leader for the Manhattan project at the University of Chicago. On August 7 1945, the day after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Simpson and his colleagues organised the Atomic Scientists of Chicago to oppose the further use of nuclear weapons and promote the peaceful use of nuclear power under international control. Simpson was the group's first chairman. The physicists were fortunate in the support they had from Robert Hutchins, the chancellor of Chicago University; he gave them free rein to organise scientists around nuclear policy issues. Simpson recalled being invited with Eugene Rabinowitch, another Manhattan project scientist, that September to meet a friend of Hutchins. He turned out to be Henry Luce, the influential publisher of Time, Life, and Fortune magazines. After hearing their story, Luce offered the scientists two full pages in Life to tell it. In those pre-TV days, two pages in Life was an unparalleled public platform. The story was a distillation of ideas that many Manhattan project scientists had debated among themselves for over a year. In the October 29 1945 issue of Life, they said that scientists for the first time had recognised a moral responsibility to carry the warning of the danger of any further use of nuclear weapons. Hutchins also encouraged the scientists to spend time in Washington, lobbying Congress for the civilian control of atomic energy in the US, and for the international control of atomic energy under UN auspices. Simpson was an adviser to Senator Brien McMahon of Connecticut, chairman of a special committee on atomic energy and sponsor of the McMahon Act of 1946, which called for civilian control of its use. Simpson later revealed that even before the bomb was tested, many Manhattan Project scientists had concluded that they were morally compelled to try to influence, within the constraints of secrecy, how the bomb would be used in the war, or even whether it should be used at all. Before the first test, many of the team at Chicago tried to do just that. They did not want to see the bomb used against Japan unless that nation was fully warned, and suggested various secret channels through which Japanese representatives might witness a demonstration. Only years after the war, as layers of secrecy were lifted and the full military and political aspects came into focus, did it become clear to Simpson that the use of the bomb was not likely to have been influenced by a few dozen scientists in Chicago. But that did not stop the pursuit of the principle that scientists and engineers could no longer remain aloof from the consequences of their work. Simpson's hugely productive career in astrophysics began when he turned his attention to investigating cosmic rays, the subatomic particles ejected from exploding stars that bombard Earth from all directions at nearly the speed of light. In 1948 he invented a neutron monitor to measure the intensity of cosmic rays, which he deployed at stations from Chicago to the magnetic equator in Peru. He discovered that cosmic ray bombardment was less intense near the equator, and suggested that this was probably due to the Earth's magnetic fields somehow eliminating the lower-energy cosmic rays here on Earth. His cosmic ray detectors were later sent to Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Simpson was involved in a fly-by of Venus, nine planetary encounters and dust experiments on two Soviet Vega spacecraft that investigated Halley's comet, for which he received the Gagarin Medal for Space Exploration of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1986, to add to his many awards and posts; at Chicago, he was professor from 1954, and emeritus professor from 1987. His instruments have measured a solar flare, and provided evidence that the Sun's magnetic field probably has a big effect on where in the solar system the solar wind blows. Equipment he built for Pioneer 10, launched in 1972, may just now be reaching the limits of solar gusts, some 75 times the Earth's distance from the Sun. Simpson was still gathering information from Pioneer 10 last year. Another of his inventions, aboard the Cassini spacecraft, will collect and analyse dust particles in Saturn's rings. His second wife, Elizabeth, and his children Mary Ann and John from his first marriage survive him.

      "body": "<p>This 21st century is not what it was cracked up to be. It is not that I actually wanted to live in a gleaming glass skyscraper attended by robot butlers, and I never liked the idea of food pills or silver lam\u00e9 jumpsuits anyway. What bothers me is the lack of jet packs. </p> <p>We should all have one by now, a device you can strap on to your back and take off into the wild blue yonder. Imagine the freedom of flight without the trouble of airports. Commuting in minutes, with no need to worry about traffic or parking spaces. In the 30s, Buck Rogers' flying belt was pure fiction, but by the 60s there were serious articles like Over Hill, Over Dale In Army's New Rocket Belt and Man Learns To Fly In A Steam-Powered Corset. James Bond used one for a quick getaway in Thunderball. Personal flight seemed to be just around the corner - what happened? </p> <p>The first practical device was the Bell Rocket Belt. Hydrogen peroxide fuel was injected into a chamber where a catalyst broke it into water and oxygen. The exhaust of superheated steam produced an ear-splitting scream and propelled the wearer over hill and dale, but only for the 20-second duration of the rocket motor. An improved version, the RB2000, has increased endurance, but still only lasts thirty seconds. Although still used for displays, the design is limited to curiosity value. </p> <p>The military liked the idea and funded a second project, the Bell Aerospace Jet Belt. This was based around a small turbojet engine with thrust nozzles directed downwards from the operator's shoulders. By 1969, the prototype was flying at up to 30mph for four minutes at a time. The makers reckoned that it would eventually be capable of over 80mph for 20 minutes. </p> <p>Unfortunately, some design weaknesses became apparent, especially during landing when pilots had to cope with 100 kilos of jet on their backs. Falling over with a jet engine running is hazardous, with the risk of ingesting foreign objects. After years of frustration, Bell sold the rights to Williams Research Corporation. </p> <p>Williams built the next model to take to the skies, the Wasp, sometimes described as a flying pulpit. The pilot stood astride the engine, with a 63,000 revs-per-minute jet between his legs. \"What if it tossed a rotor blade?\" asked writer Terry Metzgar. The designers covered the engine with Kevlar shielding to lessen the risk of damage if the worst happened. Landing wasn't a problem, but the military decided that it lacked the endurance for a mission and turned it down in 1982. </p> <p>Undaunted, Williams went on to produce the X-Jet. Similar to the Wasp but with a highly efficient turbofan engine from a cruise missile, it could fly for 30 minutes at a top speed of 60mph.

      "bodyText": "This 21st century is not what it was cracked up to be. It is not that I actually wanted to live in a gleaming glass skyscraper attended by robot butlers, and I never liked the idea of food pills or silver lam\u00e9 jumpsuits anyway. What bothers me is the lack of jet packs. We should all have one by now, a device you can strap on to your back and take off into the wild blue yonder. Imagine the freedom of flight without the trouble of airports. Commuting in minutes, with no need to worry about traffic or parking spaces. In the 30s, Buck Rogers' flying belt was pure fiction, but by the 60s there were serious articles like Over Hill, Over Dale In Army's New Rocket Belt and Man Learns To Fly In A Steam-Powered Corset. James Bond used one for a quick getaway in Thunderball. Personal flight seemed to be just around the corner - what happened? The first practical device was the Bell Rocket Belt. Hydrogen peroxide fuel was injected into a chamber where a catalyst broke it into water and oxygen. The exhaust of superheated steam produced an ear-splitting scream and propelled the wearer over hill and dale, but only for the 20-second duration of the rocket motor. An improved version, the RB2000, has increased endurance, but still only lasts thirty seconds. Although still used for displays, the design is limited to curiosity value. The military liked the idea and funded a second project, the Bell Aerospace Jet Belt. This was based around a small turbojet engine with thrust nozzles directed downwards from the operator's shoulders. By 1969, the prototype was flying at up to 30mph for four minutes at a time. The makers reckoned that it would eventually be capable of over 80mph for 20 minutes. Unfortunately, some design weaknesses became apparent, especially during landing when pilots had to cope with 100 kilos of jet on their backs. Falling over with a jet engine running is hazardous, with the risk of ingesting foreign objects. After years of frustration, Bell sold the rights to Williams Research Corporation. Williams built the next model to take to the skies, the Wasp, sometimes described as a flying pulpit. The pilot stood astride the engine, with a 63,000 revs-per-minute jet between his legs. \"What if it tossed a rotor blade?\" asked writer Terry Metzgar. The designers covered the engine with Kevlar shielding to lessen the risk of damage if the worst happened. Landing wasn't a problem, but the military decided that it lacked the endurance for a mission and turned it down in 1982. Undaunted, Williams went on to produce the X-Jet. Similar to the Wasp but with a highly efficient turbofan engine from a cruise missile, it could fly for 30 minutes at a top speed of 60mph. The X-Jet was highly manoeuvrable and much more stable than it looked. By 1989 the US Army had turned it down; the reasons are given in official reports which are still classified. Perhaps it was the cost, which was described as being \"more than a Jeep, less than a helicopter\" depending on the size of the production run.

      "body": "<p>It started with a mutiny in a university teaching lab, some ten years ago. A bunch of biology students were told to do the immunology experiments, fishing antibodies from human blood serum, and separating them into different groups. They were not too keen, as the serum might contain HIV, and also because the results of the experiment were well known and documented in their textbooks. Later, a few litres of serum leftovers were discovered in the freezers of the labs - they were from dromedaries. </p> <p>This exotic sample inspired the students sufficiently to start working on the separation of the antibodies, and they found the usual distribution of immunoglobulins that one expects to see, but they also discovered a group of smaller antibodies that did not correspond to anything known to science. This episode happened at the Free University of Brussels, and it might have ended in obscurity, had not two researchers at this university, Raymond Hamers and Cecile Casterman investigated more deeply. They believed that the smaller antibodies were not just degraded copies of the real ones, but that they were of a special kind. They repeated the students' experiments with fresh samples from camels and llamas, confirming that all the animals in this group (the camelidae) produce some amounts of antibodies that are very different from the standard ones in that they are lacking the pair of protein molecules - the light chains. </p> <p>They consist only of the heavy chains, which is why they are now referred to as heavy chain or HC antibodies. Ordinary antibodies are horrible things to deal with, as they are complicated molecular assemblies, very difficult to produce in bacteria, too bulky for many medical applications, and may trigger an immune response in a patient. Therefore, many labs have tried to find something simpler, to construct miniature antibodies combining the binding specificity of a real antibody with some extra user friendliness. Serge Muyldermans and Lode Wyns, also working at the Free University of Brussels, were pursuing research in this direction. They took up the trail of the camels. In the beginning, it was far from clear that these molecules were functional antibodies with the high variability and specificity of the real thing. They needed to find a camel, immunise it with a specific antigen, wait a year, and see whether the camel had produced specific HC antibodies against that substance. </p> <p>A party of researchers travelled to Morocco, bought a camel, immunised it _ and had it stolen before they could get at the precious serum. His Highness, General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, then the ruler of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, supported the research by providing camel serum from his renowned veterinary research centre. What the researchers found out about the camel antibodies was even more promising for medical and biotechnological applications than they could have hoped for. It turned out that the HC antibodies recognise a wide range of antigens, but they interact with them in different places. HC antibodies raised against small enzymes such as lysozyme or ribonuclease can penetrate the active site providing a potent inhibitor for the enzyme, while conventional antibodies would bind more accessibly. </p> <p>This all boils down to the fact that in a conventional antibody, the antigen recognition is provided by two sites (at the upper ends of the Y), each composed of two different molecules, a heavy chain and a light chain, resulting in a rather bulky arrangement. </p> <p>In HC antibodies, each binding site is contained in a narrowly defined region of one molecule, the variable domain of the heavy chain. This is why it reaches the parts that other antibodies can't. If you want to miniaturise a human antibody by cutting off all the parts that are not involved in binding, you are bound to have difficulties to keep the binding domains of the heavy and of the light chain together. With the camel version, you can just genetically isolate the DNA for the binding domain, get bacteria to make it, and you've got your miniature antibody, known to scientists as a single domain antibody. Single domain antibodies are the ideal tool for a range of applications from scientific research tools through to diagnostic kits for home use. </p> <p>One very promising field is imaging of living tissue, and especially cancer diagnosis. When trying to localise a tumour, you want a label that, apart from recognising the particular molecules found on tumour cells, penetrates easily into the tumour. Once it has done that and bound to the target, you want to be able to wash out any unbound leftover material as easily, so that it will not show up in the picture. Common antibodies fail on these accounts, but preliminary tests suggest that single domain binders derived from camel HC antibodies could be used. It also appears that they will not normally provoke an immune response as full-size (non-human) antibodies would. Furthermore, the small size of these molecules allows scientists to use them as building blocks for constructs which might contain two different binding sites, or even a binding site combined with an enzymatic or other activity. They could even be harnessed inside the cell. </p> <p>A typical example of an antibody-based product is the home pregnancy test kit which you dip into a urine sample, and then wait for a blue stripe to turn up. One version of this, designed to indicate the presence of a characteristic pregnancy hormone, consists of two different kinds of antibodies against this hormone. One set is glued to the solid support in the window area where you want the blue stripe to appear. When hormone molecules float by, they will get bound by these antibodies. A second set of antibodies, recognising a different part of the hormone molecule, is charged with blue-coloured particles. When this second set comes across the hormone molecules firmly bound to the first set, it will bind to them and thus make the blue colour accumulate in the window. As this kind of test requires two kinds of antibodies which bind the target in different ways such that they do not interfere with each other's binding, a combination of conventional antibodies on the solid surface and camel-type antibodies in the liquid would be ideally suited. </p> <p>At their research centre in Vlaardingen, Netherlands, Unilever is currently developing a number of products based on the advantages offered by camelidae antibodies. While it's not yet clear why camels use this strange kind of molecules, they are turning out to be quite useful for us.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One of the most important consequences of the recent collapse of many high-profile dot.coms has been a back to basics rethinking of what actually constitutes a good website. What is emerging is the understanding that good website design is more than a question of aesthetics. There is a fundamental difference between a good-looking site and a good site. </p> <p>Boo.com, for instance, was a visually attractive site yet poor navigation and usability contributed in no small way to its failure. We are learning that on the net, beauty is only screen deep, and not a solid enough basis for a long term relationship with a target audience. From Amazon.com to eBay, the internet success stories are surviving on more than their looks alone. To succeed, websites need to match style with substance by taking the internet on its own terms. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Understand your site's purpose</strong> <br> The visual appearance of a website depends entirely on the objectives you want it to achieve. For information rich sites, the emphasis should be on straightforward navigation rather than fancy graphics. Think of how Yahoo! and other portals present their material. If, however, your main objective is to consolidate your brand identity, it may be more appropriate to limit the amount of text on the site and concentrate on the graphics. A website is not a fashion statement, it is the starting point for your relationship with a target audience. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Keep it human</strong> <br> Claude Levi-Strauss, the French anthropologist, refers to bricolage as the opportunism of those who work with their hands, creating things out of whatever is lying about. The web works the same way: there is no set way of designing a website. Designers use tried and tested images, formats and links to each other to create pages. According to the New York Times' David Weinberger, \"this makes the web unpredictable, creative and always the result of human hands\". </p> <p> <strong> 3. Be imperfect</strong> <br> Due to its vast, complex and decentralised nature, the web will always be, in the words of Tim Berners-Lee, its inventor, \"always be a little bit broken\". The web's frailty makes it more human and also renders perfection impossible. The politics of \"being right\" must not therefore be transferred to your website; rather, the aim should be to start a two-way conversation with your target audience, not to tell them, \"this is how it is\". </p> <p> <strong> 4. Avoid the language of advertising</strong> <br> Despite the fact that, according to Forrester Research, spending on web advertising will climb dramatically from \u00a31.75bn (last year's total) to \u00a3187bn in 2004, it is already being undermined by some harsh truths. Most people now appreciate that having your page turn up in the top search engine finds is far more effective than web advertising. If the role of advertising is to present the best possible face of a company, this is made redundant by the nature of the web, where criticism will always be there: just ask Nike or MacDonalds. The speed of \"word of mouth\" online is restricted only by how fast people can type, so it is worth remembering that when designing a website, honesty is always the best policy. As Rick Levine of Sun Microsystems has put it, \"word of web will trump word of hype every time\". </p> <p> <strong> 5. Keep it simple</strong> <br> This is perhaps the most important rule of website design, yet it takes a lot of time and effort to keep thinks straightforward from a visitor's perspective. Stephen Freeman, creative brain for Retail.co.uk, draws attention to this paradox. \"Simple isn't easy\", he says. \"Sites that are overly confusing and filled with flashing gizmos that perform clever tricks without rhyme or reason are the ones which were created in an afternoon\". Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.epicheroes.com\">Epic Heroes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theorganicshop.com\">The Organic Shop</a> for inspiration. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Use straightforward navigation</strong> <br> There are a number of ways you can make it easy for people to find their way around your site. One way is to make sure no page of your web ite is further than three clicks away from any other. Another is to tell people where they are. You can do this by providing a site map or by changing the colour of the current section in the navigation area. </p> <p> <strong> 7. Satisfy itchy fingers</strong> <br> Goldfish are said to have an attention span of five seconds, which is approximately two seconds longer than a visitor to your website. If they are visiting your site via a search engine, they may have up to 10 other sites they want to visit before they log off. The trick is to make your design stimulating while keeping it user-friendly. Slow download times, repetitive text, and lengthy e-commerce processes must therefore be avoided. </p> <p> <strong> 8. Don't cheat</strong> <br> Locked within the HTML code of every website is the metatag where web designers can list keywords to help control how the page is indexed on search engines. There are a number of rogue designers out there who misuse the meta-tag in order to make their site more attractive to a search engine. Words that they know are frequently typed in to search engines will go in the metatag even though they are not relevant to the site. This is the cyberspace equivalent of genetic engineering, and can seriously damage a site's reputation. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Less is more</strong> <br> As web software has developed over the years, many web designers have felt the urge to demonstrate all these advances simultaneously on one web page. Multiple animated images, blinking text, Javascript status bar mes sages, rainbow-coloured divider bars and pop up windows may signify hard work on the part of the designer but will also result in hard work on the part of the user. </p> <p> <strong> 10. Update your site</strong> <br> A week may be a long time in politics but it is a lot longer in cyberspace. Internet time is believed to move at seven times the velocity of normal time. Many people who browse (don't be fooled by this leisurely verb) the internet return to the same sites every day. Information needs to be updated at regular intervals to keep a website fresh. </p> <p>\u0095 Matt Haig is an internet author and director of web design and marketing firm <a href=\"http://www.peppermintpr.co.uk\">Peppermint PR</a></p>",

We are learning that on the net, beauty is only screen deep, and not a solid enough basis for a long term relationship with a target audience. From Amazon.com to eBay, the internet success stories are surviving on more than their looks alone. To succeed, websites need to match style with substance by taking the internet on its own terms. 1. Understand your site's purpose The visual appearance of a website depends entirely on the objectives you want it to achieve. For information rich sites, the emphasis should be on straightforward navigation rather than fancy graphics. Think of how Yahoo! and other portals present their material. If, however, your main objective is to consolidate your brand identity, it may be more appropriate to limit the amount of text on the site and concentrate on the graphics. A website is not a fashion statement, it is the starting point for your relationship with a target audience. 2. Keep it human Claude Levi-Strauss, the French anthropologist, refers to bricolage as the opportunism of those who work with their hands, creating things out of whatever is lying about. The web works the same way: there is no set way of designing a website. Designers use tried and tested images, formats and links to each other to create pages. According to the New York Times' David Weinberger, \"this makes the web unpredictable, creative and always the result of human hands\". 3. Be imperfect Due to its vast, complex and decentralised nature, the web will always be, in the words of Tim Berners-Lee, its inventor, \"always be a little bit broken\". The web's frailty makes it more human and also renders perfection impossible. The politics of \"being right\" must not therefore be transferred to your website; rather, the aim should be to start a two-way conversation with your target audience, not to tell them, \"this is how it is\". 4. Avoid the language of advertising Despite the fact that, according to Forrester Research, spending on web advertising will climb dramatically from \u00a31.75bn (last year's total) to \u00a3187bn in 2004, it is already being undermined by some harsh truths. Most people now appreciate that having your page turn up in the top search engine finds is far more effective than web advertising. If the role of advertising is to present the best possible face of a company, this is made redundant by the nature of the web, where criticism will always be there: just ask Nike or MacDonalds. The speed of \"word of mouth\" online is restricted only by how fast people can type, so it is worth remembering that when designing a website, honesty is always the best policy. As Rick Levine of Sun Microsystems has put it, \"word of web will trump word of hype every time\". 5. Keep it simple This is perhaps the most important rule of website design, yet it takes a lot of time and effort to keep thinks straightforward from a visitor's perspective. Stephen Freeman, creative brain for Retail.co.uk, draws attention to this paradox. \"Simple isn't easy\", he says. \"Sites that are overly confusing and filled with flashing gizmos that perform clever tricks without rhyme or reason are the ones which were created in an afternoon\". Take a look at Epic Heroes and The Organic Shop for inspiration. 6. Use straightforward navigation There are a number of ways you can make it easy for people to find their way around your site. One way is to make sure no page of your web ite is further than three clicks away from any other. Another is to tell people where they are. You can do this by providing a site map or by changing the colour of the current section in the navigation area. 7. Satisfy itchy fingers Goldfish are said to have an attention span of five seconds, which is approximately two seconds longer than a visitor to your website. If they are visiting your site via a search engine, they may have up to 10 other sites they want to visit before they log off. The trick is to make your design stimulating while keeping it user-friendly. Slow download times, repetitive text, and lengthy e-commerce processes must therefore be avoided. 8. Don't cheat Locked within the HTML code of every website is the metatag where web designers can list keywords to help control how the page is indexed on search engines. There are a number of rogue designers out there who misuse the meta-tag in order to make their site more attractive to a search engine. Words that they know are frequently typed in to search engines will go in the metatag even though they are not relevant to the site. This is the cyberspace equivalent of genetic engineering, and can seriously damage a site's reputation. 9. Less is more As web software has developed over the years, many web designers have felt the urge to demonstrate all these advances simultaneously on one web page. Multiple animated images, blinking text, Javascript status bar mes sages, rainbow-coloured divider bars and pop up windows may signify hard work on the part of the designer but will also result in hard work on the part of the user. 10. Update your site A week may be a long time in politics but it is a lot longer in cyberspace. Internet time is believed to move at seven times the velocity of normal time. Many people who browse (don't be fooled by this leisurely verb) the internet return to the same sites every day. Information needs to be updated at regular intervals to keep a website fresh. \u0095 Matt Haig is an internet author and director of web design and marketing firm Peppermint PR",

He and colleague Chris Thorncroft, from Reading University, have just returned from the birthplace of hurricanes. Their aim was to discover what turns a stiff breeze into a devastating cyclone. </p> <p>Hurricanes are born over the plains and mountains of central and West Africa from what is known as the African easterly jet, a jet of air moving east to west, which can sometimes end up in America with horrifying consequences. There is a another equally important reason for investigating the African easterly jet: there is still no decent weather forecasting system that can predict when a drought or a monsoon will hit Africa, nor even how the jet affects daily weather patterns. \"At the moment we don't have much of a clue because there's so few data going in to the models,\" says Thorncroft. </p> <p>Dr Thorncroft and Dr Parker, along with an RAF crew and a team of scientists from the Met Office collected data on pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed between Cape Verde and Niamey in Niger by dropping 110 data gathering instruments attached to mini parachutes from a Hercules aircraft called Snoopy. Each one radioed back the information; at nearly \u00a3500 a pop, it's not cheap, but they hope to generate crucial information about hurricane formation. </p> <p>The jet is spawned west of the Ethiopian highlands and is inherently unstable because of the difference in temperature of the lands it is travelling over: it could be as hot as 40 C over the Sahara, through to 26 C around coastal regions. When the cool, moist air from the Atlantic meets hot desert air, there is an unequal distribution of pressure causing waves to form. These waves are swept along by the remainder of the jet: they can be up to 3,000km long. </p> <p>There are a number of factors which change the wave from a benign weather system to something rather more sinister. One of the main factors is the temperature of the sea. If the wave is very low down, about a kilometre from the ground, it can grow by extracting energy from the warm ocean. Heat travels from the ocean to the wave, warming it and causing the wave to break off and begin to spiral in a vortex pattern. As the centre warms and increases in energy, more air is sucked in. \"It's like ice skaters bringing their arms in so that they spin faster,\" explains Thorncroft. </p> <p>The faster the cyclone spins, the more heat it draws from the ocean. The cyclone travels across the sea towards America picking up speed and energy and can grow large enough to become a hurricane. What can stop it is vertical shear - a strongdifference in wind speed between upper and lower levels. The current theory is that the temperature of the sea can be used to predict the maximum intensity of a cyclone, and although Thorncroft thinks this is a factor, he believes that the degree of vertical shear is also crucial. Once the cyclone gets to the US, it loses energy when it hits the land; even a hurricane will eventually fizzle out. Some head north and interact with weather systems from Europe. A big hurricane may reach the UK and can have a significant impact on wind and rainfall. </p> <p>The African easterly jet is also responsible for weather systems over Africa; thunderstorms swept in along the line of the wave - the amount of rain that falls is partly dependent on the temperature, and humidity of the wave itself. Little is known about individual waves since weather forecasts are based on the average wave, hence the difficulty in making accurate predictions. There is also a relationship between the rainfall in Africa and the development of hurricanes - when Africa is wet, the waves become stronger and more vigorous, and the pattern of vertical shear in the Atlantic changes: large amounts of rain reduce the temperature difference between upper and lower levels of wind, and thus change the vertical shear. As a result, wet weather reduces the difference between upper and lower levels, and this, Thorncroft thinks, is more conducive to the happening of hurricanes. </p> <p>Thorncroft and Parker hope that their data will not only help predict hurricane formation and drought patterns in Africa, but could also be used to update the current models. By making forecasts using European models with and without the data the team is gathering, it will be possible to see how accurate the models are, and if they can be improved. So far it is too early to tell, but as the data was collected, it was simultaneously broadcast back to the aircraft as well as on to the Met Office. By the time the scientists returned to their hotel, the weather forecast already incorporated the new data. Thorncroft and his colleagues flew through three storms, one of which went on to become a Hurricane Ernesto. Invaluable as this data is, collecting it was a one-off. </p> <p>\"It's the responsibility of every country to make observations and share them globally,\" says Thorncroft. \"But if our data had a major impact on hurricane prediction and on understanding tropical weather systems, would anyone want to pay to collect data routinely?

During that short period of time the online auction company has expanded into 13 European countries. </p> <p>\"It's a crazy speed because these markets are taking shape very fast. Scale within a country is important because more buyers and sellers come onto the site,\" he explains. \"Critical mass within one country gives you a powerful barrier to block out the competition. If anyone else gets critical mass before you, it is going to be costly and lengthy to catch up.\" </p> <p>The activities and experiences of QXL are typical of plenty of other internet companies who are now scrambling frantically at blistering speeds to grab virtual land in Europe. With the US market already saturated, many of the emerging online markets of Europe are still waiting to be taken, and every wannabe e-tycoon wants his or her share. </p> <p>You only have to consider the scale of the market that is shaping up to understand what is driving this virtual stampede. Jupiter Communications predicts that the number of online buyers in Europe will more than quadruple, reaching 85m by 2005, up from 20m in 2000. </p> <p>It is a market which is currently dominated by the Northern European countries.

During that short period of time the online auction company has expanded into 13 European countries. \"It's a crazy speed because these markets are taking shape very fast. Scale within a country is important because more buyers and sellers come onto the site,\" he explains. \"Critical mass within one country gives you a powerful barrier to block out the competition. If anyone else gets critical mass before you, it is going to be costly and lengthy to catch up.\" The activities and experiences of QXL are typical of plenty of other internet companies who are now scrambling frantically at blistering speeds to grab virtual land in Europe.

      "body": "<p>Putting a small business online is getting easier every day. No longer do businesses need to invest in expensive leased lines and run their own electronic commerce software. Instead companies all round the world are offering to take away the risk and pain that building an online store always seemed to entail. An online presence for an SME (Small/Medium Enterprise) is becoming almost essential, with website addresses appearing on the side of white vans and on shop awnings around the UK. </p> <p>So where should a small business that wants to trade online start? One approach is to use an Application Service Provider. ASPs are web services that host applications for remote users. Big businesses outsource IT to companies such as EDS and IBM all the time, and there's nothing to stop a much smaller company doing the same. Certainly a number of ASPs have thought as much, and offer everything from low-cost services paid for with what's known as a transaction tax - a few percent taken off every transaction - to subscription services rivaling those of a big online store. </p> <p>One of the more interesting ASPs is a small US service called Caf\u00e9Press. This is a service that creates simple online stores for artists, by offering print-on-demand services for T-shirts, mugs and mouse mats. Just upload an image, choose a price and wait for the cheques to start coming in. </p> <p>The ASP handles everything from printing the merchandise to handling credit card payments and posting the goods. The available product lines may be small, but it's a simple place to start - and every pound earned is profit. Businesses use Caf\u00e9Press to sell everything from photographs of cats to comic strip merchandising. It has proven particularly popular amongst the online comic community, where a popular site means that what was a hobby now needs a business to support it. </p> <p>One of the biggest players in the whole IT industry runs one of the most successful ASP web store systems. Intel purchased iCat, a software company with a set of tools for creating secure online stores, and turned it into an online service. ICat now gives small businesses a set of services that reduce the risks in building and running a web store. </p> <p>As well as offering a full-blown catalogue-driven store system, iCat's service also includes a separate shopping cart system that can be used in existing stores, so businesses with specific design needs can still take advantage of Intel's infrastructure. </p> <p>ICat's service is well designed, and works well with traditional business models. If an item isn't selling well, or is new, it can be turned into a special offer, or linked to cross-selling and up-selling services where other items can be used to promote sales. </p> <p>To make things easier for British businesses, iCat has a partnership with BT, and provides the tools used in BT's StoreCentre service. This is an inexpensive way of starting to sell online, as the quarterly costs vary with the number of items you're selling. A 50-item store will only cost you \u00a3114 a quarter, affordable for most small businesses. </p> <p>Some software packages help greatly in putting a business online. One of the most helpful is the SME-targeted web site design package NetObjects Fusion. Version 5.0 includes an \"online\" tab, which is actually a web site helping with design and site hosting decisions. Fusion is also designed to plug into existing online offerings, and earlier versions included the tools to design pages that linked into the iCat system. </p> <p>NetObjects also offers small businesses two other online tools, GoBizGo and eFUSE. GoBizGo is an ASP that allows businesses to create web sites and e-commerce services without needing anything more than a credit card and a web browser. This is a fee-based system, with monthly charges. It is still very focussed on the US market, but is a good example of the type of ASP service that can make putting a business online a matter of a few mouse clicks. A set of testimonials on the site show how it can be used to sell everything from bowling balls to stained glass windows and wildflower jewellery. </p> <p>The closely related eFUSE is intended for a different audience: businesses that have taken the plunge into designing and running their own online presences. It is full of design tips for e-commerce service providers. </p> <p>Actinic's Catalog has proven very popular and has received rave reviews. It is a wizard and template tool that allows businesses to create and manage their online stores, with hosting either carried out by Actinic's ISP partners or on a user's own servers. </p> <p>With Actinic Catalog, businesses can work with third-party payment sites, or process credit cards themselves, with all communications between customer and store handled by heavily encrypted messages. The latest version 4.0 of Actinic's software adds many new features, including the tools for managing back orders. </p> <p>Virgin has recently entered this market with Virginbiz.net, an online service with information for small businesses wanting to go online, as well as web space and an online store. </p> <p>It has the advantage of offering a complete design and build service, taking the strain away by completely handing over the site to Virgin's team. Freeserve's small business section Clearly Business offers similar services. Freeserve's offering could have an advantage over some of the others, as it includes linking to stores from the Freeserve online mall. </p> <p>Clearly Business partners with the popular WorldPay credit card service. This service provides credit card clearing and authentication for online businesses. WorldPay's WorldDirect service operates in 125 countries, with nearly a million customers in the USA alone. Businesses can use this service to handle credit card payments, with WorldPay taking a 4.5% handling fee on every transaction. This may seem expensive, but is often cheaper than a new online merchant relationship directly with a bank. </p> <p>International stores can also use WorldPay as it can work with most currencies and credit cards. WorldPay is now also offering a one-stop shop for starter online stores, with its new Click and Build service. </p> <p>The more ambitious can start to create their own online store using design packages targeted at the SME market, in conjunction with online catalogue and payment services. Using tools like these, free web space from an ISP, and a domain purchased from a service like Clicknames, an effective online presence can be put together for very little outlay. </p> <p>Whether it's a \"roll-your-own\" presence, an ecommerce package or an ASP, putting a small business online has never been easier. </p> <p>Of course this doesn't mean a quick path to dot.com riches, just another way of bringing customers to the door. Businesses will need to work on how they manage their relationships with their online customers, and how they will handle the trickiest part of the e-business chain: fulfilment. No matter how fancy the online presence, the goods still have to reach the customer. </p> <p><strong> Links </strong></p> <p> <strong> Clicknames</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.clicknames.net \">www.clicknames.net</a> <br> <strong>WorldPay</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.worldpay.com\">www.worldpay.com</a> <br> <strong>VirginBiz.net</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.virginbiz.net\">www.virginbiz.net</a> <br> <strong>Freeserve</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.freeserve.net\">www.freeserve.net</a> <br> <strong>ICat</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.icat.com\">www.icat.com</a> <br> <strong>NetObjects</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.netobjects.com\">www.netobjects.com</a> <br> <strong> EFUSE</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.efuse.com\">www.efuse.com</a> <br> <strong>GoBizGo</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.gobizgo.com\">www.gobizgo.com</a> <br> <strong>BT StoreCentre </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.ebusiness.bt.com/storecentre/\">www.ebusiness.bt.com/storecentre/</a> <br> <strong> Caf\u00e9Press</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.cafepress.com\">www.cafepress.com</a> <br> <strong>Actinic</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.actinic.co.uk  \">www.actinic.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Putting a small business online is getting easier every day. No longer do businesses need to invest in expensive leased lines and run their own electronic commerce software. Instead companies all round the world are offering to take away the risk and pain that building an online store always seemed to entail. An online presence for an SME (Small/Medium Enterprise) is becoming almost essential, with website addresses appearing on the side of white vans and on shop awnings around the UK. So where should a small business that wants to trade online start? One approach is to use an Application Service Provider. ASPs are web services that host applications for remote users. Big businesses outsource IT to companies such as EDS and IBM all the time, and there's nothing to stop a much smaller company doing the same. Certainly a number of ASPs have thought as much, and offer everything from low-cost services paid for with what's known as a transaction tax - a few percent taken off every transaction - to subscription services rivaling those of a big online store. One of the more interesting ASPs is a small US service called Caf\u00e9Press. This is a service that creates simple online stores for artists, by offering print-on-demand services for T-shirts, mugs and mouse mats. Just upload an image, choose a price and wait for the cheques to start coming in. The ASP handles everything from printing the merchandise to handling credit card payments and posting the goods. The available product lines may be small, but it's a simple place to start - and every pound earned is profit. Businesses use Caf\u00e9Press to sell everything from photographs of cats to comic strip merchandising. It has proven particularly popular amongst the online comic community, where a popular site means that what was a hobby now needs a business to support it. One of the biggest players in the whole IT industry runs one of the most successful ASP web store systems. Intel purchased iCat, a software company with a set of tools for creating secure online stores, and turned it into an online service. ICat now gives small businesses a set of services that reduce the risks in building and running a web store. As well as offering a full-blown catalogue-driven store system, iCat's service also includes a separate shopping cart system that can be used in existing stores, so businesses with specific design needs can still take advantage of Intel's infrastructure. ICat's service is well designed, and works well with traditional business models. If an item isn't selling well, or is new, it can be turned into a special offer, or linked to cross-selling and up-selling services where other items can be used to promote sales. To make things easier for British businesses, iCat has a partnership with BT, and provides the tools used in BT's StoreCentre service. This is an inexpensive way of starting to sell online, as the quarterly costs vary with the number of items you're selling. A 50-item store will only cost you \u00a3114 a quarter, affordable for most small businesses. Some software packages help greatly in putting a business online. One of the most helpful is the SME-targeted web site design package NetObjects Fusion. Version 5.0 includes an \"online\" tab, which is actually a web site helping with design and site hosting decisions. Fusion is also designed to plug into existing online offerings, and earlier versions included the tools to design pages that linked into the iCat system. NetObjects also offers small businesses two other online tools, GoBizGo and eFUSE. GoBizGo is an ASP that allows businesses to create web sites and e-commerce services without needing anything more than a credit card and a web browser. This is a fee-based system, with monthly charges. It is still very focussed on the US market, but is a good example of the type of ASP service that can make putting a business online a matter of a few mouse clicks. A set of testimonials on the site show how it can be used to sell everything from bowling balls to stained glass windows and wildflower jewellery. The closely related eFUSE is intended for a different audience: businesses that have taken the plunge into designing and running their own online presences. It is full of design tips for e-commerce service providers. Actinic's Catalog has proven very popular and has received rave reviews. It is a wizard and template tool that allows businesses to create and manage their online stores, with hosting either carried out by Actinic's ISP partners or on a user's own servers. With Actinic Catalog, businesses can work with third-party payment sites, or process credit cards themselves, with all communications between customer and store handled by heavily encrypted messages. The latest version 4.0 of Actinic's software adds many new features, including the tools for managing back orders. Virgin has recently entered this market with Virginbiz.net, an online service with information for small businesses wanting to go online, as well as web space and an online store. It has the advantage of offering a complete design and build service, taking the strain away by completely handing over the site to Virgin's team. Freeserve's small business section Clearly Business offers similar services. Freeserve's offering could have an advantage over some of the others, as it includes linking to stores from the Freeserve online mall. Clearly Business partners with the popular WorldPay credit card service. This service provides credit card clearing and authentication for online businesses. WorldPay's WorldDirect service operates in 125 countries, with nearly a million customers in the USA alone. Businesses can use this service to handle credit card payments, with WorldPay taking a 4.5% handling fee on every transaction. This may seem expensive, but is often cheaper than a new online merchant relationship directly with a bank. International stores can also use WorldPay as it can work with most currencies and credit cards. WorldPay is now also offering a one-stop shop for starter online stores, with its new Click and Build service. The more ambitious can start to create their own online store using design packages targeted at the SME market, in conjunction with online catalogue and payment services. Using tools like these, free web space from an ISP, and a domain purchased from a service like Clicknames, an effective online presence can be put together for very little outlay. Whether it's a \"roll-your-own\" presence, an ecommerce package or an ASP, putting a small business online has never been easier. Of course this doesn't mean a quick path to dot.com riches, just another way of bringing customers to the door. Businesses will need to work on how they manage their relationships with their online customers, and how they will handle the trickiest part of the e-business chain: fulfilment. No matter how fancy the online presence, the goods still have to reach the customer.

      "body": "<p>The first record to be broken at this year's Olympics is unlikely to be on the track or field. A vast audience is expected to log on to Olympics.com tomorrow. The official Olympics site is likely to go down as the recipient of the largest number of hits ever sustained by a single website in one day, despite FBI-sanctioned warnings of hacker attacks and an anti-Olympic movement intent on disrupting the opening ceremony. </p> <p>Days before the start of the games, it was already the third most popular website in Australia. IBM - official internet and communications partner for the Sydney Olympics - predicts more than 6.5bn hits for Olympics. com over the next two weeks. </p> <p>But, despite the welter of statistics on the site and the massive number of hits, one thing will be missing: live, streaming video from the games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned it all, and started pursuit of countless websites it says are breaking the law. </p> <p>It is already a fierce battle. The websites are accusing the IOC of being monolithic and heavy handed, and say the IOC is acting against the spirit of the games. </p> <p>At stake is the IOC's lucrative contracts with broadcasters, which include traditional television stations such as the BBC, NBC and Seven Networks in Australia. For the first time, the IOC has also signed exclusive deals with \"broadband\" operators to show highlights of the games on the internet. </p> <p>To protect these deals, the IOC has clamped down hard. As well as a complete lack of live action, only a tiny number of broadband users will be able to see any highlights online, via the websites of official partners. Unofficial websites will not be able to use any audio or video from the games, and dot.com sports journalists are barred. Even competitors will be unable to write online diaries of their experiences in Sydney - it was reported last week that this would be in breach of the IOC's code of conduct for athletes. </p> <p>Using the 1999 US anti-cybersquatting act, the IOC is also targeting websites that use \"Olympic\" language in their addresses. Nearly 2,000 domains are being sued in a class action, ranging from companies unrelated to the games, through pornographers and ticket touts to amateur athletics sites. </p> <p>The roots of the problem lie back in 1994, before the internet reared its egalitarian head as a mass communications medium. Then, the IOC signed a $4bn deal with the American broadcaster NBC for exclusive TV coverage of the Olympics from 1998 to 2008. NBC wants to show \"live\" Olympics at prime time in the US, to maximise advertising revenue. But the time difference between Sydney and the US means NBC is going to delay all its coverage by half a day. The network fears the net could gazump it by offering video to the US audience before NBC gets round to its \"live\" package. </p> <p>But a number of the sites named in the class action have hit back, saying they never had any intention of broadcasting highlights of the games, and claiming the action is a ruse to silence outlets not sanctioned by the all-powerful IOC. </p> <p>Chris Jenkins is the managing director of a small internet company in Aberdeen which has been on the sharp end of the IOC and its lawyers. His company, <a href=\"http://www.planetscotland.com\" target=\"_new\">Planet Scotland</a>, runs websites dedicated to niche sports such as fishing and golf, and last year registered 58 domain names containing the word Olympic. </p> <p>The plan was to provide a circuit of sites based around a central hub called Planet Olympics - in time for the the Athens Games in 2004. But in July,the company received a letter from its net registrar, saying that its domains had been frozen. A ruling in the US courts had deemed Planet Scotland was among those companies illegally cybersquatting on Olympic domains. </p> <p>Planet Scotland says it is doing no harm and is outraged that US legislation is enforceable in the UK. \"We are not cybersquatting in any shape or format,\" says Jenkins. \"None of the names has been offered or are for sale to third parties.\" The company has even promised to donate all profits to an Olympic charity. </p> <p>Jenkins continues: \"It [the IOC] is prepared to pour a lot of money into lawyers' pockets instead of using it for the benefit of the Olympic athletes\". </p> <p>The IOC has accused Planet Scotland of acting in bad faith, and claims that although Planet Scotland is not trading in the US it is still subject to US jurisdiction because the domain, like all other domain names, is ultimately US registered. </p> <p>Many of those caught up in the suit are in the grass roots of athletics - Olympics enthusiasts who have created websites around the event. </p> <p>Since 1998, Robert Livingstone has been running <a href=\"http://www.TorontoSummerGames.com\" target=\"_new\">TorontoSummerGames.com</a>, a news and information site which monitors the Olympic bidding process. A year ago, Livingstone decided there was demand for an independent website monitoring all Olympic bids. He registered OlympicBids.com, and began developing it in time for the Sydney Games. The site was due to go live last month. </p> <p>He heard about the IOC's class action through friends, but at the time of going to press was yet to hear from the IOC or its lawyers, despite his domain being included in the class action. </p> <p>He says: \"The IOC tied up our domain name so that we couldn't change any of the information on it. We couldn't change the owner, the address information. We couldn't renew it and we couldn't change the site to another server. It was simply frozen.\" </p> <p>After weeks of wrangling with the IOC's lawyers, Livingstone has finally been told, informally, he can keep the domain name.\"What really disappoints me is that they landed me in a class action with a whole bunch of domains that they really know nothing about. The IOC is guilty of issuing writs and asking questions later,\" he says. </p> <p>He is still waiting for written confirmation of the IOC's agreement and, in the meantime, the site remains frozen during its most crucial time - two weeks after the IOC announced the shortlist for the the 2008 Olympics. </p> <p>This week the IOC confirmed to the Guardian that it was seeking to shut down websites that made use of Olympic names, such as <a href=\"http://www.Olympic.com\" target=\"_new\">Olympic.com</a>, the site of a company selling wood stain and waterproofing sealant. But a spokesperson said that the legal action would not bear fruit for some time. </p> <p>It said it had no plans to renegotiate its major rights deals which, in NBC's case, run until 2008. But an IOC conference on new media sports coverage in Lausanne this December could provide impetus for fresh thinking in the Olympic movement about the internet age. </p> <p>The IOC spokesperson said it would not be penalising fan sites run by amateur sports enthusiasts. \"It's one thing to provide a photograph or comment, but it's another thing to imply involvement with the official sites.\" But Helen Lensky, author of Inside the Olympic Industry: Power, Politics, and Activism, disagrees, and says the IOC has used draconian tactics to protect its deals with the broadcasters. </p> <p>She believes that the \"wider commercial imperative\" is to protect the official sponsors, who have also spent millions of dollars to get exclusive sponsorship. </p> <p>She says what the sponsors don't want is \"ambush marketing\" where companies attempt to piggyback their publicity on major events without splashing out on official sponsorship deals. But she says that in its keenness to monopolise the Olympic event, the IOC is hurting small businesses not connected with the games. She cites the removal of a 30-year-old trademark from the Olympic Restaurant in Sydney as a sign that the IOC will stop at nothing to protect its sponsors. \"The IOC has shown itself determined to stamp out any voices contrary to the official Olympic message. It is not interested in any kind of coverage that might be critical to the games.\" </p> <p>It's not just the Olympics. During Euro 2000, Uefa, barred internet journalists with the exception of Sportal, the sports portal that won the contract to run the official site. <a href=\"http://www.Sportal.com\" target=\"_new\">Sportal</a> was also a title sponsor for Euro 2000, for which it paid \u00a36.6m. </p> <p>Internet rights for major sporting events are now very big business - and the Olympics is no different. Only a fort night ago, <a href=\"http://www.optushome.com.au/aup.html\" target=\"_new\">Optus@Home</a>, Australia's Excite@Home high-speed cable access service, struck a deal with Australia's official Olympic broadcaster to beam its daily highlights package to computers in, potentially, 2.2m Australian homes. </p> <p>\"I think Channel Seven and us are just scratching the surface,\" says Chris Chapman, chief executive officer of Excite@Home. He accepts that the closed nature of Optus@Home's audience is the reason for bagging the Olympic deal, but says: \"I have no doubt that sport in particular is going to drive the development of a truly international mode of broadband.\" </p> <p>Optus@Home is the first deal that will deliver Olympic TV highlights over a cable broadband service in Australia, but across the globe, other commercial bargains are being struck over the Olympics. <a href=\"http://www.chello.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chello</a>, a European internet service provider, plans to show Olympic video through a deal with a European TV station. And in the US, NBC and <a href=\"http://www.quokka.com/\" target=\"_new\">Quokka</a> will show 20-minute highlight packages to broadband users. These are all excluded from the IOC's class action. </p> <p>So, even though the athletes will still compete with every sinew in their bodies over the coming weeks, the battle that has already been fought over the web hints that noble notions of the Olympics as the amateur \"people's games\" now belongs to a pre-internet age.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Open Sorcery Open Sorcery is dedicated to the intersection of computer games and art. Although much of the material is available elsewhere on the web, what it has collated is something called a game patch: a hacked piece of code that subverts a commercially available computer game. A patch allows a game such as Quake or Tomb Raider to be manipulated, changing the characters or setting and altering the experience of the game. Most patches are trivial, the most famous being Nude Raider - alas, no longer available for legal reasons. But Open Sorcery has links to more subversive patches that radically alter games to promote an agenda of their own, most notably feminism. Net worth Britart is a new online gallery selling contemporary art on the web. It offers works by up and coming artists for around \u00a33,000. It has a clean interface and a front page that looks like one of Damien Hirst's spot paintings. The work on sale is of consistent quality and well displayed. It should give rivals LondonArt.co.uk and Eyestorm.com a run for their Monet. Poptastic Alan McGee, the former boss of Creation Records, has launched Poptones, an online record label. The site looks a little bare at the moment, plastered as it is with Coming Soon signs. But there is a RealAudio channel, information on the four bands he has signed, and a request for unsigned demo tapes. When McGee left Creation last year, he claimed that the traditional way of marketing music was dead. It should soon become apparent how he intends to replace it. Also worth a look is www.channelfly.com, an online music promoter's site. It is packed with material about the gigs they promote, supported by webcasts and free MP3s.

After all, I'm only being myself, and if people don't like that, I can't change who I am. In some ways I find people are invading my personal space, but I also enjoy the attention that I get from it.

I also hope to create video archives for people to be able to see what I was doing on various days.

      "body": "<p><strong> More of the same old excellent stuff<br> TOCA World Touring Cars</strong> <br>Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Codemasters **** <br> Reviewing games is a cruel business. On any other platform, in any other genre, TOCA World Touring Cars would get five stars. But the PlayStation has a plethora of great driving games including TOCA 2 and Colin McRae Rally (both from Code-masters), Gran Turismo 2, V-Rally, Destruction Derby Raw, Wip3out, and several Formula One simulations. </p> <p>For gameplay, TOCA World is up there with the best of them, but the graphics aren't. Two years ago they would have been outstanding, but as programmers have wrung the last dregs of performance out of the aging machine, meeting expectations has become tougher than ever. </p> <p>TOCA World also loses a few fractions of a point for a lack of originality. It is, after all, a continuation of the TOCA touring car series, though it takes you much further afield. The game offers a superb selection of realistic tracks including four in the UK, and three each in Australia, Japan and the USA. </p> <p>Although there are quick race and time trial options, the heart of the game involves competing though a championship season, and winning at least one race to continue. It is much more involving than, say, Gran Turismo. And races are more exciting because more cars are involved, not just GT's five. </p> <p>The final few fractions of a point have been deducted for a reason that could make me unpopular: TOCA World is a bit too easy. It is not all that easy to win races, actually, but it is pretty easy to stay on the track, even if you bash into other cars. Realism is an unrealistic goal - if you had to be as talented as Colin McRae to win, racing games would be unplayable - but being too forgiving removes some of the challenge. </p> <p>Four stars, then. But it's still a cracking game, and should sell squillions. (JS)</p> <p><strong> Going for gold in Olympic key pounding <br> Sydney 2000 </strong><br> PC, PlayStation \u00a329.99 Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Eidos/ Attention to Detail **<br> It's Olympics time and, once again, steroids are in the news. Of course it's morally reprehensible for athletes to cheat but, such is the physical exertion needed to play this video game, anything that keeps you going should be considered. Sydney 2000 is the official Olympic game but it might as well be Los Angeles 1984 for all the gameplay advances made since then. For those without muscle aching memories of Daley Thompson's Decathlon and the rest, your aim is to pound two buttons as hard as you can for varying amounts of time. Pressing the action button at the right moment is the only other interaction in 10 of the 12 events. The other two - skeet shooting and kayaking - offer a welcome change of emphasis which is soon tempered by their frustrating difficulty levels. </p> <p>The game comes on three formats and is surprisingly similar on each. Obviously the PC version has the prettiest graphics, with some impressive animation, although the Dreamcast isn't far behind. The real difference is in control. PC owners should prepare for some heavy keyboard abuse while Dreamcasters will rapidly realise that their chunky controllers just weren't made for this. The PlayStation dual-shock works best even if the visuals are lacking. </p> <p>Realising the inherent simplicity of the genre, the developers have incorporated a training mode that allows you to build up your athlete. Unfortunately this involves yet more button bashing, making it an unappealing prospect. </p> <p>Ultimately the only way to appreciate games like this is with friends, but enjoyable multi-player distraction or not, the limitations and lack of variety soon tell. It may look the part but Sydney 2000 barely scrapes bronze. (GH)</p> <p> <strong> Having fun catching the 2D vib<br> Vib-Ribbon</strong><br> Sony PlayStation \u00a310-15 Nanaonsha/Sony ***** <br> Parental health warning: Vib-Ribbon could turn your child into a slavering vegetable. In fact, it's so damned strange, it could turn your vegetable into a child. </p> <p>What makes this game so special? A spaced-out Japanese pop soundtrack and two-dimensional wireframe graphics. Yes, wireframe graphics - as in Asteroids, as in Defender - and black and white ones to boot. </p> <p>To elaborate: Vibri is a white stick rabbit walking along a line. This line - the titular Vib-Ribbon, one supposes - modulates according to the music being played, offering four different kinds of obstacle. To help Vibri overcome an obstacle, all you have to do is press the corresponding button. Although things start out simple enough, before long the game becomes more challenging, as combination obstacles appear, forcing the player to press various keys simultaneously. </p> <p>If you time your presses correctly, Vibri evolves into a higher life form. Miss a beat, however, and the line begins to quiver, and your 2D friend slips slowly down the evolutionary ladder and ultimately to oblivion. </p> <p>Fortunately, you are not restricted to the seven distressing Japanese tracks included with the game. The stroke of genius here is that you can play along to your own CDs, which the game software will analyse and convert into new ribbons. Gameplay is limited only by the size of your CD collection. </p> <p>Catchwise, the software is not 100 % reliable in its interpretation of music, and Vibri's relentlessly upbeat whine may have some reaching for their two-dimensional 12-bore. Otherwise, Vib-Ribbon is living, dancing proof that games don't need fancy graphics to be innovative and fun. The tie-in record and novelty dance move can only be days away. (AB)</p>",

Ultimately the only way to appreciate games like this is with friends, but enjoyable multi-player distraction or not, the limitations and lack of variety soon tell. It may look the part but Sydney 2000 barely scrapes bronze. (GH) Having fun catching the 2D vib Vib-Ribbon Sony PlayStation \u00a310-15 Nanaonsha/Sony ***** Parental health warning: Vib-Ribbon could turn your child into a slavering vegetable. In fact, it's so damned strange, it could turn your vegetable into a child. What makes this game so special? A spaced-out Japanese pop soundtrack and two-dimensional wireframe graphics. Yes, wireframe graphics - as in Asteroids, as in Defender - and black and white ones to boot. To elaborate: Vibri is a white stick rabbit walking along a line. This line - the titular Vib-Ribbon, one supposes - modulates according to the music being played, offering four different kinds of obstacle. To help Vibri overcome an obstacle, all you have to do is press the corresponding button. Although things start out simple enough, before long the game becomes more challenging, as combination obstacles appear, forcing the player to press various keys simultaneously. If you time your presses correctly, Vibri evolves into a higher life form. Miss a beat, however, and the line begins to quiver, and your 2D friend slips slowly down the evolutionary ladder and ultimately to oblivion. Fortunately, you are not restricted to the seven distressing Japanese tracks included with the game. The stroke of genius here is that you can play along to your own CDs, which the game software will analyse and convert into new ribbons. Gameplay is limited only by the size of your CD collection. Catchwise, the software is not 100 % reliable in its interpretation of music, and Vibri's relentlessly upbeat whine may have some reaching for their two-dimensional 12-bore. Otherwise, Vib-Ribbon is living, dancing proof that games don't need fancy graphics to be innovative and fun. The tie-in record and novelty dance move can only be days away. (AB)",

      "byline": "Jack Schofield",

      "body": "<p>Microsoft UK is not holding a launch party for the latest version of Windows, which goes on sale today. It isn't even holding a wake, though Windows Millennium Edition - Me for short - is the last of the line. After this, Microsoft hopes everyone will move on to the more powerful, more reliable, and more expensive New Technology of Windows NT/2000, leaving the old world of Microsoft MS-Dos computing behind. </p> <p>Of course, that was supposed to happen after Windows 98, which was quickly followed by Windows 98 Second Edition, and Me is basically Windows 98 Third Edition. It hasn't changed much, which is why Microsoft is offering Windows 98 and SE users a half price upgrade - about \u00a340. Whether it is worth it is another matter. </p> <p>Me is also the first version of Windows designed specially for home users. The most obvious signs are the multimedia elements. Me includes the all-purpose Windows Media Player 7, Movie Maker video editing software, and Windows Image Acquisition software to grab pictures from digital cameras. </p> <p>Windows Explorer has also been given an extra View menu option, Thumbnails, which shows what files look like. Indeed, when you first save an image, it opens automatically in the Thumbnails view in the My Pictures folder inside My Documents. This is one of many cute tricks that Me pulls. They are great if they do what you want, and very annoying if they don't. </p> <p>Another factor is that home users rarely follow the rules of \"safe hex\". They promiscuously load all sorts of rubbish from computer magazine cover discs, and they tend to delete or update vital files without doing proper back-ups or testing. Windows Me tries to solve these problems by protecting about 80 of its files: it will restore and replace them if they are tampered with. Me can also download its own updates from the web. </p> <p>If the worst happens, Me offers System Restore, a sort of snapshot facility. If your PC doesn't work as well as it used to, Me lets you revert to an earlier state. </p> <p>Me also makes home networking and internet sharing easier - a big thing in the US, now so many homes have multiple PCs. My Network Places (formerly called Network Neighborhood) includes a Home Networking Wizard to take you through the process. Connect the Me machine to the net and the Wizard will create floppy disks to set up other Me, Windows 98 and Windows 95 PCs. </p> <p>The networking theme continues with five new games - backgammon, checkers, hearts, spades and reversi - that let you play against other people at <a href=\"http://www.zone.com\">Microsoft's Gaming Zone</a>. There is also a good patience game, Spider Solitaire, to join Solitaire and Freecell. </p> <p>But Me is not all good news. The main drawbacks? It is slower and perhaps slightly less solid than 98SE, which is the best of the 9x line. The speed loss is presumably due to the molly-coddling file tracking, and to the inclusion of Internet Explorer 5.5 and Windows Media Player 7: both are big. </p> <p>To be fair, my home PC, used for testing, is only a 200MHz Pentium MMX with 64 megabytes of memory. This is more powerful than Microsoft's suggested minimum for running Me, but frankly, a 350MHz Pentium II is a more appropriate beast. If your PC is faster than that, you may not notice the loss of speed. </p> <p>Me may also duplicate software that you already have installed and c lash with it. For example, you may be running ConfigSafe or GoBack to provide a \"system restore\" function, or ACDSee 32 or Thumbs Plus as a graphical viewer with thumbnails. </p> <p>To improve stability, Microsoft has tried to get rid of some of the long-standing problems caused by antique programs and peripherals that use the Disk Operating System launched with the IBM PC in 1981. Me therefore blocks access to \"real mode\" MS-Dos, though you can still run DOS programs in Windows, and you don't have to be very geeky to figure out how to get back to it. </p> <p>Support for old networking systems has been dumped too, though Microsoft brought back Novell support following an outcry during Me's beta testing phase. </p> <p>So is Me for you? </p> <p>If you are still running Windows 95, forget it. Me would be a big improvement, but your PC is probably not powerful enough to run it comfortably. </p> <p>If you are running Windows 98 or 98SE and already have accessory programs such as ConfigSafe, GoBack, ACDSee and so on, then Me does not add much. If you want newer versions of Internet Explorer, Outlook Express and Windows Media Player, they are available, free, on the Microsoft website. </p> <p>However, if you don't have any accessory programs, or you are particularly accident prone, then Windows Me is a cheap upgrade for as long as the half-price offer lasts. </p> <p>The upgrade may also be worthwhile if your PC has problems running 98/98SE, especially if it slows to a crawl and crashes when it runs out of resources (see Start|Programs|Accessories|System Tools|Resource Meter). Me handles low resources better. However, if 98/98SE runs well then it is probably not worth the effort. </p> <p>But if you are buying a new PC, then Me does provide some improvements, and there is no obvious reason to avoid it. In fact, most copies of Me will undoubtedly be sold with new PCs, rather than as upgrade packages, and that is the way to go. </p> <p> \u0095 The US launch party for Windows ME is being webcast today at 10am PDT at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsme\" target=\"_new\">www.microsoft.com/windowsme </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Microsoft UK is not holding a launch party for the latest version of Windows, which goes on sale today. It isn't even holding a wake, though Windows Millennium Edition - Me for short - is the last of the line. After this, Microsoft hopes everyone will move on to the more powerful, more reliable, and more expensive New Technology of Windows NT/2000, leaving the old world of Microsoft MS-Dos computing behind. Of course, that was supposed to happen after Windows 98, which was quickly followed by Windows 98 Second Edition, and Me is basically Windows 98 Third Edition. It hasn't changed much, which is why Microsoft is offering Windows 98 and SE users a half price upgrade - about \u00a340. Whether it is worth it is another matter. Me is also the first version of Windows designed specially for home users. The most obvious signs are the multimedia elements. Me includes the all-purpose Windows Media Player 7, Movie Maker video editing software, and Windows Image Acquisition software to grab pictures from digital cameras. Windows Explorer has also been given an extra View menu option, Thumbnails, which shows what files look like. Indeed, when you first save an image, it opens automatically in the Thumbnails view in the My Pictures folder inside My Documents. This is one of many cute tricks that Me pulls. They are great if they do what you want, and very annoying if they don't. Another factor is that home users rarely follow the rules of \"safe hex\". They promiscuously load all sorts of rubbish from computer magazine cover discs, and they tend to delete or update vital files without doing proper back-ups or testing. Windows Me tries to solve these problems by protecting about 80 of its files: it will restore and replace them if they are tampered with. Me can also download its own updates from the web. If the worst happens, Me offers System Restore, a sort of snapshot facility. If your PC doesn't work as well as it used to, Me lets you revert to an earlier state. Me also makes home networking and internet sharing easier - a big thing in the US, now so many homes have multiple PCs. My Network Places (formerly called Network Neighborhood) includes a Home Networking Wizard to take you through the process. Connect the Me machine to the net and the Wizard will create floppy disks to set up other Me, Windows 98 and Windows 95 PCs. The networking theme continues with five new games - backgammon, checkers, hearts, spades and reversi - that let you play against other people at Microsoft's Gaming Zone. There is also a good patience game, Spider Solitaire, to join Solitaire and Freecell. But Me is not all good news. The main drawbacks? It is slower and perhaps slightly less solid than 98SE, which is the best of the 9x line. The speed loss is presumably due to the molly-coddling file tracking, and to the inclusion of Internet Explorer 5.5 and Windows Media Player 7: both are big. To be fair, my home PC, used for testing, is only a 200MHz Pentium MMX with 64 megabytes of memory. This is more powerful than Microsoft's suggested minimum for running Me, but frankly, a 350MHz Pentium II is a more appropriate beast. If your PC is faster than that, you may not notice the loss of speed. Me may also duplicate software that you already have installed and c lash with it. For example, you may be running ConfigSafe or GoBack to provide a \"system restore\" function, or ACDSee 32 or Thumbs Plus as a graphical viewer with thumbnails. To improve stability, Microsoft has tried to get rid of some of the long-standing problems caused by antique programs and peripherals that use the Disk Operating System launched with the IBM PC in 1981. Me therefore blocks access to \"real mode\" MS-Dos, though you can still run DOS programs in Windows, and you don't have to be very geeky to figure out how to get back to it. Support for old networking systems has been dumped too, though Microsoft brought back Novell support following an outcry during Me's beta testing phase. So is Me for you? If you are still running Windows 95, forget it. Me would be a big improvement, but your PC is probably not powerful enough to run it comfortably. If you are running Windows 98 or 98SE and already have accessory programs such as ConfigSafe, GoBack, ACDSee and so on, then Me does not add much. If you want newer versions of Internet Explorer, Outlook Express and Windows Media Player, they are available, free, on the Microsoft website. However, if you don't have any accessory programs, or you are particularly accident prone, then Windows Me is a cheap upgrade for as long as the half-price offer lasts. The upgrade may also be worthwhile if your PC has problems running 98/98SE, especially if it slows to a crawl and crashes when it runs out of resources (see Start|Programs|Accessories|System Tools|Resource Meter). Me handles low resources better. However, if 98/98SE runs well then it is probably not worth the effort. But if you are buying a new PC, then Me does provide some improvements, and there is no obvious reason to avoid it. In fact, most copies of Me will undoubtedly be sold with new PCs, rather than as upgrade packages, and that is the way to go. \u0095 The US launch party for Windows ME is being webcast today at 10am PDT at www.microsoft.com/windowsme",

A new facility is voice Wap: users can shout \"internet!\" at the phone and its Wap browser automatically kicks in. The smaller of the pair, the Xenium Wap, is targeted at business users and boasts an impressive seven hours talk time. It will retail for around \u00a3100. The Az@lis is a pay as you go phone available from BT Cellnet. </p> <p>The company is also launching its first ever MP3 music products. Due in stores now is the tiny \u00a3250 Rush personal player which comes with a 64MB SmartMedia card capable of archiving around an hour's worth of CD-ish quality tunes. Philips is also touting a CD personal, the \u00a3230 eXpanium, and a CD home deck, the \u00a3280 FW-M55, which will play back CD-ROMs that hold MP3 files. An audio unit with hard disk storage could be on the cards for 2002. Also coming soon are the ToUcams, a series of web cameras that look like a bird and are designed to nest on the top of your PC. </p> <p><strong> TiVo - old hat?</strong><br> The UK launch of the TiVo personal video recorder system might only be weeks away. But it's already starting look like old hat compared to what's on sale in the United States. Across the pond, TiVo's great rival Replay has just started shipping a new PVR with a capacity of 60 hours - more that twice the storage of both other US systems and the Sky/Thomson unit. The 60 gigabyte Replay unit goes on sale in October priced at $799. </p> <p>Meanwhile Philips has confirmed that it is eager to launch a personal video recorder in the UK, but not this side of Christmas. At a briefing in Holland, the company hinted that it was likely to launch a TiVo system some time next year, probably integrated into a digital TV set-top box. </p> <p><strong> Box of tricks</strong><br> Next year Nokia will be gunning for that space under your television with an all-in-one box that offers digital TV, internet access and personal video recording on to a 20 gigabyte hard disk. The Media Terminal, expected next summer, uses the Linux operating system, the Mozilla web browser and Intel's x86 computer architecture. </p> <p>It will be available in two incarnations: one designed for Digital TV networks and another that's compatible with ADSL broadband services. </p> <p>Like the Sky/TiVo box, it will allow viewers to pause and replay live broadcasts and make timed recordings: in this instance, via the Nokia Navibars user interface. </p> <p>Nokia is unwilling to confirm a price for the Media Terminal largely because it hasn't signed a deal with a digital TV network. An agreement with ONdigital, BSkyB, or NTL could see the product subsidised and on sale for around \u00a3200.

      "body": "<p>The United Nations force commander in Sierra Leone has accused Nigerian political and military officials at the top of the UN mission in Freetown of \"working hard to sabotage the peace process\", and the Nigerian army command of looting diamonds in league with the now imprisoned rebel leader, Foday Sankoh.</p> <p>In a devastating four-page confidential report obtained by the Guardian, Major-General Vijay Jetley paints a picture of a conspiracy to force him out as the UN commander in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The revelations will cast a shadow over the Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo's official three-day visit to London this week when he is due to meet Tony Blair, senior ministers and Prince Charles. The president has put the fight against corruption high on his domestic agenda.</p> <p>The public airing of bitter differences within the UN operation in Freetown came as world leaders met in New York at the UN millennium summit last week and pledged to overhaul peacekeeping in Africa after a decade of humiliating failures in Angola, Somalia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. With 7,000 more UN troops destined for Freetown, Gen Jetley's report will force the UN security council to confront issues beyond the numbers of peacekeepers and their mandate, and to consider whether the whole operation is a further threat to stability in West Africa.</p> <p>The memorandum, called \"Report on the crisis in Sierra Leone\", was written during the upheaval in May that prompted British intervention to prevent the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) from seizing power. Gen Jetley did not officially submit the document to the UN, but it has been circulated among security council members and other major players in Sierra Leone. Its damning criticism of the Nigerians, and its exposure of the deep divisions that have all but paralysed the UN mission, has added pressure for a shakeup of a discredited peace keeping force that Britain is counting on to help defeat the RUF.</p> <p>Gen Jetley singles out three Nigerians for particular criticism: Kofi Annan's special representative in Freetown, under-secretary-general Oluyemi Adeniji; the former head of Ecomog, the West African intervention force in Sierra Leone that worked with the UN for six months, Major General Gabriel Kpamber; and the deputy commander of the force, Brigadier-General Mohammed Garba, who is Gen Jetley's immediate subordinate.</p> <p>The report lays bare the personal animosity between Gen Jetley and the men he accuses, but it goes further by detailing a series of actions that he says amount to collusion with the rebels to wreck last year's peace accords because Nigeria wants a free hand to run Sierra Leone and its army wants to control the diamond trade. At the heart of the accusations lie charges that the Nigerians compromised Gen Jetley's efforts to free 500 of his peacekeepers taken hostage by the RUF in May.</p> <p>\"The mission directive given to me and which I tried to follow, directly conflicted with the interests of not only the warring factions but also of the major players in the diamond racket like Liberia and Nigeria.</p> <p>\"As an Indian, and having no hidden agenda to promote, I became a victim of the machinations of these countries. By placing their stooges in the right places they have not only tried to scuttle the peace process but also try and denigrate me and the country I represent, to promote their own personal ambitions and personal interests.</p> <p>\"It is my opinion that the Ecomog force commander along with the SRSG [Mr Adeniji] and DFC [Gen Garba] have worked hard to sabotage the peace process and show Indians in general and me in particular in a poor light . . . Keeping the Nigerian interests was paramount even if it meant scuttling the peace process and this also implied that Unamsil [the UN force] was expendable. To this end the SRSG and DFC cultivated the RUF leadership, especially Foday Sankoh, behind my back.\"</p> <p>The report came as no surprise to senior UN officials, who say there is ample evidence the Nigerian army remains heavily implicated in the illegal diamond trade, that its senior officers worked closely with the RUF despite having also fought it, and that the Nigerians believe that, as the largest troop contingent in the UN mission, they should have overall command.</p> <p>Gen Jetley argues that senior Nigerian army officers - particularly Gen Kpamber and Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe, who died earlier this year - did not want to withdraw from Sierra Leone because they were making huge amounts of money from illegal diamond mining and the RUF.</p> <p>In January Gen Kpamber astonished a meeting of regional heads of state on the peace process by praising Mr Sankoh as the \"saviour of the nation\". The two men were often seen in each other's company travelling to diamond towns from which the UN was barred.</p> <p>Gen Jetley lists a series of actions by the Nigerian army that he concludes amounted to colluding in the abductions. He notes that while Kenyans, Zambians and Indians were taken captive, the rebels let the Nigerians go.</p> <p>Ewen MacAskill in New York writes: The UN security council last week agreed to overhaul its peacekeeping operations, with a six-step programme, including \"clearly defined, credible, achievable and appropriate mandates\".</p> <p>The new mandates will include \"effective measures for the security and safety of United Nations personnel and, wherever possible, for the protection of the civilian population\".</p> <p>Other steps include helping the UN to obtain trained and properly equipped personnel for peacekeeping operations. Many of the UN troops sent to Sierra Leone from developing countries were short of basic equipment.</p> <p>One of the biggest and most expensive changes will be the creation of a permanent UN high command to plan, deploy and conduct peacekeeping operations in an effort to reduce the chaos that all too often surrounds its interventions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations force commander in Sierra Leone has accused Nigerian political and military officials at the top of the UN mission in Freetown of \"working hard to sabotage the peace process\", and the Nigerian army command of looting diamonds in league with the now imprisoned rebel leader, Foday Sankoh. In a devastating four-page confidential report obtained by the Guardian, Major-General Vijay Jetley paints a picture of a conspiracy to force him out as the UN commander in Sierra Leone. The revelations will cast a shadow over the Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo's official three-day visit to London this week when he is due to meet Tony Blair, senior ministers and Prince Charles. The president has put the fight against corruption high on his domestic agenda. The public airing of bitter differences within the UN operation in Freetown came as world leaders met in New York at the UN millennium summit last week and pledged to overhaul peacekeeping in Africa after a decade of humiliating failures in Angola, Somalia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. With 7,000 more UN troops destined for Freetown, Gen Jetley's report will force the UN security council to confront issues beyond the numbers of peacekeepers and their mandate, and to consider whether the whole operation is a further threat to stability in West Africa. The memorandum, called \"Report on the crisis in Sierra Leone\", was written during the upheaval in May that prompted British intervention to prevent the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) from seizing power. Gen Jetley did not officially submit the document to the UN, but it has been circulated among security council members and other major players in Sierra Leone. Its damning criticism of the Nigerians, and its exposure of the deep divisions that have all but paralysed the UN mission, has added pressure for a shakeup of a discredited peace keeping force that Britain is counting on to help defeat the RUF. Gen Jetley singles out three Nigerians for particular criticism: Kofi Annan's special representative in Freetown, under-secretary-general Oluyemi Adeniji; the former head of Ecomog, the West African intervention force in Sierra Leone that worked with the UN for six months, Major General Gabriel Kpamber; and the deputy commander of the force, Brigadier-General Mohammed Garba, who is Gen Jetley's immediate subordinate. The report lays bare the personal animosity between Gen Jetley and the men he accuses, but it goes further by detailing a series of actions that he says amount to collusion with the rebels to wreck last year's peace accords because Nigeria wants a free hand to run Sierra Leone and its army wants to control the diamond trade. At the heart of the accusations lie charges that the Nigerians compromised Gen Jetley's efforts to free 500 of his peacekeepers taken hostage by the RUF in May. \"The mission directive given to me and which I tried to follow, directly conflicted with the interests of not only the warring factions but also of the major players in the diamond racket like Liberia and Nigeria. \"As an Indian, and having no hidden agenda to promote, I became a victim of the machinations of these countries. By placing their stooges in the right places they have not only tried to scuttle the peace process but also try and denigrate me and the country I represent, to promote their own personal ambitions and personal interests. \"It is my opinion that the Ecomog force commander along with the SRSG [Mr Adeniji] and DFC [Gen Garba] have worked hard to sabotage the peace process and show Indians in general and me in particular in a poor light . . . Keeping the Nigerian interests was paramount even if it meant scuttling the peace process and this also implied that Unamsil [the UN force] was expendable. To this end the SRSG and DFC cultivated the RUF leadership, especially Foday Sankoh, behind my back.\" The report came as no surprise to senior UN officials, who say there is ample evidence the Nigerian army remains heavily implicated in the illegal diamond trade, that its senior officers worked closely with the RUF despite having also fought it, and that the Nigerians believe that, as the largest troop contingent in the UN mission, they should have overall command. Gen Jetley argues that senior Nigerian army officers - particularly Gen Kpamber and Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe, who died earlier this year - did not want to withdraw from Sierra Leone because they were making huge amounts of money from illegal diamond mining and the RUF. In January Gen Kpamber astonished a meeting of regional heads of state on the peace process by praising Mr Sankoh as the \"saviour of the nation\". The two men were often seen in each other's company travelling to diamond towns from which the UN was barred. Gen Jetley lists a series of actions by the Nigerian army that he concludes amounted to colluding in the abductions. He notes that while Kenyans, Zambians and Indians were taken captive, the rebels let the Nigerians go. Ewen MacAskill in New York writes: The UN security council last week agreed to overhaul its peacekeeping operations, with a six-step programme, including \"clearly defined, credible, achievable and appropriate mandates\". The new mandates will include \"effective measures for the security and safety of United Nations personnel and, wherever possible, for the protection of the civilian population\". Other steps include helping the UN to obtain trained and properly equipped personnel for peacekeeping operations. Many of the UN troops sent to Sierra Leone from developing countries were short of basic equipment. One of the biggest and most expensive changes will be the creation of a permanent UN high command to plan, deploy and conduct peacekeeping operations in an effort to reduce the chaos that all too often surrounds its interventions.",
