      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Q: Have negotiations over a new transfer system been concluded?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Yes, but it might not be the end of the matter. After six months of negotiations the football authorities and the EU hope to have found a solution. But Fifpro, the European players' union, plans a legal challenge to the new rules. </p> <p> <strong> Q: So what are the new rules and how will the new transfer system look?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> From the start of next season the new system will be in force. Players will be allowed only one move each season. There will be only two transfer windows: a main one in the summer and a mid-season window limited to buying and selling to replace injured players or for technical reasons. </p> <p> <strong> Q: Will there still be contracts for players?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Yes. All contracts will be for a minimum of one year and a maximum of five. Players aged 28 or under will have to honour their contracts for a minimum of three years, those over 28 for a minimum of two. These time spans are called the protected periods. </p> <p> <strong> Q: Will it be easier for players to move clubs?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Yes. Once a player has honoured the minimum contract time he can terminate it by giving notice and leaving at the end of a season. </p> <p> <strong> Q: What happens if a player wants to break his contract and move before two or three years?</strong> </p> <p> <strong>A </strong>Players who unilaterally break contracts during a protected period will be suspended for a minimum of four months. Clubs inducing players to break contracts can be prevented from making a signing for a year or more, have league points deducted or even be excluded from competitions. Agents involved in breach of contract can be fined. If a player leaves for a new club during his protected period, the new club will be deemed to have induced him and sporting sanctions will be applied. </p> <p> <strong> Q: Will players be allowed to break contracts without facing sporting sanctions?</strong> </p> <p><strong> A</strong> Yes, if they can prove there was sporting just cause for doing so. This means that if, say, a player plays in less than 10% of his club's games in a season but they refuse to let him go, he has the right to break his contract. Tribunals set up to judge these issues will also entertain claims from players who have been played out of position by their managers. </p> <p> <strong> Q: Will there still be transfer fees?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Only for players who are under 23 when they are transferred. Compensation is then payable according to a complex formula which has yet to be fully worked out. </p> <p> <strong> Q: If transfer fees fall sharply, how will small clubs survive - those who rely on the sale of players, particularly young emerging ones, for extra revenue?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Clubs with players aged 23 or under will receive special compensation for the amount of time they have spent on their development. Training compensation will be calculated from the age of 12 to 23, when he leaves the club. </p> <p> <strong> Q: How will training compensation be calculated?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> The EU has set up four bands of clubs. Category 1 roughly equates to the English Premiership and Category 4 to the Third Division. Fifa/Uefa will set a value per year of training at each level with that in Category 1 worth more than in Category 4. If any player is transferred before he is 23 all the clubs that have trained him between 12 and 21 will receive compensation in accordance with the number of years they have trained him. </p> <p> <strong> Q: So will all clubs receive the same? </strong></p> <p><strong> A </strong> No. If a player is transferred from a lower to a higher category club, the fee is calculated as an average of training the player had at the lower and the higher club. If a player is transferred from a higher to a lower category club the fee is calculated as the cost of training at the lower. And if a player is transferred from a higher category club into Category 4, no fee is payable. </p> <p> <strong> Q: How does this benefit the smaller clubs? </strong></p> <p> <strong>A </strong> A percentage of the fee payable when a player moves from a club in Category 3 or 4 to a club in a higher category is given to all clubs who have helped train that player from the age of 12. </p> <p> <strong> Q: What happens if there is a dispute over compensation, or whether a player should face sanctions for breaking his contract?</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Two bodies will be set up to deal with these issues. The first is the Dispute Resolution Chamber and its decisions can be appealed to the Football Arbitration Panel. Both bodies will have half their members nominated by the players and half by the clubs, both with an independent chairman.</p>",

His \u0091\u00a32bn of extra spending\u0092 is actually only \u00a31bn. Half of today\u0092s announcement on extra spending on public services is simply money he failed to spend last year. </p> <p>The reality of this Budget is almost \u00a34bn of tax cuts and less than \u00a31bn of extra spending. He has tinkered with the tax system but failed to make a significant impact on police shortages, teacher shortages and nursing shortages. This Budget will not make nearly enough impact on waiting lists, class sizes and getting more police on the streets, neither will it give pensioners dignity and security in retirement.</p> <p><strong>Royal College of Nursing</strong><br> RCN general secretary Christine Hancock welcomed the extra cash to recruit more NHS staff. \"This major new fund clearly demonstrates how seriously the government is taking the issue of nurse recruitment,\" she said. But Ms Hancock warned: \"Pay is still a key factor in improving nurse recruitment and retention and we'd like to see this new money targeted at continuing the trend of above-inflation pay increases.</p> <p>\"We are particularly glad to see extension to maternity benefits and maternity and paternity leave - we would like to see further investment in initiatives that help staff balance their caring responsibilities with their home life.\"</p>",

His \u0091\u00a32bn of extra spending\u0092 is actually only \u00a31bn. Half of today\u0092s announcement on extra spending on public services is simply money he failed to spend last year. The reality of this Budget is almost \u00a34bn of tax cuts and less than \u00a31bn of extra spending. He has tinkered with the tax system but failed to make a significant impact on police shortages, teacher shortages and nursing shortages. This Budget will not make nearly enough impact on waiting lists, class sizes and getting more police on the streets, neither will it give pensioners dignity and security in retirement. Royal College of Nursing RCN general secretary Christine Hancock welcomed the extra cash to recruit more NHS staff. \"This major new fund clearly demonstrates how seriously the government is taking the issue of nurse recruitment,\" she said. But Ms Hancock warned: \"Pay is still a key factor in improving nurse recruitment and retention and we'd like to see this new money targeted at continuing the trend of above-inflation pay increases. \"We are particularly glad to see extension to maternity benefits and maternity and paternity leave - we would like to see further investment in initiatives that help staff balance their caring responsibilities with their home life.\"",

      "body": "<p>Families and the stamping out of child poverty were at the heart of chancellor Gordon Brown's Budget speech.</p> <p>\"Our greatest long-term investment is in children,\" said the Labour chancellor, launching his fifth Budget. \"It is right that we have a Budget that puts families first.\"</p> <p>The main planks of his family-friendly Budget are the new children's tax credit, help for low-paid workers with child care costs, and improved maternity and paternity rights and benefits. Low-income families could be up to \u00a32,240 better off, said the chancellor.</p> <p> A new children's tax credit will be \u00a310 a week, or \u00a3520 a year - equivalent to a 2.5% cut in income tax for families on average earnings. Parents earning up to \u00a350,000 with new-born children will get an extra boost, with a tax allowance of \u00a31,000 for the first year of a baby's life. Adoptive parents are to get similar benefits.</p> <p>Statutory maternity pay is to rise from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 and will be paid for 26 weeks, rather than the current 18. New fathers will for the first time be entitled to paid paternity leave - two weeks' worth.</p> <p>Families with at least one parent in full-time employment will be guaranteed an annual income of \u00a311,700, thanks to a \u00a35 a week rise in the working families tax credit in June. The national minimum wage should also rise to \u00a34.20 an hour.</p> <p>Low-income families will be able to get up to 70% of their child care costs paid from June - up to a limit of \u00a3135 a week for one child and \u00a3150 a week for two or more.

      "bodyText": "Families and the stamping out of child poverty were at the heart of chancellor Gordon Brown's Budget speech. \"Our greatest long-term investment is in children,\" said the Labour chancellor, launching his fifth Budget. \"It is right that we have a Budget that puts families first.\" The main planks of his family-friendly Budget are the new children's tax credit, help for low-paid workers with child care costs, and improved maternity and paternity rights and benefits. Low-income families could be up to \u00a32,240 better off, said the chancellor. A new children's tax credit will be \u00a310 a week, or \u00a3520 a year - equivalent to a 2.5% cut in income tax for families on average earnings. Parents earning up to \u00a350,000 with new-born children will get an extra boost, with a tax allowance of \u00a31,000 for the first year of a baby's life. Adoptive parents are to get similar benefits. Statutory maternity pay is to rise from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 and will be paid for 26 weeks, rather than the current 18. New fathers will for the first time be entitled to paid paternity leave - two weeks' worth. Families with at least one parent in full-time employment will be guaranteed an annual income of \u00a311,700, thanks to a \u00a35 a week rise in the working families tax credit in June. The national minimum wage should also rise to \u00a34.20 an hour. Low-income families will be able to get up to 70% of their child care costs paid from June - up to a limit of \u00a3135 a week for one child and \u00a3150 a week for two or more. This rise in New Labour's child care tax credit was \"in addition to the child care places being created for one million children\", said Mr Brown. But there was a sting in the tail - lone parents on income support will be interviewed regularly about trying to find work, even if their children are under five. Child benefit, paid to all 7.5m families with children, will go up in April to \u00a315.50 a week. The Sure Start maternity grant would be set at \u00a3500 a week.

The word prudence hardly figured, although 'caution' was thrown around with rather greater elan. But those were mere fig leaves, reminders of a bygone age. This Budget will not be remembered for either.</p> <p>It will be remembered instead for being a tax-cutting and family-targeted Budget. The large increase in the 10p tax band was trumpeted - as it was in the judicious leaks which have been peppering the newspapers in the last few weeks - as 'a tax cut for all'.</p> <p>There would be more money for mothers. More money for fathers. More money for education, more money for health. Fuel prices decreased and, in a little Budget gift to show he isn't such a hard-hearted chancellor after all: there's even a freeze on the duty on spirits and beer.</p> <p>He was trying to achieve one thing. A feel-good boost that would get the public trooping out to the polls on election day. This was always going to be a pre-election Budget, tax cuts plus increases in public spending, the classic final-year wake-up call which any chancellor would give his eye-teeth to deliver.</p> <p>By this stage of a Labour government, chancellors would usually be announcing spending cuts and tax increases and facing defeat as a result. Brown has engineered the cycle so that he announced the cuts at the beginning of this government and the big increases at the end.</p> <p>No jam yesterday, lots of jam today.

      "bodyText": "It was, as ever, the most political of Budgets. But chancellor Gordon Brown, rather than giving with one hand and whipping it away with the other, just gave this year. And then gave a bit more. And gave a bit more. The word prudence hardly figured, although 'caution' was thrown around with rather greater elan. But those were mere fig leaves, reminders of a bygone age. This Budget will not be remembered for either. It will be remembered instead for being a tax-cutting and family-targeted Budget. The large increase in the 10p tax band was trumpeted - as it was in the judicious leaks which have been peppering the newspapers in the last few weeks - as 'a tax cut for all'. There would be more money for mothers. More money for fathers. More money for education, more money for health. Fuel prices decreased and, in a little Budget gift to show he isn't such a hard-hearted chancellor after all: there's even a freeze on the duty on spirits and beer. He was trying to achieve one thing. A feel-good boost that would get the public trooping out to the polls on election day. This was always going to be a pre-election Budget, tax cuts plus increases in public spending, the classic final-year wake-up call which any chancellor would give his eye-teeth to deliver. By this stage of a Labour government, chancellors would usually be announcing spending cuts and tax increases and facing defeat as a result. Brown has engineered the cycle so that he announced the cuts at the beginning of this government and the big increases at the end. No jam yesterday, lots of jam today. It is the essential lesson of this government: plan for all four years in power rather than the first two. By doing that, it will be the chancellor who will win the next election rather than the man sitting next to him in the commons this afternoon, Tony Blair. It is the economy, stupid.

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown today unveiled a Budget that he said \"puts families first\".</p> <p>Delivering his first Budget as a married man, and what is virtually certain to be the last before the election, the chancellor said families would receive more money from the tax system and promised \u00a31bn for hospitals and \u00a31bn for schools over the next three years.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging 52-minute address, Mr Brown said that childcare tax credit would rise to \u00a3135 a week for one child and \u00a3200 a week for two or more children. Tax credit for families with new babies will also be increased.</p> <p>The new children's tax credit, which replaces the married couple's allowance in April, will be paid at a rate not of \u00a38.50 a week as planned, but at \u00a310 a week or \u00a3520 a year. \"For families on average earnings this is worth more than a 2.5 pence cut in the basic rate of income tax.\"</p> <p>The government, he said, also wanted to make it easier for mothers who wanted to stay at home after their child was born.</p> <p>Maternity pay will be paid for 26 weeks instead of 18 from 2003 and increased from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 a week. Two weeks paternity leave at the same rate will also be introduced, and for the first time adoptive parents also will qualify for the payments.</p> <p>Mr Brown said he had looked back at Budgets from the last 100 years and discovered that the needs of children had gone almost unrecognised in the tax system while the needs of women had barely been mentioned.</p> <p>\"And when the story of Britain is of families struggling to do the best by their children, to balance work and family life, and all the daily pressures they face, it is right that we have a Budget that puts families first.\"</p> <p>He said 25 million people would benefit from a rise in the threshold, to \u00a31,880 from \u00a31520, for the 10p starting rate for income tax.</p> <p>By striking a balance between long-term investment and affordable tax cuts, the government would meet the needs of not just some but all of Britain's families, he said</p> <p>The Tory leader, William Hague, later dismissed Mr Brown's claims that the Budget proved Labour was cutting taxes, branding it a \"10p up, 1p down pre-election Budget\". He compared the chancellor to \"the thief who steals your car and comes back the next day to return the hub caps.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown used the speech to outline an increase in public spending of 3.7% a year by 2003-04, with \u00a31bn going to both education and health. The schools money will be used for teacher recruitment, school repairs and headteachers' budgets. In the NHS, up to \u00a31 million will go directly to each acute hospital trust every year for the next three years.</p> <p><b>Alcohol, tobacco, betting and cars</b></p> <p>The duty on spirits, beer and wine is frozen, while cigarettes will go up by an inflationary 6p. Betting tax is to abolished from January 1 next year.</p> <p>Vehicle excise tax is frozen, with the lower rate of car tax extended to cover 9m cars with engines of 1,500 cc or less. The chancellor also said there would be no inflation rise in petrol tax, and a 2p a litre cut in the duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol.</p> <p>\"To make sure all motorists can benefit from this 2p cut, I will extend it to unleaded petrol until June 14,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The cuts will take effect at 6pm tonight. Lead replacement petrol will also be cut by a further 2p a litre.\"</p> <p><b>Business</b></p> <p>Mr Brown announced a series of measures to help business and encourage enterprise. He promised to consult on the modernisation of corporation tax and extend tax breaks on research and development to larger firms.</p> <p>He also announced a cut in the long-term capital gains tax rate for all employees to 10p from 40p to help encourage wider employee share ownership.</p> <p><b>Communities</b></p> <p>Measures to aid urban and rural regeneration were also announced.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown today unveiled a Budget that he said \"puts families first\". Delivering his first Budget as a married man, and what is virtually certain to be the last before the election, the chancellor said families would receive more money from the tax system and promised \u00a31bn for hospitals and \u00a31bn for schools over the next three years. In a wide-ranging 52-minute address, Mr Brown said that childcare tax credit would rise to \u00a3135 a week for one child and \u00a3200 a week for two or more children. Tax credit for families with new babies will also be increased. The new children's tax credit, which replaces the married couple's allowance in April, will be paid at a rate not of \u00a38.50 a week as planned, but at \u00a310 a week or \u00a3520 a year. \"For families on average earnings this is worth more than a 2.5 pence cut in the basic rate of income tax.\" The government, he said, also wanted to make it easier for mothers who wanted to stay at home after their child was born. Maternity pay will be paid for 26 weeks instead of 18 from 2003 and increased from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 a week. Two weeks paternity leave at the same rate will also be introduced, and for the first time adoptive parents also will qualify for the payments. Mr Brown said he had looked back at Budgets from the last 100 years and discovered that the needs of children had gone almost unrecognised in the tax system while the needs of women had barely been mentioned. \"And when the story of Britain is of families struggling to do the best by their children, to balance work and family life, and all the daily pressures they face, it is right that we have a Budget that puts families first.\" He said 25 million people would benefit from a rise in the threshold, to \u00a31,880 from \u00a31520, for the 10p starting rate for income tax. By striking a balance between long-term investment and affordable tax cuts, the government would meet the needs of not just some but all of Britain's families, he said The Tory leader, William Hague, later dismissed Mr Brown's claims that the Budget proved Labour was cutting taxes, branding it a \"10p up, 1p down pre-election Budget\". He compared the chancellor to \"the thief who steals your car and comes back the next day to return the hub caps.\" Mr Brown used the speech to outline an increase in public spending of 3.7% a year by 2003-04, with \u00a31bn going to both education and health. The schools money will be used for teacher recruitment, school repairs and headteachers' budgets. In the NHS, up to \u00a31 million will go directly to each acute hospital trust every year for the next three years. Alcohol, tobacco, betting and cars The duty on spirits, beer and wine is frozen, while cigarettes will go up by an inflationary 6p. Betting tax is to abolished from January 1 next year. Vehicle excise tax is frozen, with the lower rate of car tax extended to cover 9m cars with engines of 1,500 cc or less. The chancellor also said there would be no inflation rise in petrol tax, and a 2p a litre cut in the duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol. \"To make sure all motorists can benefit from this 2p cut, I will extend it to unleaded petrol until June 14,\" he said. \"The cuts will take effect at 6pm tonight. Lead replacement petrol will also be cut by a further 2p a litre.\" Business Mr Brown announced a series of measures to help business and encourage enterprise. He promised to consult on the modernisation of corporation tax and extend tax breaks on research and development to larger firms. He also announced a cut in the long-term capital gains tax rate for all employees to 10p from 40p to help encourage wider employee share ownership. Communities Measures to aid urban and rural regeneration were also announced. Mr Brown confirmed that stamp duty was being abolished in certain areas to help regeneration and gave details of tax breaks for cleaning up contaminated land and renovating empty flats over shops. A new community investment tax credit and the first community development venture capital fund will also be created, he said. 'Locking in stability' Mr Brown said that the Budget was designed to lock in stability for the long term. \"Since we came into government our first duty has been to secure stability [...] the stability built on the first years will be our foundation for building opportunity and prosperity for all in the years to come.\" Labour had produced the lowest inflation for 30 years, the lowest interest rates for 35 years, more people in work than ever before and the lowest level of unemployment since 1975, he said. Despite the slowdown in the world economy Mr Brown said that he expected growth to be between 2.25 and 2.75% in 2001. He added that stability meant Britain was well placed to ride out global economic storms. He said exports and manufacturing would continue to grow. The current surplus forecast is \u00a323bn in 2000-01 and \u00a317bn, \u00a315bn, \u00a38bn, \u00a39bn, and \u00a39bn in successive years. The government will pay back \u00a334bn of debt this year, which will reduce debt to 30.3% of GDP in 2001-02, then 29.6%, 29.7%, 29.9% and 30% in the following years. When Labour came to power the national debt stood at 44% of national income. To cheers from the Labour benches, the chancellor said that this year's repayment was more than the total repaid by all British governments in the last 50 years.

      "body": "<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447986,00.html\">Part three of Budget speech</a> <br>We could choose to repeat the pattern of Budgets at this stage of the Parliament and make tax cuts that are unaffordable in the long term. <p> But it is right to chose the prudent course for Britain. </p> <p> Let me tell the House what the Government has decided. </p> <p> For savers, as I announced in November, the Government is extending the tax reliefs for individual savings accounts. 9 million new accounts were opened in the first year, with 48 billion pounds now being saved. Because of the high number of ISAs, tax reliefs for savers will by 2006 exceed projected tax relief for PEPS and TESSAS by 800 million pounds a year, tax incentives for savings to total 3 billion pounds. We wish to see more ISAS and more tax free saving, so for the next five years up to 7,000 pounds a year of savings can generate income and capital gains that will both be tax free. In this Budget I want to do more to cut tax for all savers, including pensioners. </p> <p> For pensioners we have already announced that from April we will raise pensions well above inflation, indeed above earnings, by 5 pounds a week for single pensioners and 8 pounds for couples and next year by 3 pounds and 4.80 pounds </p> <p> We will retain the winter allowance and the free TV licence for the over 75s that we introduced and the Christmas bonus. Detailed announcements will be made in this year's social security uprating statement. </p> <p> Since November, we have been consulting on our new pension credit, to be introduced in 2003. Pensioner couples with incomes below 200 pounds and single pensioners with incomes below 135 pounds a week, many millions of pensioners, will receive the new pension credit. It will rise in line with earnings every year and in this way, it will give recipients more than even the earnings link in the basic state pension would give them. </p> <p> In this Budget I have decided that from 2003 when the pension credit is introduced pensioners' tax allowances will be linked not just to prices but to earnings. And I will do more on tax for savers, pensioners and working families. </p> <p> To achieve our goal of full employment and reward hard work I have previously cut the basic rate of income tax and introduced a 10 pence tax rate. And for national insurance we announced and legislated in 1999 upper and lower earnings limits of 575 pounds a week and 87 pounds a week respectively for the coming year, taking three hundred thousand men and women out of tax altogether, in all a national insurance cut of 590 million pounds this coming year. </p> <p> So to reward savers, pensioners and hard working families, my aim now and in the next Parliament is to ensure that more of savers', pensioners' and working people's income, now taxed at the 22 pence rate, should be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. </p> <p> And I propose to make a start today with a one billion pounds a year tax cut: instead of the first one thousand five hundred and twenty pounds of taxable income at 10 pence rather than 22 pence, the first one thousand eight hundred and eighty pounds of the taxable income of every taxpayer in the country will be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. </p> <p> A measure which will benefit 25 million taxpayers. </p> <p> And cutting income tax by extending the 10 pence band shows our intention for the next Parliament too: that all those who work hard and save for their retirement will find that more of their income, taxed at 22 pence today, should be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. </p> <p> Seven and a half million pensioners will now pay no tax or tax at just the 10 pence rate, 70 per cent of all pensioners in the country. </p> <p> Taking into account the direct tax and benefit changes in this Budget, and changes coming in this year, households will be on average 240 pounds a year, over 4 pounds a week better off after inflation. </p> <p> With the new children's tax credit now paid from April the direct tax burden for the average family falls from 21 per cent in 1997 to 18 per cent, the lowest level for thirty years. </p> <p> I said that our long term goals for Britain are full employment, high productivity, strong public services, tackling child poverty and opportunity for all. </p> <p> Now having made this tax cut for work and savings, and locked in our fiscal tightening, our economic strength allows us to release over the next three years a further two billion pounds in total. </p> <p> There is a choice. I have had representations from some for billions in further tax cuts. But our priority has been and is Britain's public services. So we will not cut investment but raise it. We will increase spending not by 3.4 per cent a year as we planned by 2003-4 but by 3.7 per cent a year. </p> <p> I can give more detailed figures for the benefit of the House. </p> <p> To cut spending growth from 3.7 per cent to two and a quarter per cent a year, as has been proposed, would mean, if started now, annual cuts rising above 16 billions a year by 2003-4; and even if started next April cuts of 10.1 billion pounds a year by 2003-4. </p> <p> So I have rejected this course for Britain's future not only because such deep cuts would move us from our long term goals, and put hospitals and schools at risk, but also because Britain must not repeat the short-termist mistakes of the 1980s - unfunded, unaffordable tax cuts, higher interest rates, cuts in necessary investment, with no fiscal rules. </p> <p> Mr Deputy Speaker we will not return to boom and bust. </p> <p> Within our tough fiscal rules, education spending is already set to rise by 5.2 per cent a year even after inflation. </p> <p> I now propose to increase substantially the sum of current and capital money paid to every school and directly to every head teacher to allow them to make their own decisions as they meet the nation's educational targets. </p> <p> Head-teachers of every primary school will receive not 10,000 pounds as planned but 13,000 pounds with the larger primary schools receiving not 50,000 pounds but 63,000 pounds. </p> <p> And the head-teacher of each secondary school will receive for the smaller schools not 57,000 pounds but 68,000 pounds and the larger schools a payment of not 92,000 pounds but 115,000 pounds. </p> <p> And these payments will not be made for just one year, but for every year through to 2004. </p> <p> As a result of our spending review, cash spending on the NHS is rising by 50 per cent over five years.

      "bodyText": "Part three of Budget speech We could choose to repeat the pattern of Budgets at this stage of the Parliament and make tax cuts that are unaffordable in the long term. But it is right to chose the prudent course for Britain. Let me tell the House what the Government has decided. For savers, as I announced in November, the Government is extending the tax reliefs for individual savings accounts. 9 million new accounts were opened in the first year, with 48 billion pounds now being saved. Because of the high number of ISAs, tax reliefs for savers will by 2006 exceed projected tax relief for PEPS and TESSAS by 800 million pounds a year, tax incentives for savings to total 3 billion pounds. We wish to see more ISAS and more tax free saving, so for the next five years up to 7,000 pounds a year of savings can generate income and capital gains that will both be tax free. In this Budget I want to do more to cut tax for all savers, including pensioners. For pensioners we have already announced that from April we will raise pensions well above inflation, indeed above earnings, by 5 pounds a week for single pensioners and 8 pounds for couples and next year by 3 pounds and 4.80 pounds We will retain the winter allowance and the free TV licence for the over 75s that we introduced and the Christmas bonus. Detailed announcements will be made in this year's social security uprating statement. Since November, we have been consulting on our new pension credit, to be introduced in 2003. Pensioner couples with incomes below 200 pounds and single pensioners with incomes below 135 pounds a week, many millions of pensioners, will receive the new pension credit. It will rise in line with earnings every year and in this way, it will give recipients more than even the earnings link in the basic state pension would give them. In this Budget I have decided that from 2003 when the pension credit is introduced pensioners' tax allowances will be linked not just to prices but to earnings. And I will do more on tax for savers, pensioners and working families. To achieve our goal of full employment and reward hard work I have previously cut the basic rate of income tax and introduced a 10 pence tax rate. And for national insurance we announced and legislated in 1999 upper and lower earnings limits of 575 pounds a week and 87 pounds a week respectively for the coming year, taking three hundred thousand men and women out of tax altogether, in all a national insurance cut of 590 million pounds this coming year. So to reward savers, pensioners and hard working families, my aim now and in the next Parliament is to ensure that more of savers', pensioners' and working people's income, now taxed at the 22 pence rate, should be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. And I propose to make a start today with a one billion pounds a year tax cut: instead of the first one thousand five hundred and twenty pounds of taxable income at 10 pence rather than 22 pence, the first one thousand eight hundred and eighty pounds of the taxable income of every taxpayer in the country will be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. A measure which will benefit 25 million taxpayers. And cutting income tax by extending the 10 pence band shows our intention for the next Parliament too: that all those who work hard and save for their retirement will find that more of their income, taxed at 22 pence today, should be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. Seven and a half million pensioners will now pay no tax or tax at just the 10 pence rate, 70 per cent of all pensioners in the country. Taking into account the direct tax and benefit changes in this Budget, and changes coming in this year, households will be on average 240 pounds a year, over 4 pounds a week better off after inflation. With the new children's tax credit now paid from April the direct tax burden for the average family falls from 21 per cent in 1997 to 18 per cent, the lowest level for thirty years. I said that our long term goals for Britain are full employment, high productivity, strong public services, tackling child poverty and opportunity for all. Now having made this tax cut for work and savings, and locked in our fiscal tightening, our economic strength allows us to release over the next three years a further two billion pounds in total. There is a choice. I have had representations from some for billions in further tax cuts. But our priority has been and is Britain's public services. So we will not cut investment but raise it. We will increase spending not by 3.4 per cent a year as we planned by 2003-4 but by 3.7 per cent a year. I can give more detailed figures for the benefit of the House. To cut spending growth from 3.7 per cent to two and a quarter per cent a year, as has been proposed, would mean, if started now, annual cuts rising above 16 billions a year by 2003-4; and even if started next April cuts of 10.1 billion pounds a year by 2003-4. So I have rejected this course for Britain's future not only because such deep cuts would move us from our long term goals, and put hospitals and schools at risk, but also because Britain must not repeat the short-termist mistakes of the 1980s - unfunded, unaffordable tax cuts, higher interest rates, cuts in necessary investment, with no fiscal rules. Mr Deputy Speaker we will not return to boom and bust. Within our tough fiscal rules, education spending is already set to rise by 5.2 per cent a year even after inflation. I now propose to increase substantially the sum of current and capital money paid to every school and directly to every head teacher to allow them to make their own decisions as they meet the nation's educational targets. Head-teachers of every primary school will receive not 10,000 pounds as planned but 13,000 pounds with the larger primary schools receiving not 50,000 pounds but 63,000 pounds. And the head-teacher of each secondary school will receive for the smaller schools not 57,000 pounds but 68,000 pounds and the larger schools a payment of not 92,000 pounds but 115,000 pounds. And these payments will not be made for just one year, but for every year through to 2004. As a result of our spending review, cash spending on the NHS is rising by 50 per cent over five years. Today we add to it. There is a strong case for extra capital investment in equipment, new scanners and renovating old Nightingale wards, with money going direct to each hospital trust, and a case for more primary care money going direct to local GP surgeries. I am not however able to give 100,000 pounds to each of the 200 acute hospital trusts. Instead from April, for work on Nightingale wards and new investment, acute hospital trusts will receive as a result of this Budget every year for the next three years extra money of between half a million pounds and a million pounds. Further announcements including cash for GP trusts will follow, as well as allocations by the Scottish and Welsh administrations. So I have one final announcement. The Secretary of State for Health wishes to recruit an extra 20,000 more nurses by 2004. Next week he will announce three year allocations from a new 135 million pounds fund for recruitment of front-line staff. And next week also the Secretary of State for Education will announce his three year allocations from a new 200 million pound fund for retention, and recruitment of extra teachers. In total over the next three years one billion pounds more to our hospitals and one billion more to our schools - money that we could not provide if we made irresponsible tax cuts. We have made our choice: - more investment not less; - stability the foundation; - tax cuts we can afford; - schools and hospitals first. And I commend this Budget to this House.

      "body": "<b>Introduction</b> <p>I can report to the House that today because of the choices Britain made our country now has: the lowest inflation for 30 years; the lowest long term interest rates for 35 years; mortgages now averaging one thousand two hundred pounds a year lower than under the last Government; more people in work than ever before; and the lowest unemployment since 1975. </p> <p><b>Children and women</b></p> <p>Our greatest long term investment is in children. I have looked back at a century and more of past Budgets which have had one common feature: the needs of children in the tax system go almost unrecognised; the needs of women barely mentioned. </p> <p><b>Inflation</b></p> <p>So I can confirm that because stability will guide our approach, the inflation target will remain at two and a half per cent. </p> <p> <b>Surplus</b></p> <p>In the last Budget I forecast a current surplus for the financial year 2000-2001 at 14 billion pounds. I now forecast this surplus to be 23 billions pounds. Over the economic cycle, even on the most cautious of cases, we will meet our first fiscal rule and balance the current Budget. </p> <p><b>Debt</b> </p> <p> I can tell the House that this year the net cash debt repayment will be 34 billion pounds: more debt repaid by one British Government in one year than all the total debt repaid by all the previous British Governments of the last fifty years. Whereas from 1979 to 1997 42 pence in every extra pound spent went to debt and social security, now the figure is only 16 pence, leaving more than 80 pence in every extra pound to go direct to front-line public services. </p> <p> <b>Venture capital</b></p> <p> Institutional investors are responsible for assets of 1.5 trillion pounds. To promote long term investment and to protect investors, I have accepted the recommendations of the Myners report. We will abolish the minimum funding requirement; through tax and regulatory reform make it easier for life insurers and pension funds to invest in venture capital; and we will ensure both a strengthened role for pension fund trustees and a clearer duty on fund managers to promote beneficiaries' interests. </p> <p> <b>Business</b></p> <p>After further consultation with business, I propose to introduce a new tax relief for intellectual property and goodwill. We will also consult in detail on relieving tax when companies sell substantial shareholdings. And from next month I will abolish the withholding tax not only on international bonds but also on payments of interest and royalties between companies in the UK. </p> <p> <b>International development</b></p> <p>And we will legislate a new and special tax credit that will help British companies contribute to the relief of disease round the world, an incentive to accelerate research on diseases - like Aids, TB, Malaria and other diseases - that each year kill eight million people, including three million children in our poorest countries: deaths that in many cases are avoidable, diseases that in many places are preventible. We have a capacity to help and a moral duty to act. Subject to a commitment by the pharmaceutical companies to invest in and deliver new drugs and vaccines in ways that truly meet the needs of the poor and sick, the Secretary of State for International Development and I are prepared to extend this new tax credit even further. </p> <p> <b>Farming</b> </p> <p>For farming, an industry essential to Britain which today faces both immediate and long standing difficulties, the Government, over and above its statutory obligations, has made available agri-compensation money worth 150 million pounds. And I can confirm that the Minister for Agriculture is taking steps to advance agri-money and other payments. </p> <p><b>Business and employees</b></p> <p>For employees in all types of companies including venture capital and non trading companies the long term capital gains tax rate will no longer be 40 pence but 10 pence. Growing companies offering share options will benefit from today's extension of the Enterprise Management Incentive scheme. I have decided to double to 3 million pounds the share options that benefit from tax relief and in qualifying companies I will extend the right to benefit from these share options to all employees. </p> <p><b>Small businesses</b></p> <p> We propose a new regime to simplify VAT for small business, which will be of direct help to up to half a million companies. For firms with a turnover of up to fifty four thousand pounds, VAT will not be charged at all: more of business' income not subject to VAT in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. For firms with a turnover of up to one hundred thousand pounds, we propose a simpler and lower flat rate which after consultation we will implement next year. For firms with a turnover of up to six hundred thousand pounds we will also consult upon a simplified VAT payments scheme. The next step is an even more radical proposal: to make the annual company accounts the basis for calculating tax, thus cutting more red tape and cutting business costs once again. </p> <p><b>Urban regneration</b></p> <p>I see our inner cities and older industrial communities not as no-go areas for new enterprise but as places of untapped potential, where there are young people with dynamism looking for work and markets waiting to develop and grow. </p> <p>To speed up regeneration I now propose, after our Pre-Budget consultation, a total of six tax cuts targeted on enterprise at a cost - over the next five years - of one billion pounds. </p> <p>To make the first stages of buying property and bringing land back into use tax free, in designated areas stamp duty will be abolished. </p> <p>To bring disused properties back into use, we will cut VAT on residential property conversions from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent. </p> <p> To help revitalise our high streets, we will provide one hundred per cent first year capital allowances for bringing empty flats over shops back into the residential market. </p> <p><b>Churches</b> </p> <p>In both urban and rural areas, our churches are essential centres for civic life and are at the heart of our rich heritage as a nation. To help preserve that heritage and to cut the costs of saving and repairing our listed church buildings we will introduce for repairs started after April 1st a new grant, the equivalent of aVAT reduction from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent: a reform long sought by congregations across the country. </p> <p> <b>Film</b></p> <p>The film industry tax incentive we introduced in 1997 which is contributing to the unprecedented success now enjoyed by independent British films, will at a cost of 50 million pounds next year be extended until 2005. </p> <p> <b>Unemployment</b> </p> <p> The starting point is a new 'employment first' principle. In the past the unemployed signed on for benefit before they looked for work. Now before receiving benefit the employment first principle means they will first have to be interviewed about job opportunities and the steps they are ready to take to get back into work. For the hard to employ, those still left behind, we are proposing from April at a cost of two hundred million pounds a year a new regime built around more intensive coaching and stronger sanctions for the over twenty fives. For thirty thousand benefit claimants who have been drug addicts, a new three year budget of forty million pounds will mean they can receive the mentoring and training they need, but to get on the programme they will have to get off drugs. Next, to link the unemployed without skills to the jobs that require skills, we will announce separate initiatives to fill job vacancies in the IT industry, construction, hotels, retail and financial services. </p> <p> <b>Minimum wage</b></p> <p>This Government introduced the first ever national minimum wage and it is this Government which has this week raised the minimum wage as of October this year from \u00a33.70 an hour to \u00a34.10 an hour and then, next year, subject to economic conditions, to \u00a34.20. </p> <p>And as part of our programme to ensure new disability rights I can announce that in addition to a new guaranteed minimum income for a severely disabled person on benefit of 142 pounds a week, for those in full time work the Disabled Person's Tax Credit will also be raised from June this year by 5 pounds a week to guarantee a minimum weekly family income of 250 pounds. </p> <p><b>Child care tax credit</b></p> <p>In addition to the childcare places being created for one million children, the child care tax credit will, from June, pay up to 70 per cent of child care costs up to - instead of 100 pounds a week as now - 135 pounds a week for one child and - instead of 150 pounds a week - up to 200 pounds a week for two or more children, another step in our plan to place affordable child care within the reach of all working families who need it. </p> <p><b>Cars</b></p> <p>I can announce that for the coming financial year we will freeze all rates of car vehicle excise duty. Having completed our consultation on new duty rates, I will now move ahead with the proposal to extend the 55 pounds reduction on the standard licence fee from all cars up to 1200 cc to all cars up to and including 1.5 litres. This will include for example Escorts, Astras, Micras and Rover Metros, in total an extra 5 million cars. This reduction, to be implemented in July, will be backdated to November last year. In total 9 million cars up to I.5 litres will pay 55 pounds less. </p> <p><b>Fuel duty</b></p> <p>As I stated in the Pre-Budget Report: this year we will not proceed with the annual inflation rise in petrol tax that has been the norm on Budget day. After consultation on my Pre-Budget Report I am able to confirm further changes. In addition to the 1 pence cut in ultra low sulphur petrol last October, the duty on ultra low sulphur petrol will be further cut by 2 pence litre. To make sure all motorists can benefit from this 2 pence cut I will extend it to unleaded petrol until June 14th: when the industry says ultra low sulphur petrol will be 100 per cent available. </p> <p> <b>Green taxes</b></p> <p>To reward businesses investing in energy saving improvements, the Government is publishing this month the list of technologies that will qualify for 100 per cent tax relief and later this year we will launch a green technology challenge offering this 100 per cent tax relief to companies investing in the next generation of environmental technologies. </p> <p> <b>Booze and fags</b> </p> <p> Because of the competitive position of the industry I will this year continue to freeze duty on whisky and on all spirits. And this year I propose to go further and freeze duty on wine and on beer. Beyond the normal inflation rise of 6 pence, I will not go ahead with any real terms rise in cigarette taxes. </p> <p> <b>Betting</b></p> <p>Following our consultation with the betting and gaming industry over the impact of internet trading, I have decided from January 1st to abolish betting duty which has been in existence ever since betting shops were legalised. </p> <p><b>Inheritance tax</b></p> <p>For inheritance tax I propose to raise the allowance, so that no tax will be charged on estates up to almost a quarter of a million pounds, a threshold of 242,000. 96 per cent of estates will pay no tax. </p> <p><b>Families</b></p> <p>From April child benefit will be fifteen pounds fifty a week, 806 pounds a year. So in addition to child benefit the new children's tax credit is being introduced on April 6th. And after consultation I have decided that our new children's tax credit will be paid not at eight pounds fifty a week or 442 pounds a year - as originally proposed - but it will be paid at 10 pounds a week, 520 pounds a year. </p> <p>For families on average earnings this is worth more than a two and a half pence cut in the basic rate of income tax. </p> <p>With this major change in our tax system, financial support for families with children has never been higher. </p> <p>We know also that greatest help should be there when children are youngest; the time when family income tends to fall as family costs rise. </p> <p>We can do more to help mothers and fathers balance work and family responsibilities. Indeed, we want to make it easier for mothers to make the choice to stay at home after their child is born and for much longer than previously. </p> <p>I can announce that following the maternity review set up in last year's Budget under the leadership of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, maternity pay which is 60 pounds will be increased in successive stages to 75 pounds next year and the year after to 100 pounds a week, as big a rise in two years as in the previous forty. </p> <p> <b>Maternity pay</b></p> <p>We will also legislate so that, at the same time as the 100 pounds is introduced, the statutory obligation to maternity pay will be raised from 18 weeks to 26 weeks. </p> <p>And we will introduce two weeks paid paternity leave, set at the same level of 100 pounds, paid for by the Government. </p> <p><b>\u00a31,000 child tax credit</b></p> <p>For the first year of a child's life, I propose a further innovation. From April next year for families with new-born children, the children's tax credit will be set at an even higher level and paid up the income scale to all households where the main earner earns up to 50,000 pounds a year. </p> <p>I propose to set this children's credit at over 1,000 pounds a year, worth 20 pounds a week. </p> <p>So to summarise these changes: families receiving the higher children's credit and maternity pay will be up to two thousand two hundred and forty pounds better off. </p> <p> <b>War on drugs</b></p> <p>To every one of the country's 350 partnerships against crime and disorder, direct payments averaging half a million pounds and up to one million pounds will be made straight to police commanders and anti drugs leaders. Similar funds will be available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p> <p><b>Savers</b></p> <p> For savers, as I announced in November, the Government is extending the tax reliefs for individual savings accounts. </p> <p><b>Pensioners</b></p> <p>For pensioners we have already announced that from April we will raise pensions well above inflation, indeed above earnings, by 5 pounds a week for single pensioners and 8 pounds for couples and next year by 3 pounds and 4.80 pounds In this Budget I have decided that from 2003 when the pension credit is introduced pensioners' tax allowances will be linked not just to prices but to earnings. </p> <p><b>10p tax rate</b></p> <p>So to reward savers, pensioners and hard working families, my aim now and in the next Parliament is to ensure that more of savers', pensioners' and working people's income, now taxed at the 22 pence rate, should be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. And I propose to make a start today with a one billion pounds a year tax cut: instead of the first one thousand five hundred and twenty pounds of taxable income at 10 pence rather than 22 pence, the first one thousand eight hundred and eighty pounds of the taxable income of every taxpayer in the country will be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. </p> <p>A measure which will benefit 25 million taxpayers. </p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>Taking into account the direct tax and benefit changes in this Budget, and changes coming in this year, households will be on average 240 pounds a year, over 4 pounds a week better off after inflation. With the new children's tax credit now paid from April the direct tax burden for the average family falls from 21 per cent in 1997 to 18 per cent, the lowest level for thirty years. </p> <p> <b>Goals</b></p> <p>I said that our long term goals for Britain are full employment, high productivity, strong public services, tackling child poverty and opportunity for all. </p> <p>There is a choice. I have had representations from some for billions in further tax cuts. But our priority has been and is Britain's public services. </p> <p>So I have rejected this course for Britain's future not only because such deep cuts would move us from our long term goals, and put hospitals and schools at risk, but also because Britain must not repeat the short-termist mistakes of the 1980s - unfunded, unaffordable tax cuts, higher interest rates, cuts in necessary investment, with no fiscal rules. </p> <p>Mr Deputy Speaker we will not return to boom and bust. </p> <p><b>Schools</b></p> <p>Head-teachers of every primary school will receive not 10,000 pounds as planned but 13,000 pounds with the larger primary schools receiving not 50,000 pounds but 63,000 pounds. And the head-teacher of each secondary school will receive for the smaller schools not 57,000 pounds but 68,000 pounds and the larger schools a payment of not 92,000 pounds but 115,000 pounds. </p> <p><b>Health</b></p> <p>There is a strong case for extra capital investment in equipment, new scanners and renovating old Nightingale wards, with money going direct to each hospital trust, and a case for more primary care money going direct to local GP surgeries. </p> <p> Instead from April, for work on Nightingale wards and new investment, acute hospital trusts will receive as a result of this Budget every year for the next three years extra money of between half a million pounds and a million pounds. In total over the next three years one billion pounds more to our hospitals and one billion more to our schools - money that we could not provide if we made irresponsible tax cuts. </p> <p>We have made our choice: - more investment not less; - stability the foundation; - tax cuts we can afford; - schools and hospitals first. </p> <p>And I commend this Budget to this House.</p> <p> <b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a></p> <p><b>Reaction</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>The treasury </b><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a></p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

Children and women Our greatest long term investment is in children. I have looked back at a century and more of past Budgets which have had one common feature: the needs of children in the tax system go almost unrecognised; the needs of women barely mentioned. Inflation So I can confirm that because stability will guide our approach, the inflation target will remain at two and a half per cent. Surplus In the last Budget I forecast a current surplus for the financial year 2000-2001 at 14 billion pounds. I now forecast this surplus to be 23 billions pounds.

Urban regneration I see our inner cities and older industrial communities not as no-go areas for new enterprise but as places of untapped potential, where there are young people with dynamism looking for work and markets waiting to develop and grow. To speed up regeneration I now propose, after our Pre-Budget consultation, a total of six tax cuts targeted on enterprise at a cost - over the next five years - of one billion pounds. To make the first stages of buying property and bringing land back into use tax free, in designated areas stamp duty will be abolished. To bring disused properties back into use, we will cut VAT on residential property conversions from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent. To help revitalise our high streets, we will provide one hundred per cent first year capital allowances for bringing empty flats over shops back into the residential market. Churches In both urban and rural areas, our churches are essential centres for civic life and are at the heart of our rich heritage as a nation. To help preserve that heritage and to cut the costs of saving and repairing our listed church buildings we will introduce for repairs started after April 1st a new grant, the equivalent of aVAT reduction from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent: a reform long sought by congregations across the country.

And as part of our programme to ensure new disability rights I can announce that in addition to a new guaranteed minimum income for a severely disabled person on benefit of 142 pounds a week, for those in full time work the Disabled Person's Tax Credit will also be raised from June this year by 5 pounds a week to guarantee a minimum weekly family income of 250 pounds. Child care tax credit In addition to the childcare places being created for one million children, the child care tax credit will, from June, pay up to 70 per cent of child care costs up to - instead of 100 pounds a week as now - 135 pounds a week for one child and - instead of 150 pounds a week - up to 200 pounds a week for two or more children, another step in our plan to place affordable child care within the reach of all working families who need it. Cars I can announce that for the coming financial year we will freeze all rates of car vehicle excise duty.

Fuel duty As I stated in the Pre-Budget Report: this year we will not proceed with the annual inflation rise in petrol tax that has been the norm on Budget day. After consultation on my Pre-Budget Report I am able to confirm further changes. In addition to the 1 pence cut in ultra low sulphur petrol last October, the duty on ultra low sulphur petrol will be further cut by 2 pence litre. To make sure all motorists can benefit from this 2 pence cut I will extend it to unleaded petrol until June 14th: when the industry says ultra low sulphur petrol will be 100 per cent available. Green taxes To reward businesses investing in energy saving improvements, the Government is publishing this month the list of technologies that will qualify for 100 per cent tax relief and later this year we will launch a green technology challenge offering this 100 per cent tax relief to companies investing in the next generation of environmental technologies. Booze and fags Because of the competitive position of the industry I will this year continue to freeze duty on whisky and on all spirits. And this year I propose to go further and freeze duty on wine and on beer. Beyond the normal inflation rise of 6 pence, I will not go ahead with any real terms rise in cigarette taxes. Betting Following our consultation with the betting and gaming industry over the impact of internet trading, I have decided from January 1st to abolish betting duty which has been in existence ever since betting shops were legalised. Inheritance tax For inheritance tax I propose to raise the allowance, so that no tax will be charged on estates up to almost a quarter of a million pounds, a threshold of 242,000. 96 per cent of estates will pay no tax. Families From April child benefit will be fifteen pounds fifty a week, 806 pounds a year. So in addition to child benefit the new children's tax credit is being introduced on April 6th. And after consultation I have decided that our new children's tax credit will be paid not at eight pounds fifty a week or 442 pounds a year - as originally proposed - but it will be paid at 10 pounds a week, 520 pounds a year. For families on average earnings this is worth more than a two and a half pence cut in the basic rate of income tax. With this major change in our tax system, financial support for families with children has never been higher. We know also that greatest help should be there when children are youngest; the time when family income tends to fall as family costs rise. We can do more to help mothers and fathers balance work and family responsibilities. Indeed, we want to make it easier for mothers to make the choice to stay at home after their child is born and for much longer than previously. I can announce that following the maternity review set up in last year's Budget under the leadership of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, maternity pay which is 60 pounds will be increased in successive stages to 75 pounds next year and the year after to 100 pounds a week, as big a rise in two years as in the previous forty. Maternity pay We will also legislate so that, at the same time as the 100 pounds is introduced, the statutory obligation to maternity pay will be raised from 18 weeks to 26 weeks. And we will introduce two weeks paid paternity leave, set at the same level of 100 pounds, paid for by the Government. \u00a31,000 child tax credit For the first year of a child's life, I propose a further innovation. From April next year for families with new-born children, the children's tax credit will be set at an even higher level and paid up the income scale to all households where the main earner earns up to 50,000 pounds a year. I propose to set this children's credit at over 1,000 pounds a year, worth 20 pounds a week. So to summarise these changes: families receiving the higher children's credit and maternity pay will be up to two thousand two hundred and forty pounds better off. War on drugs To every one of the country's 350 partnerships against crime and disorder, direct payments averaging half a million pounds and up to one million pounds will be made straight to police commanders and anti drugs leaders. Similar funds will be available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Savers For savers, as I announced in November, the Government is extending the tax reliefs for individual savings accounts. Pensioners For pensioners we have already announced that from April we will raise pensions well above inflation, indeed above earnings, by 5 pounds a week for single pensioners and 8 pounds for couples and next year by 3 pounds and 4.80 pounds In this Budget I have decided that from 2003 when the pension credit is introduced pensioners' tax allowances will be linked not just to prices but to earnings. 10p tax rate So to reward savers, pensioners and hard working families, my aim now and in the next Parliament is to ensure that more of savers', pensioners' and working people's income, now taxed at the 22 pence rate, should be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. And I propose to make a start today with a one billion pounds a year tax cut: instead of the first one thousand five hundred and twenty pounds of taxable income at 10 pence rather than 22 pence, the first one thousand eight hundred and eighty pounds of the taxable income of every taxpayer in the country will be taxed at the lower 10 pence rate. A measure which will benefit 25 million taxpayers. Conclusion Taking into account the direct tax and benefit changes in this Budget, and changes coming in this year, households will be on average 240 pounds a year, over 4 pounds a week better off after inflation. With the new children's tax credit now paid from April the direct tax burden for the average family falls from 21 per cent in 1997 to 18 per cent, the lowest level for thirty years. Goals I said that our long term goals for Britain are full employment, high productivity, strong public services, tackling child poverty and opportunity for all. There is a choice. I have had representations from some for billions in further tax cuts. But our priority has been and is Britain's public services. So I have rejected this course for Britain's future not only because such deep cuts would move us from our long term goals, and put hospitals and schools at risk, but also because Britain must not repeat the short-termist mistakes of the 1980s - unfunded, unaffordable tax cuts, higher interest rates, cuts in necessary investment, with no fiscal rules. Mr Deputy Speaker we will not return to boom and bust. Schools Head-teachers of every primary school will receive not 10,000 pounds as planned but 13,000 pounds with the larger primary schools receiving not 50,000 pounds but 63,000 pounds. And the head-teacher of each secondary school will receive for the smaller schools not 57,000 pounds but 68,000 pounds and the larger schools a payment of not 92,000 pounds but 115,000 pounds. Health There is a strong case for extra capital investment in equipment, new scanners and renovating old Nightingale wards, with money going direct to each hospital trust, and a case for more primary care money going direct to local GP surgeries. Instead from April, for work on Nightingale wards and new investment, acute hospital trusts will receive as a result of this Budget every year for the next three years extra money of between half a million pounds and a million pounds. In total over the next three years one billion pounds more to our hospitals and one billion more to our schools - money that we could not provide if we made irresponsible tax cuts. We have made our choice: - more investment not less; - stability the foundation; - tax cuts we can afford; - schools and hospitals first. And I commend this Budget to this House.

      "body": "<p>The relief on the face of PR man Ian Monk was a picture. He was finally able to tell a sodden press pack that Michael Jackson, almost three hours late, really was about to put in an appearance at the Oxford University Union. Honest.</p> <p>Having almost resigned the PR account to orchestrate Jackson's visit, PR firm MacLaurin was already familiar with the demands from the superstar's camp.</p> <p>So it was inevitable not everyone would be seduced by Jackson's tears or saddened by his woefully fragile appearance.</p> <p>The Daily Star today splashed on the melodramatic news that it, along with the Express and - most gravely of all - OK! had been barred from the event.</p> <p>That was something the Star hadn't expected - MacLaurin, after all, handles the PR for Richard Desmond's Express group.</p> <p>Last night, the throng of TV camera crews, photographers and journalists - almost outnumbering Jackson fans - had all grown weary and suspicious.</p> <p>They had stood for hours in the rain-lashed courtyard press pens - some TV crews had been there since 10am.</p> <p>A rumour rippling through their ranks was beginning to be taken seriously - Jackson wasn't going to show.</p> <p>Hacks began to discuss what they might possibly fill page three of tomorrow's national newspapers with instead.</p> <p>Most of all, they wondered what they were doing there, fishing for an angle at a glorified photo opportunity. </p> <p>Prayers were said for a Jarvis Cocker-style bum-waggling incident to liven up the proceedings.</p> <p>But the PR strategy worked.

      "bodyText": "The relief on the face of PR man Ian Monk was a picture. He was finally able to tell a sodden press pack that Michael Jackson, almost three hours late, really was about to put in an appearance at the Oxford University Union. Honest. Having almost resigned the PR account to orchestrate Jackson's visit, PR firm MacLaurin was already familiar with the demands from the superstar's camp. So it was inevitable not everyone would be seduced by Jackson's tears or saddened by his woefully fragile appearance. The Daily Star today splashed on the melodramatic news that it, along with the Express and - most gravely of all - OK! had been barred from the event. That was something the Star hadn't expected - MacLaurin, after all, handles the PR for Richard Desmond's Express group. Last night, the throng of TV camera crews, photographers and journalists - almost outnumbering Jackson fans - had all grown weary and suspicious. They had stood for hours in the rain-lashed courtyard press pens - some TV crews had been there since 10am. A rumour rippling through their ranks was beginning to be taken seriously - Jackson wasn't going to show. Hacks began to discuss what they might possibly fill page three of tomorrow's national newspapers with instead. Most of all, they wondered what they were doing there, fishing for an angle at a glorified photo opportunity. Prayers were said for a Jarvis Cocker-style bum-waggling incident to liven up the proceedings. But the PR strategy worked. Lacking any juicy angles, the press duly obliged and printed the star's seven-point bill of rights for children. Everyone complained about the ban on recording Jackson's address from inside the debating chamber and no one had been given told why the ban was in place. The New York Daily News journalist said she was struggling to find the story and was unimpressed with the media turnout. \"Three times as many for OJ Simpson,\" she observed proudly. Some 40 journalists were permitted into the debating chamber while another 40 were in the ante-room, watching the proceedings by video link. At 7.15pm, Jackson was already late. But that, for a popstar, is fashionable. Nevertheless, all 80 hacks were unceremoniously shooed outside for a glimpse of the star as rumours of his impending arrival reached a crescendo. What the PR didn't count on was Jackson's sicknote. An hour later, he still hadn't appeared, leaving precious little time for appearances on the late evening news on BBC, ITV and Sky. Print journalists gleefully thought the delay was to their advantage. \"We'll be the first with the news,\" said one. But one cameraman summed up the mood: \"When I got this job I thought great, I'll get to see what Jacko really looks like. It's just a freakshow.\" But by the time the star deigned to show, the fans had stopped singing and first editions had gone to press. By the time the final editions of the newspapers emerged, only three bothered to put the story on their front page. Michael Jackson - freak or unique? The Star: freak \"Pop freak Michael Jackson last night banned the Daily Star from his speech at the Oxford Union\" Daily Express: unique \"Superstar sheds a tear over his lost childhood\" The Sun: freak \"Limping star rambles at launch of kids charter\" Daily Mail: unique \"I was starved of love to make me a star\" The Mirror: unique \"Jacko sobs over lost youth\" The Guardian: unique \"No kidding as Jacko calls for bill of rights\" The Times: unique \"Jackson opens heart about childhood at Oxford lecture\" The Daily Telegraph: unique \"What he said in his address to the Oxford Union\" Related stories Mar 6: Jacko bans cameras Feb 22: Jacko bans TV from Union address",

      "bodyText": "German media group Kirch is heading for crunch talks with the UK government over World Cup broadcasting rights. But officials at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport are determined that Kirch will come away empty handed from this morning's meeting with representatives of culture secretary Chris Smith. Kirch is on a collision course with UK politicians because it wants to sell the rights to the 2002 and 2006 tournaments to the highest bidder. Such an auction threatens to exclude free-to-air broadcasters such as the BBC or ITV. However, a DCMS spokeswoman said the competition is protected by the 1996 Broadcasting Act. The act states that a free-to-air station must be allowed to screen the entire tournament. \"Kirch wants to put its case to us, but our position has not changed and is unlikely to change,\" said the spokeswoman. \"As far as we are concerned, British viewers should be able to see the matches.\" Speculation is also mounting that a deal struck with the German government yesterday will force Kirch's hand in the UK. The company has been forced to sell the World Cup rights to two public-TV broadcasters following intervention by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. He acted after the media and general public reacted angrily to the prospect of paying to see the tournaments. In the UK, the fear that Kirch will sell the broadcasting franchise to a pay-TV bidder such as BSkyB or ONdigital has prompted a furious response from MPs and millions of football fans. The German group has underlined its resolve to get around UK broadcasting laws by filing a complaint to the European court of justice. It claims that the restrictions are a restraint of trade. The group is also embroiled in a tussle for control of the broadcasting rights to Formula One. It has only managed to strike a World Cup pay-per-view deal in Spain and is desperate to claw back the \u00a3550m it invested in the rights. Kirch was unavailable for comment.

With no end to the crisis in sight he can envisage having to shut down the \u00a3120,000-a-month operation.</p> <p>The foot and mouth crisis, now in its third week, is having a devastating effect on trade and many who work in the tourism industry are demanding action before their livelihoods are destroyed.</p> <p>In north Wales, the Lake District and the highlands of Scotland tourism is the largest economy's largest sector employing, the lifeblood of the community, bringing in far more money than farming - the industry the ban was brought in to protect. The Cumbrian tourist board estimated the crisis was costing the local economy between \u00a35m and \u00a38m a week.</p> <p>The government accepted yesterday that the foot and mouth outbreak was causing \"real difficulty and hardship\" to tourism, but with the Easter holidays fast approaching those working in the industry want more than just words.</p> <p>\"Everybody is suffering,\" said Mr Peter. \"Everything round here, from the pubs to the post office and petrol station rely on the trade that we bring in. With nobody here they are all starting to feel the pinch.\"</p> <p>\"We know we are not going to get any compensation from the government. I don't want the ban lifted if it is going to wreck the farming community, but the government has put in place some pretty stringent powers without thinking of the full implications. We need to see drastic action taken quickly. At the moment we have no idea when this is going to end, but if it goes on much longer I am going to have to lay off the rest of my staff.\"</p> <p>Richard Townsend from the Association of Mountain Instructors said the organisation was trying to negotiate with the national parks and land owners for limited access to the mountains. \"We have 700 members, most of whom are self employed, and they are losing on average \u00a3500 a week each as a result of the crisis.\"</p> <p>Howard Christie, who owns the Wasdale Head Hotel in the Lake District, estimates he has lost about \u00a324,000 in the last 10 days. \"I have respect for my farming neighbours and I hope they have respect for me, but the fact is the 15 people I employ at the hotel are more than the total number employed in agriculture in the valley. With the money I have lost I could have bought every piece of livestock in the valley and had change to spare.\"</p> <p>Rick Potter is a self employed mountain instructor who works out of Llanberis in the shadow of Snowdon in north Wales. \"The area is like a ghost town. The car parks are empty and taped shut, the National Parks are all closed,\" he said yesterday. \"The place is usually a mecca for outdoor activities, children and people who just want stroll or walk their dog but now it's completely dead.\"</p> <p>Just down the road at Pete's Eats, one of the most famous mountaineering hangouts in Britain, the crisis is also beginning to bite. \"Everyone is respecting the ban and we have lost most of out trade,\" said the manager, Ted Sylvester. \"We are losing thousands a week and if you multiply that through the village, where 70% of revenue is tourist based, the crisis must have cost something like \u00a3200,000.</p> <p>\"When you think that the restrictions on movement were put in mainly for economic reasons in the first place at some point the government is going to have to start considering the effect it is having on other areas and not just farming.\"</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446494,00.html\">27.02.2001: A living on the edge</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446488,00.html\">05.03.2001: Dartmoor case raises 'nightmare scenario'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446483,00.html\">05.03.2001: 'All the cheaper cuts of meat have gone'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446563,00.html\">05.03.2001: Outbreak to spare Bank's blushes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446500,00.html\">MP hits at safety on outbreak farm</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446594,00.html\">050.03.2001: Who's mad now?

The government accepted yesterday that the foot and mouth outbreak was causing \"real difficulty and hardship\" to tourism, but with the Easter holidays fast approaching those working in the industry want more than just words. \"Everybody is suffering,\" said Mr Peter. \"Everything round here, from the pubs to the post office and petrol station rely on the trade that we bring in. With nobody here they are all starting to feel the pinch.\" \"We know we are not going to get any compensation from the government. I don't want the ban lifted if it is going to wreck the farming community, but the government has put in place some pretty stringent powers without thinking of the full implications. We need to see drastic action taken quickly. At the moment we have no idea when this is going to end, but if it goes on much longer I am going to have to lay off the rest of my staff.\" Richard Townsend from the Association of Mountain Instructors said the organisation was trying to negotiate with the national parks and land owners for limited access to the mountains. \"We have 700 members, most of whom are self employed, and they are losing on average \u00a3500 a week each as a result of the crisis.\" Howard Christie, who owns the Wasdale Head Hotel in the Lake District, estimates he has lost about \u00a324,000 in the last 10 days. \"I have respect for my farming neighbours and I hope they have respect for me, but the fact is the 15 people I employ at the hotel are more than the total number employed in agriculture in the valley. With the money I have lost I could have bought every piece of livestock in the valley and had change to spare.\" Rick Potter is a self employed mountain instructor who works out of Llanberis in the shadow of Snowdon in north Wales. \"The area is like a ghost town. The car parks are empty and taped shut, the National Parks are all closed,\" he said yesterday. \"The place is usually a mecca for outdoor activities, children and people who just want stroll or walk their dog but now it's completely dead.\" Just down the road at Pete's Eats, one of the most famous mountaineering hangouts in Britain, the crisis is also beginning to bite. \"Everyone is respecting the ban and we have lost most of out trade,\" said the manager, Ted Sylvester. \"We are losing thousands a week and if you multiply that through the village, where 70% of revenue is tourist based, the crisis must have cost something like \u00a3200,000. \"When you think that the restrictions on movement were put in mainly for economic reasons in the first place at some point the government is going to have to start considering the effect it is having on other areas and not just farming.\" What's going on?

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair promised yesterday to put Britain on a fast track into the global \"green industrial revolution\" and to lead the world in addressing environmental and agricultural problems.</p> <p>In his second green speech in four months, the prime minister committed \u00a3100m of new money to renewable energy - wind, solar and wave power - and called for radical reform of the European common agricultural policy to help British farmers and developing countries.</p> <p>\"Green technologies are on the verge of becoming one of the next waves in the knowledge economy revolution,\" Mr Blair said in a speech to the Worldwide Fund for Nature. \"The global market for environmental goods and services is projected to rise to \u00a3440bn a year in the next nine years. Shell estimates that 50% of the world's energy needs could be met by renewables by 2050. By 2010, the global solar market could be worth \u00a3150bn a year. I want Britain to be a leading player in this revolution.\"</p> <p>In a wide ranging, sometimes passionate, speech that recalled Margaret Thatcher's awakening to green issues in 1989, Mr Blair restated the threats posed by climate change, desertification, and the abuse of resources - but sought to link them with \"hypocritical\" policies that exacerbated poverty in poor countries.</p> <p>\"The common agriculture policy is seriously outmoded. It distorts global agricultural markets and promotes forms of agriculture that damage the environment. It is hypocritical of us to to talk of concern to alleviate the poverty of the developing world whilst we block access to our markets.</p> <p>\"There is now an intense urgency about the politics of the environment. We would be irresponsible to treat predictions [about global warming, forest loss and water shortages] as scaremongering. They represent the considered opinions of some of the world's best scientists. We cannot afford to ignore them.</p> <p>\"The effects will be catastrophic for some parts of the world, particularly the poorer parts. Sustainable development is going to be the greatest challenge we face this century.\"</p> <p>His comments were welcomed by industry and a plethora of green groups, but other political parties accused him of appealing for the environmental vote ahead of an election.</p> <p>Charles Secrett, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"This is the strongest environment speech Tony Blair has yet made. We hope his commitment to sustainable farming will lead to a clear policy statement on how that shift can be achieved.\"</p> <p>Francis Sullivan, of the charity WWF-UK, said: \"We see this as a turning point in the government's position on the environment; we hope he follows it through in the next few months and it becomes a major plank of the manifesto.\"</p> <p>Conservative environment spokesman Damian Green countered: \"It is too late for Tony Blair to try and dress himself in green clothes. He is fooling no one with this sudden burst of fake concern.</p> <p>\"Britain is one of Europe's worst performers on renewable energy, one of Europe's worst performers on recycling domestic waste, and for the first three years Mr Blair's government blocked the construction of cleaner gas-fired power stations that emit fewer greenhouse gases.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair's points were taken up by other cabinet members. Agriculture minister Nick Brown said that the common agriculture policy was in dire need of reform. First BSE and now the foot and mouth crisis, said Mr Brown, had led to a \"very exciting opportunity\" for change in Europe.</p> <p>Clare Short, the international development secretary, said environmental degradation and poverty were intertwined. She called for improved trade access for developing countries and the dismantling of agricultural subsidies which damaged the developing world.</p> <p>But she challenged environmentalists to stop being anti-development: \"We must have a positive agenda. If we do not, developing countries will increasingly see environmental concerns as a pre-occupation of the north.\"</p> <p><b>Harnessing the elements</b><br></p> <p>The potential for alternative energy sources has been explored for 20 years but never became popular because of lack of government support. Last year's utilities bill changed all that by insisting that electricity suppliers bought 10% green electricity by 2010. This is likely to add \u00a33 a year on average to householders' bills.</p> <p><b>Wind power</b><br></p> <p>Wind power is already commercially viable at some sites and is the fastest developing renewable energy in the UK.</p> <p>Despite having more potential than anywhere else in Europe the technology has made a slow start because of the countryside lobby, which has campaigned successfully against onshore wind farms. However, there is virtually no opposition to offshore wind power.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair promised yesterday to put Britain on a fast track into the global \"green industrial revolution\" and to lead the world in addressing environmental and agricultural problems. In his second green speech in four months, the prime minister committed \u00a3100m of new money to renewable energy - wind, solar and wave power - and called for radical reform of the European common agricultural policy to help British farmers and developing countries. \"Green technologies are on the verge of becoming one of the next waves in the knowledge economy revolution,\" Mr Blair said in a speech to the Worldwide Fund for Nature. \"The global market for environmental goods and services is projected to rise to \u00a3440bn a year in the next nine years. Shell estimates that 50% of the world's energy needs could be met by renewables by 2050. By 2010, the global solar market could be worth \u00a3150bn a year. I want Britain to be a leading player in this revolution.\" In a wide ranging, sometimes passionate, speech that recalled Margaret Thatcher's awakening to green issues in 1989, Mr Blair restated the threats posed by climate change, desertification, and the abuse of resources - but sought to link them with \"hypocritical\" policies that exacerbated poverty in poor countries. \"The common agriculture policy is seriously outmoded. It distorts global agricultural markets and promotes forms of agriculture that damage the environment. It is hypocritical of us to to talk of concern to alleviate the poverty of the developing world whilst we block access to our markets. \"There is now an intense urgency about the politics of the environment. We would be irresponsible to treat predictions [about global warming, forest loss and water shortages] as scaremongering. They represent the considered opinions of some of the world's best scientists. We cannot afford to ignore them. \"The effects will be catastrophic for some parts of the world, particularly the poorer parts. Sustainable development is going to be the greatest challenge we face this century.\" His comments were welcomed by industry and a plethora of green groups, but other political parties accused him of appealing for the environmental vote ahead of an election. Charles Secrett, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"This is the strongest environment speech Tony Blair has yet made. We hope his commitment to sustainable farming will lead to a clear policy statement on how that shift can be achieved.\" Francis Sullivan, of the charity WWF-UK, said: \"We see this as a turning point in the government's position on the environment; we hope he follows it through in the next few months and it becomes a major plank of the manifesto.\" Conservative environment spokesman Damian Green countered: \"It is too late for Tony Blair to try and dress himself in green clothes. He is fooling no one with this sudden burst of fake concern. \"Britain is one of Europe's worst performers on renewable energy, one of Europe's worst performers on recycling domestic waste, and for the first three years Mr Blair's government blocked the construction of cleaner gas-fired power stations that emit fewer greenhouse gases.\" Mr Blair's points were taken up by other cabinet members. Agriculture minister Nick Brown said that the common agriculture policy was in dire need of reform. First BSE and now the foot and mouth crisis, said Mr Brown, had led to a \"very exciting opportunity\" for change in Europe. Clare Short, the international development secretary, said environmental degradation and poverty were intertwined. She called for improved trade access for developing countries and the dismantling of agricultural subsidies which damaged the developing world. But she challenged environmentalists to stop being anti-development: \"We must have a positive agenda. If we do not, developing countries will increasingly see environmental concerns as a pre-occupation of the north.\" Harnessing the elements The potential for alternative energy sources has been explored for 20 years but never became popular because of lack of government support. Last year's utilities bill changed all that by insisting that electricity suppliers bought 10% green electricity by 2010. This is likely to add \u00a33 a year on average to householders' bills. Wind power Wind power is already commercially viable at some sites and is the fastest developing renewable energy in the UK. Despite having more potential than anywhere else in Europe the technology has made a slow start because of the countryside lobby, which has campaigned successfully against onshore wind farms. However, there is virtually no opposition to offshore wind power. Its advantage is that much larger turbines can be used and the wind blows steadily out to sea, adding to efficiency. The drawback is the extra cost of installation and the length of cables to the shore. In the last few months, and with another boost from the prime minister yesterday, the off-shore wind industry is about to take off. The crown estates are due to allocate 10 sites for offshore wind farms and industry has put up \u00a31bn to build them. The UK has high hopes of reaching 5% of electricity supply from wind power by 2010, while the rest of Europe has higher targets. Solar power This has the greatest potential worldwide and could, in theory, provide 85% of UK energy needs. Germany, with a programme to build 100,000 solar roofs, and Japan, with 70,000 already under way, are ahead of targets. However, the UK has fewer than 10 properties providing power to the national grid and would require \u00a330m a year to catch up. Greenpeace and others have pushed hard for the government to take up the challenge posed by other industrial nations and were celebrating Tony Blair's conversion yesterday. Solar Century, a company promoting solar power, said if every south facing roof in Britain carried a solar panel it would generate 85% of the country's electricity needs. The mass production of photovoltaic cells, which turn sunlight into electricity, would be required. Shell and BP have already set up factories in other countries because of Britain's lack of commitment to the technology. Wave &amp; tidal power A great resource for the UK because we have some of the highest tides in the world and are battered by Atlantic waves, which scientists tell us are getting bigger all the time. Already there are plans to build three artificial islands off the coast of Wales to capture the incoming tide and generate electricity on the ebb. These islands would also have wind turbines on top and wave power generators attached making them energy islands. They would also have the advantage of creating protection against storms. There is an experimental wave station on the Isle of Islay and the government has warmed to the technology. The greatest potential is lines of generators offshore gaining energy from floats bobbing on the waves like ducks. In the 1980s when the UK had a world lead the Thatcher government killed all research on a device called \"Salter's Duck\" because of a miscalculation on cost. Unlike wind, tides are predictable so suppliers would know years in advance the precise energy yield from this technology. There have also been successful experiments using turbines in tidal areas which are reversible to take advantage of the ebb and flow. Taken together these technologies could provide up to 50% of the UK's power. Paul Brown Related special reports Special report: renewable energy Special report: global warming",

Mike O'Brien, the Home Office minister in charge of freedom of information, told a London conference that the earliest Whitehall could implement the new act was July 2002, and that date was not certain. Mr O'Brien said that a management review he had launched inside the Home Office had revealed that documents were missing, had been misfiled or could not be retrieved easily. \"I do not want to introduce a new system and then find out it cannot work because we do not have a proper system to retrieve documents or that we cannot retrieve them because we do not know where they are\", he told a conference on freedom of information at Canada House Mr O'Brien's announcement is an embarrassment for Jack Straw, the home secretary, who told the information commissioner, Elizabeth France, earlier this year that he wanted the Home Office to be the Whitehall guinea pig for the Freedom of Information Act by implementing it in October, six months in advance of everybody else. Civil servants attending this week's conference told the Guardian that the discovery of the missing files in the Home Office is expected to be replicated across government. The act will be retrospective so that documents held over the past 30 years can be requested for the first time by the public. Ministers will blame Lady Thatcher and John Major for much of the problem which stems from a decision to cut back on bureaucracy in the 1980s and 1990s. One official said: \"The cuts on bureaucracy meant that civil servants had to keep front line services running - so they cut back on filing or didn't keep any records at all unless it was essential.\"",

It's a positive trend that patients and their families increasingly feel they have the right, and are able, to raise concerns.\"",

      "body": "<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Part one of speech</a> <br>Competition at home is necessary for competitiveness at home and abroad. Yesterday the Competition Commission published its provisional findings on the banks and small business. And the Office of Fair Trading is today publishing its report on reform of the professions. Later in the week, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will announce his proposals for reform and detailed further consultation. <p> Institutional investors are responsible for assets of 1.5 trillion pounds. To promote long term investment and to protect investors, I have accepted the recommendations of the Myners report. We will abolish the minimum funding requirement; through tax and regulatory reform make it easier for life insurers and pension funds to invest in venture capital; and we will ensure both a strengthened role for pension fund trustees and a clearer duty on fund managers to promote beneficiaries' interests. I support the challenge to the industry Mr Myners has laid down and his proposal that we should be prepared to legislate as necessary to achieve the improvements he prescribes. </p> <p> And so that we secure for Britain's companies the true competitive benefits of the single market, on Monday we will submit to European Finance Ministers our proposals for capital and product market reform for the Stockholm Summit and for the Spanish Presidency of 2002 a White Paper on economic reform in Europe will be published. </p> <p> And just as I will set out later our vision for the future of the tax system for work and for families, our vision for the future of the tax system for companies, large and small, is that by combining a wide and stable tax base with low and stable rates and a constant commitment to international competitiveness, we encourage innovation, investment and entrepreneurship. </p> <p> Building on our reduction of the corporation tax rate from 33 pence to 30 pence, I propose a further modernisation of the corporate tax system to meet the needs of a more knowledge based economy. After further consultation with business, I propose to introduce a new tax relief for intellectual property and goodwill. We will also consult in detail on relieving tax when companies sell substantial shareholdings. And from next month I will abolish the withholding tax not only on international bonds but also on payments of interest and royalties between companies in the UK. All steps designed to create the best modern environment for business. </p> <p> Enhanced capital allowances since 1997 and new tax credits to encourage investment and innovation have already saved business over 1 billion pounds, a third of a billion pounds to manufacturing. It is time for the next tax incentive to back manufacturing and innovation. Today we issue proposals and will consult on the best way to extend a research and development tax credit to larger companies. </p> <p> And we will legislate a new and special tax credit that will help British companies contribute to the relief of disease round the world, an incentive to accelerate research on diseases - like Aids, TB, Malaria and other diseases - that each year kill eight million people, including three million children in our poorest countries: deaths that in many cases are avoidable, diseases that in many places are preventible. We have a capacity to help and a moral duty to act. </p> <p> Subject to a commitment by the pharmaceutical companies to invest in and deliver new drugs and vaccines in ways that truly meet the needs of the poor and sick, the Secretary of State for International Development and I are prepared to extend this new tax credit even further. And Britain is prepared to take a lead in establishing a new purchase fund for global health that will not only develop new life saving drugs but make existing drugs more widely available. </p> <p> Mr Deputy Speaker, as we consider the next steps for taxation in the North Sea, our approach will be guided not by short term factors but by the need for a regime that raises a fair share of revenue and promotes long term investment in the North Sea. </p> <p> For farming, an industry essential to Britain which today faces both immediate and long standing difficulties, the Government, over and above its statutory obligations, has made available agri-compensation money worth 150 million pounds. And I can confirm that the Minister for Agriculture is taking steps to advance agri-money and other payments. </p> <p> Last year I cut the long term capital gains rate for business assets from 40 pence to 10 pence. I can now go further. For employees in all types of companies including venture capital and non trading companies the long term capital gains tax rate will no longer be 40 pence but 10 pence. </p> <p> Growing companies offering share options will benefit from today's extension of the Enterprise Management Incentive scheme. I have decided to double to 3 million pounds the share options that benefit from tax relief and in qualifying companies I will extend the right to benefit from these share options to all employees. </p> <p> Since 1997 the number of small businesses has grown by 170,000, as we have cut small company tax from 23 pence to 20 pence, with a new starting rate of just 10 pence in the pound, an overall cut in the typical small company tax bill of nearly 25 per cent. </p> <p> We propose a new regime to simplify VAT for small business, which will be of direct help to up to half a million companies. </p> <p> For firms with a turnover of up to fifty four thousand pounds, VAT will not be charged at all: more of business' income not subject to VAT in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. </p> <p> For firms with a turnover of up to one hundred thousand pounds, we propose a simpler and lower flat rate which after consultation we will implement next year. </p> <p> For firms with a turnover of up to six hundred thousand pounds we will also consult upon a simplified VAT payments scheme. </p> <p> And I now propose not just to simplify small business VAT but to simplify small business corporate tax.</p> <p> Last year we exempted small businesses from the costly obligation to submit audited accounts, thus cutting red tape and cutting small business costs by two hundred and twenty million pounds. </p> <p> The next step is an even more radical proposal: to make the annual company accounts the basis for calculating tax, thus cutting more red tape and cutting business costs once again. </p> <p> On Friday the Deputy Prime Minister and I will announce new financial flexibilities so that Regional Development Agencies can fulfill their strategic role in delivering higher productivity and for every region balanced growth. </p> <p> Our rising prosperity still leaves too many places and people behind. Nor will they catch up if we rely on the old failed policies of the past - either paying out more and more unemployment benefits without real investment or paying out untargeted property subsidies without real job creation. </p> <p> I see our inner cities and older industrial communities not as no-go areas for new enterprise but as places of untapped potential, where there are young people with dynamism looking for work and markets waiting to develop and grow. </p> <p> Across Britain, whether in new towns, traditional inner cities or former coal, textile and steel communities, the way forward for regeneration is to harness both new public and private investment and new fiscal incentives to extend the opportunities for enterprise from some of the country to all the country. </p> <p> To speed up regeneration I now propose, after our Pre-Budget consultation, a total of six tax cuts targeted on enterprise at a cost - over the next five years - of one billion pounds. </p> <p> To make the first stages of buying property and bringing land back into use tax free, in designated areas stamp duty will be abolished. </p> <p> To bring disused properties back into use, we will cut VAT on residential property conversions from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent. </p> <p> For cleaning up contaminated land, there will be an accelerated tax relief, set at one hundred and fifty per cent, and consultation of a further corporation tax relief for firms investing in our new Urban Regeneration Companies. </p> <p> To help revitalise our high streets, we will provide one hundred per cent first year capital allowances for bringing empty flats over shops back into the residential market. </p> <p> To cut the cost of small business borrowing we will introduce a new community investment tax credit and we will create the first community development venture capital fund - a partnership between Government, financial institutions and the charitable sector for which the chairman of our review, Sir Ronald Cohen, proposes a capitalisation of forty million pounds. </p> <p> And to cut the costs of start ups, the Small Business Service will offer one-stop support and up to two thousand pounds worth of help for any start-up company drawing up their business plan, making it easier than ever in these areas to start and sustain a business. </p> <p> In both urban and rural areas, our churches are essential centres for civic life and are at the heart of our rich heritage as a nation. To help preserve that heritage and to cut the costs of saving and repairing our listed church buildings we will introduce for repairs started after April 1st a new grant, the equivalent of a VAT reduction from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent: a reform long sought by congregations across the country. </p> <p> At the centre of our communities are also thousands of non-profit sports clubs, and we will now consider the best way for the tax system to give them further support and to recognise their contribution to our community life. </p> <p> This Government's policy is for free museums and I can announce that we will change the law on VAT to make that possible. The Secretary of State for Culture will set out the full details of the change. </p> <p> The film industry tax incentive we introduced in 1997 which is contributing to the unprecedented success now enjoyed by independent British films, will at a cost of 50 million pounds next year be extended until 2005. </p> <p> My Deputy Speaker, our ambition for Britain is full employment, employment opportunity for all. </p> <p> I can report to the House that one and a half years early and at one half of the planned cost, we have exceeded our goal, not two hundred and fifty thousand, but two hundred and seventy thousand young people have now moved from welfare to work. </p> <p> With in total one million one hundred thousand more men and women in work than four years ago, Britain now has the lowest unemployment since 1975, the lowest long term unemployment since 1979, the lowest youth unemployment since 1975; the highest employment ever among women; with today one million vacancies spread across the country. </p> <p> But there is still more to do. The demands of the new economy mean we are likely to need two and a half million more employees at degree or higher degree levels, and overall more workers requiring higher skills and qualifications to fill new and higher paying jobs. </p> <p> So at the heart of our approach is that Government must meet its responsibilities, providing incentives for work and training; companies must meet their responsibilities to upgrade skills in the workplace; and people must take up their responsibilities to work and to prepare for the jobs of the future. </p> <p> We have already made major changes to reward work - the New Deal, the Working Families Tax Credit and the 10 pence income tax rate. Now we have decided that following on stage one of the New Deal -when long term youth unemployment has fallen by 80 per cent - it is time for stage two designed to link those who need jobs to the jobs that need skills. </p> <p> Next week the Secretaries of State for Employment and Social Security and I will publish detailed plans to get the hard to employ back into work; to promote employer led sector initiatives under which the unemployed learn key skills; and to improve training in the workplace </p> <p> The starting point is a new 'employment first' principle. In the past the unemployed signed on for benefit before they looked for work. Now before receiving benefit the employment first principle means they will first have to be interviewed about job opportunities and the steps they are ready to take to get back into work. </p> <p> For the hard to employ, those still left behind, we are proposing from April at a cost of two hundred million pounds a year a new regime built around more intensive coaching and stronger sanctions for the over twenty fives. </p> <p> For thirty thousand benefit claimants who have been drug addicts, a new three year budget of forty million pounds will mean they can receive the mentoring and training they need, but to get on the programme they will have to get off drugs. We will fulfil our responsibility to help them; they must fulfill their responsibility to become drug- free. </p> <p> Next, to link the unemployed without skills to the jobs that require skills, we will announce separate initiatives to fill job vacancies in the IT industry, construction, hotels, retail and financial services. And as a result of the spending review the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has now allocated over one billion pounds so that modern apprenticeships - seventy five thousand in 1997, over two hundred and twenty thousand today - will rise to three hundred and twenty thousand, as we discharge our duty to invest in the skills of the next generation.<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447986,00.html\">Budget speech continued...</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>In detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">Main points</a></p> <p><b>Reaction</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a> </p>",

For employees in all types of companies including venture capital and non trading companies the long term capital gains tax rate will no longer be 40 pence but 10 pence. Growing companies offering share options will benefit from today's extension of the Enterprise Management Incentive scheme. I have decided to double to 3 million pounds the share options that benefit from tax relief and in qualifying companies I will extend the right to benefit from these share options to all employees. Since 1997 the number of small businesses has grown by 170,000, as we have cut small company tax from 23 pence to 20 pence, with a new starting rate of just 10 pence in the pound, an overall cut in the typical small company tax bill of nearly 25 per cent. We propose a new regime to simplify VAT for small business, which will be of direct help to up to half a million companies. For firms with a turnover of up to fifty four thousand pounds, VAT will not be charged at all: more of business' income not subject to VAT in Britain than anywhere else in Europe. For firms with a turnover of up to one hundred thousand pounds, we propose a simpler and lower flat rate which after consultation we will implement next year. For firms with a turnover of up to six hundred thousand pounds we will also consult upon a simplified VAT payments scheme. And I now propose not just to simplify small business VAT but to simplify small business corporate tax. Last year we exempted small businesses from the costly obligation to submit audited accounts, thus cutting red tape and cutting small business costs by two hundred and twenty million pounds. The next step is an even more radical proposal: to make the annual company accounts the basis for calculating tax, thus cutting more red tape and cutting business costs once again. On Friday the Deputy Prime Minister and I will announce new financial flexibilities so that Regional Development Agencies can fulfill their strategic role in delivering higher productivity and for every region balanced growth. Our rising prosperity still leaves too many places and people behind. Nor will they catch up if we rely on the old failed policies of the past - either paying out more and more unemployment benefits without real investment or paying out untargeted property subsidies without real job creation. I see our inner cities and older industrial communities not as no-go areas for new enterprise but as places of untapped potential, where there are young people with dynamism looking for work and markets waiting to develop and grow. Across Britain, whether in new towns, traditional inner cities or former coal, textile and steel communities, the way forward for regeneration is to harness both new public and private investment and new fiscal incentives to extend the opportunities for enterprise from some of the country to all the country. To speed up regeneration I now propose, after our Pre-Budget consultation, a total of six tax cuts targeted on enterprise at a cost - over the next five years - of one billion pounds. To make the first stages of buying property and bringing land back into use tax free, in designated areas stamp duty will be abolished. To bring disused properties back into use, we will cut VAT on residential property conversions from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent. For cleaning up contaminated land, there will be an accelerated tax relief, set at one hundred and fifty per cent, and consultation of a further corporation tax relief for firms investing in our new Urban Regeneration Companies. To help revitalise our high streets, we will provide one hundred per cent first year capital allowances for bringing empty flats over shops back into the residential market. To cut the cost of small business borrowing we will introduce a new community investment tax credit and we will create the first community development venture capital fund - a partnership between Government, financial institutions and the charitable sector for which the chairman of our review, Sir Ronald Cohen, proposes a capitalisation of forty million pounds. And to cut the costs of start ups, the Small Business Service will offer one-stop support and up to two thousand pounds worth of help for any start-up company drawing up their business plan, making it easier than ever in these areas to start and sustain a business. In both urban and rural areas, our churches are essential centres for civic life and are at the heart of our rich heritage as a nation. To help preserve that heritage and to cut the costs of saving and repairing our listed church buildings we will introduce for repairs started after April 1st a new grant, the equivalent of a VAT reduction from seventeen and a half per cent to five per cent: a reform long sought by congregations across the country. At the centre of our communities are also thousands of non-profit sports clubs, and we will now consider the best way for the tax system to give them further support and to recognise their contribution to our community life. This Government's policy is for free museums and I can announce that we will change the law on VAT to make that possible. The Secretary of State for Culture will set out the full details of the change. The film industry tax incentive we introduced in 1997 which is contributing to the unprecedented success now enjoyed by independent British films, will at a cost of 50 million pounds next year be extended until 2005. My Deputy Speaker, our ambition for Britain is full employment, employment opportunity for all. I can report to the House that one and a half years early and at one half of the planned cost, we have exceeded our goal, not two hundred and fifty thousand, but two hundred and seventy thousand young people have now moved from welfare to work. With in total one million one hundred thousand more men and women in work than four years ago, Britain now has the lowest unemployment since 1975, the lowest long term unemployment since 1979, the lowest youth unemployment since 1975; the highest employment ever among women; with today one million vacancies spread across the country. But there is still more to do. The demands of the new economy mean we are likely to need two and a half million more employees at degree or higher degree levels, and overall more workers requiring higher skills and qualifications to fill new and higher paying jobs. So at the heart of our approach is that Government must meet its responsibilities, providing incentives for work and training; companies must meet their responsibilities to upgrade skills in the workplace; and people must take up their responsibilities to work and to prepare for the jobs of the future. We have already made major changes to reward work - the New Deal, the Working Families Tax Credit and the 10 pence income tax rate. Now we have decided that following on stage one of the New Deal -when long term youth unemployment has fallen by 80 per cent - it is time for stage two designed to link those who need jobs to the jobs that need skills. Next week the Secretaries of State for Employment and Social Security and I will publish detailed plans to get the hard to employ back into work; to promote employer led sector initiatives under which the unemployed learn key skills; and to improve training in the workplace The starting point is a new 'employment first' principle. In the past the unemployed signed on for benefit before they looked for work. Now before receiving benefit the employment first principle means they will first have to be interviewed about job opportunities and the steps they are ready to take to get back into work. For the hard to employ, those still left behind, we are proposing from April at a cost of two hundred million pounds a year a new regime built around more intensive coaching and stronger sanctions for the over twenty fives. For thirty thousand benefit claimants who have been drug addicts, a new three year budget of forty million pounds will mean they can receive the mentoring and training they need, but to get on the programme they will have to get off drugs. We will fulfil our responsibility to help them; they must fulfill their responsibility to become drug- free. Next, to link the unemployed without skills to the jobs that require skills, we will announce separate initiatives to fill job vacancies in the IT industry, construction, hotels, retail and financial services. And as a result of the spending review the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has now allocated over one billion pounds so that modern apprenticeships - seventy five thousand in 1997, over two hundred and twenty thousand today - will rise to three hundred and twenty thousand, as we discharge our duty to invest in the skills of the next generation.

      "body": "<b>The chancellor's speech</b> <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, since we came into Government our first duty has been to secure economic stability.</p> <p> In 1997 with inflation rising, a 28 billion pounds deficit, and a national debt that had doubled, the British economy was once again at risk of repeating the old all too familiar pattern of inflation followed by recession. </p> <p> There were many who opposed our decision to make the Bank of England independent, others who opposed the tough controls on borrowing and spending and many also who opposed our new fiscal rules and disciplines. There were some in this House who predicted that our policies would bring recession. </p> <p> I can report to the House that today because of the choices Britain made our country now has: </p> <p> the lowest inflation for 30 years; </p> <p> the lowest long term interest rates for 35 years; </p> <p> mortgages now averaging one thousand two hundred pounds a year lower than under the last Government; </p> <p> more people in work than ever before; and </p> <p> the lowest unemployment since 1975. </p> <p> A new won and hard won stability which Britain must not take for granted but must entrench. </p> <p> And because there is still much to do the stability built in the first years will be our foundation for building opportunity and prosperity for all in the years to come. </p> <p> We know as a nation that - after a generation of under-investment in both our industries and our public services - the ambitions we have for our country - high productivity and full employment, education opportunity for all and an end to child poverty, a modern NHS and modern public services - can only be realised if we make the choice to invest for the long term. </p> <p> So this is the challenge for this Budget and for the future: by our tax and fiscal decisions, to secure rising levels of business investment and rewards for entrepreneurship. And for all hard working British families, who deserve the best hospitals, schools and public services, decade after decade of past neglect and decline replaced by year after year of rising and sustained investment and modernisation. </p> <p> Our greatest long term investment is in children. I have looked back at a century and more of past Budgets which have had one common feature: the needs of children in the tax system go almost unrecognised; the needs of women barely mentioned. </p> <p> And when the story of Britain is of families struggling to do the best by their children, to balance work and family life, and all the daily pressures they face, it is right that we have a Budget that puts families first. </p> <p> So this is my Budget judgement: instead of the old short-termism of looking only a year or a month ahead, we lock in stability for the long term and, by striking the right balance today between long term investments and affordable tax cuts, we not only boost enterprise and savings, but meet the needs of not just some but all Britain's families. </p> <p> Let me turn to the economic background and forecasts. </p> <p> Between 1979 and 1997 inflation averaged 6.2 per cent. </p> <p> Since 1997 it has averaged less than half as much - 2.4 per cent. </p> <p> In the last year I can report inflation has averaged 2.1 per cent, the lowest annual inflation since 1963. </p> <p> Interest rates from 1979 averaged 10 per cent. Since 1997 they have averaged 6 per cent. And remained stable over the past year, the longest period of consistently low interest rates since the 1960s. </p> <p> Long term interest rates - now around 5 per cent - are for the first time since the 1960s as low as those in Germany and America. </p> <p> Mortgage rates which averaged eleven per cent between 1979 and 1997 are now down to six and three quarter per cent or less. </p> <p> Growth from 1979 averaged 2 per cent. Since 1997 it has averaged 2.7 per cent and in the last year I can now also report to the House the economy has grown at 3 per cent. </p> <p> I can also report that manufacturing - despite the euro sterling exchange rate - grew last year by 1.6 per cent; manufacturing productivity grew by 4.4 per cent and manufacturing exports by 11.8 per cent; and it is to the credit of thousands of successful British companies that overall British exports grew by 7.4 per cent. </p> <p> And business investment has grown by 2 per cent as we lock in a higher level of investment as a share of our economy, over 14 per cent, higher than at any time in forty years. </p> <p> The faster the speed of international financial flows today, the greater the need for international and national vigilance if stability is to be achieved and sustained. </p> <p> It is precisely because we have taken the time to get the fundamentals right and held to a steady course that we are better placed to cope with the uncertainties in the world economy this year. </p> <p> With the United States today experiencing a necessary slowing and Japan barely growing, the growth rate in the world's major economies this year is expected to halve while the world still faces volatile oil prices. </p> <p> But because Britain's economy remains stable, our Treasury forecast is that this year Britain's growth will be within a sustainable range of two and a quarter to two and three quarter per cent. </p> <p> And while elsewhere business investment is falling, I can inform the House - we are raising this year's forecast for business investment in Britain, which will rise by between two and a half and three per cent, continuing at an all time high of fourteen per cent of GDP - with total investment growing by between five and a half and five and three quarters per cent. </p> <p> The Treasury forecast is that consumer demand will grow by between three and a quarter to three and a half per cent; manufacturing growing between one and three quarters and two per cent; exports growing between five and a half and five and three quarters per cent. </p> <p> Inflation is forecast to be two and a quarter per cent this time next year and on target at two and a half per cent at the end of next year. </p> <p> In the Budget, the Chancellor must confirm the inflation target for the coming year. </p> <p> With inflation forecast to be two and a half per cent next year, imposing a lower inflation target - as some have suggested - would mean upward pressure on interest rates and risk lower growth and higher unemployment. </p> <p> So I can confirm that because stability will guide our approach, the inflation target will remain at two and a half per cent. </p> <p> And my Budget will meet each one of our fiscal rules. </p> <p> Let me set out the detailed figures for the House. </p> <p> In the last Budget I forecast a current surplus for the financial year 2000-2001 at 14 billion pounds. I now forecast this surplus to be 23 billions pounds, and in successive years the current surpluses are projected to be 17, 15, 8, 9 and 9. Over the economic cycle, even on the most cautious of cases, we will meet our first fiscal rule and balance the current Budget. </p> <p> After a doubling of national debt in the early 1990s the ratio of net debt to national income had, by 1997, risen to 44 per cent. Our second fiscal rule - that debt should be at a sustainable level, below 40 per cent of GDP - has led us since 1997 to cut the ratio of debt from 44 per cent to 42 per cent to 40 then 37 per cent to what I can report for this financial year - 31.8 per cent. </p> <p> From the unacceptable level of debt we inherited - debt at 44 per cent of national income - I forecast debt in the coming year will fall to 30.3 per cent and in the following years I project 29.6, 29.7, 29.9 and 30 per cent successively - meeting our second rule and putting Britain in a far stronger position to deal with the ups and downs of the economic cycle. </p> <p> Net borrowing, forecast to be in surplus this financial year at 6.5 billion pounds, now yields a surplus of 16.4 billion pounds. As we invest according to our plans the projections for future years are 6, -1, -10, -11 and -12. </p> <p> Mr Deputy Speaker, in every one of the next five years, adjusting for the cycle, we have locked in the tight fiscal stance we set out in both the Pre-Budget Report and the last Budget. </p> <p> Because of this and because of the spectrum cash proceeds, we are able to repay debt. Last year we repaid 9 billion pounds. </p> <p> I can tell the House that this year the net cash debt repayment will be 34 billion pounds: more debt repaid by one British Government in one year than all the total debt repaid by all the previous British Governments of the last fifty years. </p> <p> So debt interest payments next year are one and a half billion pounds lower than forecast in the Pre-Budget Report, and very substantially lower than expected in last year's Budget. In total because of the Government's prudence debt interest payments in the coming year will be three and a half billion pounds lower than this year, releasing resources for our priorities. </p> <p> In 1997 Britain spent more on debt interest payments than all the money it spent on our schools. In 2001-2 we will be spending ten billion pounds a year more on schools than on debt interest. </p> <p> And since 1997 lower unemployment has also reduced social security costs by 4 billion pounds a year, again releasing resources for public services. </p> <p> Whereas from 1979 to 1997 42 pence in every extra pound spent went to debt and social security, now the figure is only 16 pence, leaving more than 80 pence in every extra pound to go direct to front-line public services. </p> <p> So, because we have cut debt and cut unemployment - and achieved higher growth and earnings - we are also able to achieve today what has eluded Governments for many years: to lock in a fiscal tightening, meet all our fiscal rules, and then, within this prudent and cautious framework, to have extra resources available in this Budget to invest, in a balanced way, in Britain's future. </p> <p> A balanced approach around which we will seek to build a consensus within the country in the coming years that, within a stable framework, the right kind of public investments and targeted tax cuts are both essential engines to drive forward our economic and social ambitions for Britain. </p> <p> To achieve our first ambition - to secure the fastest productivity growth of our competitors over the next decade - business investment must rise and today I propose the further reforms needed to promote competition, innovation and entrepreneurship.<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447984,00.html\">Budget speech continued...</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>In detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">Main points</a></p> <p><b>Reaction</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a> </p>",

In 1997 with inflation rising, a 28 billion pounds deficit, and a national debt that had doubled, the British economy was once again at risk of repeating the old all too familiar pattern of inflation followed by recession. There were many who opposed our decision to make the Bank of England independent, others who opposed the tough controls on borrowing and spending and many also who opposed our new fiscal rules and disciplines. There were some in this House who predicted that our policies would bring recession. I can report to the House that today because of the choices Britain made our country now has: the lowest inflation for 30 years; the lowest long term interest rates for 35 years; mortgages now averaging one thousand two hundred pounds a year lower than under the last Government; more people in work than ever before; and the lowest unemployment since 1975. A new won and hard won stability which Britain must not take for granted but must entrench. And because there is still much to do the stability built in the first years will be our foundation for building opportunity and prosperity for all in the years to come. We know as a nation that - after a generation of under-investment in both our industries and our public services - the ambitions we have for our country - high productivity and full employment, education opportunity for all and an end to child poverty, a modern NHS and modern public services - can only be realised if we make the choice to invest for the long term. So this is the challenge for this Budget and for the future: by our tax and fiscal decisions, to secure rising levels of business investment and rewards for entrepreneurship. And for all hard working British families, who deserve the best hospitals, schools and public services, decade after decade of past neglect and decline replaced by year after year of rising and sustained investment and modernisation. Our greatest long term investment is in children. I have looked back at a century and more of past Budgets which have had one common feature: the needs of children in the tax system go almost unrecognised; the needs of women barely mentioned. And when the story of Britain is of families struggling to do the best by their children, to balance work and family life, and all the daily pressures they face, it is right that we have a Budget that puts families first. So this is my Budget judgement: instead of the old short-termism of looking only a year or a month ahead, we lock in stability for the long term and, by striking the right balance today between long term investments and affordable tax cuts, we not only boost enterprise and savings, but meet the needs of not just some but all Britain's families. Let me turn to the economic background and forecasts. Between 1979 and 1997 inflation averaged 6.2 per cent. Since 1997 it has averaged less than half as much - 2.4 per cent. In the last year I can report inflation has averaged 2.1 per cent, the lowest annual inflation since 1963. Interest rates from 1979 averaged 10 per cent. Since 1997 they have averaged 6 per cent. And remained stable over the past year, the longest period of consistently low interest rates since the 1960s. Long term interest rates - now around 5 per cent - are for the first time since the 1960s as low as those in Germany and America. Mortgage rates which averaged eleven per cent between 1979 and 1997 are now down to six and three quarter per cent or less. Growth from 1979 averaged 2 per cent. Since 1997 it has averaged 2.7 per cent and in the last year I can now also report to the House the economy has grown at 3 per cent. I can also report that manufacturing - despite the euro sterling exchange rate - grew last year by 1.6 per cent; manufacturing productivity grew by 4.4 per cent and manufacturing exports by 11.8 per cent; and it is to the credit of thousands of successful British companies that overall British exports grew by 7.4 per cent. And business investment has grown by 2 per cent as we lock in a higher level of investment as a share of our economy, over 14 per cent, higher than at any time in forty years. The faster the speed of international financial flows today, the greater the need for international and national vigilance if stability is to be achieved and sustained. It is precisely because we have taken the time to get the fundamentals right and held to a steady course that we are better placed to cope with the uncertainties in the world economy this year. With the United States today experiencing a necessary slowing and Japan barely growing, the growth rate in the world's major economies this year is expected to halve while the world still faces volatile oil prices. But because Britain's economy remains stable, our Treasury forecast is that this year Britain's growth will be within a sustainable range of two and a quarter to two and three quarter per cent. And while elsewhere business investment is falling, I can inform the House - we are raising this year's forecast for business investment in Britain, which will rise by between two and a half and three per cent, continuing at an all time high of fourteen per cent of GDP - with total investment growing by between five and a half and five and three quarters per cent. The Treasury forecast is that consumer demand will grow by between three and a quarter to three and a half per cent; manufacturing growing between one and three quarters and two per cent; exports growing between five and a half and five and three quarters per cent. Inflation is forecast to be two and a quarter per cent this time next year and on target at two and a half per cent at the end of next year. In the Budget, the Chancellor must confirm the inflation target for the coming year. With inflation forecast to be two and a half per cent next year, imposing a lower inflation target - as some have suggested - would mean upward pressure on interest rates and risk lower growth and higher unemployment. So I can confirm that because stability will guide our approach, the inflation target will remain at two and a half per cent. And my Budget will meet each one of our fiscal rules. Let me set out the detailed figures for the House. In the last Budget I forecast a current surplus for the financial year 2000-2001 at 14 billion pounds. I now forecast this surplus to be 23 billions pounds, and in successive years the current surpluses are projected to be 17, 15, 8, 9 and 9. Over the economic cycle, even on the most cautious of cases, we will meet our first fiscal rule and balance the current Budget. After a doubling of national debt in the early 1990s the ratio of net debt to national income had, by 1997, risen to 44 per cent. Our second fiscal rule - that debt should be at a sustainable level, below 40 per cent of GDP - has led us since 1997 to cut the ratio of debt from 44 per cent to 42 per cent to 40 then 37 per cent to what I can report for this financial year - 31.8 per cent. From the unacceptable level of debt we inherited - debt at 44 per cent of national income - I forecast debt in the coming year will fall to 30.3 per cent and in the following years I project 29.6, 29.7, 29.9 and 30 per cent successively - meeting our second rule and putting Britain in a far stronger position to deal with the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Net borrowing, forecast to be in surplus this financial year at 6.5 billion pounds, now yields a surplus of 16.4 billion pounds. As we invest according to our plans the projections for future years are 6, -1, -10, -11 and -12. Mr Deputy Speaker, in every one of the next five years, adjusting for the cycle, we have locked in the tight fiscal stance we set out in both the Pre-Budget Report and the last Budget. Because of this and because of the spectrum cash proceeds, we are able to repay debt. Last year we repaid 9 billion pounds. I can tell the House that this year the net cash debt repayment will be 34 billion pounds: more debt repaid by one British Government in one year than all the total debt repaid by all the previous British Governments of the last fifty years. So debt interest payments next year are one and a half billion pounds lower than forecast in the Pre-Budget Report, and very substantially lower than expected in last year's Budget. In total because of the Government's prudence debt interest payments in the coming year will be three and a half billion pounds lower than this year, releasing resources for our priorities. In 1997 Britain spent more on debt interest payments than all the money it spent on our schools. In 2001-2 we will be spending ten billion pounds a year more on schools than on debt interest. And since 1997 lower unemployment has also reduced social security costs by 4 billion pounds a year, again releasing resources for public services. Whereas from 1979 to 1997 42 pence in every extra pound spent went to debt and social security, now the figure is only 16 pence, leaving more than 80 pence in every extra pound to go direct to front-line public services. So, because we have cut debt and cut unemployment - and achieved higher growth and earnings - we are also able to achieve today what has eluded Governments for many years: to lock in a fiscal tightening, meet all our fiscal rules, and then, within this prudent and cautious framework, to have extra resources available in this Budget to invest, in a balanced way, in Britain's future.

To back up the tax relief we offer for employee training, we are prepared to consider how best we can help employers meet their responsibilities, including the case for a new tax credit. </p> <p> If we are to reach our long term employment goal we must also do more to reward work. </p> <p> Our vision of the future of the tax system for work is of one that by integrating low starting rates of tax and targeted tax credits makes work pay, brings more people into work and moves us towards our goal of full employment. </p> <p> This Government introduced the first ever national minimum wage and it is this Government which has this week raised the minimum wage as of October this year from \u00a33.70 an hour to \u00a34.10 an hour and then, next year, subject to economic conditions, to \u00a34.20. </p> <p> Today I can go further and announce that for all families on the Working Families Tax Credit there will be a rise from June this year of five pounds a week. This takes the hourly minimum rate for those on the working families tax credit not just to \u00a34.10 an hour but to \u00a36.40 an hour. When we first announced the Working Families Tax Credit the minimum family income for full time work was 180 pounds a week. This year the minimum will be 225 pounds a week, or eleven thousand seven hundred pounds a year. </p> <p> And as part of our programme to ensure new disability rights I can announce that in addition to a new guaranteed minimum income for a severely disabled person on benefit of 142 pounds a week, for those in full time work the Disabled Person's Tax Credit will also be raised from June this year by 5 pounds a week to guarantee a minimum weekly family income of 250 pounds. </p> <p> To help parents into work I have also decided to pay working families more towards the costs of childcare. </p> <p> In addition to the childcare places being created for one million children, the child care tax credit will, from June, pay up to 70 per cent of child care costs up to - instead of 100 pounds a week as now - 135 pounds a week for one child and - instead of 150 pounds a week - up to 200 pounds a week for two or more children, another step in our plan to place affordable child care within the reach of all working families who need it. </p> <p> I turn to other measures that will help hard working families. </p> <p> I can announce that for the coming financial year we will freeze all rates of car vehicle excise duty. </p> <p> Having completed our consultation on new duty rates, I will now move ahead with the proposal to extend the 55 pounds reduction on the standard licence fee from all cars up to 1200 cc to all cars up to and including 1.5 litres. This will include for example Escorts, Astras, Micras and Rover Metros, in total an extra 5 million cars. This reduction, to be implemented in July, will be backdated to November last year. In total 9 million cars up to I.5 litres will pay 55 pounds less. </p> <p> From this month also for all newly purchased cars, a new four band vehicle excise duty rewards the most environmentally friendly vehicles. 70 per cent of all new cars will now enjoy a reduced licence fee. </p> <p> Since last November, lorry owners have already received rebates for up to half of this year's licence fee, a total of 220 million pounds. And following our Pre-Budget consultation and at a cost of 300 million pounds a year we will sweep aside the 100 separate lorry licence rates, consolidate them into seven rate bands - linked to environmental standards and set in consultation with the industry - cutting the rates to match the lowest in Europe. For the lorries used most for international haulage the fee reduction will mean savings on the old rate of between one thousand five hundred pounds and two thousand one hundred pounds a year. Around 115 thousand vehicles will save over 1,000 pounds. </p> <p> And next month we will abolish vehicle excise duty on all tractors. </p> <p> Transport spending is set to rise by 20 per cent a year over the next three years, as we take forward our ten year plan of \u00a3180 billion private and public investment. </p> <p> In November 1999 I announced the Government's new approach to the fuel escalator, first introduced by the previous Government in 1993, and which by 2010 will have secured a reduction in carbon dioxide pollution of one to two and a half million tonnes. </p> <p> As I stated in the Pre-Budget Report: this year we will not proceed with the annual inflation rise in petrol tax that has been the norm on Budget day. </p> <p> After consultation on my Pre-Budget Report I am able to confirm further changes. </p> <p> In addition to the 1 pence cut in ultra low sulphur petrol last October, the duty on ultra low sulphur petrol will be further cut by 2 pence litre. </p> <p> To make sure all motorists can benefit from this 2 pence cut I will extend it to unleaded petrol until June 14th: when the industry says ultra low sulphur petrol will be 100 per cent available. The 2 pence cut for both ultra low sulphur and unleaded petrol will take effect at 6 pm tonight. </p> <p> Lead replacement petrol will also be cut - by a further 2 pence per litre. </p> <p> And because it is right to maintain the proper balance in the tax treatment of petrol and diesel I propose to match the cut in low sulphur petrol with a cut in excise duties in ultra low sulphur diesel for all diesel users of 3 pence a litre, to take effect from 6.00 pm this evening. </p> <p> The Pre-Budget Report launched the green fuel challenge: with industry invited to submit plans for new, more environmentally friendly fuels. I can announce that duty will be cut radically on alternative fuels - a further 6 pence per kilogramme duty cut on road fuel gases with effect from 6.00 pm tonight and from next April a 20 pence duty cut for bio-diesel. To allow this new industry to plan ahead, duty on road fuel gases will be frozen in real terms until 2004. </p> <p> We cannot achieve the Kyoto targets and our goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent without the climate change levy which, with April's simultaneous cut in employers national insurance, brings no additional revenues to Government but which will cut carbon emissions by 5 million tonnes by 2010. </p> <p> To reward businesses investing in energy saving improvements, the Government is publishing this month the list of technologies that will qualify for 100 per cent tax relief and later this year we will launch a green technology challenge offering this 100 per cent tax relief to companies investing in the next generation of environmental technologies. </p> <p> As previously announced, the landfill tax will rise from 11 pounds per tonne to 12 pounds per tonne. </p> <p> I turn to the other excise duties. </p> <p> Last year I froze duties on spirits. </p> <p> This year an inflation rise would push the price of whisky up by 11 pence a bottle. </p> <p> Because of the competitive position of the industry I will this year continue to freeze duty on whisky and on all spirits. </p> <p> And this year I propose to go further and freeze duty on wine and on beer. </p> <p> Beyond the normal inflation rise of 6 pence, I will not go ahead with any real terms rise in cigarette taxes. </p> <p> Following our consultation with the betting and gaming industry over the impact of internet trading, I have decided from January 1st to abolish betting duty which has been in existence ever since betting shops were legalised. </p> <p> I have agreed that the tax on bookmakers' gross profits will be 15 per cent, which the leading bookmakers have agreed not to pass on to their customers. So by January 1st no one will have to pay a tax on their bets. </p> <p> For inheritance tax I propose to raise the allowance, so that no tax will be charged on estates up to almost a quarter of a million pounds, a threshold of 242,000. 96 per cent of estates will pay no tax. </p> <p> I turn to tax and benefit policy for families. </p> <p> A policy that puts families first in the tax and benefit system insists that - as the Beveridge Report said in 1942 - nothing should be done to remove from parents the responsibility of maintaining their children but it is in the national interest to help parents discharge their responsibility properly. Our vision of the future of the tax system for families with children is to support all families; to give most help at the time they need it most; and to give more help to the families who need it most. So freed of poverty, every child has the best start in life. And consistent with our support for independent taxation of individual income, our vision for the integration of the tax and benefit system for families is that support should be based on family income, the basis of the new integrated child credit. </p> <p> By 1997 support for children had fallen in real terms by 6 per cent since 1979 as child benefit was frozen; there was no recognition at all of the needs of children in the tax system; as a result families with children had incomes 30 per cent lower than families without children; and child poverty had trebled. </p> <p> So first we made radical improvements in child benefit which is paid to all 7.5 million families with children. </p> <p> Child benefit in 1997 was only eleven pounds five pence a week, or 575 pounds a year. </p> <p> From April child benefit will be fifteen pounds fifty a week, 806 pounds a year. </p> <p> But of course we realise that fifteen pounds fifty is too small a recognition of family needs for most families and that it is totally wrong if the tax system contains no allowance for the needs and costs of bringing up children. </p> <p> So in addition to child benefit the new children's tax credit is being introduced on April 6th. </p> <p> And after consultation I have decided that our new children's tax credit will be paid not at eight pounds fifty a week or 442 pounds a year - as originally proposed - but it will be paid at 10 pounds a week, 520 pounds a year. </p> <p> For families on average earnings this is worth more than a two and a half pence cut in the basic rate of income tax. </p> <p> With the children's tax credit five million families who received only eleven pounds a week in 1997 for the first child now receive up to twenty five pounds fifty a week, an increase from 575 pounds a year to one thousand three hundred and twenty pounds per family. </p> <p> With this major change in our tax system, financial support for families with children has never been higher. </p> <p> We know also that greatest help should be there when children are youngest; the time when family income tends to fall as family costs rise. </p> <p> We can do more to help mothers and fathers balance work and family responsibilities. </p> <p> Indeed, we want to make it easier for mothers to make the choice to stay at home after their child is born and for much longer than previously. </p> <p> I can announce that following the maternity review set up in last year's Budget under the leadership of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, maternity pay which is 60 pounds will be increased in successive stages to 75 pounds next year and the year after to 100 pounds a week, as big a rise in two years as in the previous forty. </p> <p> We will also legislate so that, at the same time as the 100 pounds is introduced, the statutory obligation to maternity pay will be raised from 18 weeks to 26 weeks. </p> <p> And at a cost of 30 million pounds I will extend the help small and medium sized employers receive for administering the scheme. </p> <p> Parents who adopt will for the first time receive similar benefits. </p> <p> And we will introduce two weeks paid paternity leave, set at the same level of 100 pounds, paid for by the Government, with further details of this and other measures to be announced by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. </p> <p> For the first year of a child's life, I propose a further innovation. </p> <p> From April next year for families with new-born children, the children's tax credit will be set at an even higher level and paid up the income scale to all households where the main earner earns up to 50,000 pounds a year. </p> <p> I propose to set this children's credit at over 1,000 pounds a year, worth 20 pounds a week. </p> <p> And I will ensure that this 1000 pounds baby credit will be continued and will be paid to the mother when the new integrated child credit comes in, in 2003. </p> <p> So to summarise these changes: families receiving the higher children's credit and maternity pay will be up to two thousand two hundred and forty pounds better off. </p> <p> Our ambition for Britain is that every child has the best start in life. When we came into power, one child in every three in our country was in poverty. While child benefit starts at fifteen pounds fifty for all families, the maximum rate of support for children will go as high as 51 pounds a week, a rise of 23 pounds a week since 1997. The income support child credit will rise by one pound fifty a week, the Sure Start maternity grant will be set at 500 pounds, helping to take more than 1.2 million children out of poverty this Parliament as we work to cut child poverty in half by 2010 on the road to its abolition. </p> <p> For the sake of every family in the country we must and will do more to fight drugs. For too long in too many communities we have fought a war against drugs which drugs have won so I have a further spending announcement. Next week the Home Secretary working with the Minister for the Cabinet Office will announce a new three year budget of over 200 million pounds. To every one of the country's 350 partnerships against crime and disorder, direct payments averaging half a million pounds and up to one million pounds will be made straight to police commanders and anti drugs leaders. Similar funds will be available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p> <p> This war against drugs will never be won by Government alone but can only be won neighbourhood by neighbourhood across the country, so further resources will be announced to support a new anti drugs campaign involving prominent figures from the world of business and sports to mobilise communities against drugs. </p> <p> Mr Deputy Speaker I come to the next set of budget judgements. </p> <p> Our success in cutting debt and unemployment and rising economic growth have permitted us - while locking in our tough fiscal stance - to release four billions a year more for our priorities. </p> <p> And after the decisions already announced I can still go further. </p> <p> The Government could choose to pay off more debt, but we have already paid off 34 billion pounds this year.<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447983,00.html\">Budget speech continued...</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>In detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">Main points</a></p> <p><b>Reaction</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">07.02.2001: Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Part two of Budget speech Already with the New Deal lone parent employment has increased by one hundred thousand, on the road to our goal of seventy per cent employment for lone parents. From next month at a total cost of one hundred million pounds next year we will enhance the choices on offer to include not only full and part time jobs and training but an offer of self employment, in all cases accompanied by help for child care. In return the Government has decided that from next year all lone parents on income support including parents with children under five will be required to undertake interviews about work choices at regular intervals. And in the new economy people already in work constantly need to improve their skills. Britain cannot succeed when up to thirty per cent of employees do not have the basic level two qualifications. Here too employers, employees and Government all have a role to play. For our part we are prepared to examine radical new options. To back up the tax relief we offer for employee training, we are prepared to consider how best we can help employers meet their responsibilities, including the case for a new tax credit. If we are to reach our long term employment goal we must also do more to reward work. Our vision of the future of the tax system for work is of one that by integrating low starting rates of tax and targeted tax credits makes work pay, brings more people into work and moves us towards our goal of full employment. This Government introduced the first ever national minimum wage and it is this Government which has this week raised the minimum wage as of October this year from \u00a33.70 an hour to \u00a34.10 an hour and then, next year, subject to economic conditions, to \u00a34.20. Today I can go further and announce that for all families on the Working Families Tax Credit there will be a rise from June this year of five pounds a week. This takes the hourly minimum rate for those on the working families tax credit not just to \u00a34.10 an hour but to \u00a36.40 an hour. When we first announced the Working Families Tax Credit the minimum family income for full time work was 180 pounds a week. This year the minimum will be 225 pounds a week, or eleven thousand seven hundred pounds a year. And as part of our programme to ensure new disability rights I can announce that in addition to a new guaranteed minimum income for a severely disabled person on benefit of 142 pounds a week, for those in full time work the Disabled Person's Tax Credit will also be raised from June this year by 5 pounds a week to guarantee a minimum weekly family income of 250 pounds. To help parents into work I have also decided to pay working families more towards the costs of childcare. In addition to the childcare places being created for one million children, the child care tax credit will, from June, pay up to 70 per cent of child care costs up to - instead of 100 pounds a week as now - 135 pounds a week for one child and - instead of 150 pounds a week - up to 200 pounds a week for two or more children, another step in our plan to place affordable child care within the reach of all working families who need it. I turn to other measures that will help hard working families. I can announce that for the coming financial year we will freeze all rates of car vehicle excise duty. Having completed our consultation on new duty rates, I will now move ahead with the proposal to extend the 55 pounds reduction on the standard licence fee from all cars up to 1200 cc to all cars up to and including 1.5 litres. This will include for example Escorts, Astras, Micras and Rover Metros, in total an extra 5 million cars. This reduction, to be implemented in July, will be backdated to November last year. In total 9 million cars up to I.5 litres will pay 55 pounds less. From this month also for all newly purchased cars, a new four band vehicle excise duty rewards the most environmentally friendly vehicles. 70 per cent of all new cars will now enjoy a reduced licence fee. Since last November, lorry owners have already received rebates for up to half of this year's licence fee, a total of 220 million pounds. And following our Pre-Budget consultation and at a cost of 300 million pounds a year we will sweep aside the 100 separate lorry licence rates, consolidate them into seven rate bands - linked to environmental standards and set in consultation with the industry - cutting the rates to match the lowest in Europe. For the lorries used most for international haulage the fee reduction will mean savings on the old rate of between one thousand five hundred pounds and two thousand one hundred pounds a year. Around 115 thousand vehicles will save over 1,000 pounds. And next month we will abolish vehicle excise duty on all tractors. Transport spending is set to rise by 20 per cent a year over the next three years, as we take forward our ten year plan of \u00a3180 billion private and public investment. In November 1999 I announced the Government's new approach to the fuel escalator, first introduced by the previous Government in 1993, and which by 2010 will have secured a reduction in carbon dioxide pollution of one to two and a half million tonnes. As I stated in the Pre-Budget Report: this year we will not proceed with the annual inflation rise in petrol tax that has been the norm on Budget day. After consultation on my Pre-Budget Report I am able to confirm further changes. In addition to the 1 pence cut in ultra low sulphur petrol last October, the duty on ultra low sulphur petrol will be further cut by 2 pence litre. To make sure all motorists can benefit from this 2 pence cut I will extend it to unleaded petrol until June 14th: when the industry says ultra low sulphur petrol will be 100 per cent available. The 2 pence cut for both ultra low sulphur and unleaded petrol will take effect at 6 pm tonight. Lead replacement petrol will also be cut - by a further 2 pence per litre. And because it is right to maintain the proper balance in the tax treatment of petrol and diesel I propose to match the cut in low sulphur petrol with a cut in excise duties in ultra low sulphur diesel for all diesel users of 3 pence a litre, to take effect from 6.00 pm this evening. The Pre-Budget Report launched the green fuel challenge: with industry invited to submit plans for new, more environmentally friendly fuels. I can announce that duty will be cut radically on alternative fuels - a further 6 pence per kilogramme duty cut on road fuel gases with effect from 6.00 pm tonight and from next April a 20 pence duty cut for bio-diesel. To allow this new industry to plan ahead, duty on road fuel gases will be frozen in real terms until 2004. We cannot achieve the Kyoto targets and our goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent without the climate change levy which, with April's simultaneous cut in employers national insurance, brings no additional revenues to Government but which will cut carbon emissions by 5 million tonnes by 2010. To reward businesses investing in energy saving improvements, the Government is publishing this month the list of technologies that will qualify for 100 per cent tax relief and later this year we will launch a green technology challenge offering this 100 per cent tax relief to companies investing in the next generation of environmental technologies. As previously announced, the landfill tax will rise from 11 pounds per tonne to 12 pounds per tonne. I turn to the other excise duties. Last year I froze duties on spirits. This year an inflation rise would push the price of whisky up by 11 pence a bottle. Because of the competitive position of the industry I will this year continue to freeze duty on whisky and on all spirits. And this year I propose to go further and freeze duty on wine and on beer. Beyond the normal inflation rise of 6 pence, I will not go ahead with any real terms rise in cigarette taxes. Following our consultation with the betting and gaming industry over the impact of internet trading, I have decided from January 1st to abolish betting duty which has been in existence ever since betting shops were legalised. I have agreed that the tax on bookmakers' gross profits will be 15 per cent, which the leading bookmakers have agreed not to pass on to their customers. So by January 1st no one will have to pay a tax on their bets. For inheritance tax I propose to raise the allowance, so that no tax will be charged on estates up to almost a quarter of a million pounds, a threshold of 242,000. 96 per cent of estates will pay no tax. I turn to tax and benefit policy for families. A policy that puts families first in the tax and benefit system insists that - as the Beveridge Report said in 1942 - nothing should be done to remove from parents the responsibility of maintaining their children but it is in the national interest to help parents discharge their responsibility properly. Our vision of the future of the tax system for families with children is to support all families; to give most help at the time they need it most; and to give more help to the families who need it most. So freed of poverty, every child has the best start in life. And consistent with our support for independent taxation of individual income, our vision for the integration of the tax and benefit system for families is that support should be based on family income, the basis of the new integrated child credit. By 1997 support for children had fallen in real terms by 6 per cent since 1979 as child benefit was frozen; there was no recognition at all of the needs of children in the tax system; as a result families with children had incomes 30 per cent lower than families without children; and child poverty had trebled. So first we made radical improvements in child benefit which is paid to all 7.5 million families with children. Child benefit in 1997 was only eleven pounds five pence a week, or 575 pounds a year. From April child benefit will be fifteen pounds fifty a week, 806 pounds a year. But of course we realise that fifteen pounds fifty is too small a recognition of family needs for most families and that it is totally wrong if the tax system contains no allowance for the needs and costs of bringing up children. So in addition to child benefit the new children's tax credit is being introduced on April 6th. And after consultation I have decided that our new children's tax credit will be paid not at eight pounds fifty a week or 442 pounds a year - as originally proposed - but it will be paid at 10 pounds a week, 520 pounds a year. For families on average earnings this is worth more than a two and a half pence cut in the basic rate of income tax. With the children's tax credit five million families who received only eleven pounds a week in 1997 for the first child now receive up to twenty five pounds fifty a week, an increase from 575 pounds a year to one thousand three hundred and twenty pounds per family. With this major change in our tax system, financial support for families with children has never been higher. We know also that greatest help should be there when children are youngest; the time when family income tends to fall as family costs rise. We can do more to help mothers and fathers balance work and family responsibilities. Indeed, we want to make it easier for mothers to make the choice to stay at home after their child is born and for much longer than previously. I can announce that following the maternity review set up in last year's Budget under the leadership of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, maternity pay which is 60 pounds will be increased in successive stages to 75 pounds next year and the year after to 100 pounds a week, as big a rise in two years as in the previous forty. We will also legislate so that, at the same time as the 100 pounds is introduced, the statutory obligation to maternity pay will be raised from 18 weeks to 26 weeks. And at a cost of 30 million pounds I will extend the help small and medium sized employers receive for administering the scheme. Parents who adopt will for the first time receive similar benefits. And we will introduce two weeks paid paternity leave, set at the same level of 100 pounds, paid for by the Government, with further details of this and other measures to be announced by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. For the first year of a child's life, I propose a further innovation. From April next year for families with new-born children, the children's tax credit will be set at an even higher level and paid up the income scale to all households where the main earner earns up to 50,000 pounds a year. I propose to set this children's credit at over 1,000 pounds a year, worth 20 pounds a week. And I will ensure that this 1000 pounds baby credit will be continued and will be paid to the mother when the new integrated child credit comes in, in 2003. So to summarise these changes: families receiving the higher children's credit and maternity pay will be up to two thousand two hundred and forty pounds better off. Our ambition for Britain is that every child has the best start in life. When we came into power, one child in every three in our country was in poverty. While child benefit starts at fifteen pounds fifty for all families, the maximum rate of support for children will go as high as 51 pounds a week, a rise of 23 pounds a week since 1997. The income support child credit will rise by one pound fifty a week, the Sure Start maternity grant will be set at 500 pounds, helping to take more than 1.2 million children out of poverty this Parliament as we work to cut child poverty in half by 2010 on the road to its abolition. For the sake of every family in the country we must and will do more to fight drugs. For too long in too many communities we have fought a war against drugs which drugs have won so I have a further spending announcement. Next week the Home Secretary working with the Minister for the Cabinet Office will announce a new three year budget of over 200 million pounds. To every one of the country's 350 partnerships against crime and disorder, direct payments averaging half a million pounds and up to one million pounds will be made straight to police commanders and anti drugs leaders. Similar funds will be available for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This war against drugs will never be won by Government alone but can only be won neighbourhood by neighbourhood across the country, so further resources will be announced to support a new anti drugs campaign involving prominent figures from the world of business and sports to mobilise communities against drugs. Mr Deputy Speaker I come to the next set of budget judgements. Our success in cutting debt and unemployment and rising economic growth have permitted us - while locking in our tough fiscal stance - to release four billions a year more for our priorities. And after the decisions already announced I can still go further. The Government could choose to pay off more debt, but we have already paid off 34 billion pounds this year.

      "body": "<p><strong>STANLEY VICTOR COLLYMORE 1989 - 2001</strong></p> <p>Since our stakeout of Luton airport only two months ago, the Fiver has made many friends in the world of air travel. Hostesses, grizzled pilots, baggage handlers, some fella who used to be mates with the cousin of Jeremy off of Airport, we know the lot. So when we got a tip-off that Stanley Victor Collymore had returned to the country in high dudgeon pulling umpteen suitcases through Heathrow airport, our ears pricked up.</p> <p>And for good reason too, it seems. According to a statement released through his spokesman, Stanley has retired from the beautiful game at the age of 30 to \"spend as much time as possible with his family\". A two-month spell at Spanish side Real Oviedo which mustered only three appearances as substitute was the final chapter in a career which stirred up more controversy than most Neil Morrisseys manage in a lifetime.

Hostesses, grizzled pilots, baggage handlers, some fella who used to be mates with the cousin of Jeremy off of Airport, we know the lot. So when we got a tip-off that Stanley Victor Collymore had returned to the country in high dudgeon pulling umpteen suitcases through Heathrow airport, our ears pricked up. And for good reason too, it seems. According to a statement released through his spokesman, Stanley has retired from the beautiful game at the age of 30 to \"spend as much time as possible with his family\". A two-month spell at Spanish side Real Oviedo which mustered only three appearances as substitute was the final chapter in a career which stirred up more controversy than most Neil Morrisseys manage in a lifetime. Stanley leaves behind seven clubs, a chunky wage packet, and an untidy bedroom. Such is the enigmatic nature of the man that, even this afternoon, Oviedo officials were denying that Stanley had returned home for any other reason than to visit his pregnant girlfriend. \"He has to check all things and then he will come back,\" said general manager Felix Ortega. \"At this stage you have to believe your player. I personally spoke to him last night and he was very worried. I could tell from the tone of his voice, I don't think he's lying.\" D'oh.

Clark says \u00a310million offer might tempt a sale. 1995 Manchester United fail in New Year signing bid, settling instead for \u00a37million Andy Cole. In February Collymore acquitted of assault charge for alleged fight outside nightclub. Scores season's total of 25 goals (22 League), including 10 in last two months, as Forest finish third in Premiership and qualify for UEFA Cup. First England cap against Japan on June 3 and second as a substitute against Brazil. Joins Liverpool for British record \u00a38.5million. 1996 Makes 44 appearances in his first season at Anfield and scores 19 goals as Liverpool finish third in the Premiership. Scores the winner in a memorable 4-3 victory over Newcastle meaning the Magpies finish as runners-up to Manchester United. As new season kicks off, Collymore still commutes from his West Midlands home to Merseyside, and finds competition for his first team place from Czech Republic striker Patrik Berger. Aston Villa reported to have failed in a \u00a36million bid for Collymore. Fined \u00a320,000 for not attending training but Liverpool boss Roy Evans says Collymore will be staying even though he fails to play a reserve team fixture. 1997 Better form sees Collymore called up to the England squad to play Mexico in a Wembley friendly. Finishes season having made 37 appearances and scored 16 goals. May 13: Joins Villa in a \u00a37million deal. October: Sent off and given a three-match ban after exchanging blows with Bolton defender Andy Todd. Undergoes nose operation to cure a breathing problem. 1998 March: Accuses Liverpool's Steve Harkness of racist abuse during and after Villa's 2-1 home victory. PFA forced to step in as neither player backs down. Both shake hands as they agree to disagree. June: Involved in an altercation with girlfriend and television presenter Ulrika Jonsson in a bar in Paris. Via a statement from his agent, Collymore \"deeply regrets everything that occurred\" and \"is beside himself with remorse\" before publicly apologising. September: Collymore scores a hat-trick in Villa's UEFA Cup win over Stromsgodset. 1999 January: Collymore announces that he is seeking counselling for troubles in his private life, and spends two weeks in a clinic to undergo treatment for depression. February: Returns to Villa side against Leeds. After 3-0 home defeat by Chelsea, Villa boss John Gregory admits he will not pick Collymore again this season as he needs full-time treatment for his depression. June: Collymore has talks with Greek club Panathinaikos but a proposed deal falls through. August: Starts the season with a three-month loan at Fulham, with a view to a \u00a31m permanent deal. But Collymore and Fulham fail to agree terms and he returns to Villa. December: Collymore talks over a move to French club Montpellier but the deal is off when Collymore refuses to play in a practice match. 2000 February: Bradford end their interest in Collymore because they refuse to pay a \u00a33million transfer fee. Leicester sign Collymore on an incentive-based pay-as-you-play deal. February 16: Leicester are thrown out of their La Manga training base after Collymore is accused of letting off a fire extinguisher in a bar. The Spanish resort's bosses ordered the team to leave after the incident. February 17: Fined two weeks' wages for letting off the fire extinguisher and warned about future conduct. Collymore is also required to undertake additional community duties for deserving causes in Leicestershire at the direction of manager Martin O'Neill. The former England international and all the Leicester players are told to pay all costs of the trip, and additional air fares will be paid for by the players. A hotel bill of \u00a3700 for damage to the bar area will also be paid by the players. March: Collymore scores a hat-trick on his home debut for Leicester in the 5-2 victory over Sunderland. April: Breaks left leg in the 17th minute of the 3-0 defeat at Derby. August: Scores first goal after his horrific injury in a 3-0 friendly win at Wycombe. Targets an England recall, citing Paul Gascoigne as an example of a player who is still on the fringe of international recognition in his 30s. September: The FA confirm that their video advisory panel will meet to review Collymore's tangle with Gascoigne in the Premiership clash with Everton, when the Leicester striker appeared to stamp on - and later elbow - Gascoigne. October 2: Leicester officially accept Collymore's transfer request on the same day that the player is charged with violent conduct by the FA following the clash with Gascoigne. October 29: Scores on his Bradford debut as they draw 1-1 with Leeds at Valley Parade. November 28: Handed three-match ban by FA disciplinary committee over his attack on Gascoigne. 2001 January: Told he can leave Bradford by new boss Jim Jefferies. January 31: Signs an 18-month contract with Spanish side Real Oviedo. February 2: Makes his debut as a second-half substitute during the 1-0 defeat at Las Palmas and after another appearance from the bench, Collymore is dropped from the squad to face Real Zaragoza after coach Raddy Antic decided the striker was not fit enough to play. March 6: Announces his retirement from professional football.",

Most digital cameras allow you to adjust the image size and quality depending on whether you want to print your photographs or email them.

On average, an 8Mb memory card can hold around 20 images, depending on the scene you're photographing and the quality setting used.

I have no quarrel with her, but I somehow doubt whether the Center for Gender and Education that her $12.5m is funding will untangle the somewhat confusing thoughts underpinning her generosity. Why a centre at Harvard? Because it installed the first chair of gender studies in the heartland of the Ivy League, a post occupied by Professor Carol Gilligan.</p> <p>Gilligan was an overnight celebrity feminist nearly 20 years ago. Voted Woman of the Year by Ms magazine in 1984, and gracing the cover of Newsweek, she used her psychological expertise to argue that women's moral development is distinct from that of men - different, and more desirable. Pace Thatcher, Widdecombe and Baroness Jay, women are more compassionate in their moral reasoning, less confident, dogmatic and prone to abstractions or the espousal of universal causes than men.</p> <p>Since then, Gilligan has mined a seam that has uncovered the damage inflicted on adolescent girls in the US. Her work has de scribed how girls' confidence is undermined as they conform to gender scripts that silence the wisdom once acquired from earlier maternal attachments. Fonda was drawing directly on Gilligan's research when she told her Harvard audience that girls, \"bright-eyed and bushy-tailed\" at nine, are self-censoring and vague at 13 - despite increasing academic success. So is it, as Gilligan suggests (in tension with her own account of women's recoil from abstract thought), social pressure that undermines the wisdom that girls acquire at their mother's knee? This leaves Fonda a little muddled: \"It's in my DNA. The ways girls internalise and express the difficulty of growing up, that all happened to me.\" Even in these days of fantastic genetic hype, we have yet to locate the DNA responsible for the tales our mothers tell us, at odds with other feminine stereotypes.</p> <p>Fonda's enthusiasm for Gilligan is itself perplexing, for Fonda is concerned, primarily, with boys. \"Men suffer more\" from the strictures of gender, Fonda told the New York Times. They are twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with the psychiatric illness, attention deficit hyper- activity disorder (ADHD), which is held responsible for making them aggressive and disruptive. These boys are now treated with Ritalin (and recent alternatives, Adderall or Dextrostat). Here, Fonda under- estimates the trouble with boys. Nine out of 10 children diagnosed with ADHD are boys, and prescriptions to pacify their antisocial behaviour have risen sevenfold in the US over the past decade. Contrary to popular perception, the drug is not new. What is new - and controversial - is the psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Despite its side-effects (depression, lethargy and sleep disruption), prescriptions for Ritalin in Britain have jumped an astonishing 40-fold in five years: from 4,000 in 1994 to 157,900 in 1999. Where were all those boys suffering from this illness a decade ago?</p> <p>Despite three decades of research on gender identities and differences, we have little agreement on how to understand them. Ironically, the problems with boys have strictly mirrored our attention to them. Men's studies and research on masculinity, like ADHD itself, rocketed in the 1990s. There are many alternative explanations for \"bad\", \"mad\" or \"sad\" boys, with just a little overlap.</p> <p>The first, favoured by lawful drug dispensers, is that we are reluctant to recognise brain diseases. This is the argument proposed by Rolf Stahel, heading Shire Pharmaceuticals in the UK; meanwhile, profits of his company have increased by a factor of 177 in the last few years. Another explanation is that a diet of junk food causes children to ingest too much sulphur dioxide. Linked to ideas of \"poor parenting\", this accompanies the old trend of blaming working mothers. A third approach suggests that today's extraordinarily market-driven, work-oriented culture dislikes children - especially boys who seem harder to settle into the routines of nursery or school care, demanding attention from exhausted parents. A fourth account highlights the pressures on boys to compete and prove their masculine credentials of toughness and aggression. The final explanation, of course, comes from the dictates of hormones and DNA: it's the testosterone, stupid.</p> <p>Given the billions already spent since the 1960s mapping the cognitive and emotional differences between the sexes - differences that are robust, albeit small overall - let us pause for thought. Clearly something happens to some little boys in our society to make them extremely troubled and troublesome. It does not happen to the majority of them, who still do as well as girls in school and fare far better in later life. In the US, it is only in families earning under $30,000 that a startling two-thirds of those reaching higher education are women. A staggering 80% of poor black American males will manage only to acquire criminal convictions. In Britain, although ADHD is said to affect all classes, it is far more prevalent among the poor. Serious behavioural problems among boys tend to appear along with the birth of younger siblings. Why male? Why black? Why poor? Why in expanding families?</p> <p>A few things are certain. If anyone ever suffered from learning difficulties, ADHD and ineducability, it was two high-achieving Liverpool boys, now taking their A-levels, with clear career ambitions. They are not on Ritalin. How sad is it that as troubled pubescent boys, from poor northern families, their route to improvement was via the torture and murder of a toddler? No wonder James Bulger's parents cannot recover from their grief. Any children of their own are unlikely to enjoy similar \"success\".</p> <p>Without question, whatever else we want to factor in, poverty and inequality feeds the tensions that boys face as they know themselves in school to be only \"failures\", as they live in families with either hard-working or despairing parents. These are parents who in turn fear they are failing those children whom they just might have loved better had they had the time, the money, the social respect of which the still-widening inequalities of our society deprive them. State funding for parental leave when children most need attention would be one tiny start. The majority of working parents cannot afford time whatever their need.</p> <p>Dear Hanoi Jane: please return to the broader political fray. Study masculinity by all means. But do not imagine that you will help those boys suffering most simply by uncovering more gender cliche.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Lynne Segal is professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College, London.</p>",

Nine out of 10 children diagnosed with ADHD are boys, and prescriptions to pacify their antisocial behaviour have risen sevenfold in the US over the past decade. Contrary to popular perception, the drug is not new. What is new - and controversial - is the psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Despite its side-effects (depression, lethargy and sleep disruption), prescriptions for Ritalin in Britain have jumped an astonishing 40-fold in five years: from 4,000 in 1994 to 157,900 in 1999. Where were all those boys suffering from this illness a decade ago? Despite three decades of research on gender identities and differences, we have little agreement on how to understand them. Ironically, the problems with boys have strictly mirrored our attention to them. Men's studies and research on masculinity, like ADHD itself, rocketed in the 1990s. There are many alternative explanations for \"bad\", \"mad\" or \"sad\" boys, with just a little overlap. The first, favoured by lawful drug dispensers, is that we are reluctant to recognise brain diseases. This is the argument proposed by Rolf Stahel, heading Shire Pharmaceuticals in the UK; meanwhile, profits of his company have increased by a factor of 177 in the last few years. Another explanation is that a diet of junk food causes children to ingest too much sulphur dioxide. Linked to ideas of \"poor parenting\", this accompanies the old trend of blaming working mothers. A third approach suggests that today's extraordinarily market-driven, work-oriented culture dislikes children - especially boys who seem harder to settle into the routines of nursery or school care, demanding attention from exhausted parents. A fourth account highlights the pressures on boys to compete and prove their masculine credentials of toughness and aggression. The final explanation, of course, comes from the dictates of hormones and DNA: it's the testosterone, stupid. Given the billions already spent since the 1960s mapping the cognitive and emotional differences between the sexes - differences that are robust, albeit small overall - let us pause for thought. Clearly something happens to some little boys in our society to make them extremely troubled and troublesome. It does not happen to the majority of them, who still do as well as girls in school and fare far better in later life. In the US, it is only in families earning under $30,000 that a startling two-thirds of those reaching higher education are women. A staggering 80% of poor black American males will manage only to acquire criminal convictions. In Britain, although ADHD is said to affect all classes, it is far more prevalent among the poor. Serious behavioural problems among boys tend to appear along with the birth of younger siblings. Why male? Why black? Why poor? Why in expanding families? A few things are certain. If anyone ever suffered from learning difficulties, ADHD and ineducability, it was two high-achieving Liverpool boys, now taking their A-levels, with clear career ambitions. They are not on Ritalin. How sad is it that as troubled pubescent boys, from poor northern families, their route to improvement was via the torture and murder of a toddler? No wonder James Bulger's parents cannot recover from their grief. Any children of their own are unlikely to enjoy similar \"success\". Without question, whatever else we want to factor in, poverty and inequality feeds the tensions that boys face as they know themselves in school to be only \"failures\", as they live in families with either hard-working or despairing parents. These are parents who in turn fear they are failing those children whom they just might have loved better had they had the time, the money, the social respect of which the still-widening inequalities of our society deprive them. State funding for parental leave when children most need attention would be one tiny start. The majority of working parents cannot afford time whatever their need. Dear Hanoi Jane: please return to the broader political fray. Study masculinity by all means. But do not imagine that you will help those boys suffering most simply by uncovering more gender cliche. \u00b7 Lynne Segal is professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College, London.",

Madeleine, my nine-year-old daughter, hates being bored more than anything in the world. Boredom must be avoided at all costs. As far as she is concerned, my role in life is to entertain her. I might think that I am here to protect her from the Nigel Lythgows of the world, to work out exactly when she will be old enough for the rapping (or \"****ing\") of Eminem, and generally help prepare her for the delights and dangers of the world. I might hope that I am helping her to spell the word \"beautiful\" correctly, to see the benefits of a fairly early bedtime, and to appreciate that a brush - tooth or hair - can be a benefit in life. I might believe that I am here to improve her mind. But as far as Madeleine is concerned, I am mostly here to play with her, to keep her from being bored. And the only way to do that is to be a nine-year-old girl. </p> <p>Being bored seems to mean having to think about, you know, things. It's difficult enough having to think about things as an adult, let alone as a nine-year-old girl. You don't really want to do it, unless you have learned, in a Zen sort of way, to appreciate these things, and see that they can be a way to calm rather than panic. </p> <p>Believe me, speaking as a nine-year-old girl, I have to have things to do . I must not be bored, otherwise I have this strange urge to tear my hair out and scream at my mum. Banging the walls can be cool, too. If I'd heard of Nirvana, I'd be screaming at the top of my voice: \"Entertain me!\" </p> <p>As a nine-year-old boy, which I was once, before I was a nine-year-old girl, I could spend hours on my own kicking a ball around in the garden. That stopped me thinking things, apart from things to do with the World Cup. Madeleine needs a lot more than that to get her through an hour: some telly, a manic game of cards, a few seconds on the jigsaw puzzle she got for Christmas, a quick read. A look at her current favourite comic, Sabrina's Secrets, which features Sabrina the teenage witch helping nine-year-old kids to paint their nails and plait their hair. The TV ad for the comic promised it would banish boredom for ever. To give the comic credit, it does occupy Maddy for a good 20 minutes - which is like a nine-year-old forever. I suffer 43-year-old shock that the comic costs \u00a32.50. How boring is that ? For me, a comic is always going to be sixpence. Six old pence. </p> <p>After Sabrina's crucial sleepover tips comes a blast of PlayStation, a form of relaxation that seems to prepare young children for a future as a machine. Eventually, she'll make an attempt at some homework. </p> <p>Boredom is a fate even worse than fractions. Maddy think's it's seven-eighths of her problem. Or maybe nine-elevenths. </p> <p>As a nine-year-old girl, I play along as much as I can, until I'm forced to admit that, as a 43-year-old man, there is a tendency for what keeps Madeleine's boredom at bay to magnify mine. She plays Spyro the Dragon on PlayStation (he's the cute, flying, purple one), and achieves a non-thinking bliss. In the end, I panic that I am Bad Dad for letting Maddy play the Sony boredom-buster, and I try to stop her. We have a pathetic argument; the kind of argument two nine-year-old girls tend to have. </p> <p>We make up over a game of chess, and my panic subsides as I realise that the purple dragon hasn't yet ruined Maddy's ability with the knight. Maddy takes one of my pawns with her knight and, in my 43-year-old mind, I imagine Eminem in an Adidas suit of armour sinking a \"****ing\" sword into the \"****ing\" heart of the soft purple dragon.

      "body": "<p>A couple of years back I did something really uncool: I moved back in with Mum and Dad. It has taken a while to reconcile. Moving back in with your parents can be just as traumatic as moving out in the first place - and as satisfying (assuming you share a healthy relationship with your folks). </p> <p>After moving out at 18, I lived with students, friends, strangers - even expeditionaries in the Zimbabwean bush. Later, I bought a house and lived on my own for several years. I was single and independent, and I loved it. I could do as I pleased. Friends from around the world stayed in my cosy abode. I had fantastic parties - life was dandy. </p> <p>Then things changed. I embarked on a scriptwriting career. I sat for days on end at the PC, no longer the social butterfly of previous years. As I steered a precious script through the hellish corridors of the British film industry, my smile gave way to a constant frown. </p> <p>At the same time, my mother was diagnosed with severe thyroid problems. Dynamic by nature, she now began gaining weight at an alarming rate and falling asleep at the most unlikely moments. I worried for the both of us. </p> <p>It was a moment of clarity. I was tired of battling the world single-handedly. I was in no state to embark on a relationship, but no longer wanted to live with friends. I needed to experience some mutual tender loving care - it was time to go home. </p> <p>\"Can I move in?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Pack your bags right now,\" my mother responded. Dad was equally delighted: he needed a drinking partner and hoped that the food standards at home would improve. </p> <p>I had huge reservations. The interior decor alone was enough to cause distress. Bright red carpet, garish lighting, out-of-date wallpaper: I was used to wooden floorboards, stylish Mediterranean hues, ambience. </p> <p>Space, at least, was not an issue: I could have three rooms. All four siblings are married with children and have homes of their own. I had a separate phone line installed. </p> <p>Accustomed to the hubbub of cosmopolitan city life, I was moving into the suburbs. Nights were silent and foxes instead of drunks prowled the streets. The neighbours were mostly white and middle-aged. </p> <p>But there are excellent regular meals; tea in bed. Life has a healthier rhythm. Your identity becomes stronger as you get a second chance to understand the two most precious people in your life. Suddenly, you are in context. No more long drunken nights talking bollocks with friends you'd rather not have. Priorities become clearer. </p> <p>Duties at first were tricky to establish: who was cooking and when? What about cleaning, cutting the grass? And was I really expected to provide entertainment for anyone and everyone who dropped in? My parents' home resembles a community centre. </p> <p>Then there are my nieces and nephews - all eight of them, ranging from eight months to eight years. Mum and dad look after the smaller ones; the older ones visit after school before their parents finish work. Trying to have a professional conversation on the phone after school hours can be tricky, as one of the children is liable to shout, \"Aunty Dolly, Simran needs his bum wiped!\" </p> <p>Violins, drums and the piano are practised by the kids - sometimes all at once. Otherwise, the cacophony can include the blare of Cartoon Network, a dodgy Asian cable channel, the dishwasher, a sewing machine and three phones ringing simultaneously. There are toys, shoes, coats and bikes strewn over the hallway. Stressed-out parents collecting the kids sit and share troubles. There is a lot of human traffic. </p> <p>An Indian friend once remarked: \"The problem with Indians is that they have no understanding of the individual.\" Trying to be alone is hard enough: kids want you to play, adults want you to chat, parents want you to get married. And all you want is to complete the latest script, read the book, listen to the radio - on your own. </p> <p>I tend to be the envy of many single women who have lived solo and complain that it's expensive, wasteful and lonely. Many confess they wish they were brave enough to do the same. Mature Asian men, who often come in for a lot of stick for never leaving home, wonder why I left in the first place. And then there are those who just don't get it. </p> <p>And what do my parents think? Sometimes that I'm still the sullen child of my adolescence; sometimes that I'm a pioneering single woman teaching, learning and growing within an extended family. </p> <p>Living at home with the parents is no bed of roses: moods have to be negotiated, and parents have to discover that they can learn from their children. Mine use olive oil now instead of ghee; brown bread instead of white; semi-skimmed instead of full-fat milk. Even their punctuality is improving. </p> <p>There are still times when you're heading out to party dressed to the nines, only to find that your security-conscious parents have locked the door at 9pm. When, in a bad mood at dinner, the only sound your ears amplify is that of your father sucking his food. Twice he's almost choked. Luckily, I'm qualified in first aid. </p> <p>Then again, I'll probably be sucking my food when I get to his age. <br><strong>Dolly Dhingra</strong></p> <p> I suppose the theory of rearing children is that you are bringing them up so that one day they can stand on their own. From the time you feel confident enough not to loom over the cot every 10 minutes, checking that they are still breathing, through a few hours at playgroup, a whole morning at nursery, to days away on school trips, it is a long, slow parting. </p> <p>I had my final parting with my sons when they left home to go to university. New lives, new homes for both of them. Rooms cleared of hi-fis, books, clothes, posters. That was it. Shut the door. Have a cry. Get over it. And I did. I got on with my life. A new me emerged. A me who rediscovered the joy of thinking about me. </p> <p>And then my sons came back. </p> <p>It is common enough. Many of my friends have grown-up children who have come home while they look for new jobs or recover from a broken relationship. My sister's son, over 30, lived with her after a hurtful divorce while his flat was being renovated. It bothered her that they might not, after so many years apart, get along. But the experience was affirming for both of them, and brought them closer. </p> <p>I belong to a generation that broke away from its parents, moved out early, lived a different life with different values. After I left, I only went back to visit. In fact, the deal was: \"You've made your bed; now lie in it.\" </p> <p>I desperately wanted my children to become my friends when they grew up. And they are. I think that I, and my friends, are more relaxed about the business of being young than our parents ever were. Maybe that's the problem. Our kids like being at home. </p> <p>Still, as part of the standing-on-your-own-two-feet business, I taught my sons to iron their shirts and to cook. If you feel, like I felt, that your children should master such simple chores, a word of warning: don't. They will only return to the nest and criticise you. I blush to confess that when my sons came home they cleared out my salad tray swamp. \"Did this used to be a lettuce?\" </p> <p>By the time they returned, my sons were better at household management than I have ever been. While they had been fending for themselves, I had been discovering the joys of self-indulgence. I left the loo door unlocked. I could wander about in whatever state of undress I wanted. I could eat an apple for supper. </p> <p>But now, as they filled the house with their new lives, mine got shoved aside. They left their new skills at the door, became my boys again. Except they were men now: independent, needing their own space. Football roared on the telly. The rooms were filled with the bass thump of their music. I started wearing headphones. Friends and girl friends came to stay. I was catering for the masses. For a few years, I had shopped for two; now I was heaping the trolley high again. The phone was occupied whenever I needed it. Editors and agents could not get through. I nearly had a heart attack when the BT envelope arrived. </p> <p>My younger son would dim the bathroom lights, surround the tub with scented candles and disappear to soak for hours. Lovey... but at two in the after noon , when his hard-pressed mother needed to get in for ordinary human purposes? </p> <p>Loo rolls disappeared. The fridge emptied daily. The laundry basket was piled high. They took coffee to their rooms and never returned the cups. There were shoes everywhere. If I complained about having to pick them up, they glared at me. </p> <p>Here we were, four people who loved each other dearly, choreographing new relationships, new routines. My sons had become used to doing as they pleased, but so had I. It must be one of life's hardest lessons to realise that your mother is also a person. But it is also hard to grasp the fact that your children don't need you any more. </p> <p>We came to new agreements. They helped with the laundry, the shopping and cooking and were content to phone friends after six in the evening. I put up with the football. And I quite liked Primal Scream anyway. </p> <p>Then, one at a time, they left again. One to New York, one to London. I drove them to the station. Said goodbye again. And, dammit, cried again. </p> <p>They phone. They email. Send little gifts. Do I worry? Oh yes. I miss them. But these are my children: give them their milk and let them go. <br><strong>Isla Dewar</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Isla Dewar's novel, Two Kinds of Wonderful (Review, \u00a36.99), is published in paperback this month.</p>",

I had my final parting with my sons when they left home to go to university. New lives, new homes for both of them. Rooms cleared of hi-fis, books, clothes, posters. That was it. Shut the door. Have a cry. Get over it. And I did. I got on with my life. A new me emerged. A me who rediscovered the joy of thinking about me. And then my sons came back. It is common enough. Many of my friends have grown-up children who have come home while they look for new jobs or recover from a broken relationship. My sister's son, over 30, lived with her after a hurtful divorce while his flat was being renovated. It bothered her that they might not, after so many years apart, get along. But the experience was affirming for both of them, and brought them closer. I belong to a generation that broke away from its parents, moved out early, lived a different life with different values. After I left, I only went back to visit. In fact, the deal was: \"You've made your bed; now lie in it.\" I desperately wanted my children to become my friends when they grew up. And they are. I think that I, and my friends, are more relaxed about the business of being young than our parents ever were. Maybe that's the problem. Our kids like being at home. Still, as part of the standing-on-your-own-two-feet business, I taught my sons to iron their shirts and to cook. If you feel, like I felt, that your children should master such simple chores, a word of warning: don't. They will only return to the nest and criticise you. I blush to confess that when my sons came home they cleared out my salad tray swamp. \"Did this used to be a lettuce?\" By the time they returned, my sons were better at household management than I have ever been. While they had been fending for themselves, I had been discovering the joys of self-indulgence. I left the loo door unlocked. I could wander about in whatever state of undress I wanted. I could eat an apple for supper. But now, as they filled the house with their new lives, mine got shoved aside. They left their new skills at the door, became my boys again. Except they were men now: independent, needing their own space. Football roared on the telly. The rooms were filled with the bass thump of their music. I started wearing headphones. Friends and girl friends came to stay. I was catering for the masses. For a few years, I had shopped for two; now I was heaping the trolley high again. The phone was occupied whenever I needed it. Editors and agents could not get through. I nearly had a heart attack when the BT envelope arrived. My younger son would dim the bathroom lights, surround the tub with scented candles and disappear to soak for hours. Lovey... but at two in the after noon , when his hard-pressed mother needed to get in for ordinary human purposes? Loo rolls disappeared. The fridge emptied daily. The laundry basket was piled high. They took coffee to their rooms and never returned the cups. There were shoes everywhere. If I complained about having to pick them up, they glared at me. Here we were, four people who loved each other dearly, choreographing new relationships, new routines. My sons had become used to doing as they pleased, but so had I. It must be one of life's hardest lessons to realise that your mother is also a person. But it is also hard to grasp the fact that your children don't need you any more. We came to new agreements. They helped with the laundry, the shopping and cooking and were content to phone friends after six in the evening. I put up with the football. And I quite liked Primal Scream anyway. Then, one at a time, they left again. One to New York, one to London. I drove them to the station. Said goodbye again. And, dammit, cried again. They phone. They email. Send little gifts. Do I worry? Oh yes. I miss them. But these are my children: give them their milk and let them go.

      "body": "<p><strong>Ages 0-3</strong></p> <p> <strong> 10 Minutes Till Bedtime by Peggy Rathmann (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</strong> </p> <p> Ten minutes is a lifetime when you are little and almost anything can happen. It certainly does in this surreal, almost wordless tale in which, as the countdown to bedtime begins, the house is invaded by a busload of hamsters arriving for the bedtime tour. They get everywhere, from the bathroom to bedroom. The great thing about this funny, odd little book is that it is so matter of fact in the way it presents a skewed reality. Neatly bridging the gap between reality and dream worlds, this book may encourage children to make a connection between their dream lives and their waking lives. At the very least, it will make them laugh and help them learn to count backwards from 10. The drawings are like detailed cartoons, busy and full of perceptive little touches that make this as enjoyable for adults as it is for children. </p> <p> <strong> Daisy and the Beastie by Jane Simmons (Orchard, \u00a34.99 )</strong><br> When Daisy the Duck's grandpa reads her and little Pip a story about the Beastie, Daisy is determined to find the Beastie for herself on their own farm. So it's off to the chickens to see if the Beastie is lurking there, and down to the barn in case the Beastie is with the cows and the sheep. But it turns out there is something nasty in the woodshed. Simmons's vivid picture book knows that it is the beasties you can't see that are the most frightening, and it soothes small fears by revealing the terrible, fearsome beastie to be two playful kittens. Cynical adults will know that this alliance between beak and claw cannot last into adulthood but children fall for this gentle story without fail. Best of all, the pictures have a direct quality that cleverly captures the intensity of the world as experienced through young, not-yet-jaded eyes. </p> <p><strong> Ages 4-7</strong></p> <p> <strong> Lady Lollipop by Dick King-Smith (Walker, \u00a33.99)</strong><br> Another porky tale from the creator of Babe. Princess Penelope is so spoiled that she is more like a pig than a child. But when she demands a pet pig for her birthday, and Lollipop and her friend Johnny arrive, everyone's perceptions about themselves and each other are transformed. With Lollipop around, everyone starts behaving better. Penelope is not quite such a spoiled little madam, the queen stops having hysterics and the king becomes happier. Jill Barton's perceptive black and white illustrations capture both porcine and human expressions brilliantly; you can always see the one in the other, and the resemblance of Queen Ethelwynne to our own monarch is staggering. Even if you don't buy the idea that pigs make the world a nicer place, under-eights will happily pig out on this delightful fairy tale.</p> <p><strong> The Road to Somewhere by Helen Armstrong (Orion, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p> Farmers are having a hard time at the moment, and they don't exactly get an easy ride in Armstrong's first novel. Cow, Woolly and Ratty run away from the farm when Cow overhears that she will soon be sent off in a truck never to return. Together the trio find that the outside world is a hard, cruel place. You could say that Armstrong takes a slightly sentimental view of animals - it is certainly an anthropomorphic one. But there are also some unsentimental truths in this deceptively simple story of courage, double-crossing and necessity that should stand any child in good stead for life in the playground. Armstrong writes well about how people and animals are sometimes both better and worse than they should be, and how sometimes it is only by taking a risk that you can find friendship and end up landing on your feet. </p> <p><strong>Ages 8-11</strong></p> <p> <strong> Secret Heart by David Almond (Hodder, \u00a310)</strong> <br> David Almond's books are strange, unsettling, wild things - unfettered by the normal restraints of children's literature. It is hard to say with any certainty what age group they are for; they are, like all great literature, beyond classification. In the village of Helmouth (a nasty, brutish place), Almond's hero Joe Maloney is an outcast, an untamed child who doesn't know the things he is supposed to know or think the thoughts that he is supposed to think. Teachers and truant officers despair of him; other children, intent on growing up tough, bully him; his mother simply loves him. Then the circus comes to town. In Corinna, who flies through the air, and Nancy Solo, who is blind but can see into people's hearts, Joe finds kindred souls. An exhilarating, though not always easy read for anyone who, like Joe, has tigers and larks in their hearts. </p> <p><strong> Half Magic by Edward Eager (Oxford University Press, \u00a34.99)</strong> <br> Last week the author of Horrid Henry, Francesca Simon, told us about her favourite childhood book: Edward Eager's Half Magic. Now this 1950s US classic is available here, and a good read it proves to be. The book acknowledges an enormous debt to E Nesbit's Five Children and It by combining fantasy and reality. It tells the story of Jane and her brother and sisters who have to survive summer while their mother works. Jane discovers a coin and soon the children realise that it fulfils wishes, or at least half-wishes. So in order to get what you want you must wish for twice as much as you actually need - a situation that often leads to double trouble. The moral may be that wishes need to be handled with care, but Eager weaves his story with such a fluent sense of fun that it slips in easily. </p> <p><strong> Ages 12+</strong></p> <p> <strong> Troy Ad\u00e8le Geras (Point, \u00a35.99)</strong> <br> Troy was a man's war, but in Ad\u00e8le Geras's rich tapestry of a novel events are told from a woman's point of view. Xanthe and Marpessa are sisters, servants in the royal palaces of a Troy that has been under siege for almost 10 years. Then both fall in love with the same young warrior, and soon the bonds of sisterhood and survival are stretched thin. Geras's tale is a beautiful, compassionate, sometimes sneakily humorous retelling of an age-old story that mixes the old with the new and, in the process, offers an entirely new perspective on the siege of Troy and its aftermath. </p> <p>Lending mythology a human face, this is a tale about human beings, not heroes, and about not the wisdom of the gods but their frailties. Written with a simple, urgent clarity, Troy makes for a truly excellent piece of epic storytelling. </p> <p><strong>Witch Hill by Marcus Sedgwick (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</strong> <br> The first distinctive thing about this pacy thriller are the author's own illustrations, a series of spiky woodcuts of a young girl accused of witchcraft. Marcus Sedgwick's writing doesn't quite have the same unsettling power, but it is still a page-turner: it tells the story of Jamie, survivor of the fire that saw his family home burned down, and who finds he is not out of danger when he goes to stay with his aunt and cousin in an unwelcoming village where the dark secrets of the past infect the present and Jamie's dreams. You can forgive the slight clumsiness in plotting as the book comes to a terrifying climax: you can almost smell the guilt and smoke as Jamie confronts what has happened. Not a sophisticated read, but it offers a glimpse into a more grown-up world for 12- and 13-year-olds. </p> <p>\u0095 Order any of the books featured in this month's Off the Shelf and have them delivered free first class.

If a war was to start on the initiation of the Arabs, in three hours we would have to fight right here in the knesset,\" he said. \"In four hours we would have to fight in Tel Aviv.\" Mr Ze'evi's elevation to the cabinet has caused shivers in Israel. The former major-general, who is 74, wants the 3m Palestinians expelled from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He considers Jordan part of Israel's birthright, and thinks that Israel's 1m Arab citizens should not be allowed to vote, because they do not serve in the army.

Mr Ze'evi, who founded the Moledet (homeland) party, seems flattered by the uproar. \"If they want to call me an extremist, I am an extremist,\" he said. \"It doesn't bother me.\" But he has his own misgivings, suspecting that Mr Sharon will back down from his promise to hang on to every Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Describing himself as the prime ministerial \"guard dog\", Mr Ze'evi will push for the invasion of Palestinian-ruled towns to end the uprising. To him, the hills outside his office are not just part of the West Bank which the Palestinians want for their state: they are the high ground from which the armies of Iraq, Syria and Libya would invade and wipe Israel off the map. He wants to cleanse the West Bank of Palestinians. \"The Arabs living in the West Bank and Gaza have to be transferred to their forefather's land,\" he said, adding that most Palestinians arrived as migrants during the last century.

The government has already sanctioned limited transfers of animals to slaughterhouses from areas unaffected by the virus. But the National Farmers' Union said it was pressing for licences to be granted in cases such as those where ewes and cows were trapped by the ban on the use of public roads. Meanwhile, the first horse-racing meeting for a week was being held today despite calls from a farming industry still in the grip of the crisis for the sport to be suspended. Racing was due to restart at Lingfield Park after a thorough review of the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food's risk assessment of the sport by the Jockey Club's chief veterinary adviser. However, the NFU president, Ben Gill, wrote to the racing authorities asking them not to resume meetings for at least the next seven days. Meanwhile, experts battling the crisis are focussing their efforts on Dartmoor, following a second suspected outbreak at the national park yesterday amid fears tens of thousands of animals there may have to be destroyed. Ministry veterinary experts were seeking to establish how the virus spread to Dartmoor but ruled out \"through the air\". The number of confirmed outbreaks in the United Kingdom reached 84 today after MAFF announced three new confirmed cases at sheep and cattle farms at Arthuret in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire, and Hilton in Derbyshire. In Europe, the fight against foot-and-mouth was stepped up yesterday as a day of talks in Brussels ended with the European Union banning all livestock markets in the 15 member states and restricting the movement of animals across EU borders. On the lambing issue, Tim Bennett, the NFU deputy president, said: \"It is the start of the lambing season and it is important that we get sheep closer back to base and in some instances to get them into sheds.

Russian television today showed gruesome footage of 25 of the bodies - three of them women - laid out in a converted warehouse in Grozny waiting for relatives to identify the dead. Many of the badly decayed bodies had been mutilated. Some have razor wounds to their head and shoulders. Most of the dead had their arms bound together with rope before their death and many were blindfolded; some bodies bear the traces of gunshot wounds.</p> <p>The Memorial report has confirmed that several of those individuals already identified went missing at the end of last year, shortly after being detained by the Russian military. Oleg Orlov, director of Memorial (founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov), examined the corpses in the Grozny morgue and claimed that they were the victims of unauthorised punishments handed out by the Russian military outside the framework of the law. He concluded that they represented \"incontrovertible proof of war crimes by the Russian forces\".</p> <p>Mr Orlov said that his organisation had long expected to discover such a dumping ground for dead bodies because of mounting disquiet over disappearing citizens. Human Rights Watch has echoed his concerns. \"We have established a clear pattern of cases when people 'disappear' in the custody of Russian troops,\" a spokeswoman said. \"The discovery of this mass grave is very alarming.\"</p> <p>Russian officials have given contradictory explanations for the presence of the corpses. They claimed initially that the dead were rebel fighters (killed up to a year ago at a time when fighting was active in the region) and later that the bodies were rebels killed by their own side in internal guerrilla disputes.</p> <p>A doctor working for Memorial concluded after inspecting the bodies that the majority of them were between one and four months old - killed long after the Russian forces declared Grozny and surrounding villages under its control.</p> <p>\"It seems unlikely that Chechen fighters would have hidden their dead in a region so close to the Russian military headquarters,\" Mr Orlov said. The investigation of military medical experts was severely impeded by the shortage of equipment in Grozny, he added. Doctors have complained that they do not even have enough body bags to store the mounting pile of corpses.</p> <p>Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman on Chechnya, said today that the Chechen prosecutor's office had launched an investigation and added that until their conclusions were published, it would be unwise to speculate on the identities of the dead or on the cause of their death. \"I don't approve of Memorial's approach. It's very easy to point the finger of blame, but the military prosecutor has not yet finished his investigations,\" he said.</p> <p>The Memorial reports also detail the growth of a clandestine trade in corpses between the Russian forces and Chechen villagers; relatives are informed by an intermediary if the identity of the victim is known, and a price for securing the body for burial is negotiated.</p> <p>Information about the existence of large numbers of bodies at Zdorovye first emerged at the end of February as intermediaries involved in the corpse trade began informing families that their relatives' bodies had been deposited there.</p> <p>The corpse of Adam Chimayev was the first to be identified by relatives. His family was invited by an intermediary to inspect a group of bodies deposited at Zdorvye. After positively identifying Chumayev, the family paid $3,000 to Russian soldiers to retrieve his body from the village so they could hold a funeral, his widow said. The 38-year-old Chechen had not been seen by his family since Russian soldiers detained him on December 3 last year. Three shots to his heart area had killed him, and there were the marks of torture on his body, relatives revealed.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br><a href=\"mailto:observe@online.ru\">observe@online.ru</a> <br> <b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/chechnya/\">Chechnya</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/russia/\">Russia</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=amelia+gentleman&amp;Query=amelia+gentleman&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=Vdkpublicationdate+desc&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Amelia Gentleman</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.itar-tass.com/news.htm\" target=\"_new\">Itar-Tass news agency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moscowtimes.ru/05-May-2000/homepage.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moscow Times</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.russiatoday.com/\" target=\"_new\">Russia Today</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.times.spb.ru/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">St Petersburg Times</a></p>",

Research conducted by the Memorial human rights group suggests that as many as 2,000 Chechens may have gone missing after being detained by Russian forces; Russian officials put the number of people who have disappeared in the region, for whatever reason, at around 360. The issue has gained new urgency this week with the publication of a detailed investigation into a large body dump discovered at the end of February outside the Russians' main military headquarters in the separatist region. More than 50 bodies have already been recovered from the abandoned holiday village, Zdorovye, in the heavily-guarded area outside the Khankala base; the figure continues to rise as new bodies are found. Russian television today showed gruesome footage of 25 of the bodies - three of them women - laid out in a converted warehouse in Grozny waiting for relatives to identify the dead.

Human Rights Watch has echoed his concerns. \"We have established a clear pattern of cases when people 'disappear' in the custody of Russian troops,\" a spokeswoman said. \"The discovery of this mass grave is very alarming.\" Russian officials have given contradictory explanations for the presence of the corpses. They claimed initially that the dead were rebel fighters (killed up to a year ago at a time when fighting was active in the region) and later that the bodies were rebels killed by their own side in internal guerrilla disputes. A doctor working for Memorial concluded after inspecting the bodies that the majority of them were between one and four months old - killed long after the Russian forces declared Grozny and surrounding villages under its control. \"It seems unlikely that Chechen fighters would have hidden their dead in a region so close to the Russian military headquarters,\" Mr Orlov said. The investigation of military medical experts was severely impeded by the shortage of equipment in Grozny, he added. Doctors have complained that they do not even have enough body bags to store the mounting pile of corpses. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman on Chechnya, said today that the Chechen prosecutor's office had launched an investigation and added that until their conclusions were published, it would be unwise to speculate on the identities of the dead or on the cause of their death. \"I don't approve of Memorial's approach. It's very easy to point the finger of blame, but the military prosecutor has not yet finished his investigations,\" he said. The Memorial reports also detail the growth of a clandestine trade in corpses between the Russian forces and Chechen villagers; relatives are informed by an intermediary if the identity of the victim is known, and a price for securing the body for burial is negotiated. Information about the existence of large numbers of bodies at Zdorovye first emerged at the end of February as intermediaries involved in the corpse trade began informing families that their relatives' bodies had been deposited there. The corpse of Adam Chimayev was the first to be identified by relatives. His family was invited by an intermediary to inspect a group of bodies deposited at Zdorvye. After positively identifying Chumayev, the family paid $3,000 to Russian soldiers to retrieve his body from the village so they could hold a funeral, his widow said. The 38-year-old Chechen had not been seen by his family since Russian soldiers detained him on December 3 last year. Three shots to his heart area had killed him, and there were the marks of torture on his body, relatives revealed.

This year alone, three of our leading CEOs have signed up to swap the West End for midtown Manhattan. The phenomenon is hardly new. Like pop bands in the wake of the Beatles, numerous UK ad executives have sought to emulate the success of the late, legendary David Ogilvy in the US. Most have had as much impact as Bros. However, the hiring of Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO's Andrew Robertson, Lowe Lintas's Paul Hammersley and Leo Burnett's Nick Brien represent the formal rehabilitation of the British adman's image abroad, a decade and a half after the Saatchi brothers tarnished it. Their infamous, hostile acquisition of the venerable Ted Bates agency in the mid-80s compounded the already arrogant reputation of Brits in New York. Then there was Sir Martin Sorrell, who scarcely endeared himself to Madison Avenue by mounting a hostile takeover of the American advertising institution J Walter Thompson. A decade later, he revisited this insolence by acquiring Young &amp; Rubicam. In between, the executives became ever more senior. Although Chris Jones left JWT recently for health reasons, and Jennifer Laing of Saatchis returned to Britain, Michael Bungey of Cordiant and Michael Greenlees of TBWA still run a worldwide holding company and network respectively. And TBWA's Carl Johnson and Fallon's Alison Burns run New York agencies. There is scarcely a decent planner left in London - any US agency with planning credentials now fields a token Brit in this discipline, which is very much a British specialism. This year, expect to see others follow Mr Brien - and earlier immigrants like Paul Woolmington - into the world of the US media-buying independents. The media independent has been commonplace in the UK for a decade now and the Americans, who continue to believe in the merits of the full-service ad agency, have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to this particular altar. They consequently lack enough experienced executives to run the new entities. This helps explain the current influx of Brits, despite the painful contraction of the US ad industry. The dot.com dollars may have gone but the industry is being transformed belatedly after more than 30 years of the status quo prevailing. A generation of older managers is approaching retirement at the same time and there are not the young managers to succeed them. These were lost to Wall Street in the 80s, management consultancies and then dot.coms in the 90s. Until the downturn became the talk of the town, the talent shortage was one of the few serious problems Madison Avenue faced. The downturn will go away, the talent shortage won't. This means we can expect to see more top British names follow the dollars this year. Planners and media buyers will lead the way but perhaps not creatives. New York advertising is too businesslike and conservative for the average British creative. But, that's another column. \u0095 Stefano Hatfield is managing director and editorial director of Ad Age Global.",

The 28-year-old star of Stealing Beauty, Shakespeare in Love, Elizabeth and now Enemy at the Gates, the forthcoming movie about the siege of Stalingrad, is about to open at the Sheffield Crucible. His choice of play is equally off-centre: Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. If Fiennes was going to return to the classical theatre - he cut his teeth on the repertoire during three seasons at the Royal Shakespeare Company in the mid-1990s - you'd expect it to be as Hamlet or Richard II, like his older brother Ralph. </p> <p>But no, Fiennes has been swept off his feet by Marlowe's anti-hero king, a figure trashed by generations of literary critics for his lack of tragic status and absence of self-knowledge, who loses his heart to his favourite Gaveston and his kingdom to his restless barons, and who suffers the nastiest death in all of English drama (you know - the one with the red-hot poker). </p> <p>When Bernard Levin saw Marlowe's play, he suggested the author should be shovelled back in his grave and left to rot. But Fiennes has no time for that sort of talk. \"Oh, fuck off,\" he says good-humouredly. \"If you are going to pit Marlowe against Shakespeare, then you have to accept that they present two unique, entirely different views of the world. In Edward II the language isn't a foil, like the wit in a play like Hamlet. It is a broadsword, and Marlowe uses it brutally. He is a poet of a different nature. This is a young man's play, and it feels like one. Who knows what Marlowe might have gone on to write if he had lived?\" </p> <p>Marlowe is generally believed to have died at the age of 29, stabbed in a fight after a life as both spy and writer. His more fervent fans, however, insist that he faked his death and wrote many of the plays now credited to Shakespeare. </p> <p>Joseph Fiennes has never been one for obvious choices. After giving up an art course for drama school, he at first seemed set on imitating Ralph by going to the RSC and then to Hollywood. But he became as well known for his work in new plays as for his Shakespeare. His performance as Jesus in Dennis Potter's Son of Man was so intense that audiences were moved to tears, if not Christianity. </p> <p>Fiennes has had just one stage role since he found overnight stardom in 1998's Shakespeare in Love: in Nick Grosso's twentysomething drama Real Classy Affair at the Royal Court. But he has long wanted to do Edward II, after reading it at drama school and seeing Simon Russell Beale in the title role in the RSC's 1991 production. </p> <p>\"There is nothing dressed up about this play,\" he says. \"It is what it is - a muscular, blunt instrument. The occasional mighty line sings out, but on the whole it just tells a good story extremely well. If you get it right, it should have the audience on the edge of their seats.\" The absence of Shakespeare's rich imagery will, he feels, be a bonus in performance. At the very least, the audience's unfamiliarity with the play will spare him \"some voice on the front row mumbling the lines with you as you plough through them\". </p> <p>Fiennes admits that the play, which is being directed by Michael Grandage, owes some of its appeal to Marlowe's short but action-filled life. The more we learn about his time in the Elizabethan secret service and his violent, mysterious death, the harder it is to separate biography from the plays. Even Marlowe's sexuality comes into play in Edward II, in which he writes with modern openness about a king who loses his throne and his life because of his love for another man. </p> <p>\"This is more than just a gay play. It is about politics and society, destiny and the illusion of power as well, but it is very much a play about love. Gaveston was probably Marlowe's ultimate sexual fantasy brought to life - you feel the energy of it. But you also feel the directness of love. It is there in the text: 'Why should you love him whom the world hates so?' 'Because he loves me more than all the world.' Those two lines say it all.\" </p> <p>They do, but they don't redeem the wilful, immature Edward, a character who has the same faults but none of the growing self-knowledge of some of Shakespeare's great creations. \"That's unfair,\" counters Fiennes. \"Edward is ugly and petulant at times. But he is liberated by love. He finds himself, and it is telling that both Gaveston and Spencer, who initially are both out for their own ends, actually fall in love with him. There is something attractive about him, and he does grow - but in a very odd way. For most characters in classic texts a light grows in them towards death. But with Edward it is different. He explodes with anger and joy, and the rest of the play is a closing down, like a light being extinguished.\" </p> <p>\"Extinguished\" is a genteel way of describing Edward's appalling death, an end that fitted in with the contemporary belief that crime (in this case sodomy) and punishment should be intimately connected. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" says Fiennes. \"I think some people are going to be a bit surprised. With plays like Blasted and Shopping and Fucking we pride ourselves on being so brave and new about violence on stage. But 400 years ago Marlowe was writing something like this. Sex, power, love and violent murder: Marlowe made sure his play had got it all.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hackers have redirected the online home of Hamas, the Arab fundamentalist organisation, to a pornographic website. Users who type in the URL http://www.hamas.org are currently rerouted to two domains - \"hotmotel.com\" and \"teenjuice.com\". On both pages, explicit porngraphic images are shown on the front page, plus links to pay-per-view sites on a vast range of sexual fetishes. Both windows must be closed before unsuspecting browsers can remove the material from their screens. The web attack follows yesterday's admission by Hamas that it was responsible for Sunday's suicide bombing at Netanya, in which a bomber and three Israelis were killed. Hamas's military wing, the Izz el-deen al-Qassam brigades, had said in a statement that Ahmed Omar Alian, 23, a prayer caller at a refugee camp, had carried out the bombing. That statement described Alian as a \"hero and a martyr\", the Jerusalem Post newspaper said. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the political wing of Hamas, told the Reuters news agency that he thought Israeli intelligence was behind the attack. \"I'm telling them to die of their own fury,\" Yassin told the agency. He accused the hackers of trying to \"disfigure the image of Islam\". The web attack is just the latest incident in the Middle East's internet war. In January a 16-year-old Israeli was shot dead after meeting a Palestinian woman in an internet chatroom and arranging to meet her. Last year the website of Hizbullah, the Arab guerrilla group, was altered to display the Israeli flag. And in October Albawaba.com, a Jordanian-based portal site, was crashed by supporters of Israel - who bombarded its chatroom with emails containing large and offensive image files.

Yesterday's blast flattened the two-storey school building in the village of Fanglin in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, burying scores of children under rubble. Unconfirmed reports on Chinese websites suggested children in the school were making fireworks in their classrooms to raise pocket money or funds for the school, and some villagers told the AFP news agency that teachers had been forcing children at the school to make fireworks for three years. A spokesman for the local police in Tanbu, an impoverished rural region 250 miles north-east of Hong Kong, denied that the blast had been caused by fireworks, but a local government official said the authorities had received complaints about the matter from parents. \"Most probably it is because of fireworks, but a final result will come out after investigators convene,\" said a government spokesman in Wanzai county, where Fanglin is located in the township of Tanbu.

Besides assembling toys and producing small handicrafts, students in rural China have been known to work in mines and other labour intensive activity, according to human rights groups and officials. Fireworks have caused a series of disasters in China in recent years. In March 2000, an explosion at a huge illegal firework factory killed 33 people in Jiangxi province - 60 miles west of Wanzai county. In August, another explosion of firework ingredients stored illegally in an apartment killed 21 people, also in Jiangxi. A blast in the southern province of Guangdong last June killed 38.

The professions warned that addicts would avoid seeking help, thereby placing their children in greater danger rather than protecting them from harm. But they fear that powers to control patient information in the new health and social care bill could allow a moralistic health secretary to force them to breach addicts' confidentiality in the future, claiming it was in the public interest. Their warnings came after Professor Neil McKeganey, head of Glasgow University's centre for drug misuse research, said GPs, social workers and drugs workers needed to breach confidentiality in the interests of children's welfare. \"The risks posed to these children far outweigh the principle of confidentiality,\" he argued. The recommendation came as he revealed details of the first comprehensive study into the impact of drug abuse on the children of addicts in the UK.

However, you're likely to alienate both parent and child if you breach their trust.\" Rob Hutchinson, chairman of the Association of Directors of Social Services' children's and families committee, said: \"Under jointly agreed child protection procedures there is a need for professionals who believe a child or young person to be at risk of significant harm to share that information with appropriate agencies. \"It should not be assumed however that information should be shared simply because the parent has a drug problem. This does not on its own mean that the child is at risk.\" Ian Robinson, deputy director of drug charity Release, warned addicts would avoid seeking help if their confidentiality was compromised. \"There is already a problem with women not accessing services because they're afraid of losing their children.\" \u0095 The findings of Professor McKeganey's study will be published in a book, Beating the Dragon, due out in August.",

      "bodyText": "An Argentine judge cleared the way yesterday for hundreds of military personnel to face trial for human rights crimes during the 1976-83 dictatorship. Ruling in a 1978 case of murder and kidnapping, Gabriel Cavallo declared unconstitutional two laws passed in the 1980s which shield all but the most senior officers against prosecution for crimes committed during the \"dirty war\". While the ruling applies only to the case at hand - which involves 11 military men - it sets a precedent that could open the door for the trial of hun dreds of officers and other ranks who have escaped prosecution for nearly 25 years. The top brass were tried and jailed in 1984, but later pardoned. The ruling was made just a few weeks before the 25th anniversary of the 1976 coup which plunged Argentina into several years of military government, during which an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 people were killed or \"disappeared\" - meaning their bodies were never found. The immunity laws were agreed in the 1980s as the young democracy sought to deal with the military crimes without alienating the armed forces. Judge Cavallo made the ruling in a case brought by a human rights group, the Legal and Social Studies Centre, which accused the 11 of being involved in the murder and kidnapping of a couple and their baby in 1978. \"This is the most important case I have overseen because, with its institutional weight, I could give my opinion as a judge ... on an event as horrific as the systematic repression from 1976 to '83,\" the judge told reporters outside the court. Appeals could hold up the case, but Judge Cavallo said he would press ahead with questioning the accused. The legal centre's director, Horacio Verbitsky, said: \"For us this is a historic moment, because it marks the beginning of the end of impunity in Argentina.\" Horacio Jaunarena, who was sworn in as defence minister on Monday, said the critical issue was \"how Argentina can recover from its past\". He first held the defence post in the mid-1980s, when the immunity laws were agreed during the presidency of Raul Alfonsin. \"Anything that leads to a rapid clarification of these actions and responsibilities seems to me healthy for the future,\" Mr Jaunarena said.",

      "body": "<p>On Sylvia Thompson's street, there is broken glass caked in dog turd. Visitors wade through litter floating on the wind. Half the redbrick, pre-1920 terrace houses are empty. Addicts and alcoholics crawl in and use them as dens. </p> <p>Between the rows of boarded up windows are the net curtains and carriage clocks of people who bought into Salford when the area was popular. They are now trapped there. The market has collapsed and houses are worth as little as \u00a31,500. </p> <p>Mrs Thompson, 60, and her husband Arthur bought a two bedroom house in Langworthy, Salford, when they married in 1967. It cost them \u00a3600. Over the last 20 years, they have paid off their mortgage, built a \u00a319,000 extension and redecorated. Twelve years ago their house was worth \u00a334,000. This year it was valued at \u00a37,500. </p> <p>Less than two miles away, in central Manchester, two bedroom flats sell for \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Mrs Thompson said: \"When we bought this house it was a sought after area. You had to fight to get in. We had no idea what would happen to what was once a fantastic community. We invested for our children and our retirement but we'll never get that money back. They call this place the Bronx. The council wants us to leave so they can rebuild the street. They have had the house valued at \u00a37,500. What are we supposed to do with that?\" </p> <p>Mrs Thompson is a cleaner and her husband is a van driver. On their salaries, if they had to leave, they could not afford to rent. At their age, they cannot get a mortgage. </p> <p>The kitchen floor has begun to subside, and the bathroom will have to be refitted. Salford council is developing a plan to destroy streets where more than three quarters of houses are derelict. Green areas will be introduced, home owners whose house value has plummeted will be asked to leave their homes to the bulldozers and will be offered nearby houses that match their current status. Community facilities will be improved. </p> <p>But the Thompsons do not want to move. They want the council to revamp the area.

      "bodyText": "On Sylvia Thompson's street, there is broken glass caked in dog turd. Visitors wade through litter floating on the wind. Half the redbrick, pre-1920 terrace houses are empty. Addicts and alcoholics crawl in and use them as dens. Between the rows of boarded up windows are the net curtains and carriage clocks of people who bought into Salford when the area was popular. They are now trapped there. The market has collapsed and houses are worth as little as \u00a31,500. Mrs Thompson, 60, and her husband Arthur bought a two bedroom house in Langworthy, Salford, when they married in 1967. It cost them \u00a3600. Over the last 20 years, they have paid off their mortgage, built a \u00a319,000 extension and redecorated. Twelve years ago their house was worth \u00a334,000. This year it was valued at \u00a37,500. Less than two miles away, in central Manchester, two bedroom flats sell for \u00a3500,000. Mrs Thompson said: \"When we bought this house it was a sought after area. You had to fight to get in. We had no idea what would happen to what was once a fantastic community. We invested for our children and our retirement but we'll never get that money back. They call this place the Bronx. The council wants us to leave so they can rebuild the street. They have had the house valued at \u00a37,500. What are we supposed to do with that?\" Mrs Thompson is a cleaner and her husband is a van driver. On their salaries, if they had to leave, they could not afford to rent. At their age, they cannot get a mortgage. The kitchen floor has begun to subside, and the bathroom will have to be refitted. Salford council is developing a plan to destroy streets where more than three quarters of houses are derelict. Green areas will be introduced, home owners whose house value has plummeted will be asked to leave their homes to the bulldozers and will be offered nearby houses that match their current status. Community facilities will be improved. But the Thompsons do not want to move. They want the council to revamp the area. They and people who bought houses 10 years ago have little hope. Stephen and Dawn Curwen bought a two bedroom terrace for \u00a326,000 in 1993. It is now worth \u00a35,000. The couple, both 33, have three children and a high mortgage. They cannot afford to install central heating or do repairs to their roof and rotting windows and doors. if they know they will not see a return on their investment. The Curwens' 11-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son share a room. Their three-year-old sleeps in a cot in his parents' room. The couple wanted to build an extension for another bedroom but now they cannot afford to. \"We are trapped here. What sort of life is this? There is nothing for my kids to do.

Labour MPs are looking for eyecatching policies and initiatives to set the stage for a general election, possibly in May, after the foot and mouth disease crisis is contained. The chancellor is expected to announce \u00a34bn in tax cuts, but social security secretary Alistair Darling said he will do nothing to jeopardise Britain's economic strength. \"What we want is stability so that businesses can plan for the future. Stability also gives you low interest rates which, in turn, means lower mortgage rates,\" he said. Mr Brown has already said he intends to concentrate on \"targeted\" measures aimed at working families with young children, pensioners and savers. Newspaper reports today said that the chancellor is planning to allocate \u00a3500 million to recruit teachers, police officers and health staff. There is also speculation that he will cut income tax by widening the band for the 10p starting rate. Analysts believe the chancellor can afford to give away \u00a33bn to \u00a34bn from the treasury surplus in tax cuts and extra spending. The IMF has warned that a pre-election giveaway could prevent further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England but economists believe the strength of public finances will give Mr Brown room for manoeuvre. According to the latest estimates, public finances are on course to show a surplus of about \u00a315bn - 50% more than the \u00a310 billion that Mr Brown predicted in November. The Tories attempted to undercut the impact of the chancellor's expected largesse by leaking secret plans for \u00a3144bn tax cuts over 10 years if the party returns to power.

For while he's not quite on the mark - it's actually the club's bar that lies half in England and half in Wales - he does highlight a peculiarity unique to Chester City FC, namely that they are an English club who actually play in Wales.</p> <p>How do they get away with it? Well, although Chester's pitch is completely in Wales, the club's office, which lies just a few metres away, is just over the border in England - which is why they can be registered as an English club.</p> <p><strong>TRICKY TEASER NOT SOLVED SHOCK</strong></p> <p><strong> \"Arsenal cannot do it unless Arsene Wenger leaves. Manchester United have done it more than any other British club. Liverpool have done it once but not in the usual way. Everton, Oldham and Charlton have all done it once but Wimbledon will NEVER do it unless Crystal Palace go bankrupt. What is it?\" </strong> asks Marcus Pretlove. </p> <p>The answer is to do with rugby league matches, reckoned Rob Jordan last week. Oh no it isn't, responded scores of you in a pantomime chorus. Rob's answer is wrong for several reasons, you say: Huddersfield have hosted more rugby league matches than Manchester United; first-class rugby league has been played at Anfield, including games between St Helens v Castlefield and Wigan v Penrith; and Everton, Oldham and Charlton have all hosted more than one rugby league game.</p> <p>Any sensible suggestions are welcome </p> <p><strong> MOST POPULAR SHIRT COLOUR</strong> <br> </p> <p><strong>\"Me and my friends got talking about this without resolution: what is the most popular shirt colour in all four divisions?\" </strong> asked Stephen M.</p> <p>\"The answer is blue shirts with 19,\" says CC Goodwin. \"Then comes red, white, and blue and white with 14 each. After that comes red and white with 11. Ten teams play in amber, yellow, orange or gold, four play in claret, three in black and white, and one each in red and amber, red and blue, and green. </p> <p>\"That's 92 clubs!\" he exclaims.</p> <p><strong>DRAWS, DRAWS, DRAWS</strong> <br></p> <p><strong>\"Is there any evidence that awarding three points for a win has made the game more exciting? Are there less draws than before the change? Would any English championships have been decided differently under the old system?\"</strong> asks Stuart McGill.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago we claimed that the introduction of three points for a win has not affected the outcome of any championship since 1982. But as Doug Marx points out, we were wrong.</p> <p>\"In the 1994-95 season Blackburn won the championship,\" he says. \"But if only two points had been awarded for a win, Manchester United would have won the title on goal difference.</p> <p>\"The final table read: 1) Blackburn: P42, W27, D8, L7, F80, A39; 2) Man Utd: P42, W26, D10, L6, F77, A28.</p> <p>\"For this reason alone the nation surely owes Jimmy Hill a debt of gratitude,\" adds Stephen Buckland.</p> <p><strong>PROVE A TOKYO BAR OWNER WRONG!</strong></p> <p><strong>\"The owner of our local bar here in Tokyo, states that Sweden, Holland, Belgium, France and Portugal are the only European sides, outside of the British Isles, to ever field a black player in a full international. We think that he is talking out of his arse, can someone please help us out, so that we can shut him up?\" </strong> says Nigel Drake.</p> <p>Last week we pointed out that Vicente Engonga played for Spain during 2000. Also, as legions of you wrote in to tell us, John Carew plays for Norway. Finally, Roger Sigrist says that Olympiakos had a black centre forward called Daniel Batista, who played for the Greek national side on many occasions.</p> <p><strong>LITTLE BROTHERS TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG: PART 3</strong></p> <p><strong>\"At the moment in Italy, Christian Vieri's little brother Massimiliano and Roberto Baggio's little bro' Eddy are playing together for Serie B side Ancona.

TRICKY TEASER NOT SOLVED SHOCK \"Arsenal cannot do it unless Arsene Wenger leaves. Manchester United have done it more than any other British club. Liverpool have done it once but not in the usual way. Everton, Oldham and Charlton have all done it once but Wimbledon will NEVER do it unless Crystal Palace go bankrupt. What is it?\" asks Marcus Pretlove. The answer is to do with rugby league matches, reckoned Rob Jordan last week. Oh no it isn't, responded scores of you in a pantomime chorus. Rob's answer is wrong for several reasons, you say: Huddersfield have hosted more rugby league matches than Manchester United; first-class rugby league has been played at Anfield, including games between St Helens v Castlefield and Wigan v Penrith; and Everton, Oldham and Charlton have all hosted more than one rugby league game. Any sensible suggestions are welcome MOST POPULAR SHIRT COLOUR \"Me and my friends got talking about this without resolution: what is the most popular shirt colour in all four divisions?\" asked Stephen M. \"The answer is blue shirts with 19,\" says CC Goodwin. \"Then comes red, white, and blue and white with 14 each. After that comes red and white with 11. Ten teams play in amber, yellow, orange or gold, four play in claret, three in black and white, and one each in red and amber, red and blue, and green. \"That's 92 clubs!\" he exclaims. DRAWS, DRAWS, DRAWS \"Is there any evidence that awarding three points for a win has made the game more exciting? Are there less draws than before the change? Would any English championships have been decided differently under the old system?\" asks Stuart McGill. A couple of weeks ago we claimed that the introduction of three points for a win has not affected the outcome of any championship since 1982. But as Doug Marx points out, we were wrong. \"In the 1994-95 season Blackburn won the championship,\" he says. \"But if only two points had been awarded for a win, Manchester United would have won the title on goal difference. \"The final table read: 1) Blackburn: P42, W27, D8, L7, F80, A39; 2) Man Utd: P42, W26, D10, L6, F77, A28. \"For this reason alone the nation surely owes Jimmy Hill a debt of gratitude,\" adds Stephen Buckland. PROVE A TOKYO BAR OWNER WRONG! \"The owner of our local bar here in Tokyo, states that Sweden, Holland, Belgium, France and Portugal are the only European sides, outside of the British Isles, to ever field a black player in a full international. We think that he is talking out of his arse, can someone please help us out, so that we can shut him up?\" says Nigel Drake. Last week we pointed out that Vicente Engonga played for Spain during 2000. Also, as legions of you wrote in to tell us, John Carew plays for Norway. Finally, Roger Sigrist says that Olympiakos had a black centre forward called Daniel Batista, who played for the Greek national side on many occasions. LITTLE BROTHERS TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG: PART 3 \"At the moment in Italy, Christian Vieri's little brother Massimiliano and Roberto Baggio's little bro' Eddy are playing together for Serie B side Ancona. Are there any other younger brothers of big name players attempting to do likewise?\" asked Martin Casey. \"Nkwanko Kanu's little brother Christopher is a defender for Ajax,\" says Rick Buur, \"while Cedric Seedorf - Clarence's younger brother - is the captain of the Dutch U-17 team and plays for NAC Breda.\" \"Finally, Carlos Hasselbaink, recently retired defender from Second Division Dutch team Haarlem, has a younger brother playing in England.\" NOT-SO-BORING DRAWS: PART 3 \"What was the highest ever drawn game in terms of goals scored?\" asked Gary Ross. In previous editions of The Knowledge we've mentioned 5-5 and 6-6 draws - but Paul Crankshaw has gone one better. \"In a senior competitive match there was a 7-7 draw in the Dulwich Hamlet v Wealdstone FA Cup fourth qualifying round tie in 1930,\" he says. \"Amazingly, Dulwich were involved in an 8-7 FA Cup victory over St Albans City in the same round in 1923 - this game being famous for the fact that a St Albans player (Minter from memory) scored all SEVEN goals for his team - and ended up on the losing side!\" he adds. CAN YOU HELP? \"In the light of Ugo Ehiogu scoring for England last week - and what with me being a deeply sad individual - I was wondering if any other players had scored for England who had more vowels than consonants in their name?\" asks Nathan-Madonna Byers. \"Can someone tell me who has played for the most professional clubs during a season or career?\" asks Derek Tomkin. \"Does anyone know who has the highest ratio of international caps to league appearances? Surely Phil 'Overachiever' Neville is a prime candidate?\" asks Chris Field.",

      "body": "<p>Staff are leaving charities in growing numbers, and replacing them is proving increasingly tough. So tomorrow, 250 charity managers will gather at a conference in London to grapple with solutions. </p> <p>One in three voluntary organisations which have sought to recruit staff in the past two years says it has been a struggle. Many applicants are said to be insufficiently qualified or experienced to fill posts, especially in management, fundraising and IT. </p> <p>But recruitment experts blame low salary levels, lack of career opportunities and poor training. Elaine Smethurst, director of Working for a Charity, a training agency, says: \"In order to advance themselves, charity staff are having to move from cause to cause. Organisations should look at long-term investment in people.\" </p> <p>So what's the solution? Investment in career development, or higher salaries? And can charities afford either? </p> <p>To kick-start the debate, a raft of publications will be released at the London conference. The Voluntary Sector National Training Organisation (VSNTO), which is organising the event in conjunction with the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), will publish a workforce development plan, setting out key recommendations for the sector. The RSA will issue a report on a project for accredited learning in small charities. And guides will be available on NVQs, management development and working in the sector. </p> <p>Ben Kernighan, head of VSNTO, says: \"The sector needs to have a two-pronged attack: invest in increasing the skills of staff and ensure good people are attracted to the sector.\" </p> <p>Janet Fleming, who managed the RSA's project, says that research among small charities found that 80% of staff said training had increased their confidence and 57% said it improved motivation. Yet only 20% of the organisations had offered training previously. </p> <p>The project developed a model for planning and delivering cost-effective training. \"Charities aren't offering enough money, so they need to be prepared to take people on and offer them training,\" says Fleming.

      "bodyText": "Staff are leaving charities in growing numbers, and replacing them is proving increasingly tough. So tomorrow, 250 charity managers will gather at a conference in London to grapple with solutions. One in three voluntary organisations which have sought to recruit staff in the past two years says it has been a struggle. Many applicants are said to be insufficiently qualified or experienced to fill posts, especially in management, fundraising and IT. But recruitment experts blame low salary levels, lack of career opportunities and poor training. Elaine Smethurst, director of Working for a Charity, a training agency, says: \"In order to advance themselves, charity staff are having to move from cause to cause. Organisations should look at long-term investment in people.\" So what's the solution? Investment in career development, or higher salaries? And can charities afford either? To kick-start the debate, a raft of publications will be released at the London conference. The Voluntary Sector National Training Organisation (VSNTO), which is organising the event in conjunction with the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), will publish a workforce development plan, setting out key recommendations for the sector. The RSA will issue a report on a project for accredited learning in small charities. And guides will be available on NVQs, management development and working in the sector. Ben Kernighan, head of VSNTO, says: \"The sector needs to have a two-pronged attack: invest in increasing the skills of staff and ensure good people are attracted to the sector.\" Janet Fleming, who managed the RSA's project, says that research among small charities found that 80% of staff said training had increased their confidence and 57% said it improved motivation. Yet only 20% of the organisations had offered training previously. The project developed a model for planning and delivering cost-effective training. \"Charities aren't offering enough money, so they need to be prepared to take people on and offer them training,\" says Fleming. To save costs, she suggests, charities could ask corporate supporters to give them free places on their training courses. Kernighan sees the launch next month of learning and skills councils, 47 local branches, responsible for training of the over-16s, as a great opportunity for the sector. \"They have \u00a36bn to spend, so voluntary organisations should form local networks to identify training needs and tap this new funding,\" he says.

      "body": "<p>A miracle happened in Shaoshan, birthplace of Mao Zedong, on December 20, 1993. President Jiang Zemin had come with an entourage of party grandees to unveil a 6 metre-high bronze statue of the late Chairman Mao, looking, as the guidebook has it, \"firm and steady, and glowing with health\". Anyone who sees it, the book continues, \"can feel the magnetic power of a great leader, a victorious leader\".</p> <p>December in Hunan province is a cold, dark month, with constant rain or sleet. The freezing winds won't let up until the spring. But on that miraculous occasion, just as President Jiang was pulling the sheet off Mao's shining face, the sun came blazing through the clouds and, even stranger, the moon shone brightly.</p> <p>I was shown photographs of the miracle when I visited Shaoshan recently, on a typically bleak, rainy day. You could buy the picture in all sizes, the most expensive ones framed in gold. You could also buy gold or marble busts of the chairman, tapes of his speeches, fine embroideries of his countenance, and coins, stamps, ballpoints, pencils, cigarette lighters, key rings, CDs, T-shirts and teacups, all with Mao's image on. Then there were the plastic domes with Mao inside that rained gold flakes when you shook them. And the golden amulets to bring good health and fortune with - instead of the more usual images of Buddhist or Taoist holy men - engraved portraits of the former Chinese leader.</p> <p>Mao Zedong has clearly entered the pantheon of Chinese folk deities, along with the Yellow Emperor and other legendary sages and heroes in Chinese history. And Shaoshan, visited by millions over the years, is the Lourdes of his cult.</p> <p>This is not so strange. Humans have been worshipped as gods for thousands of years in China, and the point of Mao, in the eyes of the believers, is no longer whether he was good or bad; such categories do not apply to godmen. The point, as a taxi driver in Hunan pointed out to me when I asked him about the Mao charm dangling from his rearview mirror, is that Mao was Great, or weida . Greatness, in the sense of projecting great personal power, is much admired among the Chinese peoples; think of the continuing popularity of Mein Kampf in Taiwan.</p> <p>A godman in China or Japan can still have entirely human characteristics - more so, perhaps, than Jesus Christ, whose status with some Chinese is somewhat similar to Mao's. In Changsha, the capital of Hunan, where Mao went to school and founded the regional communist party, I visited the provincial museum, where there is a lavish display of Mao's underwear. That is the interesting thing about godmen: they are both divine and very human.</p> <p>Divine beings in every society promise salvation and good fortune, and where there are miracles, there is business to be done. This, too, is universal. Mao's divine status has brought a great deal of business to Shaoshan. Indeed, it has become the main cottage industry of this small but prosperous town. Restaurants offer \"Mao's favourite dishes\". Snake-oil salesmen sell miracle cures for all kinds of diseases. And almost every shop is a purveyor of Mao memorabilia.</p> <p>Shaoshan, as a pilgrimage site, is surprisingly traditional. Not only does it have all the characteristics of Chinese folk religion, which Mao affected to despise, but of higher Chinese culture as well; for example, the ubiquitous presence of Mao's calligraphy and poetry. One of the tasks of great Chinese leaders is to carry on Chinese civilisation, and the core of that civilisation is the word, which finds its highest expression in calligraphy. No matter how much tradition Mao and his followers smashed - and they smashed a great deal - he kept the word. And so did his successors. Not only is Mao's own rather wild calligraphy everywhere to be seen in Shaoshan - on paper, on rocks, on walls, on silk - but also that of Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin. Shaoshan, the birthplace of the greatest wrecker of Chinese tradition, has become, in many ways, a repository of it.</p> <p>There is, none the less, something curious about the cult of Mao, which began in the 80s, roughly 10 years after the Great Helmsman's death. First of all, folk cults are usually suppressed by a nominally communist government which officially, in good Marxist fashion, dismisses all religion as superstition. Governement approved, so-called patriotic churches, subservient to the party, are tolerated, but spontaneous cults are viewed with deep suspicion. Secondly, memories of the famines and mass murders associated with the Mao years have not faded away, even though younger generations often know little or nothing about them.</p> <p>However, the bad memories - the bloody purges, the violent anarchy of the Cultural Revolution - are officially classified as \"mistakes\", committed when Mao was old and no longer in control of his evil courtiers. His alleged greatness - the reason for his divinity and the thing admired by the Hunanese taxi driver - is something very traditional. Mao is supposed to have created order in the Chinese empire by kicking out the barbarians, punishing evil-doers, and restoring virtue. His great achievement in the eyes of his admirers is moral, more than political. Or rather, politics and morality come to the same thing. As the Confucian phrase goes: \"Only the virtuous can rule all under Heaven.\" Mao's revolution, so it is believed, brought back harmony and virtue were there had been chaos and corruption. And, like all peasant messiahs, Mao promised a society in which all men would be equal.</p> <p>The deification of Mao happened just as Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms once again made chaos, inequality and corruption visible in China. Deng's reforms also meant a restoration of a different kind. Intellectuals, persecuted horribly under Mao, came back as advisers to the reformist rulers. They were the modern mandarins, as it were, at the court of Deng. Tired of utopian campaigns, they knew that a degree of inequality and corruption was an inevitable side-effect of China's rush towards economic modernisation. But these side-effects can become intolerable if political freedom fails to match economic liberties. That is what produced the protests on Tiananmen Square in 1989. It is also what produced the banned Falun Gong sect - and the cult of Mao.</p> <p>A professor of history in Changsha, who supports the economic reforms and is afraid of cults and popular rebellions, told me: \"The more intellectuals hate Mao, the more the poor people like him.\" Mao's admirers think that he stood for egalitarianism and righteousness, whereas the current elite looks greedy, corrupt and contemptuous of the lower classes.</p> <p>Maoism was, in fact, a lethal mixture of Stalinism and Chinese authoritarianism. Like Chinese autocrats before him, he believed that obedience had to be enforced and that social harmony is a matter of imposing \"correct thinking\", not of finding peaceful solutions to inevitable conflicts of interests. The moral dogma to be imposed can be Confucianism or Marxism, or Maoism, or Communism with Chinese Characteristics. Whatever the dogma, opposition to it is not just wrong, it is immoral. When class enemies are wiped out, there will be no more conflicts. And those who still claim personal interests are evil, and have to be wiped out too.</p> <p>Economic liberalism, towards which China has been moving in the past 20 years, is all about interests. Businessmen in the rich coastal cities do not necessarily have the same interests as farmers in Hunan, or factory workers in the industrial northeast. And academics and party cadres might have different interests altogether. Many Chinese are well aware of this, but the one-party communist system has no mechanisms to solve these conflicts: without party politics, a free press, and elected political representation, such conflicts cannot be solved.</p> <p>So whenever conflicts come to the boil - students or Falun Gong supporters demonstrating in Beijing, farmers rioting in the countryside, academics writing critical articles on the internet, or workers protesting against factory closures - the government falls back on that old Maoist mixture of dogma and tradition. People are told to cultivate correct thinking, to redouble their studies of Marxism-Leninism, to strengthen China, and to struggle against foreign imperialists and class enemies.</p> <p>Perversely, the same intellectuals and businessmen who support China's economic reforms are often as fearful of political reforms as the party leaders. They may hate communist propaganda, but they tend to associate multi-party politics with disorder, selfishness, and mob rule. And so, in the name of economic development and stability, they endorse authoritarian measures to control protesters.</p> <p>What they often fail to see is that cults are a direct result of blocked politics. Just as autocratic Chinese governments have always justified their monopoly of power by claiming superior virtue, peasant rebellions and religious protests have done the same thing. They were the virtuous rebels who rose in the name of all kinds of folk gurus and deities, including Mao Zedong, to fight corrupt officials and evil rulers, and restore morality. This is why the government is now so spooked by Falun Gong and the many \"underground\" Christian cults: they offer alternative dogmas which undermine the rulers' already shaky claims to superior virtue.</p> <p>There is no evidence that any of the cults in China are about to explode in violent rebellion. Most believers, like the pilgrims in Shaoshan, hope for good health, good fortune, or just a good time. But there is much resentment over betrayed loyalties and dashed illusions. Like the neo-Maoists, many Falun Gong believers wereonce fervent communists who believed that a new moral Chinese utopia was at hand. The spectacle of party hacks and gangsters helping themselves to riches, while others languish in the margins, has bred a great deal of anger.</p> <p>There are democratic institutions to contain such anger. But without the freedom to build such institutions, the Chinese are reduced once again to waiting for the next Mao, or violent messiah.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Staff are leaving charities in growing numbers, and replacing them is proving increasingly tough. So tomorrow, 250 charity managers will gather at the Learning and Skills in the Voluntary Sector conference in London to grapple with solutions. One in three voluntary organisations that have sought to recruit staff in the past two years says it has been a struggle. Many applicants are said to be insufficiently qualified or experienced to fill posts, especially in management, fundraising and IT. But recruitment experts blame low salary levels, lack of career opportunities and poor training. Elaine Smethurst, director of Working for a Charity, a training agency, said: \"In order to advance themselves, charity staff are having to move from cause to cause. Organisations should look at long-term investment in people.\" So what's the solution? Investment in career development, or higher salaries? And can charities afford either? To kick-start the debate, a raft of publications will be released at the London conference. The Voluntary Sector National Training Organisation (VSNTO), which is organising the event in conjunction with the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), will publish a workforce development plan, setting out key recommendations for the sector. The RSA will issue a report on a project for accredited learning in small charities. And guides will be available on NVQs, management development and working in the sector.

That's doubtless true, but corporate perfection is not a theme you choose to write to us about, although if any of you have encountered a star removals firm do share your find with us. </p> <p>G Mathur of Amsterdam was not so fortunate. When he left London to start a new life in Brussels he gave away most of his furniture, but was keen to hang on to his treasured hand-made bed. An ad alerted him to a company called Crown Worldwide Movers which, for the next four years, stored the bed and his clothes apparently in a Belgium depot. However, when Mathur sought to retrieve them the paperwork was lost and they were eventually discovered in Barking. The clothes, when they arrived, had been stained and the bed was battered, split and dented. A Crown official promised that the damage would be made good under Mathur's insurance policy, but months passed, emails went unanswered and Mathur eventually discovered that the claim had never been submitted, nor a replacement bed part ordered from the manufacturer. His case was finally taken over by another official who also failed to respond to emails. Seven months after his first complaint, Mathur is still sleeping on a mattress and hasn't even had the large dry-cleaning bill for his clothes refunded. </p> <p><strong> Like Cargo Forwarding, Crown tends to tire quickly of its identity. It began life in 1990 as Maxxim International, then shifted to Maxxum International and now goes by the name of Crown Relocation Services. Righteous dismay from its new head, who declares that he knew nothing of the saga which happened before his time and that he'd weeded out several unhelpful staff since then. Three months after Consumer alerted him, Mathur has finally received his bed back with a new part fitted. \"It should never have taken so long to get it sorted,\" says our spokesman.

Later he noticed a new direct debit was making its way monthly to Radio Rentals.

      "bodyText": "Care home owners around the country are stepping up their campaign against local authority funding levels with legal challenges launched by groups in the north and the midlands. Sheffield residential and nursing homes association has lodged a complaint with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) over the differing level of fees paid to council and private sector homes, which they claim is illegal under the Competitions Act 1998. They have also challenged the legality of Sheffield city council's accounts and called in the district auditor - a move also being made by Birmingham care home association. Both associations will stage a protest march through Birmingham's city centre today under the \"crisis in care\" lobby banner - hot on the heels of Monday's National Care Homes Association lobby of parliament over underfunding of care homes. The lobby attracted care home owners from across the country including many from the south west, where one company, the Highcare Group, issued eviction orders to council-funded residents at its St Margaret's care home in Bridgewater, Somerset, before Christmas. Barry Giddings, chairman of the group, said the funding no longer covered the cost of care. The Birmingham march will be held jointly with supporters from Residents Action Group for the Elderly (RAGE), which has served an injunction on Birmingham city council under the Human Rights Act in a bid to stop the transfer of 30 council care homes to a private trust. Jean Cowley, chairwoman of the Birmingham care home association, said: \"There's a lot more in common between the private and public sectors than separates us. Neither side wants to see homes closed. \"We will deliver a letter to social services to say we are challenging their accounts. We think the budget set is illegal because it fails to put sufficient money aside to meet the needs of the elderly.\" A Birmingham city council spokesperson said: \"The social services 2000/01 budget includes a 3% increase on fees for private care homes which has been approved by the advisory team. That is nearly 2% more than last year in recognition of the need to maintain an adequate supply of homes and standard of care in the city.\" Sheffield's district auditor is already investigating a complaint from Sheffield residential and nursing homes association that extra funding for council-run homes contradicts best value and is forcing homes into bankruptcy, reducing people's right to choose. A spokesman for the OFT confirmed that a complaint about differing funding levels had been received and said it was examinining it. While most care home owners are drawing the line at evicting tenants, Sheffield's residential home owners have said they will not accept new council-funded residents after April 5 unless the council increases the proposed \u00a3235 per week to the \u00a3330 they say it pays for its own homes. Association chairman David Coldrick said: \"If the situation remains at stalemate with no activity from the council, then the council will be in clear breach of its legal obligations to ensure the needs of the elderly can be met.\" Sheffield council's head of adult services, Eddie Sherwood, said it was still consulting with home owners to reach a mutually acceptable decision but the new fee structure will consider the varying levels of care required by residents. \"As with all reviews of this nature, the legal and financial implications of the proposals are being carefully examined,\" said Mr Sherwood. Crisis in care campaign organiser Lesley Graves, a director of three south Yorkshire care homes, said many homes around the country are preparing to follow Sheffield's lead in boycotting new council-funded residents.",

Films are being made about his life; books are being written; Joseph Fiennes is about to open in his play Edward II; and Jude Law wants to star as Dr Faustus. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories proliferate about the writer and spy. </p> <p>Little is known for sure about Marlowe, and the more people think they know, the more they disagree. What is generally accepted is that he was born in 1564 - the same year as Shakespeare - and educated at Cambridge. He was only granted his degree after the government intervened (a sure sign that he was involved in official work) and wrote his plays, including The Tragical History of Dr Faustus, Tamburlaine the Great, and The Jew of Malta, in just six years. </p> <p>And at the age of 29, before Shakespeare had produced any of his greatest works, such as Hamlet, King Lear or Macbeth, Marlowe was stabbed to death in a tavern brawl.

      "bodyText": "This looks like being Christopher Marlowe's year. Films are being made about his life; books are being written; Joseph Fiennes is about to open in his play Edward II; and Jude Law wants to star as Dr Faustus. Meanwhile, conspiracy theories proliferate about the writer and spy. Little is known for sure about Marlowe, and the more people think they know, the more they disagree. What is generally accepted is that he was born in 1564 - the same year as Shakespeare - and educated at Cambridge. He was only granted his degree after the government intervened (a sure sign that he was involved in official work) and wrote his plays, including The Tragical History of Dr Faustus, Tamburlaine the Great, and The Jew of Malta, in just six years. And at the age of 29, before Shakespeare had produced any of his greatest works, such as Hamlet, King Lear or Macbeth, Marlowe was stabbed to death in a tavern brawl. Unless, that is, you believe that he faked his death and resurfaced as the Bard of Avon. Marlowe was sceptical about religion (\"I count religion but a childish toy\") and unafraid to deal with homosexuality - either his own or others'.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Production on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie was hit by tragedy on Tuesday morning when a crew member was killed while building one of the film's sets. The accident occurred when a crane toppled to one side, crushing an as-yet-unnamed welder who was at work on a New York building fa\u00e7ade at the film's location in Downey, California. \"The studio and film-makers are deeply saddened and send condolences to all involved,\" the film's backers Sony said in a statement. \"We are co-operating fully with the authorities investigating the incident.\" Spider-Man stars Tobey Maguire as the web-slinging crime-fighter, Willem Dafoe as his nemesis the Green Goblin and Kirsten Dunst as love interest Mary Jane. \u0095 A broadsword used by Mel Gibson in Braveheart was the hottest property at a Unicef charity auction in New York yesterday. The sword went under the hammer for an impressive \u00a390,000, with the money raised being sent to combat the spread of Aids in Africa. The sale of movie memorabilia was hosted by Liam Neeson, who saw the lightsabre he used in The Phantom Menace sell for \u00a333,000. The other big winner was the Indiana Jones whip, which went for a whopping \u00a350,000. At the lower end of the scale were a shirt worn by Ralph Fiennes in The English Patient (\u00a31,300) and Catherine Zeta-Jones's dress from The Mask of Zorro (\u00a31,000). \u0095 Noah Wyle has signed to co-star opposite Jennifer Lopez in the Columbia thriller Enough, to be directed by Michael Apted. Written by Nicholas Kazan, the film will star Lopez as a woman on the run from her abusive husband (Billy Campbell). Wyle, still best known for his role in TV's ER, will play a mysterious mentor figure who pops up like a jack-in-the-box throughout the movie's twists and turns. \u0095 Wesley Snipes, Linda Fiorentino and Oliver Platt have all been corralled into Liberty Stands Still, a thriller co-financed by Lion's Gate and the German company Cinerenta. Written and directed by Kari Skogland, it sounds a schematic little affair, with Snipes playing a vengeful dad on the trail of the arms dealer (Fiorentino) who sold the gun that killed his daughter. \u0095 Tori Spelling, star of Beverly Hills 90210 and daughter of the show's creator Aaron Spelling, is to star in Scary Movie 2, Warner Brothers' follow-up to last year's phenomenally successful horror spoof. Spelling will join an original cast that includes Chris Elliott and brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans. Older brother Keenan Ivory Wayans will again be in the director's chair for the film which is slated to begin shooting at the end of this month.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>March 7:</strong> Creative advertising guru Trevor Beattie has reached his astrological mid-life crisis, writes <strong>Maggie Hyde</strong>.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Trevor Beattie, creative director of advertising agency TBWA/London, is a canny political Capricorn (December 24 1958).</p> <p>However, up until now, you might never have guessed it. </p> <p>This advertising guru started collecting jingles when other lads were collecting stamps. He loves flogging things and he's also a big boxing fan.</p> <p>Over the past few years, he has been ducking and weaving his way around a significant turning point - his astrological mid-life crisis. </p> <p>Known as the Uranus Half Return, this happens to everyone between the ages of 38 and 42 as Uranus, planet of independence and revolution, reaches a half-way point in its movement around the horoscope. </p> <p>It marks a now-or-never mood in a person's life, a feeling that if you don't start doing the things you were \"meant\" to do now, then you never will. </p> <p>So what was Beattie put on this planet to do? </p> <p>His achievements to date have reflected his talkative, Peter Pan Gemini Moon, perfect for art, media and communication: </p> <p>\"This specimen does not merely understand media. They are little radios that jabber, jabber, jabber all day long. They simply need to express themselves... Thy trash and thy trivia, it comforts them... And what an ear for accents, buzz-words, slang!\" (Debbie Kempton-Smith).</p> <p>This jabbering Moon opposes playful Mercury, the \"messenger of the gods\" and planet of commerce, in a line-up that \"can sell anyone anything\". </p> <p>When we add inventive Uranus to this, we have a true symbol of an advertising genius. </p> <p>All the astrology textbooks wax eloquent about the talents of this combination:</p> <p>\"These planets indicate original talent: they usually give a quick and capable mind, with a considerable degree of independence. The native is very clever in certain special directions... able to express himself well, and has a dramatic sense... He may coin striking phrases or, if a writer, he may invent characters that seize the popular imagination,\" (Charles Carter). </p> <p>So the wordplay of Beattie's French Connection FCUK campaign was written in the stars, just like his \"Hello boys\" for Wonderbra. </p> <p>It's a gift he can always draw on but, at this stage in his life, clever bits of advertising with a short shelf-life are not enough. </p> <p>In the next few years, Pluto pulls him towards grittier, more socially responsible commitments. </p> <p>Capricorn is a political sign and Beattie, a staunch socialist, has said handling the New Labour account in the run-up to the election is \"the greatest moment of my career\". </p> <p>His horoscope has stunning connections with the Labour party (February 27 1900). His Capricorn Sun is joined to Labour's Saturn, giving him the chance to make his mark on posterity. </p> <p>This year, he is still in a Uranus phase and, with his horoscope keyed in to Labour's own Uranus and its socially reformist agenda, he can push political advertising to new and provocative limits. </p> <p>The New Labour brief is just the beginning. By summer 2002, Beattie could get the chance to create an impact in areas of greater global concern, perhaps with campaigns for poverty, civil liberties or the third world. </p> <p>So it's bye-bye boys. Beattie is now about to punch his weight in the real world of political and social concern. </p> <p>Email the Media Medium at <a href=\"mailto:maggie@companyguide.co.uk\">maggie@companyguide.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Trevor Beattie, creative director of advertising agency TBWA/London, is a canny political Capricorn (December 24 1958). However, up until now, you might never have guessed it. This advertising guru started collecting jingles when other lads were collecting stamps. He loves flogging things and he's also a big boxing fan. Over the past few years, he has been ducking and weaving his way around a significant turning point - his astrological mid-life crisis. Known as the Uranus Half Return, this happens to everyone between the ages of 38 and 42 as Uranus, planet of independence and revolution, reaches a half-way point in its movement around the horoscope. It marks a now-or-never mood in a person's life, a feeling that if you don't start doing the things you were \"meant\" to do now, then you never will. So what was Beattie put on this planet to do? His achievements to date have reflected his talkative, Peter Pan Gemini Moon, perfect for art, media and communication: \"This specimen does not merely understand media. They are little radios that jabber, jabber, jabber all day long. They simply need to express themselves... Thy trash and thy trivia, it comforts them... And what an ear for accents, buzz-words, slang!\" (Debbie Kempton-Smith). This jabbering Moon opposes playful Mercury, the \"messenger of the gods\" and planet of commerce, in a line-up that \"can sell anyone anything\". When we add inventive Uranus to this, we have a true symbol of an advertising genius. All the astrology textbooks wax eloquent about the talents of this combination: \"These planets indicate original talent: they usually give a quick and capable mind, with a considerable degree of independence. The native is very clever in certain special directions... able to express himself well, and has a dramatic sense... He may coin striking phrases or, if a writer, he may invent characters that seize the popular imagination,\" (Charles Carter). So the wordplay of Beattie's French Connection FCUK campaign was written in the stars, just like his \"Hello boys\" for Wonderbra. It's a gift he can always draw on but, at this stage in his life, clever bits of advertising with a short shelf-life are not enough. In the next few years, Pluto pulls him towards grittier, more socially responsible commitments. Capricorn is a political sign and Beattie, a staunch socialist, has said handling the New Labour account in the run-up to the election is \"the greatest moment of my career\". His horoscope has stunning connections with the Labour party (February 27 1900). His Capricorn Sun is joined to Labour's Saturn, giving him the chance to make his mark on posterity. This year, he is still in a Uranus phase and, with his horoscope keyed in to Labour's own Uranus and its socially reformist agenda, he can push political advertising to new and provocative limits. The New Labour brief is just the beginning. By summer 2002, Beattie could get the chance to create an impact in areas of greater global concern, perhaps with campaigns for poverty, civil liberties or the third world. So it's bye-bye boys. Beattie is now about to punch his weight in the real world of political and social concern. Email the Media Medium at maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>We will see later today whether savings have been on Chancellor Gordon Brown's mind. They have certainly been the subject of a lot of recent thinking on the right and the centre left of politics. Traditional arguments in favour of savings - economic health and enhanced individual independence - have been advanced from both Labour and the Tories. The Tories say they want to scrap tax on savings for everyone apart from top-rate taxpayers at a cost of \u00a33bn. In his recent speech about second-term priorities, Tony Blair also made clear his desire to help \"young people accumulate assets early in life that give them a financial base for the future\".</p> <p>But savings touch on the distribution of wealth - which is why the government's policy on savings should be different.</p> <p>Tory proposals raised a cheer from those who are already wealthy but do not have to pay the top-rate of income tax (many affluent pensioners, for example).</p> <p>Excluding the very richest people from tax exemption bypasses the embarrassing problem of the Duke of Westminster receiving a windfall while average households count any gains they may receive in pennies. But most families on average income or below stand to gain little, if anything, from the Tories' exemption of savings from tax. To gain \u00a360 a year, individuals would need to have \u00a35,000 of savings. Those with the least will gain least.</p> <p>Though Labour has yet to come forward with detailed proposals on savings, government thinking can be pieced together from recent statements. Last year, as part of the pre-Budget report, the Treasury expressed its interest in helping low-to-middle income groups increase their savings. Reference was made to schemes in America where the government matches savings made by low-income individuals on a two-for-one basis.</p> <p>David Blunkett, the education secretary, has spoken passionately about the left's ideological mental block over the distribution of capital (as opposed to income) and asked how the government can help low-income parents save and invest in themselves and their children. Perhaps some clear red water may be opening up between Labour and the Tories on savings policy and on the role of the government in influencing the distribution of wealth.</p> <p>Underlying trends in the distribution of financial assets should make any self-respecting social democrat shudder. As the chart shows, the proportion of households without any assets whatsoever doubled between 1979-1996. Some 50% of adults have less than \u00a3500 of disposable financial wealth and between 47% and 64% of families earning under \u00a320,000 per annum have no savings at all.</p> <p>But Labour's renewal of interest in this area is also likely to be driven by the desire to promote social mobility. Ownership of assets can have a powerful effect on key social outcomes such as labour market performance, health and entrepreneurship. Moreover, policies aimed at those with low levels of savings appear to work. The experience of individual development accounts (IDAs) in over 30 states in the US shows those on low and moderate incomes are keen to save if they get the right incentives, information and support. Generous matching payments rather than tax reliefs are a key feature of successful policy.</p> <p>The approach by Labour and the Tories so far has been to encourage saving by means of tax exemption on the interest earned from savings schemes. All the evidence we have from Peps, Tessas and Isas is that tax relief only leads those who already have wealth to seek to reshuffle it. Tax relief does next to nothing for those with few or no financial assets. The next politician who declares that they want to encourage \"savings for all\" needs to be reminded of this.</p> <p>Recently, the Institute for Public Policy Research has set out a different approach. Our idea is a new deal for savers which breaks out of this conservative consensus on tax reliefs. The focus of our proposals would be a savings account based on a small cash endowment paid to every newborn child. This \"baby bond\" would be invested, and on becoming an adult, the young person would access the bond to fund education, homeownership and entrepreneurship. Parents, relatives and friends would be encouraged to make contributions into the account, with children from low- and moderate- income families benefiting from matching government contributions.</p> <p>Another policy option would be to boost the levels of financial security of low-to-moderate income adults by American-style development accounts which could be run by community and voluntary groups in areas where access to banks and building societies is difficult for people, or where there are high levels of illiteracy. Either of these could be introduced for a third of the cost of the Tory party's tax exemption proposals.</p> <p>Underpinning these ideas is the conviction that there is nothing God-given about the distribution of asset ownership in the UK. The inequality we now see resulted in no small part from policies which systematically benefited affluent households. The Tories have now thrown down the gauntlet on savings policy with a proposal which is likely to accentuate these problems. Labour needs to respond. A new deal for savers is needed which should offer something to everyone but give most benefit to those in low- and middle-income households. A radical second-term agenda demands nothing less.</p> <p>Sue Regan is at the Institute for Public Policy Research. <br><a href=\"mailto:s.regan@ippr.org.uk\">s.regan@ippr.org.uk</a></p> <p><br> <b>Game</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br> <a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>This will be an abnormal Budget speech from an abnormal chancellor. Normally Labour goes into an election having cocked up the economy, forcing the chancellor to deliver his final Budget against a backdrop of crisis, followed by drastic belt-tightening. Normally he has spent all the public's money in the first, flush years in office and is now scrambling to repair his mistake. Normally, he would have begun as Santa - and would now have to play Scrooge.</p> <p>But this is no normal Labour chancellor. Gordon Brown will announce neither spending cuts nor tax rises when he rises to deliver his fifth budget this afternoon. Instead he will break the Labour pattern by offering a blend of the exact opposite: yet another payola for the public services and a modest - \"responsible,\" he'll call it - tax cut for everyone else.</p> <p>He can do this because he has not been normal. Far from aping his Labour ancestors, who watched the economy spiral toward disaster, he has burnished a record superior to almost any of his predecessors, of either party. Even the International Monetary Fund has applauded his stewardship of an economy enjoying its longest stretch of growth without inflation for 30 years. He has pulled off the political equivalent of the double: record low inflation and low unemployment - and all just in time for polling day. With this year's surplus estimated at around \u00a316bn, Brown has at least \u00a33-4bn to play with this afternoon. Unlike his forebears, he wore the corset of restraint for his first two years, leaving him free to loosen a few buttons now. He began as Scrooge - so now he can play Santa.</p> <p>But it is not just today's Budget which breaks the conventional pattern. So does Gordon Brown himself. For while most politicians normally focus on the day-to-day, the quick fix designed to get them through tomorrow's headlines and next week's opinion polls, Brown has done the very opposite. He is that rarest of political creatures: a long-termist. And sometimes it costs him dear.</p> <p>Listen as he makes his case and you soon notice the difference. His goals are ambitious and stretch into the middle and further distance. He aims to halve child poverty in Britain by 2010. He wants to make Britain a land of full employment (we're already at 75%). He wishes to turn around five decades in which Britain was \"under-invested in\" and instead spend the money to secure decent, efficient public services. He wishes to do more than change the economic numbers: he wants to effect a cultural shift, by \"rehabilitating tax-and-spend\" in the public mind, restoring Britons' trust in government's ability to spend citizens' money wisely and in the common interest.</p> <p>He wants to make life easier for the nation's poorest and to restore the centrality, even dignity, of work. His ambitions are so large, his energy so restless, that he even has global dreams. He aims to follow his campaign for the richest nations to cancel third world debt with new, international initiatives on child literacy and cheap medicines for the sick.</p> <p>But all this focus on the big picture has come at a price. For Gordon Brown is sometimes so transfixed by the horizon, he misses the iceberg looming before him.</p> <p>The most obvious example is also Brown's most blatant error. So clear was he on his long-term plan for pensioners - involving a complex set of credits and benefits aimed at the worst-off - that last year he allowed himself to offer the elderly a measly 75p increase. Never mind his (true) claim that he has spent more on pensions than if he had simply restored the link to earnings, as Barbara Castle and her grey panthers were demanding. Never mind that 75p was the figure the Treasury statisticians and their computerised formula spat out. A regular, normal politician would have taken one look at that 75p and told the statisticians to invent another formula - one that produced an increase over the psychologically crucial \u00a31 mark.</p> <p>But Brown didn't notice the pensioners until it was too late. He had the same trouble with last September's fuel protests: the warning signs were there, but the chancellor either did not see or did not heed them. In the end, as with the pension increase, he had to act anyway - but only after he and the government were seen to have suffered a defeat.</p> <p>It is an irony that this master strategist - now commanding an election campaign which, he predicts, the right will fight more as a referendum on the government than a two-party choice between Labour and the Tories - sometimes forgets the basics. He sees the wood all right; it's just the twigs that trip him up.</p> <p>Often it's a simple matter of communication. Labour is still feeling the pain of its two-year spending freeze, for example, not least in the lethargy of core supporters who struggled to see the difference between New Labour and the Tories who'd set the spending limits in the first place. Brown himself saw the larger picture, reckoning the two-year starvation diet would give Labour the credibility it needed with the markets and swing voters to spend more public cash later. Brown was probably right - but he never properly explained that vision to the Labour faithful, the people whose enthusiasm this spring could be so decisive.</p> <p>The same can be said of Brown's battery of credits and measures designed to redistribute wealth to the poorest quarter of Britain's people. It has been one of the hallmarks of Brown's chancellorship and it is to be admired. But because it was redistribution by stealth - whispered, lest the horses of Middle England stir - he has got all too little credit for it.</p> <p>Even now on the partial privatisation of the London Underground, Brown has a good, if complex, case. The trouble is, he is so convinced of his own rightness he has barely roused himself to make the argument in public. In the stand-off between himself and the London mayor, he has left Ken Livingstone a clear run at winning the capital's hearts and minds, if only by default. The chancellor seems to believe that, so long as it all makes sense on Planet Brown, the rest of us will eventually cotton on. He forgets that to lead is also to explain.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest Gordon Brown is insufficiently political: only a fool could think that. He remains compulsively, viscerally political. Even his long-term, strategic management of the economy is pursued, in part, to ensure that, should he one day swap Number 11 for the house next door, he will inherit an economy as healthy as the one he can brag about today.</p> <p>And, make no mistake, he remains ceaseless in pursuit of that goal, still feverishly cultivating the Labour tribe - from the one-on-one meetings with backbench MPs to his ultra-charming, networking appearances at trade union receptions. He knows who has the power to elect Tony Blair's successor and he never forgets them.</p> <p>No, Gordon Brown is no slouch when it comes to politicking: that's why he wants a May 3 poll, to allow time for some of his previous Budget goodies to kick in during April. But with his eye so firmly on the future, he can miss the odd trick in the present. Still, don't hold your breath for a stumble this afternoon: he's a smart enough politician to have saved his best Budget for last.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com&quot;\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a> <br> <b>Game</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br> <a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>In the light of the disasters which have struck British farming in recent years, there is clearly a need for a radical review of agricultural markets and practices and the state's role as regulator and subsidiser. But the growing demand for a return to a pre-intensive, small farms environment would be both highly undesirable and impractical in terms of public safety, animal welfare and consumer value.</p> <p>When I joined the dairy industry 40 years ago, my father, a farmer in County Wicklow, paid his milkman \u00a3500 a year. Today on that same farm my son pays his milkman more than \u00a320,000 a year. My father was pleased if he achieved a yield from a cow of 400 gallons. My son gets a yield of 1,500 gallons. My father could only feed 40 cows, my son feeds 150. My father was delighted to achieve a yield of a ton an acre for his wheat. Today we are disappointed if we do not get three-and-a-half tons. Northern Dairies operated separate dairies to supply a population of 20,000 people. Express Dairies today has factories which supply a million people with milk.</p> <p>Forty years ago, people, mainly women, had to shop several times a week, visiting several different shops, because food did not keep very long and most food shops were specialist. Today, busy families with both partners working can do their food shopping in one place once a week. Complaints about supermarkets may have some basis, but the vast majority of the British public would be up in arms if the convenience, variety and value offered by supermarkets was denied to them.</p> <p>If this remarkable increase in productivity had not taken place, and consumers had to pay for the inflation of the past 40 years, the price of wheat would be more than \u00a31,000 a ton instead of \u00a370, and the farmer would be receiving more than \u00a32 per litre for milk compared with the admittedly untenable existing price of about 18p. Consumers would be paying more than \u00a32 for a loaf of bread, against less than 50p today, and a pint of milk would cost about \u00a32 compared with less than 35p in a supermarket now.</p> <p>Years ago, tuberculosis, mastitis and chronic lameness were rampant in dairy herds, the majority of pigs were fed swill, practically all livestock were sold through markets, chicken meat - which is generally recognised to be an essential part of a healthy diet - was far too expensive for the majority of the population and it was assumed that every raw chicken was a carrier of salmonella. My father's cowshed was a threat to the dairyman, the cow, and those who drank the milk and would be shut down today.</p> <p>Today, while still a scourge, tuberculosis, mastitis and lameness are relatively rare and controllable diseases in cows. Only 100 of our 12,000 pig producers are licensed to give swill to their pigs (and that is 100 too many, because of the potential risk of introducing infections such as foot and mouth and swine fever). Traditional livestock markets have dwindled in size, as farmers have elected to sell their stock direct to abattoirs rather than through middlemen. There are still far too many unnecessary sheep transactions through markets, because they have been the catalyst for spreading foot and mouth across the country in the past two weeks.</p> <p>While the creation of motorways has resulted in livestock, as well as humans, moving much greater distances, people were walking pigs to London from the south-west in the 19th century, boatloads of store cattle came in from Ireland in the 50s to be transported across England, and the Wall's bacon factory in west London bought live pigs from all over the country. Although people are understandably anxious about the intensive production methods of the poultry industry, almost everyone in this country now eats chicken, and the levels of salmonella, though still unacceptably high, are far less than they were a generation ago.</p> <p>If we wanted to recreate the country side of 40 years ago, either the consumer or the taxpayer would have to pay at least twice as much (an extra \u00a350bn) for food.</p> <p>If food prices in real terms matched those of 40 years ago, rickets would remain a widespread problem because poor people could not afford enough milk, and tuberculosis and foot and mouth would be an endemic scourge. The standards of food safety which had to be acceptable in those days would result in practically every farm and food factory being shut down today.</p> <p>A generation ago, Britain imported more than two-thirds of its food, whereas today that figure is less than a third, thereby contributing to a reduced trade deficit and a stronger, more stable currency. Furthermore, if we wanted to transform our food market to either a highly priced or massively subsidised one, we would have to withdraw from the European Union unless we could persuade all our partners to follow suit. And, in the unlikely event that Europe followed our somewhat eccentric route, we would have to reverse all our commitments to global free trade and reintroduce protectionist barriers against food imports from North America - which would in turn use barriers against our manufacturing exports.</p> <p>But while acknowledging that the structural, technological and scientific revolution of agriculture in Britain and the rest of the world has contributed significantly to our health and prosperity, especially that of the poor, the young and the old, it is also necessary to recognise the many shortcomings and potential dangers arising out of modern farming and food processing methods.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, arable farmers recklessly applied fertilisers and pesticides to their crops, and antibiotics to their animals. Although levels have reduced significantly, much more can be done to make their application compati ble with a sustainable environment without impairing economic viability and to reduce the use of animal medicines by paying more attention to the prevention of disease.</p> <p>Pigswill should be banned, and all livestock should move direct from farm to slaughterhouse without passing through disease-spreading markets. The markets will still play a role in moving cattle from breeding farms to fattening farms, but there is no need for animals to go through several transactions before reaching their final destination. The live export of livestock for slaughter on the continent is unnecessary, adds extra cost and disease-carrying risk, as well as causing too much stress to the animals. Over-intensive methods in pig, and especially poultry production, need to be reviewed, but only by agreement with our European Union partners and North America.</p> <p>One possible benefit arising out of the disaster of BSE is that we can at last reform the common agricultural policy (CAP) which is to blame for many disturbing and unsatisfactory practices. Subsidies encourage over-intensive methods, enabling farmers to plough up pastures for cereal production which are much more suitable for environmentally-friendly grass. The subsidy system is easily corrupted by middlemen. Its cost, while being minuscule compared with the proposal to create the countryside of the past, is still much too high.</p> <p>The CAP should be renamed the common environmental policy and redesigned, so that farmers have to earn a right to public support rather than being automatically entitled to it. They would be rewarded according to the environmental and husbandry standards they achieved by a system of farm accreditation which might, for example, have prevented the practices which probably initiated the current foot and mouth outbreak.</p> <p>It could be adopted to incentivise the less environmentally-conscious small farmers of new European Union members, such as Poland. It could be made flexible to meet the varying environmental needs of regions and countries. It would be consistent with free, fair global trade. And it would probably cost less.</p> <p>Farmers must also change their attitudes - from a culture of dependency to one of enterprise. Many have already developed non-farming enterprises and alternative work opportunities to supplement their income. Much more can be done. Farmers must be more sensitive to the views of others in society, but the latter must not be unreasonably obstructive about plans to increase business activity in the countryside.</p> <p>As long as the supply of food exceeds demand in the market, there will be downward pressure on prices from consumers and, therefore, from retailers. In other countries, even the US, farmers have created cooperatives to strengthen their buying and selling power. Such co-operation, though growing slowly in Britain, is very underdeveloped. Powerful competition laws already control retailer behaviour, but there is a strong case for codes of best practice between suppliers and retailers which would reinforce the obligation of retailers to be fair in their dealings with their suppliers.</p> <p>And finally, while there have been serious failures in scientific innovation - most notably in the feeding of animal protein to cows - the benefits of such innovation far exceed the harm. We must find better ways of monitoring scientific innovation, including genetic modification.

      "bodyText": "In the light of the disasters which have struck British farming in recent years, there is clearly a need for a radical review of agricultural markets and practices and the state's role as regulator and subsidiser. But the growing demand for a return to a pre-intensive, small farms environment would be both highly undesirable and impractical in terms of public safety, animal welfare and consumer value. When I joined the dairy industry 40 years ago, my father, a farmer in County Wicklow, paid his milkman \u00a3500 a year. Today on that same farm my son pays his milkman more than \u00a320,000 a year. My father was pleased if he achieved a yield from a cow of 400 gallons. My son gets a yield of 1,500 gallons. My father could only feed 40 cows, my son feeds 150. My father was delighted to achieve a yield of a ton an acre for his wheat. Today we are disappointed if we do not get three-and-a-half tons. Northern Dairies operated separate dairies to supply a population of 20,000 people. Express Dairies today has factories which supply a million people with milk. Forty years ago, people, mainly women, had to shop several times a week, visiting several different shops, because food did not keep very long and most food shops were specialist. Today, busy families with both partners working can do their food shopping in one place once a week. Complaints about supermarkets may have some basis, but the vast majority of the British public would be up in arms if the convenience, variety and value offered by supermarkets was denied to them. If this remarkable increase in productivity had not taken place, and consumers had to pay for the inflation of the past 40 years, the price of wheat would be more than \u00a31,000 a ton instead of \u00a370, and the farmer would be receiving more than \u00a32 per litre for milk compared with the admittedly untenable existing price of about 18p. Consumers would be paying more than \u00a32 for a loaf of bread, against less than 50p today, and a pint of milk would cost about \u00a32 compared with less than 35p in a supermarket now. Years ago, tuberculosis, mastitis and chronic lameness were rampant in dairy herds, the majority of pigs were fed swill, practically all livestock were sold through markets, chicken meat - which is generally recognised to be an essential part of a healthy diet - was far too expensive for the majority of the population and it was assumed that every raw chicken was a carrier of salmonella. My father's cowshed was a threat to the dairyman, the cow, and those who drank the milk and would be shut down today. Today, while still a scourge, tuberculosis, mastitis and lameness are relatively rare and controllable diseases in cows. Only 100 of our 12,000 pig producers are licensed to give swill to their pigs (and that is 100 too many, because of the potential risk of introducing infections such as foot and mouth and swine fever). Traditional livestock markets have dwindled in size, as farmers have elected to sell their stock direct to abattoirs rather than through middlemen. There are still far too many unnecessary sheep transactions through markets, because they have been the catalyst for spreading foot and mouth across the country in the past two weeks. While the creation of motorways has resulted in livestock, as well as humans, moving much greater distances, people were walking pigs to London from the south-west in the 19th century, boatloads of store cattle came in from Ireland in the 50s to be transported across England, and the Wall's bacon factory in west London bought live pigs from all over the country. Although people are understandably anxious about the intensive production methods of the poultry industry, almost everyone in this country now eats chicken, and the levels of salmonella, though still unacceptably high, are far less than they were a generation ago. If we wanted to recreate the country side of 40 years ago, either the consumer or the taxpayer would have to pay at least twice as much (an extra \u00a350bn) for food. If food prices in real terms matched those of 40 years ago, rickets would remain a widespread problem because poor people could not afford enough milk, and tuberculosis and foot and mouth would be an endemic scourge. The standards of food safety which had to be acceptable in those days would result in practically every farm and food factory being shut down today. A generation ago, Britain imported more than two-thirds of its food, whereas today that figure is less than a third, thereby contributing to a reduced trade deficit and a stronger, more stable currency. Furthermore, if we wanted to transform our food market to either a highly priced or massively subsidised one, we would have to withdraw from the European Union unless we could persuade all our partners to follow suit. And, in the unlikely event that Europe followed our somewhat eccentric route, we would have to reverse all our commitments to global free trade and reintroduce protectionist barriers against food imports from North America - which would in turn use barriers against our manufacturing exports. But while acknowledging that the structural, technological and scientific revolution of agriculture in Britain and the rest of the world has contributed significantly to our health and prosperity, especially that of the poor, the young and the old, it is also necessary to recognise the many shortcomings and potential dangers arising out of modern farming and food processing methods. Twenty years ago, arable farmers recklessly applied fertilisers and pesticides to their crops, and antibiotics to their animals. Although levels have reduced significantly, much more can be done to make their application compati ble with a sustainable environment without impairing economic viability and to reduce the use of animal medicines by paying more attention to the prevention of disease. Pigswill should be banned, and all livestock should move direct from farm to slaughterhouse without passing through disease-spreading markets. The markets will still play a role in moving cattle from breeding farms to fattening farms, but there is no need for animals to go through several transactions before reaching their final destination. The live export of livestock for slaughter on the continent is unnecessary, adds extra cost and disease-carrying risk, as well as causing too much stress to the animals. Over-intensive methods in pig, and especially poultry production, need to be reviewed, but only by agreement with our European Union partners and North America. One possible benefit arising out of the disaster of BSE is that we can at last reform the common agricultural policy (CAP) which is to blame for many disturbing and unsatisfactory practices. Subsidies encourage over-intensive methods, enabling farmers to plough up pastures for cereal production which are much more suitable for environmentally-friendly grass. The subsidy system is easily corrupted by middlemen. Its cost, while being minuscule compared with the proposal to create the countryside of the past, is still much too high. The CAP should be renamed the common environmental policy and redesigned, so that farmers have to earn a right to public support rather than being automatically entitled to it. They would be rewarded according to the environmental and husbandry standards they achieved by a system of farm accreditation which might, for example, have prevented the practices which probably initiated the current foot and mouth outbreak. It could be adopted to incentivise the less environmentally-conscious small farmers of new European Union members, such as Poland. It could be made flexible to meet the varying environmental needs of regions and countries. It would be consistent with free, fair global trade. And it would probably cost less. Farmers must also change their attitudes - from a culture of dependency to one of enterprise. Many have already developed non-farming enterprises and alternative work opportunities to supplement their income. Much more can be done. Farmers must be more sensitive to the views of others in society, but the latter must not be unreasonably obstructive about plans to increase business activity in the countryside. As long as the supply of food exceeds demand in the market, there will be downward pressure on prices from consumers and, therefore, from retailers. In other countries, even the US, farmers have created cooperatives to strengthen their buying and selling power. Such co-operation, though growing slowly in Britain, is very underdeveloped. Powerful competition laws already control retailer behaviour, but there is a strong case for codes of best practice between suppliers and retailers which would reinforce the obligation of retailers to be fair in their dealings with their suppliers. And finally, while there have been serious failures in scientific innovation - most notably in the feeding of animal protein to cows - the benefits of such innovation far exceed the harm. We must find better ways of monitoring scientific innovation, including genetic modification. If we deny the science we put at risk the lives of 3bn additional global citizens anticipated in 30 years' time. They will go hungry if scientists fail to find ways of increasing global production of safe food by 50%. This is not just a middle-class British issue, it is one which affects the billions of poor people in the world.

      "bodyText": "A TV advert for a chicken sauce has been banned because it offended British Hindus. Watchdogs have warned advertisers to be more sensitive over religious faiths after a series of complaints about the commercial for Chicken Tonight. The Independent Television Commission ruling comes just months after the manufacturers of the alcoholic drink Reef were censured for portraying the haka, a Maori tribal dance, in an advert for the product. The Chicken Tonight advert shows a woman meditating in front of a chicken. The ITC said the combination of her Hindi-style chanting and the fact that the advert was for a meat-related product had offended the largely vegetarian Hindu population. The watchdog received 16 complaints about the commercial, in which the woman chants to a ready-to-eat chicken before telling the bird, \"You can't just sit there with your legs crossed, you're going to have to chant as well.\" Chicken Tonight manufacturer Unilever yesterday apologised for the advert and said it had not meant to cause offence. \"Both the haka and the meditation adverts were a case of people complaining of personal offence to their culture or religion,\" said an ITC spokeswoman. \"In both cases - where the haka was linked to alcohol and the sauce to meat-eating - they were particularly offensive. \"Our guidelines are very clear on the need to avoid treatments that use stereotyped images or denigrate religion.\" But the ITC rejected 60 complaints about an advert for Kronenberg 1664 in which a succession of men fall victim to gory accidents because they are distracted by a woman's pint.

And speculation abounds that a weekday slot on BBC2 could be the answer to one of the BBC's trickiest scheduling problems. High-level discussions are thought to be going on between BBC director general Greg Dyke, head of news Richard Sambrook and director of television Mark Thompson. But nothing has been decided and there are fears that a midweek slot on BBC1 could still be a disaster in the ratings. A weekday slot on BBC2 has been mooted before by the BBC when it planned to move Panorama out of its former slot on Monday night. Sources say it would be difficult to see how Panorama could survive in a weekday primetime slot on BBC1 if the programme length stays at 40 minutes. Options considered before the show was moved to Sunday night were Monday at 7.30pm or Wednesday at 9.30pm. The former was ruled out because it would pit the programme against Coronation Street on ITV. It was felt it could do well in the ratings and provide an alternative but the slot was too difficult to sustain. The Wednesday slot was also deemed tough. News chiefs considered shortening the programme but ultimately decided it may lose some of its impact if it was cut back to 29 minutes. \"Dyke and Thompson have been considering a move but how serious it is I don't know,\" said one insider. \"Richard Sambrook has signalled very clearly that he wants to give current affairs a higher priority, and Mark Thompson also believes that the Sunday night 10pm slot does not do justice to Panorama.\" \"Sunday may just have been a transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would increase its audience and get more share. Sunday night is just a killer slot. No matter how good the stories are it doesn't have the impact on the audience,\" the source added. \"BBC1 is so tough now. You have to fight like a dog to hold onto share, the answer may well be BBC2.\" The debate about the flagship current affairs programme was revived last week after the programme won the Royal Television Society's prestigious journalist of the year award for presenter John Ware. Mr Ware, who secured the award for his investigation of the bombing of Omagh, has called again for the BBC to put the programme into a more prominent slot. \"I and all my colleagues hope that eventually the BBC will reinstate this programme in a weekday slot, where most of us think it should be,\" he told MediaGuardian.co.uk. Panorama was shifted to Sunday night last year as part of the shake-up to BBC1's schedules which centred on the Nine O'Clock News being switched by 10pm. A BBC spokesman denied anything was in the pipeline and said that Panorama would come back in the autumn in its usual Sunday night slot. Related story Jan 21: Panorama's popularity plummets",

      "body": "<p>Uniformed men in stab-proof vests patrol the mean streets . . . sounds almost like a scene from an American TV cop show. But this isn't Dallas or Detroit - it's Darlington. And these aren't cops - they are the new breed of \"warden\" law enforcers who could soon become a familiar sight in other British cities and towns. </p> <p>Last week's announcement by home secretary Jack Straw that police-accredited private security patrols are to be introduced outside schools, commuter stations and other busy public places sparked controversy. But, in effect, many neighbourhood wardens already carry out the patrol duties set out in the government's 10-year crime plan. </p> <p>The aim of the wardens, employed in most cases by local authorities or social landlords, is to prevent crime - and, more importantly, reduce the fear of crime - by providing a uniformed presence in crime hotspots, town centres and council estates. In Darlington, County Durham, wardens patrol alongside a beat officer and can impose on-the-spot fines of up to \u00a3100 on people caught dropping litter or allowing their dogs to foul the pavement. But, like all wardens, they have no powers of arrest. </p> <p>\"If they see a fight on a Saturday night, they will shepherd people out of danger's way while their police colleague will deal with the affray,\" says Andy Errington, head of the local council's youth offending and community safety service. </p> <p>Since Darlington's three wardens sprung into action a year ago, they have become far and away the authority's most popular service, receiving an 85% approval rating from the public as well as contributing to a 40% reduction in crime in one area. Now the council is looking to recruit a further seven wardens with a \u00a3120,750 grant from the government's neighbourhood warden scheme. </p> <p>The \u00a313.5m scheme - introduced last year and jointly funded by the Home Office and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions - allocated \u00a37.5m to 50 schemes last September and a further \u00a34.8m to 36 schemes last month, bringing the total number of wardens recruited under the initiative in England and Wales to 445. The Darlington patrols represent the \"hard\" enforcement end of the neighbourhood warden model. </p> <p>Other types include super-caretakers, pioneered by the Peabody Trust housing group, whereby wardens combine odd jobs with patrolling; property-led schemes, like the 24-hour patrols in Swansea which have reduced vandalism of empty council homes and prevented heating systems being stolen; and community-based initiatives along the lines of Safer Merthyr Tydfil (SMT), a charity. What they all share is wardens who are paid employees, not vigilante volunteers. </p> <p>\"Our wardens are chosen for their life skills, not for a gung ho attitude,\" says Roger Mitchell, SMT project coordinator. </p> <p>Launching the government's neighbourhood warden scheme, Home Office minister Charles Clarke declared: \"They can improve communication between the police, residents and the local authority and mediate in minor incidents of anti-social behaviour.\" </p> <p>This certainly seems true in Merthyr Tydfil. Local lads Marc Watkins, a former holiday camp red coat, and Rob Cunningham, who used to stack supermarket shelves, have been patrolling the streets of the Penydarren ward since January last year. Between 8am and 4.30pm from Monday to Friday, they check for broken paving stones, unsightly rubbish, street lights that need replacing and abandoned vehicles, stopping to listen to people's concerns, which they report to whichever organisation can best solve the problem. \"Helping people gives you a great sense of achievement in this job,\" says Cunningham. </p> <p>Trained in first aid, customer care and calming potentially violent situ ations, they have become community heroes for their actions - such as rescuing an elderly woman who had fallen in her kitchen. </p> <p>The community advice centre, from which they operate, has also become a focal point. \"The community are glad to see us,\" says Watkins. \"They say: 'Keep up the good work.' Once the kids see we're not PC Plod, they come and talk to us.\" </p> <p>There will soon be 15 wardens across the borough, and Susan Cousins, executive director of SMT, describes them as \"the eyes and ears of the community\". She points out: \"They are not just narks for the police. We have become arms-length community safety for the local authority.\" </p> <p>An evaluation of Penydarren's first year found that of the 700 referrals made by the wardens, 273 were requests to the borough council; a further 333 were inquiries from people wanting free locks fitted under SMT's zero tolerance campaign; and 78 were tip-offs to the police about criminal activity. Crime fell 40% between April and September last year, compared to the same period a year earlier, from 254 to 151 incidents. And, within these figures, there was a 64% decrease in vehicle crime from 161 to 58 cases. </p> <p>Of 50 residents interviewed for the evaluation, 72% thought cases of nuisance had decreased and 58% thought there was less crime in the area. Yet the scheme appears to have been less successful in quelling people's fear of crime. Less than half said they were not as fearful as before. The scheme also failed to prevent burglaries, which increased 54% from 13 to 20. </p> <p>Brian Evleigh, author of the evaluation report, attributes the limitations to the wardens' hours. \"There is an argument for patrolling in the early evening and at weekends,\" he says. One local resident, who prefers not to be named, puts it more forcefully: \"Crime doesn't happen during the day and it doesn't stop at Christmas.\" </p> <p>The government is adamant that wardens are not a poor man's police force - although their salaries are significantly less than a beat officer's - and stresses that wardens complement the police service, freeing up officers' time to focus on serious crime. </p> <p>The Police Federation, which rep resents the force's rank and file, disagrees. \"Eight out of 10 people want to see more police on the streets,\" says Fred Broughton, the federation's chair. \"We share the public's view.

Discussions would be better directed at the future of the police service, not a cheap alternative.\" </p> <p>There is also concern that once an area has a warden patrol, limited police resources will be sent elsewhere to neighbourhoods without such a \"second-tier police force\". And a further criticism is that the schemes are funding-led: the government initiative requires match funding, resulting in many single regeneration budget areas securing wardens at the expense of others. Likewise, the Penydarren scheme was introduced not because it is the crime hotspot of Merthyr Tydfil, but because it was eligible for European regional development funding. </p> <p>Chief Inspector Trevor Morris, of South Wales police, can see both sides of the argument. \"If you asked me whether we wanted wardens or not, I'd say we'd have them and ensure that they were used effectively in conjunction with police officers and special constables,\" he says. \"We are lucky to have a good partnership with Safer Merthyr Tydfil and the local authority on this scheme. We have worked together on a couple of truancy operations, where wardens acted as spotters. There are certain offences, such as anti-social behaviour and neighbourhood nuisance, that they can deal with before they come to the police's notice.\" Although Morris is unable to confirm that wardens have freed up police time, he is clear that they are not a ploy to counter falling numbers on his patch, where he says there have been no recruitment problems. With a current drive to employ non-police staff to take over back office administration tasks, he is shortly expecting more bobbies on the beat. The Home Office expects that, under the crime plan, the police will continue to develop relations with neighbourhood wardens and will forge new links with the private security industry. A spokeswoman says: \"Security guards, wardens, park attendants, caretakers - the idea is that the police will co-ordinate all these types of activities that can contribute to overall public safety.\" </p> <p><strong>What price peace of mind?</strong></p> <p>The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust has taken a different tack on crime prevention.

      "bodyText": "Uniformed men in stab-proof vests patrol the mean streets . . . sounds almost like a scene from an American TV cop show. But this isn't Dallas or Detroit - it's Darlington. And these aren't cops - they are the new breed of \"warden\" law enforcers who could soon become a familiar sight in other British cities and towns. Last week's announcement by home secretary Jack Straw that police-accredited private security patrols are to be introduced outside schools, commuter stations and other busy public places sparked controversy. But, in effect, many neighbourhood wardens already carry out the patrol duties set out in the government's 10-year crime plan. The aim of the wardens, employed in most cases by local authorities or social landlords, is to prevent crime - and, more importantly, reduce the fear of crime - by providing a uniformed presence in crime hotspots, town centres and council estates. In Darlington, County Durham, wardens patrol alongside a beat officer and can impose on-the-spot fines of up to \u00a3100 on people caught dropping litter or allowing their dogs to foul the pavement. But, like all wardens, they have no powers of arrest. \"If they see a fight on a Saturday night, they will shepherd people out of danger's way while their police colleague will deal with the affray,\" says Andy Errington, head of the local council's youth offending and community safety service. Since Darlington's three wardens sprung into action a year ago, they have become far and away the authority's most popular service, receiving an 85% approval rating from the public as well as contributing to a 40% reduction in crime in one area. Now the council is looking to recruit a further seven wardens with a \u00a3120,750 grant from the government's neighbourhood warden scheme. The \u00a313.5m scheme - introduced last year and jointly funded by the Home Office and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions - allocated \u00a37.5m to 50 schemes last September and a further \u00a34.8m to 36 schemes last month, bringing the total number of wardens recruited under the initiative in England and Wales to 445. The Darlington patrols represent the \"hard\" enforcement end of the neighbourhood warden model. Other types include super-caretakers, pioneered by the Peabody Trust housing group, whereby wardens combine odd jobs with patrolling; property-led schemes, like the 24-hour patrols in Swansea which have reduced vandalism of empty council homes and prevented heating systems being stolen; and community-based initiatives along the lines of Safer Merthyr Tydfil (SMT), a charity. What they all share is wardens who are paid employees, not vigilante volunteers. \"Our wardens are chosen for their life skills, not for a gung ho attitude,\" says Roger Mitchell, SMT project coordinator. Launching the government's neighbourhood warden scheme, Home Office minister Charles Clarke declared: \"They can improve communication between the police, residents and the local authority and mediate in minor incidents of anti-social behaviour.\" This certainly seems true in Merthyr Tydfil. Local lads Marc Watkins, a former holiday camp red coat, and Rob Cunningham, who used to stack supermarket shelves, have been patrolling the streets of the Penydarren ward since January last year. Between 8am and 4.30pm from Monday to Friday, they check for broken paving stones, unsightly rubbish, street lights that need replacing and abandoned vehicles, stopping to listen to people's concerns, which they report to whichever organisation can best solve the problem. \"Helping people gives you a great sense of achievement in this job,\" says Cunningham. Trained in first aid, customer care and calming potentially violent situ ations, they have become community heroes for their actions - such as rescuing an elderly woman who had fallen in her kitchen. The community advice centre, from which they operate, has also become a focal point. \"The community are glad to see us,\" says Watkins. \"They say: 'Keep up the good work.' Once the kids see we're not PC Plod, they come and talk to us.\" There will soon be 15 wardens across the borough, and Susan Cousins, executive director of SMT, describes them as \"the eyes and ears of the community\". She points out: \"They are not just narks for the police. We have become arms-length community safety for the local authority.\" An evaluation of Penydarren's first year found that of the 700 referrals made by the wardens, 273 were requests to the borough council; a further 333 were inquiries from people wanting free locks fitted under SMT's zero tolerance campaign; and 78 were tip-offs to the police about criminal activity. Crime fell 40% between April and September last year, compared to the same period a year earlier, from 254 to 151 incidents. And, within these figures, there was a 64% decrease in vehicle crime from 161 to 58 cases. Of 50 residents interviewed for the evaluation, 72% thought cases of nuisance had decreased and 58% thought there was less crime in the area. Yet the scheme appears to have been less successful in quelling people's fear of crime. Less than half said they were not as fearful as before. The scheme also failed to prevent burglaries, which increased 54% from 13 to 20. Brian Evleigh, author of the evaluation report, attributes the limitations to the wardens' hours. \"There is an argument for patrolling in the early evening and at weekends,\" he says.

      "body": "<p>Sceptics had their doubts about Homeshare. Many said that it simply wouldn't work, that the idea of young people being happy to live with, and help out, the elderly - albeit for a minimal rent - was unlikely to take off. Yet almost eight years on, the scheme is a fixture in London and is now spreading elsewhere. </p> <p>\"It's the simplicity of the idea that has led to its success,\" says Helen Collumbine, who has been running Homeshare for the last year. \"Householders obviously benefit, while their families love us because we take the worry off their shoulders. No money is exchanged between the two people living in the same house, and that helps, too. It takes away any sense that it's a business arrangement.\" </p> <p>Homeshare started in 1993 in London and recently opened offices in Oxford, Brighton and Colchester. It is a charitable organisation that places younger people, who could be working or studying, in the home of an elderly person. The average householder is in his or her 70s, while the younger person - the homesharer -has to be what Collumbine calls \"mature\", usually 25 or older. </p> <p>\"We advertise wherever young or old people go,\" she says, \"and that might be in TNT [a free London newspaper aimed at young travellers], the local paper or a doctor's surgery.\" </p> <p>Householders may apply directly to the project, although some are recommended by GPs or social workers. \"The referral can be for any reason,\" says Collumbine. \"A family might be concerned about their parent being alone at night after a fall or a hospital stay. Some elderly people also suffer from memory loss and their children are keen simply for someone to lock up at night.\" </p> <p>Night-times are crucial and there are strict rules about the homesharer being around. They must sleep over every night and they get just one weekend off a month. They are allowed out on the occasional evening but must be in for at least four evenings a week. </p> <p>The homesharer pays \u00a350 a month to Homeshare, while the householder pays \u00a365. In addition, the younger person is required to do 10 hours of housework a week - cooking, shopping or light cleaning. This demand often puts off possible homesharers, initially tempted by the prospect of low rent. </p> <p>But housework is not the only reason why many younger inquirers realise that Homeshare isn't for them. There are other rules. \"They have to commit for six months and not be in a relationship,\" says Collumbine. \"We need them to focus their energy on the person they're living with and if they start a relationship during their stint, they are asked to leave.\" </p> <p>Patricia Angadi, 86, lives in north London. She has had homesharers for four years and is very happy with the scheme. \"I had lodgers before, but this is better,\" she says. \"It stops me from being lonely, but you also don't get bothered during the day because they go out.\" </p> <p>Her current homesharer is 37-year-old Tiina Tuliola from Finland. A trained carer, she is used to working with elderly people and has been a homesharer before. </p> <p>\"She's particularly good,\" says Angadi, \"but I've had all sorts. I had one who was chaotic and used to leave the kitchen in a real state and another who started a relationship and spent evenings at her boyfriend's house. I've also had some very good ones I still keep in touch with.\" </p> <p>Her son Shankara is impressed by the scheme. \"It has transformed my mother's life,\" he says. \"She lives in a nice flat surrounded by nice things but we started to think about whether it was going to be possible for her to continue to live there at all. The fact that there's somebody else there makes a colossal difference.\" </p> <p>Shankara and his brother, who both live an hour's drive away from their mother, used to worry about her safety but now feel happier. \"This gives us and my mother security,\" he says. \"It's a real relief.\" </p> <p>For Tuliola, Homeshare has been a good way to absorb British culture: \"I learn about the language and the lifestyle. London can be a bit overwhelming and this is a secure way of starting life here. </p> <p>\"It works both ways,\" she adds. \"I cook dinner and we eat it together. We keep each other company.\" </p> <p>Shankara's only concern is that Homeshare might expand too fast. \"What's really impressed me is that the people who run it know the ins and outs of the characters, and that's why it works,\" he says. \"They have enormous depth of understanding and I don't know how they would retain that if they grow too fast.\" </p> <p>Collumbine takes heed of the warning. \"We're very careful in the way we run Homeshare,\" she says. \"It takes time and effort to match people up and we don't want to risk that. </p> <p>\"At the moment, we want to look after what we've got. That's the priority.\" </p> <p><strong>Good moves from the matchmakers</strong></p> <p>Lisa Brown, a 25-year-old lawyer from New Zealand, is about to move in with 89-year-old Dorothy Edis in the centre of Brighton. \"It appealed because you're living more or less rent free,\" she says. \"But that wasn't the only reason. I also wanted to do it because I love old people and enjoy their company. I talk a lot and they seem to enjoy that.\" </p> <p>She is not bothered by the restrictions but realises they could be problematic for others. \"You have to be in my sort of situation or happily single to do something like this.

      "bodyText": "Sceptics had their doubts about Homeshare. Many said that it simply wouldn't work, that the idea of young people being happy to live with, and help out, the elderly - albeit for a minimal rent - was unlikely to take off. Yet almost eight years on, the scheme is a fixture in London and is now spreading elsewhere. \"It's the simplicity of the idea that has led to its success,\" says Helen Collumbine, who has been running Homeshare for the last year. \"Householders obviously benefit, while their families love us because we take the worry off their shoulders. No money is exchanged between the two people living in the same house, and that helps, too. It takes away any sense that it's a business arrangement.\" Homeshare started in 1993 in London and recently opened offices in Oxford, Brighton and Colchester. It is a charitable organisation that places younger people, who could be working or studying, in the home of an elderly person. The average householder is in his or her 70s, while the younger person - the homesharer -has to be what Collumbine calls \"mature\", usually 25 or older. \"We advertise wherever young or old people go,\" she says, \"and that might be in TNT [a free London newspaper aimed at young travellers], the local paper or a doctor's surgery.\" Householders may apply directly to the project, although some are recommended by GPs or social workers. \"The referral can be for any reason,\" says Collumbine. \"A family might be concerned about their parent being alone at night after a fall or a hospital stay. Some elderly people also suffer from memory loss and their children are keen simply for someone to lock up at night.\" Night-times are crucial and there are strict rules about the homesharer being around. They must sleep over every night and they get just one weekend off a month. They are allowed out on the occasional evening but must be in for at least four evenings a week. The homesharer pays \u00a350 a month to Homeshare, while the householder pays \u00a365. In addition, the younger person is required to do 10 hours of housework a week - cooking, shopping or light cleaning. This demand often puts off possible homesharers, initially tempted by the prospect of low rent. But housework is not the only reason why many younger inquirers realise that Homeshare isn't for them. There are other rules. \"They have to commit for six months and not be in a relationship,\" says Collumbine. \"We need them to focus their energy on the person they're living with and if they start a relationship during their stint, they are asked to leave.\" Patricia Angadi, 86, lives in north London. She has had homesharers for four years and is very happy with the scheme. \"I had lodgers before, but this is better,\" she says. \"It stops me from being lonely, but you also don't get bothered during the day because they go out.\" Her current homesharer is 37-year-old Tiina Tuliola from Finland. A trained carer, she is used to working with elderly people and has been a homesharer before. \"She's particularly good,\" says Angadi, \"but I've had all sorts. I had one who was chaotic and used to leave the kitchen in a real state and another who started a relationship and spent evenings at her boyfriend's house. I've also had some very good ones I still keep in touch with.\" Her son Shankara is impressed by the scheme. \"It has transformed my mother's life,\" he says. \"She lives in a nice flat surrounded by nice things but we started to think about whether it was going to be possible for her to continue to live there at all. The fact that there's somebody else there makes a colossal difference.\" Shankara and his brother, who both live an hour's drive away from their mother, used to worry about her safety but now feel happier. \"This gives us and my mother security,\" he says. \"It's a real relief.\" For Tuliola, Homeshare has been a good way to absorb British culture: \"I learn about the language and the lifestyle. London can be a bit overwhelming and this is a secure way of starting life here. \"It works both ways,\" she adds. \"I cook dinner and we eat it together. We keep each other company.\" Shankara's only concern is that Homeshare might expand too fast. \"What's really impressed me is that the people who run it know the ins and outs of the characters, and that's why it works,\" he says. \"They have enormous depth of understanding and I don't know how they would retain that if they grow too fast.\" Collumbine takes heed of the warning. \"We're very careful in the way we run Homeshare,\" she says. \"It takes time and effort to match people up and we don't want to risk that. \"At the moment, we want to look after what we've got. That's the priority.\" Good moves from the matchmakers Lisa Brown, a 25-year-old lawyer from New Zealand, is about to move in with 89-year-old Dorothy Edis in the centre of Brighton. \"It appealed because you're living more or less rent free,\" she says. \"But that wasn't the only reason. I also wanted to do it because I love old people and enjoy their company. I talk a lot and they seem to enjoy that.\" She is not bothered by the restrictions but realises they could be problematic for others. \"You have to be in my sort of situation or happily single to do something like this. My boyfriend is back in New Zealand for the next six months so to sleep here seven nights a week isn't a problem.\" Brown had to go through a lengthy interview process before she was accepted by Homeshare. \"They're keen to match you up properly,\" she says. \"They want to find out your interests, so they ask you all sorts of questions, from whether you smoke to what kind of television programmes you like.

Now it is tackling the issue in a different way, by piloting a scheme to get prostitutes not only off the streets but out of the business altogether. </p> <p>The women, many of whom are trapped in prostitution because they are hooked on drugs, deep in debt or the victims of domestic violence, will be offered \"exit strategies\" including addiction treatment, help with housing, money advice and protection from violent pimps. </p> <p>The scheme is being drawn up by Sheffield's prostitution forum, which includes police, local councillors, university employees, health staff, drugs counsellors and outreach workers. Matt Dixon, who chairs the forum, says: \"Our priorities are the women's health and safety, but we also want to find ways of getting prostitution out of residential areas.\" </p> <p>A study last week suggested that more than 80% of street prostitutes have been attacked while working. The finding came from a survey of three cities, including Glasgow, where a scheme similar to Sheffield's began last October and is now working with 30 women. </p> <p>The approach involves a wide range of agencies - most crucially, groups which have the confidence of prostitutes. The Sheffield scheme will rely heavily on the expertise of the Sheffield Working Women's Opportunities Project (Swwop). With two colleagues and volunteers, project worker Sali Harwood spends three nights a week in the city's red light area, giving advice and information to the 260 prostitutes who work the streets between the city centre and Sheffield University. </p> <p>\"The women trust us and, if they meet staff in our van and get to know them by name, they are much more likely to keep follow-up appointments at the sexual health clinic or [the charity] Turning Point's community drugs project,\" Harwood says. \"The majority of women on the streets have a drugs problem and they have to keep working to pay for it. There is always going to be prostitution, but we must try to make things safer for the women - and offer a way out for those who want to come off drugs and leave the streets.\" </p> <p>Dixon acknowledges: \"We need outreach workers like the people from Swwop if the project is to be a success, because they have gained the confidence of the women. It could never get off the ground if it was just coming from the police and politicians.\" </p> <p>Two recent plans to decriminalise prostitution in Sheffield have failed in the face of protests. Four years ago, proposals for a red light tolerance zone were abandoned after complaints from residents whose homes bordered the area. Then, when the Liberal Democrats gained control of the city council in 1999, they wanted to introduce registration of the city's saunas and brothels. That idea was dropped after the Sunday Sport newspaper ran a story urging readers: \"Come to Sheffield.\" </p> <p>Dixon, a 22-year-old LibDem councillor, remains an advocate of registration of saunas and brothels and believes it will have to be introduced if street prostitution is to be eradicated. Meanwhile, he intends to focus on helping women who wish to escape the lifestyle. </p> <p>Support will have to be available for as long as the women need it, Dixon says. \"It's like coming out of prison and into the same situation that led a person into crime in the first place. These women have friends still working on the streets and, in many cases, their boyfriends are also their pimps and their drug dealers. They can't go back to all that if they are to stay off drugs and prostitution. It could mean having to relocate them to another area. That is why the multi-agency approach is essential.\" </p> <p>Harwood agrees: \"It is difficult staying off drugs if you are living in the same area and the people who sell them are doing their best to persuade you to go back on them. It is a big loss of revenue for the drug dealers - who are often well known to the women - and they are not going to lose their customers easily. </p> <p>\"Housing will have to play a key part in exit strategies, so that women can move away if necessary. Drop-in centres are helpful, but the forum must come up with ways of following up individual women and supporting them on a one-to-one basis.\" </p> <p>The forum is establishing links with the city council's housing department and housing associations in Sheffield so that the women can be offered new accommodation if necessary. Debt counsellors from Sheffield's advice centres will give information on the best ways of tackling money problems. And women's aid refuges and the police's domestic violence unit will be involved in the planned exit strategies for those prostitutes who are being assaulted or threatened by pimps. </p> <p>Police believe previous operations to get kerb crawlers and prostitutes off the streets have shifted them to other areas. And when the university increased the use of security cameras and lighting to deter would-be punters, it merely attracted more prostitutes to the area. \"The extra security made them feel safer and, surprisingly, it didn't seem to deter the punters,\" Superintendent Steve Hicks says. </p> <p>\"Police operations only bring short-term solutions and we are now working with other agencies to address the roots of the problem. We know that many of these women would welcome the chance to get off the streets.\" </p> <p>Harwood points out that by no means all the prostitutes are regulars. Some turn out perhaps once a week and others travel to Sheffield from nearby Barnsley and Rotherham, where there are no traditional beats. </p> <p>\"Then there are the ones we only see on a sporadic basis, perhaps every two months,\" she says. \"Some work in the weeks before Christmas to get extra money for children's presents, and we don't see them again until the following year.\"</p>",

Four years ago, proposals for a red light tolerance zone were abandoned after complaints from residents whose homes bordered the area. Then, when the Liberal Democrats gained control of the city council in 1999, they wanted to introduce registration of the city's saunas and brothels. That idea was dropped after the Sunday Sport newspaper ran a story urging readers: \"Come to Sheffield.\" Dixon, a 22-year-old LibDem councillor, remains an advocate of registration of saunas and brothels and believes it will have to be introduced if street prostitution is to be eradicated. Meanwhile, he intends to focus on helping women who wish to escape the lifestyle. Support will have to be available for as long as the women need it, Dixon says. \"It's like coming out of prison and into the same situation that led a person into crime in the first place. These women have friends still working on the streets and, in many cases, their boyfriends are also their pimps and their drug dealers. They can't go back to all that if they are to stay off drugs and prostitution. It could mean having to relocate them to another area. That is why the multi-agency approach is essential.\" Harwood agrees: \"It is difficult staying off drugs if you are living in the same area and the people who sell them are doing their best to persuade you to go back on them. It is a big loss of revenue for the drug dealers - who are often well known to the women - and they are not going to lose their customers easily. \"Housing will have to play a key part in exit strategies, so that women can move away if necessary. Drop-in centres are helpful, but the forum must come up with ways of following up individual women and supporting them on a one-to-one basis.\" The forum is establishing links with the city council's housing department and housing associations in Sheffield so that the women can be offered new accommodation if necessary. Debt counsellors from Sheffield's advice centres will give information on the best ways of tackling money problems. And women's aid refuges and the police's domestic violence unit will be involved in the planned exit strategies for those prostitutes who are being assaulted or threatened by pimps. Police believe previous operations to get kerb crawlers and prostitutes off the streets have shifted them to other areas. And when the university increased the use of security cameras and lighting to deter would-be punters, it merely attracted more prostitutes to the area. \"The extra security made them feel safer and, surprisingly, it didn't seem to deter the punters,\" Superintendent Steve Hicks says. \"Police operations only bring short-term solutions and we are now working with other agencies to address the roots of the problem. We know that many of these women would welcome the chance to get off the streets.\" Harwood points out that by no means all the prostitutes are regulars. Some turn out perhaps once a week and others travel to Sheffield from nearby Barnsley and Rotherham, where there are no traditional beats. \"Then there are the ones we only see on a sporadic basis, perhaps every two months,\" she says. \"Some work in the weeks before Christmas to get extra money for children's presents, and we don't see them again until the following year.\"",

The report, Lilac from the Garden, looks at meeting the need for dayservices for older people in rural areas.

Thewlis found there were about 100 Age Concern parish links across the county who serve as a resource for older people in their locality. Unlike the Braybrooke-Tuckers, few are trained to give benefits advice, but they will direct people to where they can find out about home security and fire prevention, or how to get electric blankets safety-tested.

The report therefore recommends that the network be developed to try to reach the very fingertips of rural Oxfordshire. </p> <p>\"We have applied for a Home Office grant for extra staffing so that we can attack those gaps,\" Daniel says. The idea is that a community development worker could work closely with a small number of rural communities to recruit more parish links, before moving on to other parishes. </p> <p>Age Concern has appointed a parish link coordinator to provide support to the existing network and is looking at setting up a small innovation grant for which parish links could bid and use to support local initiatives, such as an information coffee morning or an outing. </p> <p>Parish links are volunteers and tend to be retired people.

The brief was for a global search - and they wanted the best.\" </p> <p>Headhunter Davidson and his team compiled a shortlist of four candidates from Britain and four from the US. Davidson put forward Bob Kiley, who had revitalised subway systems in New York and Boston, as a leading candidate. </p> <p>\"Bob was surprised to hear from us, but once I knew he was intrigued I realised we had a good chance of getting him. He was too busy to fly over, so we did the interview via video link. Bob was very impressive and confident. That brief was my most challenging yet.\" </p> <p>The Kiley appointment confirmed Davidson's reputation as the real power behind various local government thrones - an energetic headhunter whose bulging contacts book and powers of persuasion have enabled him to help recruit Liverpool council's chief executive David Henshaw, Sheffield's Bob Kerslake and Newcastle upon Tyne's Kevin Lavery. He has also found chief executives for more than a third of all London boroughs and is currently searching for someone to fill the top job at Coventry. </p> <p>He is uncomfortable with accolades - \"I don't make the appointments, I just suggest to members who they might interview\" - but is none the less proud to have brought an aggressive form of recruitment into the public sector. </p> <p>After graduating from Keele University in international relations, Davidson worked as an auditor and then investment manager before deciding on a career in recruitment. \"I enjoyed meeting people and selling, so I thought that headhunting would allow me to do both - meet people and sell their talent.\" </p> <p>Now 42, Davidson was himself headhunted from a small company of recruitment consultants to join PricewaterhouseCoopers 13 years ago. He fell into public sector recruitment by chance. Asked to search out candidates for a director-level job at a local authority, he found few suitable people and was excited by the challenge. </p> <p>As a partner, Davidson heads a 50-strong team of consultants specialising in local government. He describes his job as that of a \"third party broker\", although concedes that some members and officers might see him more as a pied piper figure, luring away staff. </p> <p>Despite the fact that he is behind most of the high-profile local gov ernment appointments in recent years, Davidson says: \"The public sector is more cautious about using headhunters than the private sector - the 'men in grey suits', what I call the old guard in local government, are always anxious about using headhunters.\" </p> <p>One reason he is regarded with suspicion is that he is concerned with profit making. Yes, he concedes, PricewaterhouseCoopers does take a cut of 25% of the annual salary of the post in question, but he insists: \"Using a headhunter increases your chances of finding a top-class candidate.\" </p> <p>At best, Davidson is described by those recruited by him as \"a real character\". At worst, some say he is frustratingly unconventional. He criticises what he sees as local government's bureaucracy and inflexibility, which may dictate that just one or two days are set aside for interviews, that candidates must come to interview, or that job ads have to be staid and conventional. </p> <p>Davidson disproved this last point nowhere better than in 1995, when he was given the challenge of recruiting a chief executive for Lambeth council, south London. </p> <p>He spent hours at his desk, trying to create an ad that would make debt-ridden Lambeth, still struggling to rid itself of a \"loony left\" image, seem attractive. Finally, he tore up his ideas and wrote exactly what he felt. He described the post as \"arguably the worst job in local government\". </p> <p>He says: \"I didn't think members would ever go for it but they had the courage to do so. I was being honest and trying to provoke people into reading it.\" </p> <p>Heather Rabbatts was headhunted by Davidson from nearby Merton council. Despite claimsthat her time at Lambeth was a matter of style over substance, she did at least raise the profile of the authority. </p> <p>Davidson repeated the technique in December 1999, when searching for a new managing director for Hackney, east London - a post now filled by Max Caller, who was drawn by the advert describing the challenges as . . . \"an absence of coherent political leadership, a disconnection between strategy and operation, poor financial management and a lack of focus on basic services.\" </p> <p>In headhunting, says Davidson, you have to contact someone who's settled in their job, persuade them to go for a job which, after a long, exhausting process they may not get, and then you have to tell them exactly why they failed. It's not always a pleasant task.\"</p>",

Despite the fact that he is behind most of the high-profile local gov ernment appointments in recent years, Davidson says: \"The public sector is more cautious about using headhunters than the private sector - the 'men in grey suits', what I call the old guard in local government, are always anxious about using headhunters.\" One reason he is regarded with suspicion is that he is concerned with profit making. Yes, he concedes, PricewaterhouseCoopers does take a cut of 25% of the annual salary of the post in question, but he insists: \"Using a headhunter increases your chances of finding a top-class candidate.\" At best, Davidson is described by those recruited by him as \"a real character\". At worst, some say he is frustratingly unconventional. He criticises what he sees as local government's bureaucracy and inflexibility, which may dictate that just one or two days are set aside for interviews, that candidates must come to interview, or that job ads have to be staid and conventional. Davidson disproved this last point nowhere better than in 1995, when he was given the challenge of recruiting a chief executive for Lambeth council, south London. He spent hours at his desk, trying to create an ad that would make debt-ridden Lambeth, still struggling to rid itself of a \"loony left\" image, seem attractive. Finally, he tore up his ideas and wrote exactly what he felt. He described the post as \"arguably the worst job in local government\". He says: \"I didn't think members would ever go for it but they had the courage to do so. I was being honest and trying to provoke people into reading it.\" Heather Rabbatts was headhunted by Davidson from nearby Merton council. Despite claimsthat her time at Lambeth was a matter of style over substance, she did at least raise the profile of the authority. Davidson repeated the technique in December 1999, when searching for a new managing director for Hackney, east London - a post now filled by Max Caller, who was drawn by the advert describing the challenges as . . . \"an absence of coherent political leadership, a disconnection between strategy and operation, poor financial management and a lack of focus on basic services.\" In headhunting, says Davidson, you have to contact someone who's settled in their job, persuade them to go for a job which, after a long, exhausting process they may not get, and then you have to tell them exactly why they failed. It's not always a pleasant task.\"",

The Ministry of Agriculture should either be abolished or become a Department of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 CAP</strong> The common agricultural policy should become a common food and rural rolicy (CFRP). The commission, in the wake of BSE, is trying to bolt safety on to agricultural policy. Nutrition remains a marginal policy issue, although 1.5m Europeans die from heart disease each year. The proposed European Food Authority will be narrowly focused on microbiological and toxicological aspects of safety. It would be irrelevant to the current foot and mouth crisis. The commission needs an overview. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Subsidies</strong> Export subsidies, which dump Europe's surpluses on world markets, damage developing countries. They must stop. The CFRP should shift to sustainable , extensive farm methods. Labour should back the organic targets bill, now before Parliament, with a goal of 30% of agriculture to be organic by 2020. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Trade </strong> The government accepts the World Trade Organisation's vision of liberalised trade. Trade liberalisation, however, can drive down consumer protection standards and inflict greater environmental harm from farming, trade and especially transport. Why are we flying in luxury foods from countries that aren't feeding their own people properly? </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Codex </strong> The Codex Alimentarius Commission,<strong> </strong> the body the WTO uses to set global food standards, is stacked with corporate interests - helping set standards for their own products. It needs wholesale reform. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Prices</strong> A sustainable food supply will mean (re)building local food systems, but not at any cost. If you want mangoes, don't expect them to be grown in subsidised European greenhouses. State-supported infrastructure, such as roads, enables food corporations to garner economies of scale but at huge environmental costs. Food prices should reflect the full costs of production, not just short-term fuel prices. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Fair payments</strong> Farm-gate prices have declined but retail prices have not been reduced. A larger portion of the value generated in the food chain should accrue to farmers who grow the primary products. Shortening the supply chain would help. We either need to break up the big retail chains or tightly regulate competition among them, or both. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Access to shops</strong> Diversity of shops is just as important as diversity of crops within a field. The hypermarket revolution gets consumers into retail sheds, while just-in-time delivery systems mean the motorways become the warehouse. This is brilliant logistics but crazy environmental or cultural economics. Access to shops and a wholesome diet is espedcially vital for the poor. Why is the social exclusion unit's access to shops report gathering dust? </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Food skills </strong> The growth of the catering sector shows the hunger of the British for good food, but too often it relies on cheap, unskilled labour. When schools don't teach cooking or treat other food skills as important, is the low esteem of food work surprising? Food life-skills should be introduced into schools. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Food science </strong> Too many research grants are linked to commercial projects. Governments have failed to invest in research to improve the productivity of organic and extensive farming, or to study the adverse consequences of current practices, so it fails to produce evidence, and then interprets the absence of evidence of risk as if it were evidence of the absence of risks. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Consumer protection</strong> There is no such thing as risk-free food. Equally, regulators must stop assuming that current food methods are safe until proven harmful. A new precautionary approach is needed. Strict liability rules need to be applied to all agricultural and food products, including GM crops. Exemptions that cushion the food system from taking responsibility for the costs it has long not paid should be abolished. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 Competition policy</strong> In every food sector, the share taken by larger companies grows. Behind the cafe society lie stock exchange giants. How is a market to be delineated? Currently, national markets are being redrawn as regional ones.

      "body": "<p><strong> Home and away</strong><br> </p> <p> It's a bit rich to blame planners for poor supply and consequent high prices in the housing market (Key workers in the cold, February 21). </p> <p>A shortage of key workers in a given area simply implies that they are not being paid enough to compete against others when buying homes and that their commuting costs are too high. There are only two solutions: one is to pay key workers more and the other is to provide them with subsidised housing or travel costs. </p> <p>Local authority planners have the knowledge to identify areas where affordable housing is needed. They have the powers and democratic mandate to ensure that, where homes are built, some of them are affordable. In the old days, local authorities could provide such housing themselves and allocate units to key workers; now, others are expected to help out. But developers, banks and building societies cannot be expected to subsidise new housing in the numbers needed. Government must step in, with subsidies funded through central taxation. </p> <p>Even given a workable system for subsidising key worker accommodation, we have to question the level of demand. All our experience shows that employees do not necessarily want to live near their place of work. Other factors - schools, the quality of the environment, a partner's travel needs - weigh heavier. Even in the new towns, carefully planned to bring employment and housing closer together, typically half of residents still commute to the nearby cities. If only in the interests of the environment, however, we should seek to reduce the length of all journeys to work. </p> <p>So let's stop blaming planners for making new development uneconomical. It is through the planning system that we can build broad and thriving communities that all will want to live in. The successful provision of key worker housing is only a small part of the equation. </p> <p><strong>Nick Davies</strong><br>President, Royal Town Planning Institute<br></p> <p><strong> Dig for victory again</strong><br> </p> <p> Even before this latest tragedy to hit British livestock, national food security had reached an all-time low (Kill or cure? February 28). </p> <p>One would have thought that, as an island nation, we would have learned our lesson from the two world wars in the last century when, in times of crisis, it was imperative to use all our own resources to feed the nation. With so many mouths to feed, this country should cut imports and concentrate on home production once again. Our farmland is a vital resource and it should be cared for properly, not raped by industrial farming. </p> <p>At the same time, individuals should realise that food safety for the family can come from growing as much food as possible at home in gardens and allotments, making use of every piece of land available as was done during wartime. </p> <p><strong>Brian Baxter</strong><br> Swaffham, Norfolk <br></p> <p><strong> Women's initiative</strong><br> </p> <p> I take issue with Michael Symmons Roberts's assertion that the women on Greenham Common were hijacked by \"a sort of feminist-separatist policy\" agenda (Nuclear families, February 28). </p> <p>His opinion arises out of his failure to differentiate between a woman-only initiative, for a specific purpose, and separatism. In the early days - September 1981 to February 1982 - there were women and men living at the peace camp. A conscious effort was made to promote an image of women doing things in their own right and for their own reasons, and to counter the media's concentration on male personalities and male-oriented news. </p> <p>After much reflection, it was decided to have a trial run at a women-only camp; the men left and didn't return. </p> <p>As a women-only camp, we could claim our autonomy, which allowed us to develop politically a system that could respond to other injustices that were the result of domination by the military industrial complex. The spirit of the peace camp and its work travelled out across the country and the rest of the world. </p> <p>Roberts should ask himself if the fact that he was a reporter for the Newbury Weekly News could have anything to do with the hostility he claims was directed at him by women. This was the newspaper that allowed Rage (Ratepayers Against Greenham Encampments) to run an advertising campaign in the form of vicious cartoons. The camp was attacked, maggots were thrown into the kitchen area, attempts were made to burn our tents and cement was poured into the standpipe - our only water supply. We were refused service in shops and travel on buses. </p> <p>Roberts did not choose to mention this negative activity exercised by some of his local community. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Hipperson</strong><br> London<br></p> <p><strong> Wholly healthy</strong><br> </p> <p> I am a proselytising atheist and therefore well placed to judge if support for religious groups leads inevitably to religious brainwashing (Letters, February 28). </p> <p>Last year I spent three nights observing the actions of a group of Christians who work the \"winter watch \"programme in Bolton. The team of seven (eldest 70, youngest 16) prayed before they started and when they finished - and why not?

      "bodyText": "Home and away It's a bit rich to blame planners for poor supply and consequent high prices in the housing market (Key workers in the cold, February 21). A shortage of key workers in a given area simply implies that they are not being paid enough to compete against others when buying homes and that their commuting costs are too high. There are only two solutions: one is to pay key workers more and the other is to provide them with subsidised housing or travel costs. Local authority planners have the knowledge to identify areas where affordable housing is needed. They have the powers and democratic mandate to ensure that, where homes are built, some of them are affordable. In the old days, local authorities could provide such housing themselves and allocate units to key workers; now, others are expected to help out. But developers, banks and building societies cannot be expected to subsidise new housing in the numbers needed. Government must step in, with subsidies funded through central taxation. Even given a workable system for subsidising key worker accommodation, we have to question the level of demand. All our experience shows that employees do not necessarily want to live near their place of work. Other factors - schools, the quality of the environment, a partner's travel needs - weigh heavier. Even in the new towns, carefully planned to bring employment and housing closer together, typically half of residents still commute to the nearby cities. If only in the interests of the environment, however, we should seek to reduce the length of all journeys to work. So let's stop blaming planners for making new development uneconomical. It is through the planning system that we can build broad and thriving communities that all will want to live in. The successful provision of key worker housing is only a small part of the equation. Nick Davies President, Royal Town Planning Institute Dig for victory again Even before this latest tragedy to hit British livestock, national food security had reached an all-time low (Kill or cure? February 28). One would have thought that, as an island nation, we would have learned our lesson from the two world wars in the last century when, in times of crisis, it was imperative to use all our own resources to feed the nation. With so many mouths to feed, this country should cut imports and concentrate on home production once again. Our farmland is a vital resource and it should be cared for properly, not raped by industrial farming. At the same time, individuals should realise that food safety for the family can come from growing as much food as possible at home in gardens and allotments, making use of every piece of land available as was done during wartime. Brian Baxter Swaffham, Norfolk Women's initiative I take issue with Michael Symmons Roberts's assertion that the women on Greenham Common were hijacked by \"a sort of feminist-separatist policy\" agenda (Nuclear families, February 28). His opinion arises out of his failure to differentiate between a woman-only initiative, for a specific purpose, and separatism. In the early days - September 1981 to February 1982 - there were women and men living at the peace camp. A conscious effort was made to promote an image of women doing things in their own right and for their own reasons, and to counter the media's concentration on male personalities and male-oriented news. After much reflection, it was decided to have a trial run at a women-only camp; the men left and didn't return. As a women-only camp, we could claim our autonomy, which allowed us to develop politically a system that could respond to other injustices that were the result of domination by the military industrial complex. The spirit of the peace camp and its work travelled out across the country and the rest of the world. Roberts should ask himself if the fact that he was a reporter for the Newbury Weekly News could have anything to do with the hostility he claims was directed at him by women. This was the newspaper that allowed Rage (Ratepayers Against Greenham Encampments) to run an advertising campaign in the form of vicious cartoons. The camp was attacked, maggots were thrown into the kitchen area, attempts were made to burn our tents and cement was poured into the standpipe - our only water supply. We were refused service in shops and travel on buses. Roberts did not choose to mention this negative activity exercised by some of his local community. Sarah Hipperson London Wholly healthy I am a proselytising atheist and therefore well placed to judge if support for religious groups leads inevitably to religious brainwashing (Letters, February 28). Last year I spent three nights observing the actions of a group of Christians who work the \"winter watch \"programme in Bolton. The team of seven (eldest 70, youngest 16) prayed before they started and when they finished - and why not? In 15 hours, I did not see or hear anyone mention Jesus or the word prayer to what the leader called \"the customers\". Their prayers, short and extemporised, were practical. One woman asked not that the Lord would stop the tea urn from malfunctioning, but that he would give her the strength to cope when it did break down at the moment the doors opened and 20 hungry rough sleepers came rushing at the serving hatch. Healthy realism, that, not happy clapping.

      "bodyText": "The Groucho Club, the Soho watering hole for the would-be famous, is about to receive a hostile takeover bid from a hotels company advised by It girl Tara Palmer-Tomkinson. Zoo Hotels, owner of two fashionable hotels in west London, is raising \u00a31m through a flotation on the Ofex market and will ask Groucho members to swap their shares in the club for stock in the hotel group. Benjamin Fry, 31, one of the founders of the K-bar night club chain and chairman of Zoo, last year tried and failed with a cash offer for the Groucho. Last night Mr Fry said he was hopeful his new offer, made direct to shareholders, would at least allow him to build a strategic stake in the club that counts Steve Martin, Janet Street-Porter and Lord Archer among its 315 shareholders. \"I've seen the current Groucho management miss too many opportunities and fail to deliver on too many promises. I would love to play a role in upgrading the Groucho Club and restoring it to its rightful place in the London social scene.\" Mr Fry is likely to face an uphill battle after the failure of last year's cash offer. The Groucho's chairman, Tony Mackintosh, owner of 20% of the shares, has resisted takeover approaches before. Zoo's offer of two \u00a31 shares for every Groucho share is less than the \u00a32.30p cash Mr Fry offered last spring. Deloitte &amp; Touche was appointed last year to evaluate any takeover approaches amid rumours that PR guru Matthew Freud and chocolates heir Joel Cadbury were also considering making offers. Mr Fry wants to bring the Groucho, which has 18 bedrooms, into his hotel group and open a sister venue in Beverly Hills.",

But she admits a solution that complicated may be too expensive for a library.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Glasgow city council hopes to have internet access up and running again - with new filtering software - by the end of this week.

The problem for Glasgow's libraries is that most filtering software is a blunt instrument at best, and keeping inappropriate sites out of children's reach can also mean keeping adults away from information they want or need. Glasgow city council is well aware of the civil liberties issues. \"The words filtered by the old software could stop an adult from reading an article about sex therapy in a national newspaper, for example,\" said the spokesman. \"It was pointless having a system in a library that was so strict.\" Paola Bassanese, an analyst with internet consultancy Ovum, said most of the tools available now filter by keyword or specific internet address. To get around the restriction, sites can use code words that will sound inoffensive to a filtering system or change their URL. \"This kind of software is pretty limiting as it will filter out an innocuous site,\" she said. \"There is no foolproof solution.\" Ms Bassanese suggests that libraries could put a computer chip on library swipe cards that would tell a computer what sort of internet access you should have: filtered for the under-18s and unlimited for adults. But she admits a solution that complicated may be too expensive for a library. Meanwhile, Glasgow city council hopes to have internet access up and running again - with new filtering software - by the end of this week. And the kids will be left to think of creative new search words to outwit the filters.

In the village of Mellis near here, only seconds after the half-width barriers come down, the London-Norwich trains thunder through at 100mph and more. There are no CCTV cameras to show the signalman if the crossing is clear. A concerted Guardian campaign is called for. Stephen Schwarz Eye, Suffolk expression@netmatters.co.uk \u0095 One presumes Robert Mugabe will cite Peter Tatchell's attempted arrest (Mugabe men beat up Tatchell, March 6) as a further example of the gay mafia he perceives to be running Britain. Was the assault on Mr Tatchell an indication of the heterosexual mafia running Zimbabwe? If so, then God Save the Queens. Steve Taylor Ilford, Essex \u0095 I nearly wept for those miserable-looking, starving refugees from Milan (Faces of fashion, March 6). Surely the Home Office must be compassionate and offer them a good meal and a visit to the nearest hairdresser at the least. On which beach were they found? Alastair Black Ventnor, Isle of Wight \u0095 As Fritz Spiegl knows (Letters, March 5), we scice of a certain age refer to our partner as miaowlgerl - undoubtedly a literal translation into feline of the canine female, with perhaps a touch of Bristol in the pronunciation.

Ever since the Clore Gallery was planned, an element at the Tate has wanted to change this notable late 20th-century building into a Victorian one. Is that not philistine? Is it sensible? In its size, plan, situation and integral style, the Clore is fundamentally unsuited to the Turners, but could provide congenial space to some of the hundreds of other Tate works in store. Would it not be better to turn it over to those and erect a Turner gallery that needs no excuses?</p> <p>Meanwhile, excuses are what we have had from the Royal Academy for the casual way it has treated the one-sixth of Turner's fortune, which it received. The Turner Medal has been expunged from its schools' prospectus, and was only awarded last week after persistent complaints. Whereas Turner wanted to encourage landscape painting, the latest winner is a printmaker, and has been given a medal bearing Michelangelo's effigy.</p> <p>The message from both the RA and Tate seems to be that Turner's wishes only merit a token nod. <br><b>Dr Selby Whittingham</b> <br>London</p>",

      "bodyText": "How depressing it is that the Tate's commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Turner's death is prefaced by that old excuse - that Turner, too, maltreated his works - for its own failure to live up to the potential of his bequest (Home from home with Turner, March 5). Amusingly Turner is nevertheless now portrayed by the Tate as having had better ideas for the background to his pictures than it has had. Ever since the Clore Gallery was planned, an element at the Tate has wanted to change this notable late 20th-century building into a Victorian one. Is that not philistine? Is it sensible? In its size, plan, situation and integral style, the Clore is fundamentally unsuited to the Turners, but could provide congenial space to some of the hundreds of other Tate works in store. Would it not be better to turn it over to those and erect a Turner gallery that needs no excuses? Meanwhile, excuses are what we have had from the Royal Academy for the casual way it has treated the one-sixth of Turner's fortune, which it received. The Turner Medal has been expunged from its schools' prospectus, and was only awarded last week after persistent complaints. Whereas Turner wanted to encourage landscape painting, the latest winner is a printmaker, and has been given a medal bearing Michelangelo's effigy. The message from both the RA and Tate seems to be that Turner's wishes only merit a token nod. Dr Selby Whittingham London",

Mr Tang drew attention to the possible sale of sophisticated US seaborne and land-based radar and air defence systems, for which Taiwan has been lobbying. \"If the US side continues to fail to honour its commitment on the Taiwan question and insists on selling advanced weapons to Taiwan, including particularly the Aegis missile destroyers and the Patriot anti-missile defence system, that would send a very wrong signal to the Taiwan authorities,\" he said. Departing from his normal flat diplomatic delivery, Mr Tang said that the US should \"rein in its wild horse right on the edge of the precipice\". The issue is likely to become critical during a visit to the US later this month by the Chinese vice-premier, Qian Qichen, who oversees foreign policy. President Bush must decide on the Taiwanese request next month. China also announced yesterday a substantial increase in its military budget - up by 17.7% on last year's figure to a total of 141bn yuan (\u00a311.6bn). The minister of finance, Xiang Huaicheng, said the increase was needed to increase the pay of army personnel, to \"adapt to drastic changes in the military situation of the world\", and to cope with the demands of \"modern technology [and] especially high technology\". Mr Tang denied that this had anything to do with the Bush administration's enthusiasm for a national missile defence shield, but he acknowledged the need to \"modernise our national defence system\". Most foreign analysts believe that the declared military budget excludes important items, but the latest figure may be a shift towards greater clarity. Mr Tang said that since Mr Bush's inauguration the two countries' top leaders had \"always kept in touch\". However, Mr Bush, as far as is known, has not made direct contact yet with President Jiang Zemin.",

      "body": "<p>A lot of people can remember exactly where they were when they heard that Elvis Presley had died, in the same way that old rockers like Keith Richards remember hearing Heartbreak Hotel for the first time. His beginning and his end had that kind of impact. Whereas rock's dried-out survivors circle the globe like Flying Dutchmen, dead Elvis represents something more pure than the persistence of survivors. However far he was perceived to have fallen by the end of his life, people in their tens of thousands descended on Graceland when he died. He and his kind represent for us the voice of eternal youth, our own stab at immortality. </p> <p>A quarter of a century after his death, Elvis is a sort of godhead. He has legends of resurrection, and a worldwide following for whom tales of the star's excess mean little. He is the King, and he is everyman: last year, 30,000 fans gathered for a candlelit vigil at Graceland on the anniversary of his death. </p> <p>Guy Gilbert, who filmed the gathering, came across his first rock shrine at Le P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in Paris on Bastille Day 1992, when Jim Morrison's grave played host to an orgy of liberation that would have rivalled anything going down at Whisky A-Go-Go in 1967, where the Doors first entered rock legend. Morrison's final resting place has been a rock'n'roll shrine for years now, signposted from gate to graveside. Go there, and you may meet the man in Gilbert's film, handing out joints. He's there every day, and so are the fans, the diehards, the ones for whom the music is not enough, who make the pilgrimage. </p> <p>Gilbert documented 17 rock shrines in Britain and the US, interviewing fans, friends and family, including Jeff Buckley's mother and Rolan Bolan, Marc's son, at the tree shrine where his father fatally crashed his car. The shrines - of musicians from Buddy Holly to Biggie Smalls - and the fans who tend them are as strange as anything in rock. Gilbert's programme is about the audience as much as the star, and explores the sense of identification and belief that made rock singers into legends in the first place. </p> <p>These fans are a gentler breed than the celebrity stalkers of the living. Although a few do skirt the edges of parody at times, they reveal more clearly than any conventional star biography why rock music can mean so much, and also how far from normality it can take you. A middle-aged fan in the Marc Bolan film reveals how his marriage ended because of his obsession, but what brings tears to his eyes is his inability, still, to make sense of his idol's death. \"Twenty-nine years old? My idol, my pop star who I followed, dead in a car crash?\" He stares at the camera unblinking, wet-eyed. \"No, I couldn't accept it . . .\" </p> <p>In one of the most haunting films of the series, we witness Nick Drake's fans gathering at the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene in Tanworth in Arden, near Birmingham. Gilbert was warned by the vicar there that many of them, like Nick, simply wouldn't talk. No footage survives of Drake, and its absence makes the film about him all the more poignant. All that remains are the recordings, and the truism that those who knew him feel that they never knew him, and those who only have his songs feel they know him intimately. </p> <p>There's one Nick Drake fan I know of, who actually owns a pair of his trousers. She says they have a stain on the fly. Someone else I know of wears a pair of Ian Curtis's shoes on the anniversary of his death. That is possibly one step too far, but some people can never go far enough. In the film about Jeff Buckley, the fan who moved herself into Buckley's last home in Memphis declines to discuss the experience of dwelling in her idol's shadow, and refers to his house as \"my healing process\" before disappearing behind her - or is it his? - screen door. One wonders whose life she is really living. One wonders, too, about the Michael Hutchence fan who said she loved him, even in death, more than her own children. </p> <p>Some stars you'd expect to have a shrine don't. Gilbert wanted to make films on Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye and Janis Joplin, but for these and others there simply wasn't a focal point. Sid Vicious's ashes were dropped accidentally on the runway at Heathrow, and the nearest Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones has to a shrine are the 320 blue ceramic tiles on sale from the swimming pool in which he drowned in 1969. As for Bob Marley, the village in which he was born is as poor as it ever was. When Gilbert filmed there for the first series of Rock Shrines, his guide pointed out an old man working the next field. It was Marley's uncle. </p> <p>Rock music has always inspired a religious kind of devotion. When rock'n'roll was young it was the devil's music, a revolution in a century of revolutions. Now speed metal sells instant coffee, but when the young Elvis sang in the studio corridor to capture the echo, it was an underworld journey, forbidden fruit, a Promethean fire.

      "bodyText": "A lot of people can remember exactly where they were when they heard that Elvis Presley had died, in the same way that old rockers like Keith Richards remember hearing Heartbreak Hotel for the first time. His beginning and his end had that kind of impact. Whereas rock's dried-out survivors circle the globe like Flying Dutchmen, dead Elvis represents something more pure than the persistence of survivors. However far he was perceived to have fallen by the end of his life, people in their tens of thousands descended on Graceland when he died. He and his kind represent for us the voice of eternal youth, our own stab at immortality. A quarter of a century after his death, Elvis is a sort of godhead. He has legends of resurrection, and a worldwide following for whom tales of the star's excess mean little. He is the King, and he is everyman: last year, 30,000 fans gathered for a candlelit vigil at Graceland on the anniversary of his death. Guy Gilbert, who filmed the gathering, came across his first rock shrine at Le P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in Paris on Bastille Day 1992, when Jim Morrison's grave played host to an orgy of liberation that would have rivalled anything going down at Whisky A-Go-Go in 1967, where the Doors first entered rock legend. Morrison's final resting place has been a rock'n'roll shrine for years now, signposted from gate to graveside. Go there, and you may meet the man in Gilbert's film, handing out joints. He's there every day, and so are the fans, the diehards, the ones for whom the music is not enough, who make the pilgrimage. Gilbert documented 17 rock shrines in Britain and the US, interviewing fans, friends and family, including Jeff Buckley's mother and Rolan Bolan, Marc's son, at the tree shrine where his father fatally crashed his car. The shrines - of musicians from Buddy Holly to Biggie Smalls - and the fans who tend them are as strange as anything in rock. Gilbert's programme is about the audience as much as the star, and explores the sense of identification and belief that made rock singers into legends in the first place. These fans are a gentler breed than the celebrity stalkers of the living. Although a few do skirt the edges of parody at times, they reveal more clearly than any conventional star biography why rock music can mean so much, and also how far from normality it can take you. A middle-aged fan in the Marc Bolan film reveals how his marriage ended because of his obsession, but what brings tears to his eyes is his inability, still, to make sense of his idol's death. \"Twenty-nine years old? My idol, my pop star who I followed, dead in a car crash?\" He stares at the camera unblinking, wet-eyed. \"No, I couldn't accept it . . .\" In one of the most haunting films of the series, we witness Nick Drake's fans gathering at the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene in Tanworth in Arden, near Birmingham. Gilbert was warned by the vicar there that many of them, like Nick, simply wouldn't talk. No footage survives of Drake, and its absence makes the film about him all the more poignant. All that remains are the recordings, and the truism that those who knew him feel that they never knew him, and those who only have his songs feel they know him intimately. There's one Nick Drake fan I know of, who actually owns a pair of his trousers. She says they have a stain on the fly. Someone else I know of wears a pair of Ian Curtis's shoes on the anniversary of his death. That is possibly one step too far, but some people can never go far enough. In the film about Jeff Buckley, the fan who moved herself into Buckley's last home in Memphis declines to discuss the experience of dwelling in her idol's shadow, and refers to his house as \"my healing process\" before disappearing behind her - or is it his? - screen door. One wonders whose life she is really living. One wonders, too, about the Michael Hutchence fan who said she loved him, even in death, more than her own children. Some stars you'd expect to have a shrine don't. Gilbert wanted to make films on Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye and Janis Joplin, but for these and others there simply wasn't a focal point. Sid Vicious's ashes were dropped accidentally on the runway at Heathrow, and the nearest Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones has to a shrine are the 320 blue ceramic tiles on sale from the swimming pool in which he drowned in 1969. As for Bob Marley, the village in which he was born is as poor as it ever was. When Gilbert filmed there for the first series of Rock Shrines, his guide pointed out an old man working the next field. It was Marley's uncle. Rock music has always inspired a religious kind of devotion. When rock'n'roll was young it was the devil's music, a revolution in a century of revolutions. Now speed metal sells instant coffee, but when the young Elvis sang in the studio corridor to capture the echo, it was an underworld journey, forbidden fruit, a Promethean fire. People's lives were changed. Which is why the living dead of rock'n'roll refuse to die in the hearts of their fans. And if they have to travel to the ends of the earth, as Buddy Holly fans do, every February, to Clear Lake, Iowa, to lay flowers at the remote, freezing spot where his plane crashed, then they go and do it. In the Holly film, an Elvis lookalike dances in the Surf Ballroom, site of Holly's last gig, as a Buddy impersonator belts it out on stage, and out of the crowd stands Buddy's last drummer, Carl Bush, back in Clear Lake for the first time after 41 years. \"That telephone over there,\" he points, \"was the last thing they used to call home to say goodbye to their loved ones.\" There's a plaque over the payphone. \"It's a, it really is kind of hard,\" stammers Bush, \"to breathe, sometimes, for me here . . .\" Rock stars, especially dead rock stars, get into our hearts in the way that no film or sports star ever can.

This was followed by equally yuksome voyages through his veins, pores and throat.</p> <p>Now William Hague is trying the same trick. \"Let me take you on a journey,\" he told the Tories' spring forum last weekend, \"to a foreign land - to Britain after a second term of Tony Blair.\" At a time when almost any travel in Britain is fraught with anguish, and when delegates in Harrogate were swapping horror stories about their epic rail odysseys from Esher or Budleigh Salterton, the use of the word \"journey\" was presumably calculated to make his audience shiver. The reminder of Winston's innards merely intensified the horror. Yet I wonder if Hague's speech was quite the cunning oratory that rightwing pundits would have us believe.</p> <p>Though no one seems to have noticed, it was clearly inspired by Peter Hitchens's book The Abolition of Britain (Quartet, 1999), which warned that the referendum on the single currency would be \"a last unrepeatable moment at which we can halt our extinction as a culture and a nation\" - an opportunity that must be seized by \"those many millions who feel they have become foreigners in their own land and wish with each succeeding day that they could turn the clock back\".</p> <p>Hitchens, too, took us on a journey. Whereas Hague conjured up a nightmarish future in which the prison population is falling and Britain remains in Europe, Hitchens led an imaginary female reader back to the London of 1965, around the time of Winston Churchill's funeral. What would she see? \"Less litter, less dog muck and much less chewing gum stuck to the pavement.\"</p> <p>So far so good. What else? \"She would search long and hard for a public telephone . . . London itself would seem extraordinarily dark and dirty . . . At her hotel, she would be struck by the way the staff had never heard of credit cards, by the fact that her room lacked its own bathroom . . . Moving on to a cafe, she would gag at the thick gravy, push aside the watery murdered vegetables, refuse the stodgy pudding and reject the washy unrecognisable coffee.\" I'd guess that few modern readers, even those with conservative instincts, would share Hitchens's nostalgic fondness for a Paradise Lost of overcooked cabbage.</p> <p>The same is true of Hague's attempt to make the voters' flesh creep with his vision of Britain as a foreign land. In an excellent speech to the Media Society two years ago, the journalist Amanda Platell attacked politicians who try \"to make us all terrified about Europe\". Even Sun readers, she pointed out, now eat pizza and chicken jalfrezi; they drink French wine and German beer; they cheer on Gianfranco Zola or Dennis Bergkamp; they hum Nessun Dorma and dream of holidays in Spain or Crete. \"And the question is, can we still regard Europe as a sinister dark force? In my experience, what British people have already gone and done is embraced Europe.\"</p> <p>I couldn't have put it better myself (not least because I helped her write the speech in a Soho bar). William Hague should have a word with Amanda Platell before he makes an even bigger fool of himself during the election campaign. When last heard of she was working in Smith Square, London SW1, as chief spin-doctor to the leader of the Conservative party.</p> <p><br><br><b>Ministry on defensive</b><br><br>My comments last week about the armed services and their dodgy equipment elicited an instant email from the chief press officer at the Ministry of Defence, who accuses me of peddling two \"urban myths\".</p> <p>Myth number one is my allegation that the only submarine on patrol in British waters on October 31 last year was a German U-boat. \"This is bollocks,\" the MoD man says, showing a fine grasp of barrack-room lingo. In fact, the only inaccuracy was my suggestion that the Royal Navy paid to hire the vessel. It was covered by a credit agreement \"whereby the German navy provide submarine time in exchange for RN operational sea training\". This scheme \"reduces the burden on our own submarines\". Just as well, since our own submarines were out of action at the time. Stripped of all bollocks, the truth is that the only sub patrolling British waters on October 31 was a German U-boat - as I reported.</p> <p>And so to urban myth number two: that the accident-prone SA80 rifle jammed during a firefight between British paras and the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone last year. \"We are not aware of any post-incident report, secret or otherwise, that mentions a jamming problem,\" according to the MoD's spinwallah. \"A lessons-identified report produced by 1 Para on return from Sierra Leone does not mention any problem with the weapon.\"</p> <p>If this is true then the MoD does indeed have grounds for complaint - not least with its own spokesman, who admitted after the firefight last May that \"two soldiers said they could not release their safety catches\". Even more culpable is Peter Hain, then the Foreign Office minister responsible for Sierra Leone, who told the BBC that \"the safety catches jammed and some troops were put in danger. The lessons from that incident will be taken on board, because it must not happen again. The modification programme reflects the government's concern to ensure that this rifle is operating at the utmost level of efficiency.\"</p> <p>Now we learn that the MoD is unaware of any problem. Why, then, has the rifle been modified more than 80 times since it came into service? Why does the SAS refuse to use it? Why has Nato suspended the SA80 from its list of approved weapons? And why does Whitehall rebuke newspapers for peddling \"urban myths\" when the sources for these stories are its own press officers and ministers?</p> <p><br><br><b>Bedsit dirty tricks</b><br><br> From Azerbaijan to Zanzibar, admirers of British fair play have been outraged by the revelation that the Labour party recruited students to infiltrate local Tory associations \"as part of an election dirty tricks campaign\". The Mail on Sunday, which alerted the world to this shocking news, describes it as an \"extraordinary underhand ploy\". Michael Ancram, the amiable if harrumphing chairman of the Conservative party, says that \"this is a perfect example of how low Tony Blair's Labour party is willing to stoop in its unprincipled quest for power\".</p> <p>But where did Labour learn this sneaky trick? Not, surely, from my old chum Julian Lewis? Julian first came to public attention in the mid-1970s as a loud and litigious member of Newham North-East Labour party, leading a crusade against \"bedsit entryists\" who were seeking to deselect the local MP, Reg Prentice. Lewis described himself as \"a liberal democrat, an old-style Gaitskellite\", and denounced those \"Trotskyites\" who dared suggest that Prentice was a Tory in all but name.</p> <p>Prentice defected to Margaret Thatcher's Conservative party soon afterwards. It then transpired that Julian was something of a bedsit entryist himself. His expensive lawsuits had been financed by the National Association For Freedom (Naff by name, naff by nature), a rightwing pressure group not known for its Gaitskellite tendencies.</p> <p>If Michael Ancram is to be believed, the Tories would never condone such a deplorable stunt. So was Julian Lewis cast into the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth? As near as makes no difference: in the mid-90s he was appointed deputy research director at Conservative Central Office, and he now sits as the Tory MP for New Forest East.</p>",

Though no one seems to have noticed, it was clearly inspired by Peter Hitchens's book The Abolition of Britain (Quartet, 1999), which warned that the referendum on the single currency would be \"a last unrepeatable moment at which we can halt our extinction as a culture and a nation\" - an opportunity that must be seized by \"those many millions who feel they have become foreigners in their own land and wish with each succeeding day that they could turn the clock back\". Hitchens, too, took us on a journey. Whereas Hague conjured up a nightmarish future in which the prison population is falling and Britain remains in Europe, Hitchens led an imaginary female reader back to the London of 1965, around the time of Winston Churchill's funeral. What would she see? \"Less litter, less dog muck and much less chewing gum stuck to the pavement.\" So far so good. What else? \"She would search long and hard for a public telephone . . . London itself would seem extraordinarily dark and dirty . . . At her hotel, she would be struck by the way the staff had never heard of credit cards, by the fact that her room lacked its own bathroom . . . Moving on to a cafe, she would gag at the thick gravy, push aside the watery murdered vegetables, refuse the stodgy pudding and reject the washy unrecognisable coffee.\" I'd guess that few modern readers, even those with conservative instincts, would share Hitchens's nostalgic fondness for a Paradise Lost of overcooked cabbage. The same is true of Hague's attempt to make the voters' flesh creep with his vision of Britain as a foreign land. In an excellent speech to the Media Society two years ago, the journalist Amanda Platell attacked politicians who try \"to make us all terrified about Europe\". Even Sun readers, she pointed out, now eat pizza and chicken jalfrezi; they drink French wine and German beer; they cheer on Gianfranco Zola or Dennis Bergkamp; they hum Nessun Dorma and dream of holidays in Spain or Crete. \"And the question is, can we still regard Europe as a sinister dark force? In my experience, what British people have already gone and done is embraced Europe.\" I couldn't have put it better myself (not least because I helped her write the speech in a Soho bar). William Hague should have a word with Amanda Platell before he makes an even bigger fool of himself during the election campaign. When last heard of she was working in Smith Square, London SW1, as chief spin-doctor to the leader of the Conservative party. Ministry on defensive My comments last week about the armed services and their dodgy equipment elicited an instant email from the chief press officer at the Ministry of Defence, who accuses me of peddling two \"urban myths\". Myth number one is my allegation that the only submarine on patrol in British waters on October 31 last year was a German U-boat. \"This is bollocks,\" the MoD man says, showing a fine grasp of barrack-room lingo. In fact, the only inaccuracy was my suggestion that the Royal Navy paid to hire the vessel. It was covered by a credit agreement \"whereby the German navy provide submarine time in exchange for RN operational sea training\". This scheme \"reduces the burden on our own submarines\". Just as well, since our own submarines were out of action at the time. Stripped of all bollocks, the truth is that the only sub patrolling British waters on October 31 was a German U-boat - as I reported. And so to urban myth number two: that the accident-prone SA80 rifle jammed during a firefight between British paras and the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone last year. \"We are not aware of any post-incident report, secret or otherwise, that mentions a jamming problem,\" according to the MoD's spinwallah. \"A lessons-identified report produced by 1 Para on return from Sierra Leone does not mention any problem with the weapon.\" If this is true then the MoD does indeed have grounds for complaint - not least with its own spokesman, who admitted after the firefight last May that \"two soldiers said they could not release their safety catches\". Even more culpable is Peter Hain, then the Foreign Office minister responsible for Sierra Leone, who told the BBC that \"the safety catches jammed and some troops were put in danger. The lessons from that incident will be taken on board, because it must not happen again. The modification programme reflects the government's concern to ensure that this rifle is operating at the utmost level of efficiency.\" Now we learn that the MoD is unaware of any problem. Why, then, has the rifle been modified more than 80 times since it came into service? Why does the SAS refuse to use it? Why has Nato suspended the SA80 from its list of approved weapons? And why does Whitehall rebuke newspapers for peddling \"urban myths\" when the sources for these stories are its own press officers and ministers? Bedsit dirty tricks From Azerbaijan to Zanzibar, admirers of British fair play have been outraged by the revelation that the Labour party recruited students to infiltrate local Tory associations \"as part of an election dirty tricks campaign\". The Mail on Sunday, which alerted the world to this shocking news, describes it as an \"extraordinary underhand ploy\". Michael Ancram, the amiable if harrumphing chairman of the Conservative party, says that \"this is a perfect example of how low Tony Blair's Labour party is willing to stoop in its unprincipled quest for power\". But where did Labour learn this sneaky trick? Not, surely, from my old chum Julian Lewis? Julian first came to public attention in the mid-1970s as a loud and litigious member of Newham North-East Labour party, leading a crusade against \"bedsit entryists\" who were seeking to deselect the local MP, Reg Prentice. Lewis described himself as \"a liberal democrat, an old-style Gaitskellite\", and denounced those \"Trotskyites\" who dared suggest that Prentice was a Tory in all but name. Prentice defected to Margaret Thatcher's Conservative party soon afterwards. It then transpired that Julian was something of a bedsit entryist himself. His expensive lawsuits had been financed by the National Association For Freedom (Naff by name, naff by nature), a rightwing pressure group not known for its Gaitskellite tendencies. If Michael Ancram is to be believed, the Tories would never condone such a deplorable stunt. So was Julian Lewis cast into the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth? As near as makes no difference: in the mid-90s he was appointed deputy research director at Conservative Central Office, and he now sits as the Tory MP for New Forest East.",

Although waves in the north Atlantic had reached up to 15ft and sea temperature was described as extremely low, the exhausted crewman managed to survive a night with the aid of only an immersion suit. But as the bodies of five of his colleagues were also recovered, hopes were fading last night for the final missing crewman of the German-registered trawler Hansa. An international rescue mission was launched late on Monday when the Hansa sent a distress signal from 180 miles off the Scottish coast west of Benbecula, in the Western Isles. Overnight, nine crewmen were rescued from life rafts, but by yesterday morning, six were still missing. Rescue workers feared there was little chance of finding any more survivors, but at around 12.15pm, an RAF Nimrod reconnaissance jet spotted one man in the water. The crew of the jet dropped a survival pack - a dinghy and food - and then watched as the fisherman scrambled into the dinghy. He was later picked up by a fishing boat, before being flown to Benbecula, where he was diagnosed with severe hypothermia. Michael Mulford, a spokesman for the RAF, described the rescue as \"miraculous\". \"A low-flying Nimrod pitched a life raft down to him in a quite dramatic rescue,\" he said. \"This man has been in the water since before midnight. He really must have the survival instinct - this is quite exceptional in the history of search and rescue operations.\" The coastguard at Falmouth first picked up an urgent distress signal from the trawler, which had set sail from the Spanish port of La Caruna, at 11.10pm on Monday. As rescue helicopters from Stornoway and Prestwick made their way to the scene, a jet dropped life rafts for the stricken fishermen. Nine men were rescued and taken to a reception centre on Benbecula suffering mild hypothermia. Yesterday helicopters from Britain, Ireland and Norway searched for the missing men. There were 16 men on board the ship - one German and 15 Spaniards. It is not yet clear what caused the Hansa to sink.",

In 1967, realising that a substantial part of the American society's research funds were going to teams outside the country, Sylvia founded the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, now the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, with its secretariat in London.

So is the government's readiness to go ahead with the change another example of ministerial cringe to populist clamour for law 'n' order? No. On this particular charge, it is not guilty. The initiator of the change was the Macpherson report into the murder of the young black teenager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white racist thugs. Three youths were formally acquitted of the crime when a private prosecution for murder failed. Macpherson called for a review of the double jeopardy rule which precluded a second trial, despite the emergence of new evidence.</p> <p>This was one proposal about which we expressed reservations, suggesting that the law commission, to which the review was referred, should protect the old concept.

It suggests that in murder cases only, the appeal court could, where there is \"compelling\" new evidence, set aside an acquittal and require a second trial. Reluctantly, we agree.</p> <p>Three arguments - two of them weighty - are being advanced by critics. First, that second trials would be unfair because juries would be bound to convict if they knew the retrial was based on evidence which the appeal court had found \"compelling\". That is worrying; but the jury would hear the evidence themselves and would be instructed to form their own opinion. Moreover, the aim would be to keep from the jury the fact that it was a retrial. There are many retrials already - following hung juries or deaths of jurors - where they are unaware that this is the case. Reporting restrictions will apply to appeal court hearings about a rerun. A second objection is that if the police are allowed a second bite, they may be less thorough the first time. That too is a genuine risk, but sloppiness can be stopped by the appeal court ruling out retrials where the relevant evidence should have been collected for a first trial. A new symmetry will be established, with both defence and prosecution allowed to apply for retrials on the emergence of new evidence.</p> <p>A third objection - about breaches to the European convention on human rights - does not hold water. Several European states allow retrials. A new protocol to the convention specifically endorses retrials where new evidence emerges. Nor does applying the new principle retrospectively amount to a breach. A new criminal law would be, but this is a new procedure applied to an old criminal law. The new rule may be too narrowly drawn - why logically should it not be extended to manslaughter and rape? - but it will reinforce public support for the criminal justice system. That is important.

      "bodyText": "The band Blur were at the centre of a high court battle last night after the husband-and-wife team who propelled them to fame launched a claim against EMI Records for \u00a3250,000 in royalties. David and Helen Balfe sold their company, Food Records, to EMI in 1994 as part of a \u00a3475,000 deal which guaranteed them royalties from the next two albums released by the band, whose hits include Parklife, Country House and Song 2. The first album, The Great Escape, sold 2.15m copies worldwide but the second, Live At Budokan - aimed at the Japanese market and not released in the UK - sold only 80,000. The couple argue that they are entitled to royalties from the subsequent highly successful studio album, entitled Blur, which sold 2.4m copies. They say the low circulation live album should not be considered part of the royalties agreement. A judgment on the case is expected this morning. Robert Englehart QC told the high court in London yesterday that the \u00a3250,000 claim also included royalties owing from albums by the group Shampoo. EMI had employed a similar tactic with the female pop duo, Mr Englehart told Judge Boggis QC, giving their second album a restricted release targeted on Japan, where the band had enjoyed an enormous fan following. But he said it was the albums released by Blur, now \"an extremely successful band\", which had \"by far the greater commercial significance\" in the legal dispute. Mr Balfe, a former keyboard player with Julian Cope's Liverpool-based psychedelic group the Teardrop Explodes, established the label in 1983, signing artists including the Woodentops, Zodiac Mindwarp and Jesus Jones. In 1989 the label discovered Blur, then called Seymour and headed by an art student, Damon Albarn. The band were signed over a meal with Food executives in a Soho pizzeria. Balfe, who with his wife owned 75% of the shares in Food, sold the company weeks before the release of Blur's album Parklife, amid tensions in' his relationship with the band. It entered the UK charts at number one and became the standard-bearer of the Britpop phenomenon. Shampoo were in negotiations to sign with Food at the time of the sale. Albarn and fellow Blur members Graham Coxon, Alex James and David Rowntree went on to make Balfe the subject of their less than complimentary single Country House. Representatives of Food Records and EMI refused to comment yesterday pending the outcome of the case. EMI Records, one of the world's biggest record companies, is also at the centre of an investigation into alleged price-fixing of compact discs launched last month by the office of fair trading. The watchdog said it had \"reasonable grounds\" to suspect that the company, along with Sony Music, Universal, BMG, Warner, Virgin and Pinnacle, was keeping CD prices in the United Kingdom artificially high. If the allegations are proven, the companies could be prosecuted under the Competition Act and fined up to 10% of their turnover per year of infringement. Artists for whom the label owns distribution rights encompass a vast range of eras and styles from the Beatles through Pink Floyd and Iron Maiden to Robbie Williams, Kylie Minogue and Geri Halliwell. When the notes turn sour Badfinger In April 2000 Joey Molland, the guitarist and one of two surviving members of the suicide-ravaged pop band, which was signed to the Beatles' Apple label, won a battle recognising his entitlement to \u00a346,650 in royalties from the 1974 album Day After Day. Phil Collins The singer had a hollow victory last April after a court agreed he accidentally overpaid horn players Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis.

Though the Irish agriculture minister Joe Walsh has stated that he found it found it hard to understand the British stance on sporting events, his compatriots have clearly not had such problems. While there will be no Irish horses for them to back at the meeting - the trainers and owners having followed their government's guidelines and withdrawn their animals - the punters have not been so easily deterred. Hotels in the Cheltenham area have reported only a modest number of cancellations. Ryan Air spokesman Enda O'Toole said that the airline was still heavily booked. As a further measure to protect their farming, the Irish government said yesterday that the world cross-country championships, due to be held in Dublin this month, would move to Brussels. Hopes that the foot and mouth crisis might have peaked were yesterday supported when only seven new cases were confirmed - four in Cumbria, two in Devon and another in County Durham and all believed to be connected to previous outbreaks. But the authorities were investigating a second suspected case on Dartmoor, at a farm at Widecombe in the moor five miles from Dunna Bridge Farm, Two Bridges, where an outbreak was confirmed on Sunday.

      "body": "<b> Is there a vaccine available for foot and mouth?</b> <p>There are 50 million doses of foot and mouth vaccine stocked in the EU and ready for use. There are four types of virus so there are different types of vaccine to suit. The UK has the virulent type O, the vaccine to which works very well and protects cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer from getting the disease so to many people it seems the logical option. </p> <p><b> Why don't we get on with it?</b> </p> <p>Vaccination is regarded as a policy of last resort. In the long run it would be costly because we would lose export markets as confidence in UK produce would plummet. Once vaccination is carried out it has to be repeated for new generations. Some animals still carry the virus although they show no symptoms and the countries who use it cease to be regarded as disease-free. Under international rules countries which vaccinate cannot export live animals and meat products to foot and mouth free countries because they carry the danger of infection. </p> <p> <b> When would we use it then?</b> </p> <p> Only if the disease was thought to be completely out of control, and then only if the standing veterinary committee - the top vets from all 15 EU countries - agreed. They met yesterday in Brussels and decided that the UK was coping and that the existing policy of slaughtering all animals would eradicate the disease. This means the UK would soon be able to resume its disease-free status. Vaccination will be reviewed again at another meeting but only if the situation got a lot worse and the UK asked for the policy to be changed. </p> <p> <b> What is the UK view?</b> </p> <p> It would be a calamity in the long run to lose the disease-free status because \u00a31m exports a week at least would be lost.

      "bodyText": "Is there a vaccine available for foot and mouth? There are 50 million doses of foot and mouth vaccine stocked in the EU and ready for use. There are four types of virus so there are different types of vaccine to suit. The UK has the virulent type O, the vaccine to which works very well and protects cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer from getting the disease so to many people it seems the logical option. Why don't we get on with it? Vaccination is regarded as a policy of last resort. In the long run it would be costly because we would lose export markets as confidence in UK produce would plummet. Once vaccination is carried out it has to be repeated for new generations. Some animals still carry the virus although they show no symptoms and the countries who use it cease to be regarded as disease-free. Under international rules countries which vaccinate cannot export live animals and meat products to foot and mouth free countries because they carry the danger of infection. When would we use it then? Only if the disease was thought to be completely out of control, and then only if the standing veterinary committee - the top vets from all 15 EU countries - agreed. They met yesterday in Brussels and decided that the UK was coping and that the existing policy of slaughtering all animals would eradicate the disease. This means the UK would soon be able to resume its disease-free status. Vaccination will be reviewed again at another meeting but only if the situation got a lot worse and the UK asked for the policy to be changed. What is the UK view? It would be a calamity in the long run to lose the disease-free status because \u00a31m exports a week at least would be lost. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, has not wavered from the policy of no vaccination from the first day of the outbreak and believes that slaughtering to eradicate it remains the best option.

He holds the casting vote in the tied 100-member US Senate, and has emerged as the administration's main media spokesman. Mr Bush also relies on Mr Cheney as his most experienced and trusted adviser on a range of issues. Mr Cheney went to hospital on Monday after having two bouts of chest pain in 48 hours. Doctors carried out a \"balloon angioplasty\" to reopen an artery that had narrowed since November.",

      "bodyText": "France ignored British unease about a meeting last night between Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, and President Jacques Chirac, with the two men talking for more than an hour. Officials in Paris said that Tony Blair had been informed of the agenda several days ago. They gave no indication of the prime minister's reaction. In London, the Conservative opposition accused the Blair government of \"shameful silence\" for refusing to elaborate after reports said it was concerned at the \"red carpet treatment\" given to Mr Mugabe on the continent in recent days. Downing Street later said Mr Chirac had been expected to raise human rights issues with Mr Mugabe and insist on the primacy of the rule of law; but Chirac advisers said these matter had not been included in a pre-arranged agenda. The attack on French policy towards Zimbabwe was led by the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude. He called the French ambassador in London, Bernard Daniel, to say that it would be \"wrong and unethical\" if France were trying to increase its influence in central and southern Africa by receiving the Zimbabwean leader, whose status as a liberation icon has been eroded by his regime's attacks on the judiciary, its intimidation of opponents and white farmers, and its role in the ruinous and unpopular Congo war. Mr Mugabe, who arrived in Paris on Friday, met Mr Chirac last night after a one-day visit to Brussels to see the Belgian prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt. Violent incidents in Brussels between Mr Mugabe's bodyguards and the British gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell went unreported by the French press. However, police confirmed that the episode had led to tightened security in Paris. French presidential advisers said the agenda for the talks between Mr Chirac, 68, and Mr Mugabe, 77, concentrated on finding a solution to the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where Zimbabwe has 12,000 troops backing Joseph Kabila. He succeeded his murdered father, Laurent Kabila, as leader last year. Mr Mugabe's opponents at home allege that members of his administration and the army are involved in the war to protect dealings they have in the area's resources. There is a suspicion that Mr Chirac wants to strengthen France's political and economic presence in the Congo and Zimbabwe, one of the English-speaking African states targeted by recent French diplomacy. The opposition in Harare has accused France and Belgium of conniving to dominate the Congo, once a Belgian colony; it fears they will prop up Mr Mugabe to keep him as a go-between. The main opposition leader in Zimbabwe, Morgan Tsvangirai, said there was concern that France and Belgium saw Mr Mugabe as a solution and not a cause of conflict in the Congo. Reports of arrests of Mr Kabila's Angolan advisers appear to have increased Zimbabwe's influence there.",

      "bodyText": "Reduced and inadequate testing has led to a serious decline in the reliability of US weapons, a Pentagon report says. Service chiefs are cutting too many corners and taking too many risks in their efforts to bring expensive new weapons systems into operational use before they have been properly tested, it concludes. \"Cost and schedule pressures are increasingly causing programme managers to accept more risk and it is showing up as performance shortfalls in operational testing,\" says the author of the annual departmental report, Philip Coyle, who resigned as the Pentagon's director of testing and evaluation in January. The report is scathing about the increasing failure to test weapons systems properly, an issue at the centre of the argument about the government's plan to erect a multibillion dollar missile defence shield to protect the US and its allies from attacks by \"rogue states\". Mr Coyle says that earlier tests of the missile shield were too simple to allow a properly informed decision whether to move from the current research phase to deployment, as the administration has made it clear it intends to do. The missile defence test programme is \"not aggressive enough to match the pace of acquisition to support deployment and the test content does not yet address important operational questions,\" the report says. It makes it clear that the armed forces' desire to bring modern hi-tech weapons on stream is consistently running ahead of the proof that they can actually do the job for which they are intended. The failure to submit new systems to adequate testing has caused repeated delays in all the armed services, the report says. \"The impact of reductions [of testing] can be seen in the doubling of army systems that failed to meet reliability requirements,\" Mr Coyle writes. In recent years 66% of all US air force programmes have had to stop operational testing because the system under test was not in fact ready for testing \"due to some major system or safety shortcoming\", the report says. In the past five years 80% of army weapons and equipment programmes have failed to achieve even half of their \"reliability requirements\", it adds. The report is especially critical of the way in which the increasingly ill-fated and hugely expensive V-22 Osprey vertical takeoff aircraft programme has been allowed to get so close to deployment with so many basic safety and reliability issues unsolved. The Osprey, which crashed twice last year killing 23 US marines, is a revolutionary cross between a helicopter and a plane. It is intended to replace the current generation of medium lift assault helicopters. Tests were reduced \"due to cost and schedule pressures\", the report says. Instead of carrying out the planned 103 tests of the controversial tilt-rotor plane, the marines first cut the number to 49 and then conducted only 33. Rather than test the Osprey's reliability under icing conditions or under air combat simulations, the US navy issued waivers to cancel the tests. The report's criticisms of the national missile defence (NMD) programme come at a time when President Bush has ordered his defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, to conduct a review of defence strategy and needs, including the role of NMD. It is expected to recommend a central role for a more extensive NMD system than the one that was tested under the Clinton administration. The report is highly critical of the adequacy of the testing programme to which missile defences were subjected as part of the Clinton administration's more limited programme to examine the feasibility of a land-based system of about 100 anti-missile interceptors based in Alaska. Unsuccessful NMD test intercepts in 1999 and 2000 were not only failures but were dogged by \"considerable limitations\" in reliability, Mr Coyle says. These included a failure to achieve \"realistic engagement conditions\" with respect to radar tracking, range, intercept altitude and closing velocity, as well as other features. The tests were of limited use, because they simulated \"only unsophisticated counter-measures, such as simple balloons\". In real combat, the report says, hostile missiles would be equipped with much more elaborate and effective decoy systems.",

The submarine commander was 45 minutes behind schedule because of the lunch with visiting civilian VIPs, so he ordered a rapid surfacing manoeuvre in half the usual time, said Rear Admiral Charles Griffiths, who is leading the investigation into the sinking of the Ehime Maru off the coast of Hawaii last month. \"He wanted to get to periscope depth in a hurry,\" Admiral Griffiths told the court of inquiry in Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, appointed to decide what happened and whether there should be criminal charges. \"I can surmise it was because they were late from their previous schedule.\" Lunch with the visitors took longer than it might have done because the Greeneville's mess room could cater for only 10 at a time and two sittings were needed. Commander Scott Waddle considered it important to spend \"quality time\" with the guests, who were donors to a memorial fund for another submarine. There were other mistakes on the day the submarine sliced through the hull of the 57-metre Ehime Maru. \"Control room instruments were broken, civilians in the control room distracted the crew, one of two sonar operators was a trainee who was not supervised consistently, a sonar search of the area was incomplete, and the submarine spent only 80 seconds at periscope depth before surfacing,\" Admiral Griffiths said.

There was a giant spotted ray caught in the Indian ocean more than 40 years ago; a 12ft oarfish found by a man walking his dog in Whitby in 1981, so large it had to be cut into six pieces; the first pufferfish to be described by science, by Charles Darwin during his time aboard HMS Beagle; the first groupers, caught by Captain James Cook in the Marquesas islands in the Pacific; a shark from Harrods. </p> <p>Some were \"type specimens\" - the first of their species to be described and named, the official representatives of their kind. Some of them had stayed on much the same shelves, far from the public gaze, in the research departments of the museum since it was built in 1881, and some were far older. Some were collected by Sir Hans Sloane, the 17th-century scientist who invented milk chocolate and gave his name to Sloane Square. </p> <p>Altogether, the museum has 78m specimens of fish, bird, mammal, insect, plant, fossil, mineral and rock. The preserved fish and marine creatures will be seen by the public for the first time with the opening next year of the first \u00a327m phase of the museum's Darwin Centre. Some were plucked from the seas more than two centuries ago and dunked in ship's rum to keep them from rotting. Most of them are now stored in 70% by volume methyl alcohol. </p> <p>\"We've got them since 1774,\" said Oliver Crimmen, curator of fish. \"This is perhaps the longest running experiment in preserving biological specimens. Alcohol seems to work so far, so we are hoping it is more or less permanent. There is no finer method that we have discovered.\" </p> <p>The march of the fish is only the beginning. They will be followed by tanks of sharks and turtles, and then reptiles, spiders and parasitic worms. Future stages will see the transfer of millions of transfixed beetles, butterflies, ants and bees, tens of thousands of dried and pressed plants, thousands of stuffed and dried mammals and birds. </p> <p><strong>Biodiversity</strong><br> </p> <p>The specimens of once living tissue have huge scientific value: they are the cornerstone of a worldwide effort to understand the planet's biodiversity. Birds' eggs from public collections provided evidence of the threat to wildlife from organochlorine pesticides in the 1960s; experts from the museum 10 years later provided solutions to the pests that plagued cassava and other developing world staples. </p> <p>Specimens are now providing DNA samples which could answer questions about evolutionary links. They are also still providing information about disease-bearing pests such as blackfly and mosquito, and about crops and animal diseases - as well as new clues to engineering design. Shark skin is not smooth: it has tiny teeth all over its surface. </p> <p>\"These cut drag and smooth water flows over the shark's body,\" Dr Crimmen said. Now we understand the technique, it is used on the hulls of boats, high performance swimwear and on the bodies of long-haul aircraft to cut fuel costs.\" </p> <p>Some of the museum's largest preserved mammals - stuffed elephants, rhinos and so on - are kept in a controlled environment in a warehouse at Wandsworth. But the zoology department also has to move many of its 10m dried specimens to the new Darwin Centre. \"It might be bones, it might be skins, it might be whole birds, moa bones, bits of dodo and so on,\" said Phil Rainbow, head of zoology. </p> <p>\"We are going to do guided tours to show people the collections we are now moving, but in addition to that we are going to have a meet-the-scientist session, twice a day.

The Natural History Museum has never been able to show even a 100th of its material. The hope is that, by the time the museum has managed to raise a further \u00a353m to complete the Darwin Centre, the bulk of the collection of life's astonishing variety will be open to public gaze. </p> <p>One of the first to wheel a specimen from a dark Victorian storeroom to a partly finished building site was the director, Neil Chalmers. \"It's what it is all about,\" he said. \"It typifies what we are really trying to do. We are trying to replace this old and really unpleasant working environment.\" </p> <p>\"We'll have lifts to all of the floors, we'll have computer touchscreens so people can key in information they want themselves.

Joseph Banks collected 500 fish, and Captain James Cook later collected the first kangaroo to be seen in Europe. </p> <p>\u0095 By 1800, the British Museum had 140,000 specimens. To keep the numbers under control, the departmental head used to burn or bury specimens. With the move to South Kensington in 1882, keepers had to find room for 52,635 bottles of preserved specimens.

      "bodyText": "The Mafia has been suspected of many things in the past, but never of harbouring a predilection for the classics. Yesterday, however, police arrested 14 people accused of helping it take over Italy's National Institute for Ancient Drama, which has been staging theatrical productions in the Greek amphitheatre at Syracuse, Sicily, for 87 years. Investigators said the Mafia began controlling the theatre's car park, then the usher services and the renting of cushions, and eventually assumed complete financial control, boosting costs by up to 500%. The influence of organised crime on theatre contracts transformed a 500,000 lire (\u00a3163,000) profit in 1994 into a 5bn lire loss four years later, they said. Among those arrested was the institute's artistic director, Filippo Amoroso, 52, who is also a professor of drama at Palermo University and artistic director of the principal theatre in Catania. He was joined by Michele Midolo, an alleged Mafia boss linked to the Urso-Bottaro crime family. Another suspect is a leading classical Greek scholar, Umberto Albini. Theatre administrators have been charged with fraud, false accounting and rigging contracts, while their alleged accomplices are accused of extortion and Mafia association. The arrests, dubbed \"Operation Agamemnon\" after an Aeschylus play performed by the institute in 1914, follow a three-year investigation based on information supplied by pentiti (Mafia supergrasses). Police suspect the institute may also have been used to launder Mafia money, because some large purchases were paid for in cash. The prestigious theatrical performances are popular with cultural tourists visiting Sicily and leading Italian actors and directors have been involved in the shows, which are staged every two years. \"The administrators knew perfectly well who they were dealing with and rigged contract tenders to favour them,\" Luigi Rossi, a public prosecutor, said, adding that their inertia had allowed the Mafia to take control of theatrical events and cream off large quantities of public money.",

France Galop chief executive Louis Romanet said: \"The signs are more positive than yesterday. We have to be more hopeful of our horses going to Cheltenham now.\" Chantilly-based Francois Doumen will be the biggest sufferer if the travel ban continues. He is responsible for leading Tote Cheltenham Gold Cup challenger First Gold as well as Royal &amp; SunAlliance Novice Hurdle favourite Baracouda and Elite Racing Club Triumph Hurdle contender Bilboa. Their plans were thrown into turmoil when the French acted to prevent the possible spread of foot and mouth disease with tough measures including a ban on the transportation of horses. But after discussions yesterday the authorities have come up with a strict code of practice to allow horses to go to the races. \"We have had to call off a meeting at Enghien because there was a suspected case 10 kilometres from the course,\" said Romanet yesterday. \"But with the special regulations that have been brought in we are able to hold a trotting meeting tomorrow and will stage a Flat meeting on Thursday.\" He stressed, however, there was no word from the authorities regarding taking horses abroad. \"This is a difficult situation and anything could happen yet.

      "body": "<p>My father, who served in the Royal Artillery, used to tell me as a lad that war consisted of long periods of tedium interrupted by moments of absolute terror.</p> <p>In that case, peace is somewhat different for a soldier, consisting of lengthy periods of tedium interrupted by moments of absolute boredom. Or so one would gather from watching the new chief of defence staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, being grilled by the committee on the armed forces bill yesterday.</p> <p>Things began quietly. The \"chair\", Rachel Squire MP, asked \"before we start, is there anything you would like to say on the subject of the armed forces bill?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" said Sir Michael.</p> <p>This was a good start, but things got even quieter. The subtext of the meeting was that the Tories (apart from the chairwoman, only one Labour MP was there, and he drifted in and out) wanted Sir Michael to fulminate against the bill, predict the imminent demise of our entire military reputation, and if he were to go red in the face and start roaring about not wishing to live to see the day when this nation's soldiers were sent into battle led by a bunch of women, human rights lawyers and shirt-lifters, so much the better.</p> <p>But of course nobody gets to the top in any government department by carrying on like that, least of all in the Ministry of Defence. Invited to say that discipline was about to crumble, Sir Michael merely murmured that \"I don't think there are things in the bill which would make it more difficult to maintain discipline. There are some ways in which it might improve\".</p> <p>I don't suppose that Alastair Campbell had to stand over him with a rubber truncheon to drill in that reply. It's just the way Whitehall warriors learn to talk.</p> <p>No, he continued, there was no evidence at all that the bill would affect operational preparedness.

      "bodyText": "My father, who served in the Royal Artillery, used to tell me as a lad that war consisted of long periods of tedium interrupted by moments of absolute terror. In that case, peace is somewhat different for a soldier, consisting of lengthy periods of tedium interrupted by moments of absolute boredom. Or so one would gather from watching the new chief of defence staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, being grilled by the committee on the armed forces bill yesterday. Things began quietly. The \"chair\", Rachel Squire MP, asked \"before we start, is there anything you would like to say on the subject of the armed forces bill?\" \"No,\" said Sir Michael. This was a good start, but things got even quieter. The subtext of the meeting was that the Tories (apart from the chairwoman, only one Labour MP was there, and he drifted in and out) wanted Sir Michael to fulminate against the bill, predict the imminent demise of our entire military reputation, and if he were to go red in the face and start roaring about not wishing to live to see the day when this nation's soldiers were sent into battle led by a bunch of women, human rights lawyers and shirt-lifters, so much the better. But of course nobody gets to the top in any government department by carrying on like that, least of all in the Ministry of Defence. Invited to say that discipline was about to crumble, Sir Michael merely murmured that \"I don't think there are things in the bill which would make it more difficult to maintain discipline. There are some ways in which it might improve\". I don't suppose that Alastair Campbell had to stand over him with a rubber truncheon to drill in that reply. It's just the way Whitehall warriors learn to talk. No, he continued, there was no evidence at all that the bill would affect operational preparedness. Yes, he conceded, there might be \"some increase in the bureaucratic load\", but everyone would get used to that. Another Tory, Quentin Davies, tried to persuade Sir Michael to demand that our armed forces be exempted from the Human Rights Act, as the French are. You don't catch a wary old submariner out like that. \"It would be easy to say 'yes, it would make things easier for us'. But I think in the long term it will be of benefit ...\" If there was a danger of our getting too excited at seeing Britain's top fighting man in ameliorative action, it was averted by the Venerable John Blackburn, QHC. He is the chaplain general at the Ministry of Defence, which makes him the country's leading sky pilot. General Blackburn (this is a proper military rank, and nothing to do with the Salvation Army) is even more softly spoken than his boss - Admiral Boyce, that is. Ms Squire asked him: \"Is there anything you would like to say to us, chaplain general?\" Gen Blackburn: \"only that I would like to thank you for your warm welcome.\" Ms Squire: \"Thank you.\" This ferocious inquisition continued for some time. Sadly the MPs didn't get round to putting the question I've always wanted to ask a forces padre. What would happen if he were to say to say to his commanding officer, \"look, sir, I've just been talking to the man upstairs - chief of combined ops as I think of Him, ha ha - and, frightfully embarrassingly, it turns out He's not on our side ...\"? But I suppose that's not really their job. As Robert Key, the Tory MP, put it, \"you should have a private room in case you need to give some great big hunk of a man a shoulder to cry on\".

      "body": "<p>Not for the first time, a charismatic, highly praised social carer has been exposed as a risk to those entrusted to her. Not for the first time, there are those who simply refuse to believe it. </p> <p>The extraordinary case of Jeanette Roberts, a devout Christian and former \"carer of the year\", who was allowed to adopt or foster more than 80 children and young adults over the past three decades, has prompted deep soul-searching among care agencies. How could it be that an individual was regarded as so credible an operator that alarm bells failed to ring about a system characterised by, in the words of Mr Justice Hughes, \"deceit, manipulation and considerable emotional damage to many dependent people\"? </p> <p>Yet even now, with the judge's words ringing in their ears, there are supporters of Roberts who claim she is victim of a vendetta, motivated by official panic and public hysteria over child abuse. </p> <p>Until recently, the Old Convent, Roberts's converted convent deep in rural Essex, had been hailed by numerous celebrities and charities as a model community: a place of warmth, love and refuge for damaged children and vulnerable adults whom no one else wanted. </p> <p>But on a November morning in 1998, all that changed. A hundred police and social workers raided the Old Convent, removing all its 26 residents to \"places of safety\" and arresting Roberts and four colleagues on charges of physical abuse. </p> <p>Essex police and social services say they had no choice but to investigate what was a large number of serious complaints, launching a hugely expensive operation that prompted the longest family court case in history. Ian Grant, lead social services manager throughout the operation, insists you cannot put a price on justice. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the recent outcome of the family court proceedings raises many unanswered questions - not least, about the morality of a care system which placed responsibility for so many highly vulnerable people in one individual's hands. </p> <p>All criminal charges against Roberts and her associates have now been dropped. Some of the removed children and adults have been returned to Roberts's care - a decision taken as vindication of her innocence by supporters, including Family in Trust, a charity which supports the Old Convent financially. </p> <p>Those who read the judge's published ruling may take a different view. Although the judgment does not find the regime at the Old Convent to have been habitually violent, and acknowledges the benefits Roberts brought to many individuals, it is very critical of her child-rearing methods. Confinement and other heavy-handed methods of discipline were used too freely; exclusive loyalty to the Roberts \"family\" was demanded at the cost of contact with birth families; and children were questioned intensely and inappropriately about previous sexual abuse. </p> <p>Should this be surprising? As her biographer, Claire Lorrimer, recounts, Roberts (who herself came from a very abusive family background) rapidly became the foster carer who could never say no. Her undertaking became unfeasibly large: children, some severely abused and neglected; young people with multiple disabilities and grossly disturbed behaviour. From the time she began caring for youngsters in London's east end, these, and later their offspring, became her extended family, all taking the Roberts family name. </p> <p>Thirty-six were adopted by her. And, despite her lack of training and frequent run-ins with the authorities, the shortage of carers - particularly for older, seriously damaged children - meant that hard-pressed social service agencies were only too happy to oblige. \"She became a victim of her own success,\" says Pat Verity, deputy director of the National Foster Care Association. \"Her ability to turn these children around was 'rewarded' with yet more placements.\" </p> <p>From time to time, serious doubts were raised about Roberts's unconventional practices. But, by and large, she was left to get on with mothering her ever-expanding flock; largely unregulated and unsupervised by social services since, technically, she was not running a children's home. </p> <p>Parents for Children, a charity which seeks homes for \"hard to place\" children, put seven young people with Roberts in the early 1980s. Its director, Karen Irving, believes that, given the dictates of the fostering and adoption market place, it was the best option available at the time. But with so many emotionally disturbed children directing such primitive emotions at their primary carer, she says, the circumstances were always there for a potential disaster. </p> <p>Danya Glaser, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street children's hospital, London, argues: \"In this kind of setting it's extremely difficult to avoid using undesirable methods of discipline. In fact, it's very questionable how far this number of children can form any kind of attachment with their 'mother'.\" A small, family-type setting can give fostered and adopted children a real sense of belonging, she says, but one on this scale can only enforce that sense of identity by draw ing increasingly artificial boundaries around itself - for example, by refusing to acknowledge its members originally came from somewhere else. </p> <p>This, many childcare specialists, is one of the most disturbing features of the Old Convent regime. Roberts's defenders insist that adopting a new identity is therapeutic for some children coming from a life of abuse, and a useful safety device to protect them from former abusers. But, for her detractors, it smacks of an old-fashioned, Dickensian mission to \"rescue\" poor unfortunates and set them on a virtuous path. </p> <p>\"It amounts to a terrible denial and betrayal of a child's life history,\" says children's services consultant Christine Walby. \"Everything we know about adoption tells us children have a desperate hunger to know about their past.\" Equally worrying is the apparent willingness of the statutory services to place so much trust in one super-carer. For Walby, who became Staffordshire social services director after the infamous \"pin-down\" scandal of the early 1990s, there are uncomfortable parallels with past experiences of charismatic individuals working with highly disturbed young people. </p> <p>\"Tony Latham's humiliating pin-down practices, and Frank Beck's abusive 'regression therapy' [in Leicestershire], went unchallenged for so long because of the pathetic and unrealistic search by managers and inexperienced staff for a quick fix,\" says Walby. \"They stood in awe of anyone who could 'keep the little sods quiet' for a while.\" </p> <p>There is plenty of scope in children's services for people with commitment, originality and flair who will go the extra mile, she says, \"but their work has to be rigorous and rooted in respect for good practice. They need to be challenged, and be prepared to accept advice.\" </p> <p>In Roberts's case, that was no doubt made difficult by her growing celebrity status; the accolades from Esther Rantzen, royalty and BBC's Children in Need appeal. But how, throughout all these years, could there have been - in the words of one witness to the court proceedings - such \"serial corporate blindness\". Was no one aware of the implications of placing yet another child or vulnerable adult in such a pressurised setting? </p> <p>A Department of Health \"serious case review\" is now under way. Belatedly, it will ask why so many children were permitted to be fostered and adopted by one carer, and why none of the authorities and agencies seemed to know what the others were about.

The right-back Carteron, 30, will arrive from St-Etienne on loan until the end of the season with a view to a permanent move. </p> <p>Reid is also about to make a week-long scouting trip to Argentina. It is understood the 18-year-old Argentinian midfielder Nicolas Medina and Boca Juniors defender Hugo Ibarra are on his list.

Reid has agreed a \u00a31.4m fee with Ipswich for the sale of 27-year-old full-back Chris Makin, while at the same time snapping up Frenchman Patrice Carteron on loan. Makin joined Sunderland from Marseille in a \u00a3500,000 move in July 1997 and has made 142 appearances since. \"He has been a great servant here and I hope things go well for him at Ipswich,\" said Reid. The right-back Carteron, 30, will arrive from St-Etienne on loan until the end of the season with a view to a permanent move. Reid is also about to make a week-long scouting trip to Argentina. It is understood the 18-year-old Argentinian midfielder Nicolas Medina and Boca Juniors defender Hugo Ibarra are on his list. He is also believed to have renewed his interest in Brann's Norwegian midfielder Alex Valencia. The Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson hopes to clinch the \u00a31m signing of the Bradford forward Dean Windass today.

Salford council is developing a plan to destroy streets where more than three quarters of houses are derelict. Green areas will be introduced, home owners whose house value has plummeted will be asked to leave their homes to the bulldozers and will be offered nearby houses that match their current status. Community facilities will be improved. </p> <p>But the Thompsons do not want to move. They want the council to revamp the area.

They cannot afford to install central heating or do repairs to their roof and rotting windows and doors. if they know they will not see a return on their investment. </p> <p>The Curwens' 11-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son share a room. Their three-year-old sleeps in a cot in his parents' room. The couple wanted to build an extension for another bedroom but now they cannot afford to. </p> <p>\"We are trapped here.

They are now trapped there. The market has collapsed and houses are worth as little as \u00a31,500. Mrs Thompson, 60, and her husband Arthur bought a two bedroom house in Langworthy, Salford, when they married in 1967. It cost them \u00a3600. Over the last 20 years, they have paid off their mortgage, built a \u00a319,000 extension and redecorated. Twelve years ago their house was worth \u00a334,000. This year it was valued at \u00a37,500. Less than two miles away, in central Manchester, two bedroom flats sell for \u00a3500,000. Mrs Thompson said: \"When we bought this house it was a sought after area. You had to fight to get in. We had no idea what would happen to what was once a fantastic community. We invested for our children and our retirement but we'll never get that money back. They call this place the Bronx. The council wants us to leave so they can rebuild the street. They have had the house valued at \u00a37,500. What are we supposed to do with that?\" Mrs Thompson is a cleaner and her husband is a van driver. On their salaries, if they had to leave, they could not afford to rent. At their age, they cannot get a mortgage. The kitchen floor has begun to subside, and the bathroom will have to be refitted. Salford council is developing a plan to destroy streets where more than three quarters of houses are derelict. Green areas will be introduced, home owners whose house value has plummeted will be asked to leave their homes to the bulldozers and will be offered nearby houses that match their current status. Community facilities will be improved. But the Thompsons do not want to move. They want the council to revamp the area. They and people who bought houses 10 years ago have little hope. Stephen and Dawn Curwen bought a two bedroom terrace for \u00a326,000 in 1993. It is now worth \u00a35,000. The couple, both 33, have three children and a high mortgage. They cannot afford to install central heating or do repairs to their roof and rotting windows and doors. if they know they will not see a return on their investment. The Curwens' 11-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son share a room. Their three-year-old sleeps in a cot in his parents' room. The couple wanted to build an extension for another bedroom but now they cannot afford to. \"We are trapped here. What sort of life is this? There is nothing for my kids to do. We wanted to get our foot on the ladder but we fell through to the cellar,\" Mrs Curwen said.",

She called the audience \"my friends\", never asked for the house lights to be turned down, and confided that she needed tea for her throat at the interval. </p> <p>Having established this intimate setting, she proceeded with an almost casual demonstration of her extraordinary vocal skills. She eased into her ragas gently, tamburas and harmonium providing a wash of sound against which she matched her gently drifting, trance-like vocals. Then in came the subtle, gently rousing tabla work of Mukundraj Deo, and the song began to change from mesmeric to exhilarating, as she suddenly moved into passages of quite remarkable, rapid-fire scales and improvisation. Now her voice was wailing and swooping as she showed off some of her three-and-a-half-octave range. She was singing at frantic speed, but never once gave the impression she was under any pressure. It was a remarkable tour-de-force, especially as the first song alone lasted nearly an hour. </p> <p>Born into a family of musicians, Sultana gave her first classical recital at the age of 12 and was hailed as a child prodigy. Her ease, confidence and range established her as one of the stars of Indian music, occasionally moving away from her classical roots to provide songs for the Bollywood movie industry. </p> <p>However, although she is a major celebrity in India, and has performed in concert halls around the world, Sultana has never become well-known in the west, despite the popularity of world music.

There is not a single secondary school in the area.\" </p> <p>The city council wants stronger powers to halt the cycle of decline by earmarking whole streets as property improvement zones, where authorities - using public funds if necessary - will guarantee that prices will not fall below a certain level. </p> <p>Andrew Bennett, MP for Denton and Reddish, in Greater Manchester, is now pressing the government for revised legislation to create the zones. \"The very act of guaranteeing a 'floor' in the market, below which prices would not be allowed to fall, would maintain confidence in the area,\" he said. \"It is now impossible to sell in some areas, although a mile or so away similar [terrace] houses are going for \u00a3100,000. It is an appalling situation, with some people unable to sell their houses - and others scared stiff of going into areas because they know if they buy a house it will lose value.\" </p> <p>He fears that the problem of low demand and abandonment will spread from east Manchester to the neighbouring authorities of Stockport and Tameside, which embrace his constituency. \"Already there are signs of the poorer areas spreading out and decline, once it sets in, can take root very quickly.\" </p> <p><strong> Dire position</strong><br> </p> <p>A third of homes in east Manchester are vacant in a conurbation with more derelict land than any other part of the country. Terraces that have not been demolished are boarded up and vandalised. On some estates nearby, almost half the housing is vacant. Tom Bloxham, chairman of the Manchester-based developers Urban Splash, which has created 1,000 city centre flats in Manchester and Liverpool - several are on the market for \u00a3700,000 - acknowledges that the urban \"doughnut\" has left some neighbourhoods in a \"dire position\", with unsaleable houses and a string of social problems. </p> <p>But he believes that the city centre property renaissance - central Manchester now has 10,000 residents - will eventually ripple out to east Manchester and elsewhere. \"Ten years ago no one would have dreamt that so many old warehouses would be redeveloped and that people would invest in city properties on this scale,\" he said. \"Now, as the city centre gets fuller the market will spread out. There is no reason why there should not be a radical transformation elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Development is continuing to blight the countryside at the expense of rebuilding cities, in spite of planning guidelines introduced a year ago, according to a report published today by the Council for the Protection of Rural England. </p> <p>Plans for 658,000 houses on green fields are still in the pipeline - enough to accommodate the demands of the top 80 housebuilders for six years before touching an urban site.</p>",

At present, councils anxious to redevelop rundown areas can only compensate owners for the market value of their property - which means that many people stand to gain nothing and could be left with huge debts because their mortgage far exceeds the value of a house. The full extent of the problem, particularly acute in Greater Manchester and Merseyside, has been underlined in a report from Birmingham University showing that 280,000 homes along the north-west's M62 corridor alone are blighted - 17% of properties - including almost 100,000 private houses. Researchers working for 39 councils and housing associations have called for a government fund to tackle areas of low demand and abandoned housing because current programmes are inadequate to cope with a deepening crisis. The issue was underlined at a recent Guardian North debate which highlighted the sharp north-south property divide - prices in even the poorer parts of Greater London remain buoyant - and the deep divisions within northern cities where apartments have been sold for up to \u00a31m barely a mile from areas where property prices are collapsing. Research undertaken for the Guardian by Brian Robson, a government urban adviser and head of Manchester University's centre for urban policy studies, warned that northern cities are increasingly characterised by the North American \"doughnut\" phenomenon - thriving, rebuilt centres surrounded by a wasteland of dereliction and abandoned housing, with many trapped in streets where prices have collapsed.

Professor Robson's report spoke of houses selling \"if at all\" for less than \u00a310,000, with unemployment twice the Manchester average and a mortality rate 50% above the national norm. \"In a city which now boasts of selling its first \u00a31m flat, the terraces of east Manchester are largely unsaleable,\" he wrote. \"A quarter of Manchester houses sell for less than \u00a320,000 and in east Manchester many sell for \u00a35,000 ... across the area, some 20% of housing is vacant and, in parts, whole streets stand empty. There is not a single secondary school in the area.\" The city council wants stronger powers to halt the cycle of decline by earmarking whole streets as property improvement zones, where authorities - using public funds if necessary - will guarantee that prices will not fall below a certain level. Andrew Bennett, MP for Denton and Reddish, in Greater Manchester, is now pressing the government for revised legislation to create the zones. \"The very act of guaranteeing a 'floor' in the market, below which prices would not be allowed to fall, would maintain confidence in the area,\" he said. \"It is now impossible to sell in some areas, although a mile or so away similar [terrace] houses are going for \u00a3100,000. It is an appalling situation, with some people unable to sell their houses - and others scared stiff of going into areas because they know if they buy a house it will lose value.\" He fears that the problem of low demand and abandonment will spread from east Manchester to the neighbouring authorities of Stockport and Tameside, which embrace his constituency. \"Already there are signs of the poorer areas spreading out and decline, once it sets in, can take root very quickly.\" Dire position A third of homes in east Manchester are vacant in a conurbation with more derelict land than any other part of the country. Terraces that have not been demolished are boarded up and vandalised. On some estates nearby, almost half the housing is vacant. Tom Bloxham, chairman of the Manchester-based developers Urban Splash, which has created 1,000 city centre flats in Manchester and Liverpool - several are on the market for \u00a3700,000 - acknowledges that the urban \"doughnut\" has left some neighbourhoods in a \"dire position\", with unsaleable houses and a string of social problems. But he believes that the city centre property renaissance - central Manchester now has 10,000 residents - will eventually ripple out to east Manchester and elsewhere. \"Ten years ago no one would have dreamt that so many old warehouses would be redeveloped and that people would invest in city properties on this scale,\" he said. \"Now, as the city centre gets fuller the market will spread out. There is no reason why there should not be a radical transformation elsewhere.\" Development is continuing to blight the countryside at the expense of rebuilding cities, in spite of planning guidelines introduced a year ago, according to a report published today by the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Plans for 658,000 houses on green fields are still in the pipeline - enough to accommodate the demands of the top 80 housebuilders for six years before touching an urban site.",

Under a wide-ranging series of proposals unveiled yesterday by Paul Myners, a senior fund manager commissioned by chancellor Gordon Brown to review the industry, pension funds will operate under a new 10 point code of conduct. Mr Myners, chairman of the Gartmore fund management group and the Guardian Media Group, allowed no part of the highly lucrative industry to escape unscathed with actuaries, pension fund trustees and fund managers, and major stocking broking firms all facing calls for radical change. He criticised the industry for \"slavish adherence to consensus\" and described \"herding\" as \"a pervasive feature of UK institutional investment\". His 200-page report, which is expected to be endorsed by the chancellor in his budget speech today, is also likely to lead to a new investigation into the way the life insurance industry operates. Following the recommendations made by Mr Myners, the chancellor is expected to commission a new wide-ranging analysis of the relationship between financial advisers and insurance companies and the policies eventually sold to investors. Mr Myners suspects that the way insurance policies are sold is on the basis of commissions and fees paid rather than on the performance of the financial products themselves. A new investigation into the life insurance industry would affect 20% of the \u00a31,500bn invested in the stock market each year. Another 20% is invested by the pension funds, which received most of Mr Myners' attention during his nine-month investigation to establish why so little money is invested in start-up companies, known as venture capital. He said yesterday: \"The review finds that savers' money is too often being invested in ways that do not maximise their interests. It is likely to follow too that capital is being inefficiently allocated in the economy.\" The main thrust of his proposals, which calls for the code of conduct to be enshrined in law if it is not adopted voluntarily within two years, is to make pension trustees better equipped for their roles in deciding how pension fund money is invested, by whom and for how long. For this reason, Mr Myners believes trustees should be paid and better trained. In this way their reliance on just four firms of pension fund consultancy firms, who provide 70% of all the advice received by the industry, would be reduced.

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown is expected to use today's Budget to initiate a new investigation into the way life assurance and other savings policies are sold, following yesterday's attack on the \"herd-like\" behaviour of the pension fund industry by Paul Myners. </p> <p>Mr Myners, a senior fund manager commissioned by Mr Brown nine months ago to establish why so little money is invested in start-up businesses, yesterday recommended a separate, independent investigation into the life industry after completing his wide-ranging review. </p> <p>The chairman of the Gartmore fund management group and of the Guardian Media Group lambasted the \u00a3800bn industry of which he is part, saying it suffered from a \"slavish adherence to consensus\" and \"herd-like\" tendencies. </p> <p>His analysis was the second commissioned by Mr Brown into the financial services industry and his approach contrasted with the combative one taken by Don Cruickshank when he scrutinised banking competition in 1999. </p> <p>The prospect of a third inquiry at the behest of Mr Brown brought immediate warnings from the insurance industry of \"review overload\". </p> <p>Mr Myners said yesterday there were issues about the way insurance products were sold, more on fees than performance, which needed to be investigated. \"I've been worried about the engine beneath the bonnet of the car. Many people wanted to talk about the design of the car.\" His scrutiny led him to conclude that the pension fund industry, which has \u00a3800bn of assets to nurture on behalf of investors saving for their old age, tends to invest them in similar ways in identical stocks. </p> <p><strong> Cosy world</strong><br> </p> <p>That meant \"savers' money is too often being invested in ways that do not maximise their interests\". </p> <p>It also meant that venture capitalists, who invest funds in start-up companies, were fortunate if as much as 5% of this total went in their direction. Mr Myners cited statistics showing that, while investment by American pension funds in venture capital had tripled since 1996, British pension funds had reduced their investment over the same period. </p> <p>This is the discrepancy Mr Myners was commissioned to address. He tried to lift the lid on the cosy world of institutional investment management and the relationship between pension fund trustees, the big fund management firms, actuarial consultants and big stock broking firms. </p> <p>Mr Myners saw the root of the problem as pension fund trustees, who are rarely paid, may be poorly trained and have little support from their employers. </p> <p>This increases the reliance of pension fund trustees on just four consultancy firms for advice about which fund management company to appoint. The fund managers are all measured against the same benchmark - often a stock market index such as the FTSE 100 - which again contributes to their \"herd-like\" behaviour and \"short-termism\". </p> <p>At the same time, the fund managers buy research from City stockbroking firms to help decide which shares to buy and sell. This might also be a latent force in the \"herd-like\" mentality. </p> <p>All of this contributes to an industry where the big pension fund managers -Schroders, Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Phillips &amp; Drew and Hermes - try to be top of the all-important league tables so that actuaries recommend them to pension fund trustees. This also means that when their performance flags they tend to be replaced by the manager currently making better returns. This leads to a musical chairs every three years or so and enforces the short-termism. </p> <p>In an attempt to break down this structural problem, Mr Myners outlined a 10-point code of conduct that would allow pension fund trustees to be paid and receive more training. Improving their knowledge was at the root of tackling the remaining distortions in the market. </p> <p>He admitted that his code, which he suggested should be voluntary for the next two years before legislation is considered, was \"manifest common sense\". </p> <p>His vision would place the onus on pension fund trustees to provide clear targets for fund managers on how to invest and how their performance is measured. </p> <p>Some restricting rules, such as the minimum funding requirement introduced after Robert Maxwell raided the Mirror Group pension fund, also needed to be abandoned or updated, Mr Myners said. </p> <p>Little detail was provided about how this would work in practice and prompted stinging criticism from Towers Perrin, one of the firms of actuaries providing advice to pension fund trustees. </p> <p>Mark Duke, principal at Towers Perrin, said: \"Mr Myners may have found the subjects of governance and management far more complex than he anticipated. Perhaps the lack of substance and practical content in the review is indicative of him finding the topic too hard.\" </p> <p>Other firms were less scathing in their response. Andrew Kirton, William M Mercer investment practice leader, which is the biggest consultant in Britain, advising 20% of pension schemes, said: \"We can argue about some of the details but there are lots of reasons to be supportive. </p> <p>\"Could the trustees be made more expert at investment decisions? Yes, but with trustees you are drawing people from a wide range of backgrounds.\" </p> <p>Along with a number of fund managers, Mr Kirton pointed out that the industry was already moving along the path suggested in the Myners review of following more customised performance targets. </p> <p>Andre Maclaren, head of asset allocation at Swiss-owned Phillips &amp; Drew, one of the five biggest pension fund managers, said: \"The herd game has been going on for several years, but it's becoming less profitable than it used to be, because it's been rumbled by the consultants.\" </p> <p>Trustees also felt the ideas outlined in the Myners review were already being adopted. David Fry, a current trustee of the \u00a3100m Origin pension fund, said: \"A lot of what is being recommended is what we and other big funds have been doing for some time, particularly in terms of training and support for trustees.\" </p> <p>Mr Myners refused to indicate how much the cost of his proposals - paying trustees, for instance - would dent the pension fund industry. He suggested this would be outweighed by \"huge opportunities for enhanced returns\". </p> <p>He asked the chancellor to give the industry two years to adopt his code before legislation was considered. This legislation would require an explanation from any pension fund flouting the rules, as with the Cadbury code on corporate governance. </p> <p>While the industry insists that it is already progressing towards the ideas in the Myners review, some admit privately that a change in attitude will be needed. Mr Myners quotes economist John Keynes to describe the necessary change in mindset: \"Worldly wisdom teaches that is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.\" </p> <p><strong>Practitioners predict the death of the closet indexer</strong></p> <p><strong> The pension manager</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>ANDREW MACLAREN,</strong> head of asset allocation at Phillips &amp; Drew, part of UBS Asset Management, which looks after \u00a3124bn. </p> <p>Phillips &amp; Drew believes it is exempt from Mr Myners's condemnation of the \"herd instinct\" in the City, as its investment director, Tony Dye famously turned against the herd five years ago, predicting a downturn in markets. The bet - for the first few years - failed to pay off, and as clients headed for the exit, other fund managers saw it as a classic case of investment risk outweighing the commercial risk to the company. </p> <p>Mr Maclaren says the Myners review will not result in a \"step change\" in fund management, but will mark the death of the \"closet indexer\" which avoids risk by clinging around an index but charges the full fees of active management. \"The herd game is now less profitable than it used to be - it's been rumbled by the consultants. I see the market becoming more polarised between indexers and real active managers.\" </p> <p>He is less than enthusiastic about the prospect for a rush into venture capital. \"It's quite likely it will increase, but the market in the UK is not as deep as in the US, and the past track record is not significantly better than the FTSE.\" </p> <p><strong> The investment consultant</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> ANDREW KIRTON,</strong> head consultant at William M Mercer, the biggest adviser in Britain, working on behalf of 20% of UK pension schemes. </p> <p>Consultants such as William M Mercer are best known as the all-powerful intermediaries that can make or break City fund management houses, running \"beauty parades\", used to decide if the manager will win - or lose - billions in pension fund money. </p> <p>Mr Kirton believes the Myners review will result in significant, if not revolutionary, changes. \"He's pushing at an open door. The changes will be that the mandates to fund managers will become clearer and more explicit; there will be a greater focus on the active versus passive management debate; the risk control elements will be less severely restricted, giving managers the opportunity to outperform; and there will be more demand from clients for private equity [venture capital].\" </p> <p>Cash going into private equity is not about to explode - Mr Kirton believes the biggest new investment area for pension funds over the next few years will be into hedge funds. </p> <p>He also believes that the days when consultants poured money into the \"big four\" investment managers (including Mr Myners's company, Gartmore), which encouraged a herd mentality, are over. \"Concentration had gone too far. The big managers have slipped as we've seen the arrival of companies such as JP Morgan, Capital and Fidelity into the market. Trustees are casting their net much more widely.\" </p> <p><strong> The trustee</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>DAVID FRY,</strong> managing director of the \u00a32bn Philips UK pension fund between 1995-1999, and an independent trustee on a Philips offshoot, Origin, which has a \u00a3100m pension fund. </p> <p>As part of a big multinational, Mr Fry was at the fortunate end of the trustee world, with significant re sources to draw upon and extensive internal support. He agrees with Mr Myners that many trustees are being asked to take crucial decisions without resources, expertise or internal support. At Philips, the trustees, drawn from employees and senior directors, are advised by an expert investment sub- committee, and new trustees are sent on training courses. \"In the past that sort of training has been neglected, especially by smaller firms. But even with large funds, the courses that new trustees have gone on have tended not to focus on investment issues.\" </p> <p>Hopes that the Myners review may lead to more capital for start-ups are likely to be dashed, he says. For example, the Philips fund has 45,000 members, but only 4,500 are contributing employees, and the rest are pensioners \"in payment\". With such a mature profile of liabilities, the fund is unlikely to want to invest in high-risk venture capital start-ups. \"The fund has had some venture capital, but it will not be reinvesting.\" However, it has decided to spread its investments more internationally in recent years. </p> <p>Trustee meetings take up about 10 days a year, but Mr Fry says this is in company time when the trustee is being paid. He believes extra payment, as proposed by Myners, should only be for work done over and above the meetings. </p> <p><strong>Ways to split up the herd</strong></p> <p><strong> The problem</strong> </p> <p>Pension fund trustees take crucial investment decisions yet lack resources and expertise. They are not paid. </p> <p>This means they rely on a handful of investment consulting firms for advice and set objectives for fund managers which result in \"herd-like\" behaviour. </p> <p>This ultimately deters investment in start-up or venture capital. </p> <p><strong> The Myners solution</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 A 10-point Cadbury-style code of conduct under which trustees should be paid and investment managers given clearer, individual performance benchmarks which are not related to a stock market index. </p> <p>\u0095 The minimum funding requirement, which was introduced after the Maxwell pension scandal and means funds have to buy a certain amount of government bonds, should be abolished. </p> <p>\u0095 Shareholder \"activism\", as in the United States, should be endorsed to encourage underperforming companies to improve. Fund managers should be able to measure how effective they are in instigating change. </p> <p>\u0095 The definition of people who are pension fund trustees should be changed so they become \"familiar\" with the issues on which they make decisions, as is the case in the United States. </p> <p>\u0095 The law commission should be asked to look for ways of suggesting greater clarity in establishing the ownership of surplus pension assets. </p> <p>\u0095 Institutional fund managers should include the cost of advice they receive from investment banking analysts for research on specific stocks in the overall fee they charge their pension fund client, rather than pass on the bill to the pension fund. </p> <p>\u0095 The chancellor should commission a separate investigation into the life assurance industry to scrutinise the disclosure and visibility of the performance of personal finance products. </p> <p>\u0095 While 70% of all consultancy advice is provided by four firms, a competition review is not necessary</p>",

David Fry, a current trustee of the \u00a3100m Origin pension fund, said: \"A lot of what is being recommended is what we and other big funds have been doing for some time, particularly in terms of training and support for trustees.\" Mr Myners refused to indicate how much the cost of his proposals - paying trustees, for instance - would dent the pension fund industry. He suggested this would be outweighed by \"huge opportunities for enhanced returns\". He asked the chancellor to give the industry two years to adopt his code before legislation was considered. This legislation would require an explanation from any pension fund flouting the rules, as with the Cadbury code on corporate governance. While the industry insists that it is already progressing towards the ideas in the Myners review, some admit privately that a change in attitude will be needed. Mr Myners quotes economist John Keynes to describe the necessary change in mindset: \"Worldly wisdom teaches that is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.\" Practitioners predict the death of the closet indexer The pension manager ANDREW MACLAREN, head of asset allocation at Phillips &amp; Drew, part of UBS Asset Management, which looks after \u00a3124bn. Phillips &amp; Drew believes it is exempt from Mr Myners's condemnation of the \"herd instinct\" in the City, as its investment director, Tony Dye famously turned against the herd five years ago, predicting a downturn in markets. The bet - for the first few years - failed to pay off, and as clients headed for the exit, other fund managers saw it as a classic case of investment risk outweighing the commercial risk to the company. Mr Maclaren says the Myners review will not result in a \"step change\" in fund management, but will mark the death of the \"closet indexer\" which avoids risk by clinging around an index but charges the full fees of active management. \"The herd game is now less profitable than it used to be - it's been rumbled by the consultants. I see the market becoming more polarised between indexers and real active managers.\" He is less than enthusiastic about the prospect for a rush into venture capital. \"It's quite likely it will increase, but the market in the UK is not as deep as in the US, and the past track record is not significantly better than the FTSE.\" The investment consultant ANDREW KIRTON, head consultant at William M Mercer, the biggest adviser in Britain, working on behalf of 20% of UK pension schemes. Consultants such as William M Mercer are best known as the all-powerful intermediaries that can make or break City fund management houses, running \"beauty parades\", used to decide if the manager will win - or lose - billions in pension fund money. Mr Kirton believes the Myners review will result in significant, if not revolutionary, changes. \"He's pushing at an open door. The changes will be that the mandates to fund managers will become clearer and more explicit; there will be a greater focus on the active versus passive management debate; the risk control elements will be less severely restricted, giving managers the opportunity to outperform; and there will be more demand from clients for private equity [venture capital].\" Cash going into private equity is not about to explode - Mr Kirton believes the biggest new investment area for pension funds over the next few years will be into hedge funds. He also believes that the days when consultants poured money into the \"big four\" investment managers (including Mr Myners's company, Gartmore), which encouraged a herd mentality, are over. \"Concentration had gone too far. The big managers have slipped as we've seen the arrival of companies such as JP Morgan, Capital and Fidelity into the market. Trustees are casting their net much more widely.\" The trustee DAVID FRY, managing director of the \u00a32bn Philips UK pension fund between 1995-1999, and an independent trustee on a Philips offshoot, Origin, which has a \u00a3100m pension fund. As part of a big multinational, Mr Fry was at the fortunate end of the trustee world, with significant re sources to draw upon and extensive internal support. He agrees with Mr Myners that many trustees are being asked to take crucial decisions without resources, expertise or internal support. At Philips, the trustees, drawn from employees and senior directors, are advised by an expert investment sub- committee, and new trustees are sent on training courses. \"In the past that sort of training has been neglected, especially by smaller firms. But even with large funds, the courses that new trustees have gone on have tended not to focus on investment issues.\" Hopes that the Myners review may lead to more capital for start-ups are likely to be dashed, he says. For example, the Philips fund has 45,000 members, but only 4,500 are contributing employees, and the rest are pensioners \"in payment\". With such a mature profile of liabilities, the fund is unlikely to want to invest in high-risk venture capital start-ups. \"The fund has had some venture capital, but it will not be reinvesting.\" However, it has decided to spread its investments more internationally in recent years. Trustee meetings take up about 10 days a year, but Mr Fry says this is in company time when the trustee is being paid. He believes extra payment, as proposed by Myners, should only be for work done over and above the meetings. Ways to split up the herd The problem Pension fund trustees take crucial investment decisions yet lack resources and expertise. They are not paid. This means they rely on a handful of investment consulting firms for advice and set objectives for fund managers which result in \"herd-like\" behaviour. This ultimately deters investment in start-up or venture capital. The Myners solution \u0095 A 10-point Cadbury-style code of conduct under which trustees should be paid and investment managers given clearer, individual performance benchmarks which are not related to a stock market index. \u0095 The minimum funding requirement, which was introduced after the Maxwell pension scandal and means funds have to buy a certain amount of government bonds, should be abolished. \u0095 Shareholder \"activism\", as in the United States, should be endorsed to encourage underperforming companies to improve. Fund managers should be able to measure how effective they are in instigating change. \u0095 The definition of people who are pension fund trustees should be changed so they become \"familiar\" with the issues on which they make decisions, as is the case in the United States. \u0095 The law commission should be asked to look for ways of suggesting greater clarity in establishing the ownership of surplus pension assets. \u0095 Institutional fund managers should include the cost of advice they receive from investment banking analysts for research on specific stocks in the overall fee they charge their pension fund client, rather than pass on the bill to the pension fund. \u0095 The chancellor should commission a separate investigation into the life assurance industry to scrutinise the disclosure and visibility of the performance of personal finance products. \u0095 While 70% of all consultancy advice is provided by four firms, a competition review is not necessary",
