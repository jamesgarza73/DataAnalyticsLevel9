      "bodyText": "Fresh doubts about conducting business over the internet were raised last night after an apparent security breach forced Barclays to shut down its online banking service. The bank, which says it is the country's largest internet bank with more than 1.2m customers, was last night scrambling to restore confidence in its service after customers complained they were able to access other customers' accounts in cyberspace. While the shutdown once again raised questions about the safety of handling finances online, it also added further embarrassment to the bank which has been battling to restore its reputation after a series of public relations disasters. These have ranged from the public outcry over the pay package awarded to chief executive, Matt Barrett, to the bank's insensitivity in closing rural branches and its insistence on charging customers for cash machine withdrawals. A clumsily-timed advertising campaign, fronted by Hollywood stars such as Anthony Hopkins, emphasising the bank's size added to its publicity woes. The latest problem was described by Barclays as \"unacceptable\" and the bank said it followed an upgrade to its online services carried out over the weekend. Four customers, out of 85,000 who have used the online service since the weekend's upgrade, complained that they could see other cus tomers' accounts when they logged on. \"Barclays views this compromise in the security and integrity of its online service as unacceptable - security of customer information is paramount,\" the bank said. The shutdown to the online service took place at 3.30pm and was expected to last for four hours while the bank reinstalled the old system. \"The new service will not be rereleased until we are satisfied that this particular issue has been rectified,\" Barclays said. The bank posted a message, timed at 3.30pm, on its website for customers trying to log on, which read: \"We apologise for the temporary withdrawal of the online banking service and for any inconvenience this may cause. We are currently working on restoring online banking - the service will be available within the next few hours\". Barclays, which is due to publish its profits figures for the first six months of the year later this week, joins a growing list of major financial services providers to experience embarrassing problems with their much-heralded internet services. Halifax was forced to delay its new telephone-cum-internet bank, Intelligent Finance, just one day before it was due to open to customers after becoming concerned that the system would falter under the potential volume of business. A new internet bank launched by Abbey National, branded Cahoot, was also crippled by difficulties during the week of its launch when its website was put out of action for several hours by a surge in demand. While neither of these incidents appear to involve security, the potential for damaging breaches was highlighted in July when Powergen, the gas and electricity supplier, was forced to contact 2,500 of its customers after their bank account details appeared on its internet site. None of these issues have helped to improve the public's perception of banking on the internet, a channel many of the major financial services would like their customers to adopt for the most basic transactions because it cuts costs and frees up branches for more complicated and profitable transactions such as selling mortgages. A survey by Henrion, Ludlow and Schmidt, a brand consultancy, has found that just 8% of men and 6% of women would choose an online bank over one with a traditional high street presence. A spokeswoman for the National Consumer Council (NCC), which has been campaigning for better internet security, said the latest mishap at Barclays proved the issue should be taken more seriously by financial groups. Anna Bradley, director of the NCC, said: \"Our research shows that trust is a serious concern for consumers. \"Today's problems at Barclays further undermine consumer confidence and until providers such as Barclays address the problems of security, privacy and customer service, e-commerce will not take off.\"",

      "body": "<p>Few artists make you think simultaneously of post-apocalyptic poisoning and Battenberg cake. That it should be a landscape painter and not a left-field installation artist who manages this feat is testimony to the allure of Carol Rhodes's work. </p> <p>Think dreamlike nostalgic visions of futuristic scenarios and you're close to Rhodes's territory: blocks of flats, motorway service stations, car parks, painted with a palette of sugared-almond hues. The effect is unsettling, but calmly so; dystopian, but endearing at the same time. </p> <p>A sickeningly polluted river runs by bleak, grey flats that could be the eastern bloc's worst, and yet they are studded with jewel-like touches of blue. A motorway scene is all American cool, bleached-out Hopper, and yet there is something of the architectural study about it, too. These are obsessive yet detached visions, beautiful in their small scale and delicacy, yet nightmarish too. </p> <p>Much of this quality stems from Rhodes's use of aerial perspective and a range of photographic surfaces. Both lend these paintings a clinical edge only softened by the use of the gentle shades. Ultimately, though, this is a dark vision, though, more poison than prettiness. </p> <p>A reservoir is rendered a deep, swirling, scary thing; hills and trees the cover for some malignant presence in the earth. From a great height and in horror-film colours, the trees are like a fungus, the scum on top of poisoned water. The contours of the earth are stretched over what look like tumours. </p> <p>Rhodes's depopulated, invented landscapes somehow draw you in with an emotional pull. Maybe it's because she captures the surreal otherness of the built environment as we drive by or fly over or, more appropriately, dream about flying over. Rhodes was born in Scotland but spent her early years in India. Maybe this explains her novel way of seeing, her gloriously dark way of sharing with us. </p> <p>\u0095 Till August 27.

      "bodyText": "Few artists make you think simultaneously of post-apocalyptic poisoning and Battenberg cake. That it should be a landscape painter and not a left-field installation artist who manages this feat is testimony to the allure of Carol Rhodes's work. Think dreamlike nostalgic visions of futuristic scenarios and you're close to Rhodes's territory: blocks of flats, motorway service stations, car parks, painted with a palette of sugared-almond hues. The effect is unsettling, but calmly so; dystopian, but endearing at the same time. A sickeningly polluted river runs by bleak, grey flats that could be the eastern bloc's worst, and yet they are studded with jewel-like touches of blue. A motorway scene is all American cool, bleached-out Hopper, and yet there is something of the architectural study about it, too. These are obsessive yet detached visions, beautiful in their small scale and delicacy, yet nightmarish too. Much of this quality stems from Rhodes's use of aerial perspective and a range of photographic surfaces. Both lend these paintings a clinical edge only softened by the use of the gentle shades. Ultimately, though, this is a dark vision, though, more poison than prettiness. A reservoir is rendered a deep, swirling, scary thing; hills and trees the cover for some malignant presence in the earth. From a great height and in horror-film colours, the trees are like a fungus, the scum on top of poisoned water. The contours of the earth are stretched over what look like tumours. Rhodes's depopulated, invented landscapes somehow draw you in with an emotional pull. Maybe it's because she captures the surreal otherness of the built environment as we drive by or fly over or, more appropriately, dream about flying over. Rhodes was born in Scotland but spent her early years in India. Maybe this explains her novel way of seeing, her gloriously dark way of sharing with us. \u0095 Till August 27.

      "body": "<p>David Ginola last night signed for Aston Villa in a \u00a33m move from Tottenham with a broadside at the north London club which the Frenchman claims he never wanted to leave. </p> <p>The French winger announced the completion of his protracted move to the Midlands on his personal website after several hours of negotiations, first with Villa's manager John Gregory and then with the chairman Doug Ellis in a Birmingham hotel yesterday. He has signed a two-year contract worth around \u00a330,000 a week. </p> <p>Gregory had claimed: \"Give me a face-to-face meeting with Ginola and he wouldn't leave without signing.\" Yesterday Villa's manager received that chance and it is believed he immediately challenged the 33-year-old player to prove that he could still flourish in the Premiership rather than take the soft option of playing out his career in a less demanding league abroad. </p> <p>It appears Gregory's gauntlet won the day, which has been a long time coming since the middle of last month, when Ginola first learned that Spurs had accepted a \u00a33m offer from Villa. To the Frenchman it was \"bombshell news\". </p> <p>\"It totally ruined my summer,\" said Ginola on his website. \"I never asked to leave, I was happy at White Hart Lane and my family were settled in north London. </p> <p>\"But it was quite clear that Spurs - and I am not quite clear whether Alan Sugar or George Graham - didn't want me around any more and so were prepared to let me leave. </p> <p>\"Once I got over the shock I was very disappointed to learn that the club had put a \u00a33m price-tag on my head. I am 33 and, although I feel I have still got at least two years left in me, playing at the highest level, I felt I should have been rewarded for my time at Spurs with a free transfer.

      "bodyText": "David Ginola last night signed for Aston Villa in a \u00a33m move from Tottenham with a broadside at the north London club which the Frenchman claims he never wanted to leave. The French winger announced the completion of his protracted move to the Midlands on his personal website after several hours of negotiations, first with Villa's manager John Gregory and then with the chairman Doug Ellis in a Birmingham hotel yesterday. He has signed a two-year contract worth around \u00a330,000 a week. Gregory had claimed: \"Give me a face-to-face meeting with Ginola and he wouldn't leave without signing.\" Yesterday Villa's manager received that chance and it is believed he immediately challenged the 33-year-old player to prove that he could still flourish in the Premiership rather than take the soft option of playing out his career in a less demanding league abroad. It appears Gregory's gauntlet won the day, which has been a long time coming since the middle of last month, when Ginola first learned that Spurs had accepted a \u00a33m offer from Villa. To the Frenchman it was \"bombshell news\". \"It totally ruined my summer,\" said Ginola on his website. \"I never asked to leave, I was happy at White Hart Lane and my family were settled in north London. \"But it was quite clear that Spurs - and I am not quite clear whether Alan Sugar or George Graham - didn't want me around any more and so were prepared to let me leave. \"Once I got over the shock I was very disappointed to learn that the club had put a \u00a33m price-tag on my head. I am 33 and, although I feel I have still got at least two years left in me, playing at the highest level, I felt I should have been rewarded for my time at Spurs with a free transfer. That would have given me far more freedom in choosing which club to join. \"In fact, Spurs originally quoted Villa \u00a34m but then accepted a bid of \u00a33m. People then said I was being greedy with my demands but I hope they understand that, if I was being pushed out of Spurs - and I fought long and hard to avoid that - then I was going to leave on my terms.\" Then, says Ginola, \"all I did was to try and get a decent wage, again wildly exaggerated in the press, for having to leave Tottenham and uprooting to the Midlands. People have to appreciate that I did not anticipate any of this, having signed a three-year contract with Tottenham only 12 months ago. There was little indication earlier over the weekend that the 1999 double player of the year would move to Villa but the deadline issued by Gregory and Graham's decision to leave him out of Saturday's friendly at Birmingham City helped persuade Ginola to sever his ties. The division at White Hart Lane between Graham and Ginola was clear last season as the manager substituted the Frenchman repeatedely and finally warned him that he could not expect an automatic place in the upcoming campaign. Dan Petrescu also fired a parting shot at his former manager Gianluca Vialli after completing a whirlwind \u00a31m move to Bradford City. The 32-year-old Romanian wing-back signed a four-year deal barely 24 hours after his first contact with the Yorkshire club and admitted that his differences with Chelsea's manager had hastened his exit. Petrescu fell out of favour with Vialli halfway through last season and it became inevitable they would part. \"I knew that from the manager,\" said the versatile Petrescu, who was also the subject of a late offer from Middlesbrough just before signing for Bradford at 11.15pm on Saturday. But he added: \"I was very happy there and the club treated me fantastically - the chairman [Ken Bates] and [managing director] Colin Hutchinson - but unfortunately they don't pick the team.

Ganguly suffered a groin injury and retired after bowling four balls of his 13th over. But the loss of Ganguly, when added to that of Richard Green, who shuffled from the field with a back injury yesterday, is meaningful. </p> <p>Lancashire are already without Peter Martin (thumb) and Ian Austin (back), although it is hoped both will be fit for the club's NatWest Trophy semi-final at Bristol on August 13. </p> <p>Before then, next week in fact, Lancashire face the championship leaders and favourites, Surrey, at the Oval. It is their two matches with Surrey, who they also play at Old Trafford at the end of the season, which will have a vital influence on Lancashire's ambitions. </p> <p>They would lead the table if they win here - as would Yorkshire - but their principal ambition this morning will be to avoid defeat. At 127 for two they lead by only 18 runs and will need to bat for two sessions. Ganguly will be hampered, if he bats at all, so Yorkshire have a good chance, though a draw is the most likely outcome. </p> <p>The match was well poised when Yorkshire resumed yesterday morning on 203 for four. But when Darren Lehmann was lbw to Michael Smethurst without adding to his overnight 83, and when Richard Blakey fell to Glen Chapple in the next over, Lancashire had hopes of gaining a first-innings lead. In fact they conceded one of 109. </p> <p>This was partly due to a plucky innings of 46 from Gary Fellows, his best in the championship, but some ragged new-ball bowling was also responsible. Byas was seventh out at 291 and Yorkshire were only 35 runs on when Lancashire took the new ball at 302. </p> <p>But Chapple and Smethurst bowled poorly and Chris Silverwood (34) and Matthew Hoggard (14) made Yorkshire's tail appear as short as a Manx cat's. Hoggard was last man out, caught at point off Andrew Flintoff, who is not properly fit to bowl. </p> <p>When Lancashire batted again they lost Michael Atherton for 17, caught behind off Chris Elstub with the score on 31, though the little shake of the head he gave the umpire Allan Jones suggested he thought he had not touched it. </p> <p>Elstub, though, ran in briskly. He is only playing because Yorkshire's injury problems are just as great as Lancashire's and might have had a second wicket yesterday when Flintoff, who had scored just five, drove firmly back at him. Flintoff managed 20 more before he was caught by Byas at second slip off Silverwood. </p> <p>Crawley and Fairbrother then batted positively enough in their unbroken partnership of 53 to suggest that Lancashire had not surrendered the notion of forcing a result themselves.</p>",

They would lead the table if they win here - as would Yorkshire - but their principal ambition this morning will be to avoid defeat. At 127 for two they lead by only 18 runs and will need to bat for two sessions. Ganguly will be hampered, if he bats at all, so Yorkshire have a good chance, though a draw is the most likely outcome. The match was well poised when Yorkshire resumed yesterday morning on 203 for four. But when Darren Lehmann was lbw to Michael Smethurst without adding to his overnight 83, and when Richard Blakey fell to Glen Chapple in the next over, Lancashire had hopes of gaining a first-innings lead. In fact they conceded one of 109. This was partly due to a plucky innings of 46 from Gary Fellows, his best in the championship, but some ragged new-ball bowling was also responsible. Byas was seventh out at 291 and Yorkshire were only 35 runs on when Lancashire took the new ball at 302. But Chapple and Smethurst bowled poorly and Chris Silverwood (34) and Matthew Hoggard (14) made Yorkshire's tail appear as short as a Manx cat's. Hoggard was last man out, caught at point off Andrew Flintoff, who is not properly fit to bowl. When Lancashire batted again they lost Michael Atherton for 17, caught behind off Chris Elstub with the score on 31, though the little shake of the head he gave the umpire Allan Jones suggested he thought he had not touched it. Elstub, though, ran in briskly. He is only playing because Yorkshire's injury problems are just as great as Lancashire's and might have had a second wicket yesterday when Flintoff, who had scored just five, drove firmly back at him. Flintoff managed 20 more before he was caught by Byas at second slip off Silverwood. Crawley and Fairbrother then batted positively enough in their unbroken partnership of 53 to suggest that Lancashire had not surrendered the notion of forcing a result themselves.",

So, perhaps, will the chairman of selectors' assertion that Giles \"could not have done more\" to turn himself into a worthy No8, confirmation, presumably, that he will be one of three slow men on the subcontinent this winter. To make Brown jump through the same hoop would be a waste of potential.",

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Chalk and cheese: they seem to have been around for ever, these two very individual individuals. Yin and yang; the regimental sergeant major with get-your-bleedin'-'air-cut standards and creases you could shave with and the lippy, know-all, stuff-it squaddie; Savile Row and an explosion in an Oxfam shop; school leaver and Cambridge graduate; Stan Laurel and Thomas Hardy; the Gaffer and Captain Grumpy; Alec Stewart and Mike Atherton. </p> <p>Almost 11 years ago Atherton, at the age of 21, made his debut for England against Australia at Trent Bridge, watched Geoff Marsh and Mark Taylor bat through the first day and then, when finally it was his turn, at No3, made nought. He made 47 in the second innings but England lost by an innings and plenty. It had been a harsh start. </p> <p>One hundred and ninety eight days after Atherton's first appearance Stewart made his own debut, at Sabina Park in Kingston (\"they'd sent Athers off for a quiet time on the A tour\"), and, also batting at three, hit his first ball to the boundary, scored 13 before Ian Bishop got him and had just come to the crease in the second innings when Wayne Larkins hit the runs that completed a nine-wicket win. </p> <p>Chalk and cheese, separate and yet together and about to join an exclusive club of England cricketers - Graham Gooch, David Gower, Colin Cowdrey, Geoff Boycott and Ian Botham - who have played 100 Test matches. One or, more likely, both will surely go on to pass Gooch at 118 and one of them become the highest capped Englishman of them all. </p> <p>Their careers have followed remarkably parallel courses. Atherton has played 182 innings, 167 as opener, and scored 6,713 runs at an average of 38.14 with 14 hundreds. Pakistan and Sri Lanka alone are missing from his set of centuries and there is an opportunity to rectify that this winter. Stewart, for his part, has three fewer innings, 77 as opener, and scored 20 more runs at an average of 40.56. He has one fewer century, missing out only against India, for whom he will have to wait until the winter after next. </p> <p>Each has captained England, Atherton for a record 52 times, surviving the dirt-in-the-pocket controversy on the way, and Stewart on 14 occasions, two of them abroad during the winter of 1992-93, an 11-match stint following Atherton's resignation until a duff World Cup did for him last year, and the last as stand-in for Nasser Hussain at Lord's recently. </p> <p>Chalk and cheese: Stewart and Atherton have complemented one another in the same way that unlike polarity attracts but have competed against each other as well, which, says Atherton, is only healthy. Only once, in Bombay seven years ago when, says Atherton, \"he called yes and I said no\" and Stewart was run out, have they fallen out and that only briefly. Their mutual respect is fulsome. </p> <p>Atherton is remembered best for his toughness, technique, concentration and ability to raise his game. One is constantly reminded of his confrontations with the great fast bowlers: Allan Donald at Trent Bridge, Courtney Walsh in Jamaica and Curtly Ambrose just about everywhere they opposed each other. </p> <p>Along with Steve Waugh this has been perhaps the most single-minded batsman of his generation. Stewart is the contrast, a bat-twirling boulevardier, brisk and dapper, with timing courtesy of Swiss watchmakers. He is recalled for the perky exuberance of his back-foot stroke play and the way that in adversity, when the runs have dried up, he has had the courage to stick to what he knows. </p> <p><strong> Perfect foil</strong><br> </p> <p> Between them they have provided the spine of the England side, a constant throughout a tough decade where the cricket world has moved on leaving England behind. The first time they opened the batting together, at Sabina Park once again in February 1994, they put on 121 and there have been five more century partnerships at the top of the order from a further 49 opening excursions with an average partnership of almost 40. </p> <p>\"I like to think we were a good team,\" says Stewart. \"Our styles have complemented each other. He is good defensively and less flamboyant than me. When we have opened together, it has been an England strength because he blunts and I take them on. It's like Taylor and Michael Slater were. It is a pity that this particular strength has been weakened by me moving down the order but in doing so we have actually strengthened a different weakness, so it is a question of balance. </p> <p>\"Athers' concentration is just fantastic. I have played with or against no one quite with his ability to block everything out except the job in hand. And the way he has managed to carry on playing with his back problems is an object lesson, for he just got on with it where others would not.\" </p> <p>Stewart pinpoints two Atherton innings as exemplifying his qualities. \"Johannesburg five years ago obviously just for the concentration and technique required to bat for the period of time to save the game.\" Atherton spent more than 10 hours at the crease in making his highest score of 185 not out to ensure that a match that seemed doomed was resurrected. \"But I look then at his unbeaten 98 at Trent Bridge two years ago because it was a match-winning innings.\" </p> <p>Chasing 247 to win the fourth Test and level the series against South Africa, Atherton batted himself to a standstill, enduring and surviving on the way the classic duel with Donald, before Stewart took charge and put the game out of its misery by plastering the ball all round the field. \"That was a great way for Alec to finish the match,\" Atherton points out, \"because it was so emphatic, making a statement to take into the final match.\" </p> <p>Generally Atherton has been England's insurance policy against defeat: 12 of his centuries have come in the first innings, and, if only twice - his 101 against New Zealand at Trent Bridge in 1994 and his 118 in the second innings at Christchurch 3 years ago - his hundreds have resulted in a victory, then just once, at Georgetown in 1994, has he made a hundred and lost. </p> <p>Stewart's fine record might have been better still had he not been a victim of his own versatility for, if he has been one of the world's finest opening batsmen for a decade, then for much of that time he has also been its very best allrounder, his wicketkeeping of the highest order and too valuable an asset to ignore in the wider scheme of things. As a result, no other contemporary England player, apart perhaps from Graeme Hick, has stimulated quite the discussion he has. But even someone as willing to be all things to everyone was unable to sustain the triple role of opening batsman-wicketkeeper-captain. His life has been a compromise but one to England's if not his own advantage. </p> <p>Stewart's fondest memories are of making his debut at Sabina - \"a dream, and to play in a winning side too\" - and in particular of his historic twin centuries in Bridgetown four years later. \"I've played better innings than these but never better throughout a match. Particularly it was on the back of the humiliation in Trinidad, when we were bowled out for 46. From a team perspective, winning the series against South Africa at Headingley was a highlight as I was captain. And there was the time that I carried my bat for 69 out of 175 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1992. I thought I played well there.\" </p> <p>Atherton recognises Bridgetown as the benchmark but also cites this latter innings along with Stewart's 190 at Edgbaston in the preceding match (in neither of which he himself played) as representing his partner at his very best. </p> <p>One other Stewart innings sticks in the mind, though. Three years ago at Sabina Park yet again, on a sadistic surface the like of which had never been seen in a Test, Stewart batted skilfully but above all courageously, taking numerous knocks in making nine before the match was abandoned. \"That was 54 minutes of hell,\" he remembers. \"We can look back on it and laugh but it was not funny at the time. You were just trying to avoid getting hurt. The thing is that Athers, who was out, wanted the match scrubbed from the record but I was keen for it to be kept because I was not out. But, yes, I played well there. You can mention that one.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chalk and cheese: they seem to have been around for ever, these two very individual individuals. Yin and yang; the regimental sergeant major with get-your-bleedin'-'air-cut standards and creases you could shave with and the lippy, know-all, stuff-it squaddie; Savile Row and an explosion in an Oxfam shop; school leaver and Cambridge graduate; Stan Laurel and Thomas Hardy; the Gaffer and Captain Grumpy; Alec Stewart and Mike Atherton. Almost 11 years ago Atherton, at the age of 21, made his debut for England against Australia at Trent Bridge, watched Geoff Marsh and Mark Taylor bat through the first day and then, when finally it was his turn, at No3, made nought. He made 47 in the second innings but England lost by an innings and plenty. It had been a harsh start. One hundred and ninety eight days after Atherton's first appearance Stewart made his own debut, at Sabina Park in Kingston (\"they'd sent Athers off for a quiet time on the A tour\"), and, also batting at three, hit his first ball to the boundary, scored 13 before Ian Bishop got him and had just come to the crease in the second innings when Wayne Larkins hit the runs that completed a nine-wicket win. Chalk and cheese, separate and yet together and about to join an exclusive club of England cricketers - Graham Gooch, David Gower, Colin Cowdrey, Geoff Boycott and Ian Botham - who have played 100 Test matches. One or, more likely, both will surely go on to pass Gooch at 118 and one of them become the highest capped Englishman of them all. Their careers have followed remarkably parallel courses. Atherton has played 182 innings, 167 as opener, and scored 6,713 runs at an average of 38.14 with 14 hundreds. Pakistan and Sri Lanka alone are missing from his set of centuries and there is an opportunity to rectify that this winter. Stewart, for his part, has three fewer innings, 77 as opener, and scored 20 more runs at an average of 40.56. He has one fewer century, missing out only against India, for whom he will have to wait until the winter after next. Each has captained England, Atherton for a record 52 times, surviving the dirt-in-the-pocket controversy on the way, and Stewart on 14 occasions, two of them abroad during the winter of 1992-93, an 11-match stint following Atherton's resignation until a duff World Cup did for him last year, and the last as stand-in for Nasser Hussain at Lord's recently. Chalk and cheese: Stewart and Atherton have complemented one another in the same way that unlike polarity attracts but have competed against each other as well, which, says Atherton, is only healthy. Only once, in Bombay seven years ago when, says Atherton, \"he called yes and I said no\" and Stewart was run out, have they fallen out and that only briefly. Their mutual respect is fulsome. Atherton is remembered best for his toughness, technique, concentration and ability to raise his game. One is constantly reminded of his confrontations with the great fast bowlers: Allan Donald at Trent Bridge, Courtney Walsh in Jamaica and Curtly Ambrose just about everywhere they opposed each other. Along with Steve Waugh this has been perhaps the most single-minded batsman of his generation. Stewart is the contrast, a bat-twirling boulevardier, brisk and dapper, with timing courtesy of Swiss watchmakers. He is recalled for the perky exuberance of his back-foot stroke play and the way that in adversity, when the runs have dried up, he has had the courage to stick to what he knows. Perfect foil Between them they have provided the spine of the England side, a constant throughout a tough decade where the cricket world has moved on leaving England behind. The first time they opened the batting together, at Sabina Park once again in February 1994, they put on 121 and there have been five more century partnerships at the top of the order from a further 49 opening excursions with an average partnership of almost 40. \"I like to think we were a good team,\" says Stewart. \"Our styles have complemented each other. He is good defensively and less flamboyant than me. When we have opened together, it has been an England strength because he blunts and I take them on. It's like Taylor and Michael Slater were. It is a pity that this particular strength has been weakened by me moving down the order but in doing so we have actually strengthened a different weakness, so it is a question of balance. \"Athers' concentration is just fantastic. I have played with or against no one quite with his ability to block everything out except the job in hand. And the way he has managed to carry on playing with his back problems is an object lesson, for he just got on with it where others would not.\" Stewart pinpoints two Atherton innings as exemplifying his qualities. \"Johannesburg five years ago obviously just for the concentration and technique required to bat for the period of time to save the game.\" Atherton spent more than 10 hours at the crease in making his highest score of 185 not out to ensure that a match that seemed doomed was resurrected. \"But I look then at his unbeaten 98 at Trent Bridge two years ago because it was a match-winning innings.\" Chasing 247 to win the fourth Test and level the series against South Africa, Atherton batted himself to a standstill, enduring and surviving on the way the classic duel with Donald, before Stewart took charge and put the game out of its misery by plastering the ball all round the field. \"That was a great way for Alec to finish the match,\" Atherton points out, \"because it was so emphatic, making a statement to take into the final match.\" Generally Atherton has been England's insurance policy against defeat: 12 of his centuries have come in the first innings, and, if only twice - his 101 against New Zealand at Trent Bridge in 1994 and his 118 in the second innings at Christchurch 3 years ago - his hundreds have resulted in a victory, then just once, at Georgetown in 1994, has he made a hundred and lost. Stewart's fine record might have been better still had he not been a victim of his own versatility for, if he has been one of the world's finest opening batsmen for a decade, then for much of that time he has also been its very best allrounder, his wicketkeeping of the highest order and too valuable an asset to ignore in the wider scheme of things. As a result, no other contemporary England player, apart perhaps from Graeme Hick, has stimulated quite the discussion he has. But even someone as willing to be all things to everyone was unable to sustain the triple role of opening batsman-wicketkeeper-captain. His life has been a compromise but one to England's if not his own advantage. Stewart's fondest memories are of making his debut at Sabina - \"a dream, and to play in a winning side too\" - and in particular of his historic twin centuries in Bridgetown four years later. \"I've played better innings than these but never better throughout a match. Particularly it was on the back of the humiliation in Trinidad, when we were bowled out for 46. From a team perspective, winning the series against South Africa at Headingley was a highlight as I was captain. And there was the time that I carried my bat for 69 out of 175 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1992. I thought I played well there.\" Atherton recognises Bridgetown as the benchmark but also cites this latter innings along with Stewart's 190 at Edgbaston in the preceding match (in neither of which he himself played) as representing his partner at his very best. One other Stewart innings sticks in the mind, though. Three years ago at Sabina Park yet again, on a sadistic surface the like of which had never been seen in a Test, Stewart batted skilfully but above all courageously, taking numerous knocks in making nine before the match was abandoned. \"That was 54 minutes of hell,\" he remembers. \"We can look back on it and laugh but it was not funny at the time. You were just trying to avoid getting hurt. The thing is that Athers, who was out, wanted the match scrubbed from the record but I was keen for it to be kept because I was not out. But, yes, I played well there. You can mention that one.\"",

On both occasions, though, I baulked at the suggestion that the News of the World's new editor, Rebekah Wade, had come up with the idea either to make her mark or as a cynical attempt to boost sales. It seemed too far-fetched.

Early, unaudited figures suggest a rise of about 95,000 to a total of 4,065,000, with returns so low as to be negligible. Word of mouth and TV publicity undoubtedly helped.

According to the Daily Telegraph, \"the feeling that the campaign was misjudged - and that Wade is coming to realise the fact - has been reinforced by her refusal to defend it publicly\". The trade weekly, Press Gazette, also referred to her \"curious silence\", as if she was embarrassed by what she had done. </p> <p>I think we can discount that particular claim. Wade has adopted the philosophy expounded by the successful Mirror editor of the 1960s, Lee Howard, who said: \"I believe in the anonymity of editors. I think their papers should speak for them.\" </p> <p>Anyway, Wade showed yesterday that she certainly isn't running away from the issue. She devoted no fewer than 10 pages to the naming and shaming issue, vigorously defending her campaign. The front page was dominated by a cut-out petition to send to home secretary Jack Straw. A further 50 offenders were named, and four pages of letters from readers were published in a pull-out. The paper has received 5,000 letters, of which only 15 were critical. Of some 2,000 emails, only a handful thought the paper wrong. Most of the week the newsdesk was inundated with callers offering the paper their support. </p> <p> One of the most surprising supporters was the misidentified man, posing with the petition and saying: \"What are a few stones thrown against my window when a child's life might be saved?\" </p> <p>To show how serious she is, Wade flew in from the US the parents of a child who was killed by a paedophile and who secured the passing of legislation which ensures that people must be told when freed sex offenders return to their neighbourhood. Named after their child, it is a form of \"Megan's law\" that Wade (and the Mirror, in a somewhat supportive leader) wants the British government to introduce. </p> <p>Straw, whose officials have evidently looked at Megan's law, has rejected the idea and is known to have been appalled by the News of the World's campaign. There are rumours that he told Wade so in an edgy phone conversation last week. </p> <p>One of Straw's objections to the name-and-shame list, which I share, is its indiscriminate nature. Why should a woman who engaged in consensual sex with an under-age youth be named alongside a man who forced himself on a tiny child? Is a person who downloads computer porn, no matter how disgusting, as much a threat to the public as a convicted rapist? </p> <p>I understand that the only proper complaint to the press complaints commission so far has come from a woman contesting the accuracy of the description of her offences, arguing that her inclusion was therefore invalid.

Doubtless an investigation will follow. </p> <p>So have I changed my mind after my initial knee-jerk response? Up to a point, yes. I remain worried about the possibility of \"lynch law\" outrages, despite Wade's leader yesterday urging vigilance rather than vigilantism. I think the definition of who appears on any list requires very careful monitoring and if the paper makes mistakes it should be required by the PCC to publish corrections. Complaints should therefore be dealt with as fast as possible. </p> <p>I am also unsure whether it helps people to understand the awful truth of most attacks on children: they happen within the home and are usually committed by someone known to the child. Attacks by strangers are mercifully rare. </p> <p>But I take on board the argument that there is a policy vacuum in which the authorities appear uncertain how to deal with the phenomenon of paedophiles who reoffend. In that sense, the News of the World has attempted to perform a public service. </p> <p>I am certain that Wade has not acted from base commercial motives. She clearly believes she has done right by her readers. Her fear - our fear - must be that an innocent will suffer. The fact that the first victim has given the campaign his blessing should not blind us to the possibility of a far worse mistake in future. Wade, an editor for barely two months, has taken an enormous risk.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The competition commission is due to deliver its long-awaited report on supermarket pricing to the government today, but the demands it will make of the UK's leading chains come on the heels of increasing pressures on the industry fuelled by overseas competition. According to new retail analysis also published today, three of the five major chains could shut down over the next five years. Wal-Mart's UK arrival this month has led to a programme of cost-cutting that has disturbed the grocery retailing industry. The competition commission's findings will remain confidential for another eight to 10 weeks, but the report is not expected to be strongly critical of the industry, despite months of claims that UK shoppers pay more for their groceries than consumers in other EU countries. Over the last 18 months the inquiry into the \u00a360bn-a-year market occupied by the big five - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Safeway - investigated the effect of possible supermarket monopolies on the public interest. The commission has already said it has found \"only limited evidence of excessive profitability\", and that grocery prices in the UK are lower than in some comparable EU countries. The report is expected to focus on two areas of concern: goods pricing and supermarkets' use of suppliers. Supermarket chains could be told to stop abusing their buying power to squeeze prices when dealing with farmers and other suppliers. The commission could also recommend the closure of stores in areas where one chain has an unfair market share, and will say prices should be no higher in areas where one supermarket corners the market than in areas where shoppers have a choice of three or four different chains. The commission is expected to recommend that supermarkets post prices on their websites to enable consumers to \"shop around\". The commission may also press the government to set up a system whereby the big supermarkets send detailed accounts of their profit margins to competition watchdogs every six months. Supermarket heads have described the internet idea as unworkable, as it would mean posting tens of thousands of product prices on a daily basis. The proposals to reveal their profit details are equally unrealistic, they say, as stores would be required to deliver both cost price and retail price details for every single product line. The inquiry has received more than 200 submissions, questioned 400 suppliers and 50 local authorities, and held 35 hearings in London, Birmingham and Belfast. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Safeway were also called to make submissions earlier this year. Meanwhile, a study published today by retail analyst Verdict Research said heightened price competition among UK supermarkets could shut down three of the UK's top five supermarket chains within the next five years. According to Verdict, price competition, now incorporating petrol, is set to reach new levels with both Tesco and Asda (backed by US giant Wal-Mart) raising the tempo in the supermarket price war. Both Safeway and Somerfield, which is struggling under the burden of ailing discount chain Kwik Save, are potential takeover targets. Sainsbury's, struggling against Asda to hold on to the number two slot, was another possible candidate for acquisition, Verdict suggested.

They are notes from the planetary bank manager, warning of capital overdrawn. They raise huge political problems, but they present a clear challenge for science.</p> <p>Here is the problem. The human population explosion from 1bn to 6bn in 200 years has been paid for by the loss of life - other life. Between a third and a half of the land surface has been transformed by human action. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 30%. Vast tracts of the world are rapidly growing short of water, which means huge areas will go short of food.</p> <p>One species controls the globe and is obliterating thousands - perhaps tens of thousands - of other species a year.</p> <p>In this context, Britain's future is inseparable from the rest of humanity's. It was British science - Jenner's vaccine, Lister's hygiene, Brunel's ships and railroads, Rutherford's atom, Fleming's antibiotics - that accelerated the 20th century revolution. It could be British science that finds better ways to handle energy, devises new ways to save the natural world, manipulates crops for more nourishment, outwits disease and extends healthy lifespans.</p> <p>Only very lately, however, has there been any sign that a British government might put more resources into science - resources that really would make for a better world, or at least forestall a worse one.</p> <p>Step one is to confront the energy crisis. In the next term, the Department of Trade and Industry should fund more initiatives to save and recycle wasted energy, to fashion machines that need less energy, to construct power supplies that use renewable energy and do not pollute the atmosphere.</p> <p>A community that does these things must then share the technology: the potential poverty of billions can be alleviated only by clean and reliable sources of energy. Through foreign aid programmes Britain should make sure the know-how gets shared. It is an investment. A developing world with energy to spare is a market for more trade, and more ingenuity, which will create more wealth.</p> <p>The second step is to put increasing sums of money into the government's natural environment research council, the Natural History Museum, the Royal Botanic Gardens and other world-class institutions dedicated to understanding the planet, from the magnetosphere to the deepest ocean trench, and to making an inventory of the life on it.</p> <p>The habitats of the forests, savannahs, swamps, reefs and river estuaries are being destroyed, and with them creatures fashioned by millions of years of evolution. Nobody can make a sensible guess as to the number of species on the planet, but half could vanish in the next century. If taxonomists do not take to the field now, the world will not even know what it has lost.</p> <p>And it will be a loss. The wealth of the pharmaceutical industry, a key part of the British economy, is based on natural genetic material: medicines from plants, antibiotics from bacteria, drugs from slugs and sponges. So the third step is to focus on the genetic machinery of life and learn from it. The medical, biotechnology and biological sciences research councils have begun the basic research, but the prizes will go to the groups with the best backing. Here, too, a second-term government can play its part.</p> <p>Tomorrow's industry will be a marriage of computing power and biological information, as science begins to understand how genes make proteins, and how proteins assemble themselves into living things. Animals and crops will become genetically engineered: animals will make human proteins, crops will grow human vaccines. The divide between flesh and automata will begin to blur. Life will be understood as software, and disease as a software glitch.</p> <p>Tissues will be engineered, artificial limbs will be hooked up to nervous systems. The \"biochip\" will assess the DNA of the patient, and the DNA of the pathogen, and expert systems will offer diagnoses.</p> <p>These things will start to happen in the lifetime of the next government, and the richest pickings will go to those who get there first. Labour can keep British science in the race by using the country's considerable wealth. This is one of the few problems that really can be solved by throwing money at it.</p> <p>But who benefits? Just the rich? Or everybody? How wisely, how safely, how effectively these things happen will depend on political will. Science needs the informed consent of voters and taxpayers. Politicians won't pay attention until the people do. So the most important step is to educate a nation in the challenges of tomorrow. It will take skills to cure ills - and that means a government boost to the teaching of science in schools and colleges.</p> <p>This alchemy will be competitive, but it will also be international. It will be done entirely in the units of the metre, the kilogram, the second. On second thoughts, the erg has no place in it. The unit of currency that will matter most will be not the British erg but its rival measure of energy, the EU's joule. But fear not, Eurosceptics: James Prescott Joule came from Salford.</p> <p><b>Pledges</b></p> <p><b> 1.</b> More for satellite observation and disaster warning</p> <p><b> 2.</b> More for conservation in species-rich but cash-poor nations</p> <p><b> 3.</b> More research into non-polluting energy sources</p> <p><b> 4.</b> Cheap technology to spread medical benefits to the poor</p> <p><b> 5.</b> Research into GM crops that genuinely help the poor and hungry</p>",

Here, too, a second-term government can play its part. Tomorrow's industry will be a marriage of computing power and biological information, as science begins to understand how genes make proteins, and how proteins assemble themselves into living things. Animals and crops will become genetically engineered: animals will make human proteins, crops will grow human vaccines. The divide between flesh and automata will begin to blur. Life will be understood as software, and disease as a software glitch. Tissues will be engineered, artificial limbs will be hooked up to nervous systems. The \"biochip\" will assess the DNA of the patient, and the DNA of the pathogen, and expert systems will offer diagnoses. These things will start to happen in the lifetime of the next government, and the richest pickings will go to those who get there first. Labour can keep British science in the race by using the country's considerable wealth. This is one of the few problems that really can be solved by throwing money at it. But who benefits? Just the rich? Or everybody? How wisely, how safely, how effectively these things happen will depend on political will. Science needs the informed consent of voters and taxpayers. Politicians won't pay attention until the people do. So the most important step is to educate a nation in the challenges of tomorrow. It will take skills to cure ills - and that means a government boost to the teaching of science in schools and colleges. This alchemy will be competitive, but it will also be international. It will be done entirely in the units of the metre, the kilogram, the second. On second thoughts, the erg has no place in it. The unit of currency that will matter most will be not the British erg but its rival measure of energy, the EU's joule. But fear not, Eurosceptics: James Prescott Joule came from Salford. Pledges 1. More for satellite observation and disaster warning 2. More for conservation in species-rich but cash-poor nations 3. More research into non-polluting energy sources 4. Cheap technology to spread medical benefits to the poor 5. Research into GM crops that genuinely help the poor and hungry",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>News came from Washington today that the US government is considering making a formal complaint to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on the grounds that labelling GM foods is a restraint of trade. The US has said it will ask the WTO to impose sanctions on EU exports if GM labels are not removed from US food exports.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the US food and drug administration (FDA) called the labelling of GM foods \"economic fraud\". She continued: \"We would not have allowed these products on the market if they were not safe, they are the same as non-GM food, so they do not require a label.\" Any labelling of GM foods as GM foods is, she suggested, \"trade discrimination and therefore wrong\".</p> <p>This is quite extraordinary behaviour. The purpose of labelling is to inform the public of the ingredients of the food they eat. The FDA claims such information is \"fraud\". Their system - to deliberately neglect to inform the public - is, by their terms, \"not fraud\".</p> <p>The FDA has accused the EU of \"discriminating\" against GM foods by labelling them as GM foods. This is particularly unfair, their spokeswoman suggests, because GM foods are the \"same\" as non-GM food. But, GM foods are not \"the same\" as non-GM foods. GM foods are made by altering the properties of plants by direct scientific intervention in the make-up of their DNA. Non-GM foods are not made in this way. </p> <p>The US government and FDA demands are also extraordinary business practice. They are trying to boost the sales of an unpopular US export by asking trading countries to treat it in 'the same' way as other products which sell better. This makes it starkly obvious that GM manufacturers and promoters in the USA believe the European public perceives no positive benefit in GM food manufacture.</p> <p>They do not believe that advertising campaigns, however backed by billions, will persuade this public that there are any positive reasons - any positive benefits of health, or cost, or distribution, or resource-use - for eating GM foods. Instead, the best US GM companies can hope for is that European consumers can be conned into buying GM foods without realising. </p> <p>The FDA is an organisation given to creative use of labelling for GM foods. In 1997, they produced a staggering ruling that GM foods could be labelled as \"organic\". And the recent statement from Washington is merely the latest stage in a long line of US to Europe pressure over food practice.</p> <p>In talks at Downing Street in 1998, Clinton was briefed to warn Blair of the huge cost to US corporations of current EU approval processes for GM foods. At the same summit, US representatives also expressed disapproval at the labelling of GM foods.</p> <p> The EU ban on the use of hormones in beef has led to a 12 year embargo on US beef.

      "bodyText": "News came from Washington today that the US government is considering making a formal complaint to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on the grounds that labelling GM foods is a restraint of trade. The US has said it will ask the WTO to impose sanctions on EU exports if GM labels are not removed from US food exports. A spokeswoman for the US food and drug administration (FDA) called the labelling of GM foods \"economic fraud\". She continued: \"We would not have allowed these products on the market if they were not safe, they are the same as non-GM food, so they do not require a label.\" Any labelling of GM foods as GM foods is, she suggested, \"trade discrimination and therefore wrong\". This is quite extraordinary behaviour. The purpose of labelling is to inform the public of the ingredients of the food they eat. The FDA claims such information is \"fraud\". Their system - to deliberately neglect to inform the public - is, by their terms, \"not fraud\". The FDA has accused the EU of \"discriminating\" against GM foods by labelling them as GM foods. This is particularly unfair, their spokeswoman suggests, because GM foods are the \"same\" as non-GM food. But, GM foods are not \"the same\" as non-GM foods. GM foods are made by altering the properties of plants by direct scientific intervention in the make-up of their DNA. Non-GM foods are not made in this way. The US government and FDA demands are also extraordinary business practice. They are trying to boost the sales of an unpopular US export by asking trading countries to treat it in 'the same' way as other products which sell better. This makes it starkly obvious that GM manufacturers and promoters in the USA believe the European public perceives no positive benefit in GM food manufacture. They do not believe that advertising campaigns, however backed by billions, will persuade this public that there are any positive reasons - any positive benefits of health, or cost, or distribution, or resource-use - for eating GM foods. Instead, the best US GM companies can hope for is that European consumers can be conned into buying GM foods without realising. The FDA is an organisation given to creative use of labelling for GM foods. In 1997, they produced a staggering ruling that GM foods could be labelled as \"organic\". And the recent statement from Washington is merely the latest stage in a long line of US to Europe pressure over food practice. In talks at Downing Street in 1998, Clinton was briefed to warn Blair of the huge cost to US corporations of current EU approval processes for GM foods. At the same summit, US representatives also expressed disapproval at the labelling of GM foods. The EU ban on the use of hormones in beef has led to a 12 year embargo on US beef. In response, the US has imposed 100% tariffs on French cheese and truffles and German and French mustards. Britain has nominated itself in support of the US, while being bound by EU legislation. There is a danger that the US bullying will work. Two weeks ago the European commission stated that it would mount a proposal to reverse the current European moratorium on the introduction of new types of GM food. Eighteen GM food products have already been passed for commercial use in the EU. Proposals such as this latest one fly in the face of popular opinion - which remains vehemently opposed. A recent EU poll found that 66% of Europeans saw GM foods as a health hazard. The USA, a country which thrives on free market competition, has conceded that it cannot compete with the organic trade. It needs special dispensation. It needs GM foods to be sold as if they are something other than GM foods. It needs the public to be lied to.",

We do, however, need to compare it with cheaper, more cost-effective alternatives - walking, cycling and making roads safer. Mayer Hillman, a long-standing critic of unquestioning support for public transport investment, analysed travel habits in the Netherlands. Despite enjoying superb public transport, the Dutch walk and cycle rather than take the bus, tram or train for all but the longest trips.

People on high incomes make three times as many journeys by car or van, over four times as many journeys by train and travel more than three times further overall than those on low incomes.</p> <p>There is also the question of speed of delivery. However much the government accelerates the planning process, road and rail schemes will take years. They are also likely to prove controversial. People's support for bypasses and railways tends to evaporate when they see the route coming through their allotments. By contrast, improving the quality and safety of the streets could begin at once.

Mr Peres, a former prime minister and Nobel peace laureate, was beaten by 63 votes to 57 in the parliamentary vote by the relatively unknown Moshe Katsav of the rightwing Likud party. Later today, the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, will vote again on a motion of no confidence in the Barak government. The Likud opposition, bolstered by its spectacular victory in the presidential vote, will be bidding hard to bring down the coalition and replace it with a new rightwing administration. A number of Knesset members have defected to the opposition in recent weeks, over Mr Barak's willingness to concede land to the Palestinians. Rightwingers were especially incensed by the prime minister's apparent offer of shared sovereignty in Jerusalem. Tensions are running high in the occupied West Bank, partially controlled by the Palestinian National Authority, led by Yasser Arafat. The territory, seized by Israel in the six-day war of 1967, is home to more than 1m Palestinian Arabs, most of whom live in abject poverty. It is also home to more than 150,000 Jewish settlers, many of them with strong religious beliefs, who have pledged to resist any Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 boundaries.

The newspaper publicity has been blamed for a series of vigilante attacks on innocent people. On Friday night a group of around 60 people waving banners and shouting abuse threw paint at a house in Plymouth which they had wrongly identified as home to a paedophile. In the Midlands, vigilante groups have told police that they intend to use violence to drive out sex offenders. Probation officers have reported \"high levels of anxiety\" from wives and children of sex offenders - and from victims. One officer in Yorkshire told of an adult victim who came to him angry and drunk, threatening to kill the man who abused him. \"Prior to this he had been dwelling less on the past and his drinking was more controlled. This has set him back,\" said the officer. Probation officers are worried that, because many victims are related to their abusers, there is a risk that they could be identified. Leading children's charities have said the government should launch a major public education campaign offering practical advice on how to protect children. The News of the World was last night sticking by its campaign. Referring to tomorrow's meeting, a spokesman said: \"We are ready and very willing to meet these important organisations. We will of course listen with the greatest care to everything they have to say. At the same time, we will clearly explain our position and restate if necessary our defined objectives.\" \u0095 Police last night prepared to clear away the final toys, cards, letters and mementoes from the site where Sarah Payne's body was found 14 days ago.",

Or live in Birmingham.</p> <p>According to David's view of events, he was happily enjoying his summer holiday, \"and looking forward to another season at White Hart Lane, when my agent called to tell me Spurs were selling me.

I never asked to leave.\" So who was the villain who pushed him towards Villa? \"I was surprised to hear George Graham saying in the papers that he didn't want me to go,\" David admitted, heroically flicking his hair out of his eyes. \"If that was the case, he had the power to tell Alan Sugar not to accept Villa's offer.\"</p> <p>So why didn't he? Because according to Herr Commandant Graham, it was Ginola's decision. \"It was his decision to go, not mine,\" he said, smiling. \"If he had wanted to stay, that would have been fine by me.

Perhaps Ginola pushed himself?</p> <p>But just as we were about to join the unruly mob descending on White Hart Lane, Graham cannily let it slip that he wasn't going to dwell on Ginola's departure, concentrating instead on targeting Boudewijn Zenden as the Frenchman's replacement. \"Zenden is certainly a player that I admire,\" admitted George slyly. Luckily for Spurs, Zenden was about to join Lazio for \u00a38m last week but the move fell through and, for all we know, the winger is currently resting in Amsterdam.

So, this afternoon, Boro are on the verge of signing Noel Whelan from Coventry and fellow forward Joseph Desire Job from Lens for a combined fee of \u00a35m.</p> <p>Whelan needs no introduction. Actually that's not quite true, as while Noel's window smashing and refuelling habits were once as legendary as his Gallagher namesake, they are now obscured by images of the less-than-streamlined forward sitting on the Cov bench. Gordon Strachan used to claim that his greatest challenge at Highfield Road was getting Whelan into the England side. It appears to be a challenge he has now given up on, and if Strachan failed then what can we expect from Robbo, the players' pal? \"I will miss him [Strachan] shouting at me at the morning,\" said Whelan today. \"But I am sure Bryan [Robbo] will do that.\" Yep.</p> <p>Job meanwhile is waiting on a medical after completing his fortnight-long trial at the Riverside. A regular Cameroonian international, Job has hardly set the French first division alight - scoring only four league goals in his one season with RC Lens. Meanwhile it looks like Boro's bid to land Dani has ran aground, while Steve McManaman has called the very idea of his transferring to Boro as \"barmy\". As for Christian Ziege, Robbo is becoming less and less bullish by the day. \"Obviously I don't want him to go, but it's his decision,\" he said this morning.

      "body": "<p>President and Mrs Bush, a special good evening. I am honoured and pleased to again have the privilege of addressing a Republican national convention.</p> <p>In San Diego in 1996, I followed former first lady Nancy Reagan to the lectern after her moving tribute to President Reagan. I am delighted this time to follow Mrs Laura Bush, a lady of passion, dedication and grace. She will be a great first lady. Don't you think?</p> <p>During the almost seven years since I left the army, I've traveled all across America. I've seen people hard at work providing for their families, giving of themselves, caring for each other.</p> <p>I've seen them creating wealth for the nation. I've seen an economy transforming itself to seize the promise of the information revolution. I've met so many of our fellow citizens who believe in America to the depth of their hearts and who are doing everything they can in their communities to make our nation that more perfect union spoken of in our constitution.</p> <p>I've been moved yet again to stand in awe of the American dream which was given birth in this city over 200 years ago. A dream I have been privileged to live. I've met so many young people who believe in the dream. They are on a road to success. They are being raised in strong families, going to good schools, filling the finest universities, graduating and going on to find their place and fortune in this land.</p> <p>Even the youngest of them, still in elementary school are getting ready for the future -- using computers, logging onto the internet -- while still enjoying the magic of childhood by curling up with a Harry Potter book. There is so much that is good and right in America!</p> <p>Yet I cannot ignore that in my travels I've also seen poverty, failing communities, people who've lost hope. Tragically, I've seen too many young Americans who are overwhelmed by the daily struggle just to survive. I've seen kids destroying themselves with drugs. Kids who see violence and crime as the answer to their hopelessness. Kids who no longer believe in themselves and who don't see a reason to believe in America. I've seen kids in utter despair. I've visited kids in jail doing adult time for crimes they've committed.</p> <p>They are part of a growing population of over 2m Americans behind bars. Two million convicts, not consumers. Two million Americans who, while paying for their crimes, are not paying taxes, are not there for their children and are not raising families. Most of them are men and the majority of those men are minorities. The issue of race still casts a shadow over our society, despite the impressive progress we have made over the last 40 years to overcome the legacy of our troubled past.</p> <p>So, with all the success we have enjoyed and with all the wealth we have created, we have much more work to do and a long way to go to bring the promise of America to every American. And with all we have to do on our national agenda, I am convinced that to deliver on that promise, we must begin with our children. So many of the problems we worry about go back to how we raise our children. We either build our children or we build more jails.</p> <p>Time to stop building jails. And listen -- our children are not the problem, they are our future. They are America's promise. The problem is us if we fail to give them what they need to be successful in life.</p> <p>That mission has become the passion of my life. Because if you want to solve our drug problem, you won't do it by trying to cut off the supply and arresting street pushers alone.</p> <p>It will only be solved when we place into the heart of every child growing up in America the moral strength never to fall for the destructive lure of drugs --- the strength to just say \"no, not me. I won't do it! I've got too much to live for.\"</p> <p>If you want to solve the problem of violence and crime on our streets, it begins with us teaching children to value life, their own and others, and to have respect for themselves and respect for others. If you want young people to become contributing citizens and not convicts, then early in life we must give them the character and the competence they need to succeed in this exciting new world.</p> <p>It begins in the home with caring, loving parents and family members who pass on the virtues of past generations, who live good lives which serve as models for their children.</p> <p>And where the family is broken or not up to the task, the rest of us must step in to help as mentors, tutors, foster parents, friends to kids who desperately need responsible adults to show them the way. Tens of thousands of our neighbours have stepped forward. Tens of thousands who realize that children are a gift from God not only to their parents, but to their community. They belong to us all.</p> <p>We need to provide safe places for those kids to learn and to grow. More clubs and after-school programs to protect them from the dangers in our society and to surround them with more adults who will keep them in play. We are obliged to make sure that every child gets a healthy start in life. With all our wealth and capacity, we just can't stand by idly. We must make sure that every child has health care.</p> <p>As we are giving these necessities, and others, to our children, let's ask them to also give back to the community of which they are a part. Early in life help them to learn of the joy that comes from giving to others through community service. Let youngsters be part of the solution.</p> <p>With character in their hearts, and nurturing adults in their lives, our youngsters will be ready for the schooling that will give them the education needed to win those jobs of the future.</p> <p>There's work for all of us to do -- parents, aunts, uncles, teachers, the government at all levels, the private sector, our great non-profits, our houses of worship, all joining in the crusade to point kids in the right direction in life.</p> <p>Tonight we focus on education. Governor Bush has rightly made children and education the centrepiece of his campaign for president. You just heard him say it - we can't leave any child behind. Every child deserves and must receive a quality education. Give a quality education to a child who believes in himself or herself and even with the bleakest beginning in life that child can make it and break the cycle of poverty and failure for that family forever.</p> <p>So many of our public schools are doing a fine job preparing our youngsters. I have been given no greater honour than to have had four public schools named after me - an honour greater than medals. In those schools and so many others I've visited, you've never seen better facilities, more dedicated teachers and more involved parents. It makes your heart pound with pride.</p> <p>But I have also seen too many schools that are failing. They are trapped in fossilised bureaucracies. Bureaucracies that have low expectations for children and consequently set low standards for them. These schools are leaving our children behind and they must be fixed.</p> <p>If we believe they are all our children, then all of us must be willing to spend more to repair our schools and to pay our teachers better. We must also be open to new ideas. Let's not be afraid of standardised testing for students, testing of teachers, charter schools, private scholarship funding to give poor parents a choice, or home schooling.</p> <p>Let's experiment prudently with school voucher programs to see if they help. Let's use innovation and competition to help give our children the best education possible.</p> <p>We invite skilled workers to come to America from all over the world to fill the good obs that are waiting here. I think that's great. Immigration is our life's blood. I am the son of immigrants. But I also want our kids educated and trained for those jobs. We owe it to them!</p> <p>Governor Bush has shown in Texas in just a few short years, what can be done for education. As Governor, he ended social promotions. He increased state funding for education by $8bn. He put new textbooks in every school. He strengthened standardised testing in all Texas public schools, he insisted on teacher competency, and he expanded the charter school movement.</p> <p>Seventeen thousand Texas kids are now in charter schools. Seventy-eight percent of those kids are minorities - their parents had a choice and what they decided was best for their kids. The results in Texas have been dramatic. The number of students passing all parts of the Texas standardised tests since 1994 has increased by 51%. Even more exciting, the number of minority students passing the tests has increased by 89%.</p> <p>Also, to insure a diverse college population with the loss of affirmative action, Governor Bush has guaranteed acceptance at public universities for the top 10% of every high school graduating class in the state. And above all, he insisted on accountability for results.</p> <p>It works. It all comes together. Governor Bush doesn't just talk about reform, he reforms. He now offers that leadership to the nation.</p> <p>In pursuing educational reform, as well as in all other parts of his agenda for Texas, Governor Bush has reached out to all Texans-- white, black, Latino, Asian, native American.</p> <p>He has been successful in bringing more and more minorities into the tent by responding to their deepest needs. Some call it compassionate conservatism. To me, it's just about caring for people.</p> <p>He can do the same thing as President. He will bring to the White House that same passion for inclusion. I know he can help bridge our racial divides.</p> <p>Recently, Governor Bush addressed the annual meeting of the NAACP. He spoke to the delegates about his plans for housing, health and educational programs to help all Americans. He also spoke the truth to the delegates when he said that \"the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln.\"</p> <p>I talked with him again today and I know that, with all his heart, Governor Bush welcomes the challenge. He wants the Republican party to wear that mantle again. But he knows it will take hard work. He knows it will not be handed over, that it will have to be earned.</p> <p>The party must follow Governor Bush's lead and reach out to minority communities and particularly the African-American community - and not just during an election year campaign. It must be a sustained effort. It must be every day. It must be for real.</p> <p>The party must listen to and speak with all leaders of the black community, regardless of political affiliation or philosophy. We must understand the cynicism that exists in the black community. The kind of cynicism that is created when, for example, some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand Black kids get an education, but hardly a whimper is heard from them over affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with preferences for special interests.</p> <p>Overcoming the cynicism and mistrust that exist and raising up that mantle of Lincoln is about more than just winning votes.

      "bodyText": "President and Mrs Bush, a special good evening. I am honoured and pleased to again have the privilege of addressing a Republican national convention. In San Diego in 1996, I followed former first lady Nancy Reagan to the lectern after her moving tribute to President Reagan. I am delighted this time to follow Mrs Laura Bush, a lady of passion, dedication and grace. She will be a great first lady. Don't you think? During the almost seven years since I left the army, I've traveled all across America. I've seen people hard at work providing for their families, giving of themselves, caring for each other. I've seen them creating wealth for the nation. I've seen an economy transforming itself to seize the promise of the information revolution. I've met so many of our fellow citizens who believe in America to the depth of their hearts and who are doing everything they can in their communities to make our nation that more perfect union spoken of in our constitution. I've been moved yet again to stand in awe of the American dream which was given birth in this city over 200 years ago. A dream I have been privileged to live. I've met so many young people who believe in the dream. They are on a road to success. They are being raised in strong families, going to good schools, filling the finest universities, graduating and going on to find their place and fortune in this land. Even the youngest of them, still in elementary school are getting ready for the future -- using computers, logging onto the internet -- while still enjoying the magic of childhood by curling up with a Harry Potter book. There is so much that is good and right in America! Yet I cannot ignore that in my travels I've also seen poverty, failing communities, people who've lost hope. Tragically, I've seen too many young Americans who are overwhelmed by the daily struggle just to survive. I've seen kids destroying themselves with drugs. Kids who see violence and crime as the answer to their hopelessness. Kids who no longer believe in themselves and who don't see a reason to believe in America. I've seen kids in utter despair. I've visited kids in jail doing adult time for crimes they've committed. They are part of a growing population of over 2m Americans behind bars. Two million convicts, not consumers. Two million Americans who, while paying for their crimes, are not paying taxes, are not there for their children and are not raising families. Most of them are men and the majority of those men are minorities. The issue of race still casts a shadow over our society, despite the impressive progress we have made over the last 40 years to overcome the legacy of our troubled past. So, with all the success we have enjoyed and with all the wealth we have created, we have much more work to do and a long way to go to bring the promise of America to every American. And with all we have to do on our national agenda, I am convinced that to deliver on that promise, we must begin with our children. So many of the problems we worry about go back to how we raise our children. We either build our children or we build more jails. Time to stop building jails. And listen -- our children are not the problem, they are our future. They are America's promise. The problem is us if we fail to give them what they need to be successful in life. That mission has become the passion of my life. Because if you want to solve our drug problem, you won't do it by trying to cut off the supply and arresting street pushers alone. It will only be solved when we place into the heart of every child growing up in America the moral strength never to fall for the destructive lure of drugs --- the strength to just say \"no, not me. I won't do it! I've got too much to live for.\" If you want to solve the problem of violence and crime on our streets, it begins with us teaching children to value life, their own and others, and to have respect for themselves and respect for others. If you want young people to become contributing citizens and not convicts, then early in life we must give them the character and the competence they need to succeed in this exciting new world. It begins in the home with caring, loving parents and family members who pass on the virtues of past generations, who live good lives which serve as models for their children. And where the family is broken or not up to the task, the rest of us must step in to help as mentors, tutors, foster parents, friends to kids who desperately need responsible adults to show them the way. Tens of thousands of our neighbours have stepped forward. Tens of thousands who realize that children are a gift from God not only to their parents, but to their community. They belong to us all. We need to provide safe places for those kids to learn and to grow. More clubs and after-school programs to protect them from the dangers in our society and to surround them with more adults who will keep them in play. We are obliged to make sure that every child gets a healthy start in life. With all our wealth and capacity, we just can't stand by idly. We must make sure that every child has health care. As we are giving these necessities, and others, to our children, let's ask them to also give back to the community of which they are a part. Early in life help them to learn of the joy that comes from giving to others through community service. Let youngsters be part of the solution. With character in their hearts, and nurturing adults in their lives, our youngsters will be ready for the schooling that will give them the education needed to win those jobs of the future. There's work for all of us to do -- parents, aunts, uncles, teachers, the government at all levels, the private sector, our great non-profits, our houses of worship, all joining in the crusade to point kids in the right direction in life. Tonight we focus on education. Governor Bush has rightly made children and education the centrepiece of his campaign for president. You just heard him say it - we can't leave any child behind. Every child deserves and must receive a quality education. Give a quality education to a child who believes in himself or herself and even with the bleakest beginning in life that child can make it and break the cycle of poverty and failure for that family forever. So many of our public schools are doing a fine job preparing our youngsters. I have been given no greater honour than to have had four public schools named after me - an honour greater than medals. In those schools and so many others I've visited, you've never seen better facilities, more dedicated teachers and more involved parents. It makes your heart pound with pride. But I have also seen too many schools that are failing. They are trapped in fossilised bureaucracies. Bureaucracies that have low expectations for children and consequently set low standards for them. These schools are leaving our children behind and they must be fixed. If we believe they are all our children, then all of us must be willing to spend more to repair our schools and to pay our teachers better. We must also be open to new ideas. Let's not be afraid of standardised testing for students, testing of teachers, charter schools, private scholarship funding to give poor parents a choice, or home schooling. Let's experiment prudently with school voucher programs to see if they help. Let's use innovation and competition to help give our children the best education possible. We invite skilled workers to come to America from all over the world to fill the good obs that are waiting here. I think that's great. Immigration is our life's blood. I am the son of immigrants. But I also want our kids educated and trained for those jobs. We owe it to them! Governor Bush has shown in Texas in just a few short years, what can be done for education. As Governor, he ended social promotions. He increased state funding for education by $8bn. He put new textbooks in every school. He strengthened standardised testing in all Texas public schools, he insisted on teacher competency, and he expanded the charter school movement. Seventeen thousand Texas kids are now in charter schools. Seventy-eight percent of those kids are minorities - their parents had a choice and what they decided was best for their kids. The results in Texas have been dramatic. The number of students passing all parts of the Texas standardised tests since 1994 has increased by 51%. Even more exciting, the number of minority students passing the tests has increased by 89%. Also, to insure a diverse college population with the loss of affirmative action, Governor Bush has guaranteed acceptance at public universities for the top 10% of every high school graduating class in the state. And above all, he insisted on accountability for results. It works. It all comes together. Governor Bush doesn't just talk about reform, he reforms. He now offers that leadership to the nation. In pursuing educational reform, as well as in all other parts of his agenda for Texas, Governor Bush has reached out to all Texans-- white, black, Latino, Asian, native American. He has been successful in bringing more and more minorities into the tent by responding to their deepest needs. Some call it compassionate conservatism. To me, it's just about caring for people. He can do the same thing as President. He will bring to the White House that same passion for inclusion. I know he can help bridge our racial divides. Recently, Governor Bush addressed the annual meeting of the NAACP. He spoke to the delegates about his plans for housing, health and educational programs to help all Americans. He also spoke the truth to the delegates when he said that \"the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln.\" I talked with him again today and I know that, with all his heart, Governor Bush welcomes the challenge. He wants the Republican party to wear that mantle again. But he knows it will take hard work. He knows it will not be handed over, that it will have to be earned. The party must follow Governor Bush's lead and reach out to minority communities and particularly the African-American community - and not just during an election year campaign. It must be a sustained effort. It must be every day. It must be for real. The party must listen to and speak with all leaders of the black community, regardless of political affiliation or philosophy. We must understand the cynicism that exists in the black community. The kind of cynicism that is created when, for example, some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand Black kids get an education, but hardly a whimper is heard from them over affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with preferences for special interests. Overcoming the cynicism and mistrust that exist and raising up that mantle of Lincoln is about more than just winning votes. It is about giving all minorities a competitive choice. We deserve one! It will be good for our party and it will be good for America. Good for America -- that must be the measure for all that we do. I believe that's the measure that Governor Bush will use to guide his actions as president. Whether it's economic policy or military strategy or seeing what we can do to make our American family more inclusive, he will always try to do what is good and right for America. Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at an historic turning point in world history. For the first time in almost a century, America does not face an enemy fueled by an ideology claiming to be superior to our beloved system of democracy, free enterprise and the rights of men and women to pursue their individual destinies. We defeated communism and fascism on the field of battle and on the field of ideas. The sick nations that still pursue the 'fools gold' of tyranny and weapons of mass destruction will soon find themselves left behind in the dust bin of history. They are investing in their own demise as surely as the Soviet Union did by investing in the Red Army. Today, we are the most powerful nation on earth - militarily, economically, by any measure. We are that rarity in history - a trusted nation whose power is tempered by compassion, whose leadership is earned by example and whose foreign affairs will be guided by common interests and common sense. The world is watching to see if all this power and wealth is just for the well-to-do, the comfortable, the privileged. Or are we a nation that can make our dream real for all Americans, so that all share in what we have been given by a generous God? We must show to the rest of the world the beauty and potential of democracy. Our greatest strength is the power of our example -- to be that shining city on the hill that Ronald Reagan spoke of and that the world looks up to. To continue to be that place, we must all work together, we must reach down, back and across, all of us coming together to show the world what our American family can do. That is the challenge. This is the time. And in Governor George Bush we have the leader.",

It also contends reasonably that it is making better use of the vast wealth of content that would otherwise go unused from its bank of bureaux, sports reporters and news stringers around the world.</p> <p>Professor Ian Hargreaves from Cardiff University, who has written on the future of the corporation, says: \"The BBC's place on the internet is incontestable.

Funding. As the least mature service, attracting private backing for the internet division could be the least politically sensitive way of getting outside money into the BBC.</p> <p>Insiders say that Dyke views the core news online service as a sacred cow but that everything else is up for debate. He is said to enthuse over the commercial opportunities available from exploiting the web. </p> <p>A model may be Beeb.com, which sits under BBC Worldwide. For the past 12 months or so a wide range of options have been considered including a partial stock market flotation of the retailing site. </p> <p>The preferred option is selling a minority stake to a private investor. Cable companies NTL and Telewest both held protracted talks but have since left the negotiating table although the BBC is understood to be close to agreeing a deal with another unnamed partner. \"Beeb.com is pretty much opening the door,\" says one BBC insider. \"It's difficult to say what the BBC will look in a few years' time - although it is committed to a public internet service.\"</p> <p>The other option that has been mooted is some kind of mutual structure which would leave the BBC owned by the licence fee payers - but better able to raid the capital markets for funding.</p> <p>Hargreaves adds that the answer to both funding and the issue of how far the BBC should be allowed to go will come down to more effective regulation. \"They are not separate questions,\" he says. \"The way to deal with issues of competition is by having a competent regulatory regime but the regulator also has to have a view on far the BBC will be able to raise money in a commercial fashion.\" </p> <p>The issues facing the BBC are similar to those troubling most others in the new media environment. There is one certainty however - that in the short term the blurring of lines between commercial operations and the public service will at the very least cause structural headaches of the kind Dyke is keen to expunge.</p>",

Hargreaves adds that the answer to both funding and the issue of how far the BBC should be allowed to go will come down to more effective regulation. \"They are not separate questions,\" he says. \"The way to deal with issues of competition is by having a competent regulatory regime but the regulator also has to have a view on far the BBC will be able to raise money in a commercial fashion.\" The issues facing the BBC are similar to those troubling most others in the new media environment.

      "body": "<p>On Friday the Queen graciously gave her assent to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers bill after it was fast-tracked through parliament with the agreement of the two main parties. So the RIP bill is now the RIP Act, yet another piece of legislation which will prevent journalists from operating freely in the public interest. </p> <p>On the face of it, the act was proposed for the best of reasons: to ensure that the formidable array of the authorities' investigatory powers accord with human rights. Unless there is good reason, our communications cannot be monitored. </p> <p>But what amounts to a good reason? Terrorism, drug-dealing, serious crime, tax evasion and that greatest of catch-alls: the national interest. There lies the problem. What the government and its various authorities - whether police, customs and excise or security services - regard as the national interest is all too often about the state's interest rather than the public good. </p> <p>I'll come back to that. Let's consider the main threat faced by newspapers from the draconian powers of this act. Emails, now the most used form of communication between journalists, and between them and their contacts and sources, are no longer safe. </p> <p>From this day on, without our knowledge, the authorities can intercept our messages. They will know who said what to whom about what well before the information can be published. Indeed, by having that knowledge in advance they may well be able to take measures to prevent its publication. </p> <p>This isn't far-fetched. A good example occurred recently when the renegade MI5 officer David Shayler emailed the Observer and the Guardian. When the police - claiming to be acting in the national interest - tried to compel the papers to hand over the emails, the request was refused. </p> <p>A judge ordered the papers to comply, a ruling that was overturned by the court of appeal in a masterly judgment by Lord Justice Judge which stressed the rights of a free press to investigate matters on behalf of the public without compromising its informants. </p> <p>If the RIP Act had been on the statute book at the time, that case would never have reached court because the police would have used the act's powers to obtain the emails secretly regardless of such rights. </p> <p>It wouldn't have helped if the emails had been encrypted. Under the new act, the authorities can demand the key to any encrypted message. </p> <p>In other words, the RIP Act makes all traffic over the internet in Britain available to the state if a body, however flimsy its suspicion, decides to apply for the right to intercept emails. </p> <p>Nor will the authorities need a legal warrant to do so. Interception will require only the home secretary's approval while the monitoring of traffic can be \"self-authorised\" by whoever decides it is necessary.

      "bodyText": "On Friday the Queen graciously gave her assent to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers bill after it was fast-tracked through parliament with the agreement of the two main parties. So the RIP bill is now the RIP Act, yet another piece of legislation which will prevent journalists from operating freely in the public interest. On the face of it, the act was proposed for the best of reasons: to ensure that the formidable array of the authorities' investigatory powers accord with human rights. Unless there is good reason, our communications cannot be monitored. But what amounts to a good reason? Terrorism, drug-dealing, serious crime, tax evasion and that greatest of catch-alls: the national interest. There lies the problem. What the government and its various authorities - whether police, customs and excise or security services - regard as the national interest is all too often about the state's interest rather than the public good. I'll come back to that. Let's consider the main threat faced by newspapers from the draconian powers of this act. Emails, now the most used form of communication between journalists, and between them and their contacts and sources, are no longer safe. From this day on, without our knowledge, the authorities can intercept our messages. They will know who said what to whom about what well before the information can be published. Indeed, by having that knowledge in advance they may well be able to take measures to prevent its publication. This isn't far-fetched. A good example occurred recently when the renegade MI5 officer David Shayler emailed the Observer and the Guardian. When the police - claiming to be acting in the national interest - tried to compel the papers to hand over the emails, the request was refused. A judge ordered the papers to comply, a ruling that was overturned by the court of appeal in a masterly judgment by Lord Justice Judge which stressed the rights of a free press to investigate matters on behalf of the public without compromising its informants. If the RIP Act had been on the statute book at the time, that case would never have reached court because the police would have used the act's powers to obtain the emails secretly regardless of such rights. It wouldn't have helped if the emails had been encrypted. Under the new act, the authorities can demand the key to any encrypted message. In other words, the RIP Act makes all traffic over the internet in Britain available to the state if a body, however flimsy its suspicion, decides to apply for the right to intercept emails. Nor will the authorities need a legal warrant to do so. Interception will require only the home secretary's approval while the monitoring of traffic can be \"self-authorised\" by whoever decides it is necessary. Demands for someone to provide an encryption key can be authorised by a customs and excise official, a chief constable, a magistrate, a judge or the home secretary. The passing of the RIP Act denies everyone the freedom, and the privacy, we thought the internet had provided. It robs journalists and their sources - including that most potent and essential of tipsters, the whistle-blower - of their rights and, quite possibly, threatens their liberty. Despite significant concessions made during the passage of the bill, it is still badly conceived and may well prove counter-productive. Internet experts believe that users will soon employ a range of esoteric \"privacy tools\", enabling them to camouflage emails and hide files, to avoid compliance. In what appears to have been panic at the growth of the internet and the freedom enjoyed by its users, the British government has accorded itself powers which no other western country has dared to take. Yet this, remember, is the government that came to power crowing about its commitment to end secrecy. Instead its record has been a disgrace. Jack Straw last week finally announced that the Home Office will consult media bodies to ensure that future legislation which does \"impact on press and media reporting\" does not create \"unintended restrictions\". What a cheek. The sound of the stable door being closed long after the horses have bolted is deafening. So far we have seen a milksop freedom of information proposal, a worrying data protection act, a thoughtless youth and criminal evidence act, a potentially harmful terrorism act and a restrictive local government act. Now comes the RIP Act. Consultation is supposed to happen before, Mr Straw, not afterwards. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIP) What is it? Originated by Jack Straw, RIP sets out the government's plans to allow official surveillance of internet traffic. Published in February 2000, it passed through the Lords in July and becomes law in October. The government line? RIP gives police and security services new powers to monitor and intercept emails and websites, channels through which online criminals, terrorists, paedophiles and pornographers have traditionally been able to communicate. Some data on computers, such as child pornography, is often encrypted. The bill makes it illegal to refuse a police request to decrypt data. All security service warrants for data interception will require prior government approval, bringing the UK into line with other EU surveillance measures. The anti-government line? The cost and maintenance of necessary surveillance equipment will be passed on to the internet user, threatening e-commerce in Britain and billions in lost business. Every UK internet service provider will be responsible for the installation of remote-controlled black boxes relaying all data passing through its computers to a special monitoring centre in MI5's HQ, the Government Technical Assistance Centre. Unlike telephone tapping, which can be specified, RIP allows the government to monitor all UK internet traffic - sites downloaded, address books, emails, discussion groups and chat rooms - without a warrant, which could be considered a contravention of the privacy requirements of the European convention on human rights. There are two-year sentences for forgetting passwords, and for failing to surrender or losing keys used to encrypt communications data. The burden of proof is reversed from the prosecution to the defence. Then there are five-year sentences for telling anyone that you have been served with an order to surrender encryption keys or hand over encrypted material in \"plaintext\" form. The RIP bill can justifiably be called a total infringement of civil liberties. From October, no one in the UK will be able to feel free from government surveillance. International precedents? Only Russia, Singapore and Malaysia have similar laws. There is nothing comparable in the US. A recent Irish law makes it illegal for government to access commercial encryption keys. France has relaxed controls on domestic encryption, while Germany is opposed to restrictions on citizens' use of encryption.",

      "body": "<p> Earlier this summer the Kosovan daily Dita ran an exclusive story about a 25-year-old Serb working in Pristina for the UN. The article, \"When Petar becomes Peter\", accused him of committing war crimes during Nato's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia last year. </p> <p>\"His name is Petar Topoljski,\" ran the article. \"He and his father were paramilitary. They robbed, looted, beat and forced their Albanian neighbours from their homes. Now Petar is working in the UN administration in Pristina and is known as Peter.\" His address was also provided. </p> <p>Three weeks after publication, Petar Topoljski went missing. Ten days later, he was found stabbed to death in a village on the outskirts of Pristina. </p> <p>The article was far from the first to have appeared in the Kosovo Albanian press attempting to \"expose\" war criminals. Numerous similar features have appeared over the last few months. But the \"naming and shaming\", and subsequent death of a UN employee, have jolted the UN into action and sparked an intense debate in the province about the regulation of the media. </p> <p>Dita was seen as having a significant role in Petar Topoljski's death. Bernard Kouchner, head of the UN mission in Kosovo, ordered the paper to close for eight days in the immediate aftermath of his death. </p> <p>New rules have since been introduced that can see newspapers fined up to 100,000 German marks (\u00a331,500), or closed down permanently. The rules are being enforced by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), part of the UN administration in Kosovo. Its ambassador, Daan Everts, is hoping the new rules will put an end to the publication of articles that he describes as \"death warrants\". </p> <p>\"We have seen some very bad articles where individuals are being condemned to death, because they are being identified,\" he says. \"Their workplace is being given out, and people are basically saying, 'There they are. Do whatever you want to them.' This is unacceptable.\" </p> <p>So far the rules have had a limited effect. At the beginning of this month, the bi-monthly magazine Kosovarja published Nightmare Butchers, an article accusing Kosovo's Roma community en masse of being guilty of war crimes. </p> <p>\"Sources of information from all battlefields support the reactions of Albanian public opinion proving with facts and names the participation of Roma in the ethnic cleansing campaign against Albanians,\" the article stated. With scant evidence that they had committed any crimes, it listed 11 men involved in \"local actions\". </p> <p>Dita has continued to print articles revealing the whereabouts of paramilitaries and even Kosovo's best selling and most widely respected daily, Koha Ditore, has printed the name of an Albanian student in the Kosovo police school with alleged connections to the Serbian police. </p> <p>There seems to be very little middle ground between newspaper editors and the UN, which has taken on the task of regulation. Few newspapers accept that what they put into print can have potentially fatal consequences. Editors instead see the articles as part of a quest for the truth. Behlul Beqaj, the editor of Dita, argued in a recent editorial that \"it is the task and obligation of every Albanian citizen to reveal war criminals. If we do not do so now the forthcoming generations will never forgive us\". </p> <p>The articles, Beqaj claimed, are also a quest for justice: \"Do not ask Albanians to forgive before justice has been done. Ethnic tolerance cannot be created by asking Albanians to turn a blind eye... You who came to Kosovo to establish justice should stop the crime and criminals and not the press that publishes facts about them.\" </p> <p>Dita's complaint is a common one. Kosovo's judicial system has been notoriously slow to get started and very few Serbs have stood trial for war crimes. </p> <p>Llazar Semini, a writer for the Institute of War and Peace Reporting, which monitors news coverage in Kosovo, suggests that much of the problem is due to a perception among Kosovo Albanians that the courts are not effective. </p> <p>\"They are not seeing any alleged Serb war criminal being sentenced. They think this is morally right at a time when they are not feeling the results of good governance by the international community.\" </p> <p>In the meantime there has been strong criticism of tighter media regulation from local editors and international press organisations alike. Groups such as Article 19, the World Press Freedom Committee and the International Federation of Journalists have criticised the wide-ranging powers of the new OSCE press commissioner as a threat to the freedom of speech. </p> <p>A code of conduct is currently being discussed with local editors, but the media commissioner already has the power to warn, fine, or even close down a newspaper. Ardian Arifaj, managing editor of Koha Ditore, sees this as an unwelcome reminder of the past. </p> <p>\"It's definitely a step in the wrong direction - any kind of suppression of freedom of speech and expression is a step backwards. It would definitely be a reminder of the environment I grew up in and started working as a journalist in. And it's a reminder of an environment I would not like to go back to.\" </p> <p>The division between Kosovo's media and the UN regulators looks likely to intensify for the moment. At the end of last week the OSCE took the decision to close Dita. The paper was refusing to pay a fine of 25,000 German marks for publishing the names and photos of several Serb paramilitaries. Dita's editor described the fine as \"25,000 blows for Kosovo and democracy\". </p> <p>But the media commissioner, Douglas Davidson, an American diplomat working with the OSCE, defends the regulatory measures. </p> <p>\"People argue that this [the new media law] limits press freedom, saying everyone should be free to pronounce whoever is a war criminal. I'm not sure that is a very healthy tendency if you are trying to bring a society together. It is a pretty effective means of keeping people whipped up with hatred against other ethnic groups.\" </p> <p>He admits that this latest crackdown may not have initially had the desired effect. \"I've boosted Dita's circulation from nothing.\" The paper is now planning demonstrations against its closure. But Davidson says he won't let up. </p> <p>\"We wouldn't be doing this if the press could regulate itself. If you are trying to build a stable, secure, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo, it seems to me you might want to curb the tendency of people to take justice into their own hands, whether on the pages of the newspaper, or directly for the benefit of society.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Twice in the space of a week, British courts did an unusual thing and delivered ringing endorsements of press and broadcasting freedom. </p> <p>You know all about the first one - the appeal court victory for the Guardian and the Observer in the Shayler case was a front-page lead story in this newspaper on July 22. It upheld the right of journalists to publish allegations by whistleblowers without then having that material seized by the authorities. The publication of \"inconvenient or embarrassing revelations\" was, the court seemed to accept, necessary and in the public good. It should therefore not be discouraged or stifled. </p> <p>A similar principle was at work the following Tuesday, two floors up in the family division of the high court. The BBC sought to remove an injunction placed on an interview Today had carried out with Bobby Kelly, the 16-year-old boy who left home suddenly to join an obscure religious sect. We had pursued the sect, Jesus Christians, for several days, asking to talk to Bobby. Eventually he rang the programme and an interview with our reporter, Zubeida Malik, was recorded. Bobby had been made a ward of court after his \"abduction\", as some people had called it. When we rang his family to let them know Bobby would be on air the next morning, the injunction was served, supported by his grandmother and by his legal guardian, the official solicitor. </p> <p>This was an odd state of affairs. After making Bobby a ward of court, the authorities had called for media assistance in tracking the boy down. They named him, and a photograph was published. None of this attention would, so far as the court was concerned, do the boy any damage. But, having invited the press in, they shut the door. </p> <p>Not only was our interview injuncted, but henceforth there would be no interviews, anywhere, with Jesus Christians. This was, in our view, an extreme case of censorship. While Jesus Christians were allegedly in contempt of court for not having disclosed the whereabouts of Bobby Kelly, the organisation was not illegal nor a force for evil deserving a restriction of its members' civil rights. Why should they be deprived of free speech? The answers were a little vague. </p> <p>The official solicitor argued that to broadcast the interview would harm Bobby. No direct evidence was offered as to what that damage would be; publicity in itself was seen as damaging. In other words, it was a circular argument. Further, interviews with members of the cult would provide Jesus Christians with - here comes that ill-judged phrase again - the oxygen of publicity. It seemed that the authorities, in the same way as in the Shayler case, regarded the media as an unpaid servant of the judiciary. </p> <p>In lifting the injunction, Justice Munby challenged this head on. Just as Lord Justice Judge in the appeal court the previous Friday had recognised the public interest served by free and independent media, so Judge Munby acknowledged that newspapers and radio programmes were not factotums of the court and that restrictions on their reporting rights served to chip away at freedom of speech. </p> <p>Further, the suggestion that in every such case the child's welfare would take precedence over press freedom, was rejected: hard evidence, said Munby, must be provided to support allegations of likely harm. This is crucial. In future, courts may be less likely to view the wishes of the media as trivial when compared to the welfare of a single individual; the overriding concern must be free speech. </p> <p>What happened in court is immensely useful . In future, there might, after this very long, detailed and powerful judgment, be fewer injunctions, and a greater realisation that the media assist the courts - and the public - to the fullest when given as much freedom and independence as possible.</p> <p><strong>Rod Liddle is editor of Radio 4's Today programme</strong></p>",

Not only was our interview injuncted, but henceforth there would be no interviews, anywhere, with Jesus Christians. This was, in our view, an extreme case of censorship. While Jesus Christians were allegedly in contempt of court for not having disclosed the whereabouts of Bobby Kelly, the organisation was not illegal nor a force for evil deserving a restriction of its members' civil rights. Why should they be deprived of free speech? The answers were a little vague. The official solicitor argued that to broadcast the interview would harm Bobby. No direct evidence was offered as to what that damage would be; publicity in itself was seen as damaging. In other words, it was a circular argument. Further, interviews with members of the cult would provide Jesus Christians with - here comes that ill-judged phrase again - the oxygen of publicity. It seemed that the authorities, in the same way as in the Shayler case, regarded the media as an unpaid servant of the judiciary. In lifting the injunction, Justice Munby challenged this head on. Just as Lord Justice Judge in the appeal court the previous Friday had recognised the public interest served by free and independent media, so Judge Munby acknowledged that newspapers and radio programmes were not factotums of the court and that restrictions on their reporting rights served to chip away at freedom of speech. Further, the suggestion that in every such case the child's welfare would take precedence over press freedom, was rejected: hard evidence, said Munby, must be provided to support allegations of likely harm. This is crucial. In future, courts may be less likely to view the wishes of the media as trivial when compared to the welfare of a single individual; the overriding concern must be free speech. What happened in court is immensely useful . In future, there might, after this very long, detailed and powerful judgment, be fewer injunctions, and a greater realisation that the media assist the courts - and the public - to the fullest when given as much freedom and independence as possible.

      "byline": "Sean Dodson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>He is the self-appointed watchdog of the US media, the man who Bob Woodward once called, \"the foremost serious journalistic entrepreneur of our times\". His name is Steve Brill, he is the founder and former editor of Brill's Content - one-time scourge of corporate media - and now he is a fully-fledged media owner in his own right. </p> <p>Last month, Brill started what many new media commentators regard as one of the most exciting e-commerce launches in the US this year. <a href=\"http://www.Contentville.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Contentville.com</a> is a massive e-publisher, selling content culled from books, magazines, transcripts and legal documents. It even claims every dissertation written for a PhD degree in the US since 1861. </p> <p>The site is a pay-to-download electronic archive. Magazine articles are sold for $2.95 (\u00a32), while a dissertation (in electronic form) costs around $50 (\u00a333). The site sells books too, selected by a string of carefully chosen bookshops and by a weighty editorial team which includes such luminaries as Harold Bloom and the playwright Wendy Wasserman. </p> <p>But only a week into its launch the $120m (\u00a380m) company found itself embroiled in a bitter dispute. And for once, Brill found himself up against thousands of disgruntled freelance writers rather than the media higher-ups that he usually tackles in his magazine Brill's Content. </p> <p>The writers are complaining that their work is being sold on his new site without their prior consent. What rubs salt in the wound is that Brill has always sold himself as a guardian of the little fella. And besides, all he had to do was ask. </p> <p>Brill launched Brill's Content in 1998 and it rapidly gathered a reputation for being a brash magazine that prided itself on whistle-blowing its way through the US media. Brill had cut his teeth 20 years earlier as founder of the first court TV service in the US, before moving on to found the magazines American Lawyer and Consumer Reports. </p> <p>So when he announced, back in February, that he was to form a partnership with some of the biggest names in the US media, many pundits reacted with surprise and even scorn. How could a media watchdog be of any use if it was in the lap of the corporations it was set to guard against? </p> <p>Brill's partners include NBC, CBS (who gained 35% equity in Contentville in return for $40m (\u00a326m) worth of advertising and promotions over a three-year period) and Ebsco, a company which provides magazine subscription services and databases of archive content. In other words, the very companies that Brill's Content is famous for monitoring. It was as if Private Eye had cut a deal with Rupert Murdoch and begun selling edited highlights of Hansard at a couple of pounds a throw. </p> <p>As Matt Welch of the Online Journalism Review points out: \"He [Brill] will benefit materially from every positive book or magazine review he publishes, and his right to cover one of the most important media issues of the day... is hopelessly compromised.\" </p> <p>Immediately, Brill announced that he was stepping down as as editor-in-chief of the magazine, turning those duties over to David Kuhn, who had joined the company last autumn from Talk magazine. Kuhn will edit both sites and Brill will remain as chairman and CEO of Brill Media Holdings - the company which oversees Brill's Content and Contentville. But he has insisted he will keep the two entities separate. </p> <p>Writing in Media Life magazine, Jeff Bercovici noted: \"It's almost as though, by appointing a single editor-in-chief for both ventures and announcing plans to share staffs and stories, he's intentionally stirring up controversy.\" </p> <p>But the trouble really started in the week after the launch. A number of online writing lists began to receive complaints from disgruntled freelancers claiming that they had found their articles available on Contentville. One writer, Catherine Dold, discovered that an article she had written in 1993 was for sale on the site. She believes that she retains copyright and has said that she was never contacted by Contentville or the article's original publishers. </p> <p>Dold immediately posted a warning on the online-writers list at <a href=\"http://www.content-exchange.com\">content-exchange.com</a>. She said: \"Big surprise. Several articles I wrote for Discover are being offered for sale on Contentville. I hold the copyright to these, no question... I suggest everyone do a search on your name at this site.\" </p> <p>She quickly found out she was not alone. Freelance writers across the US began complaining to the National Writers Union (NWU) that their work was available on the website without prior permission being granted. The authors claim that they still own the copyright to the material and have contracts to prove it. What's more, a number of the writers claim to have contacted the website and informed them of the infringement. None has received an initial reply and none of the work has been removed. </p> <p>The NWU immediately posted an email alert, warning its members that: \"There could literally be thousands whose work is being used illegally\" on Brill's new site. </p> <p>Then, a letter addressed to Steve Brill, by NWU president Jonathan Tasini, claimed that several of its members who retain copyright reported to Contentville that their work was being used without permission. </p> <p>Contentville responded by stating that more than a million articles are offered on its site legitimately, under a contract with the magazine archive company Ebsco. </p> <p>Contentville's website states that: \"Except for materials in the public domain, all of the content of Contentville.com is the property of Contentville.com or its content suppliers and is protected by copyright laws...\" The site also claims that it \"will block access to and/or remove any material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted\". </p> <p>Obviously embarrassed by the criticism, Brill responded on the Poynter Institute's media news website (<a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/medianews/letters.htm\" )>www.poynter.org/medianews/letters.htm</a>) claiming that his company had bought the articles in good faith and was \"keeping exact records of each article that we sell so that we can pay whoever the appropriate copyright owner is\". </p> <p>He added: \"I don't think we should be cast as the bad guy here for trying to create a market for this stuff - and for getting that process started by going to those who are promising that they own it.\" </p> <p>But the mess was not confined to small-time freelances either, it was reported last week that Associated Press is investigating after one of its business writers found AP stories in the Contentville archives. The New York newspaper the Village Voice has also complained that its own archive material is being sold on the site. </p> <p>Some analysts have suggested that what Brill wants to do is ditch Brill's Content, a magazine that has never made a profit, and concentrate on the e-publishers. Both Brill and Kuhn have denied this.

      "bodyText": "He is the self-appointed watchdog of the US media, the man who Bob Woodward once called, \"the foremost serious journalistic entrepreneur of our times\". His name is Steve Brill, he is the founder and former editor of Brill's Content - one-time scourge of corporate media - and now he is a fully-fledged media owner in his own right. Last month, Brill started what many new media commentators regard as one of the most exciting e-commerce launches in the US this year. Contentville.com is a massive e-publisher, selling content culled from books, magazines, transcripts and legal documents. It even claims every dissertation written for a PhD degree in the US since 1861. The site is a pay-to-download electronic archive. Magazine articles are sold for $2.95 (\u00a32), while a dissertation (in electronic form) costs around $50 (\u00a333). The site sells books too, selected by a string of carefully chosen bookshops and by a weighty editorial team which includes such luminaries as Harold Bloom and the playwright Wendy Wasserman. But only a week into its launch the $120m (\u00a380m) company found itself embroiled in a bitter dispute. And for once, Brill found himself up against thousands of disgruntled freelance writers rather than the media higher-ups that he usually tackles in his magazine Brill's Content. The writers are complaining that their work is being sold on his new site without their prior consent. What rubs salt in the wound is that Brill has always sold himself as a guardian of the little fella. And besides, all he had to do was ask. Brill launched Brill's Content in 1998 and it rapidly gathered a reputation for being a brash magazine that prided itself on whistle-blowing its way through the US media. Brill had cut his teeth 20 years earlier as founder of the first court TV service in the US, before moving on to found the magazines American Lawyer and Consumer Reports. So when he announced, back in February, that he was to form a partnership with some of the biggest names in the US media, many pundits reacted with surprise and even scorn. How could a media watchdog be of any use if it was in the lap of the corporations it was set to guard against? Brill's partners include NBC, CBS (who gained 35% equity in Contentville in return for $40m (\u00a326m) worth of advertising and promotions over a three-year period) and Ebsco, a company which provides magazine subscription services and databases of archive content. In other words, the very companies that Brill's Content is famous for monitoring. It was as if Private Eye had cut a deal with Rupert Murdoch and begun selling edited highlights of Hansard at a couple of pounds a throw. As Matt Welch of the Online Journalism Review points out: \"He [Brill] will benefit materially from every positive book or magazine review he publishes, and his right to cover one of the most important media issues of the day... is hopelessly compromised.\" Immediately, Brill announced that he was stepping down as as editor-in-chief of the magazine, turning those duties over to David Kuhn, who had joined the company last autumn from Talk magazine. Kuhn will edit both sites and Brill will remain as chairman and CEO of Brill Media Holdings - the company which oversees Brill's Content and Contentville. But he has insisted he will keep the two entities separate. Writing in Media Life magazine, Jeff Bercovici noted: \"It's almost as though, by appointing a single editor-in-chief for both ventures and announcing plans to share staffs and stories, he's intentionally stirring up controversy.\" But the trouble really started in the week after the launch. A number of online writing lists began to receive complaints from disgruntled freelancers claiming that they had found their articles available on Contentville. One writer, Catherine Dold, discovered that an article she had written in 1993 was for sale on the site. She believes that she retains copyright and has said that she was never contacted by Contentville or the article's original publishers. Dold immediately posted a warning on the online-writers list at content-exchange.com. She said: \"Big surprise. Several articles I wrote for Discover are being offered for sale on Contentville. I hold the copyright to these, no question... I suggest everyone do a search on your name at this site.\" She quickly found out she was not alone. Freelance writers across the US began complaining to the National Writers Union (NWU) that their work was available on the website without prior permission being granted. The authors claim that they still own the copyright to the material and have contracts to prove it. What's more, a number of the writers claim to have contacted the website and informed them of the infringement. None has received an initial reply and none of the work has been removed. The NWU immediately posted an email alert, warning its members that: \"There could literally be thousands whose work is being used illegally\" on Brill's new site. Then, a letter addressed to Steve Brill, by NWU president Jonathan Tasini, claimed that several of its members who retain copyright reported to Contentville that their work was being used without permission. Contentville responded by stating that more than a million articles are offered on its site legitimately, under a contract with the magazine archive company Ebsco. Contentville's website states that: \"Except for materials in the public domain, all of the content of Contentville.com is the property of Contentville.com or its content suppliers and is protected by copyright laws...\" The site also claims that it \"will block access to and/or remove any material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted\". Obviously embarrassed by the criticism, Brill responded on the Poynter Institute's media news website (www.poynter.org/medianews/letters.htm) claiming that his company had bought the articles in good faith and was \"keeping exact records of each article that we sell so that we can pay whoever the appropriate copyright owner is\". He added: \"I don't think we should be cast as the bad guy here for trying to create a market for this stuff - and for getting that process started by going to those who are promising that they own it.\" But the mess was not confined to small-time freelances either, it was reported last week that Associated Press is investigating after one of its business writers found AP stories in the Contentville archives. The New York newspaper the Village Voice has also complained that its own archive material is being sold on the site. Some analysts have suggested that what Brill wants to do is ditch Brill's Content, a magazine that has never made a profit, and concentrate on the e-publishers. Both Brill and Kuhn have denied this. But the kind of publicity generated by the ugly mess over writers' copyright will hardly inspire confidence in an ailing magazine. The NWU is confident that the row can be resolved and cites a similar recent dispute with another pay-to-download site, www.mercurycenter.com. Also, the union offers a similar service of its own - the Publication Rights Clearing House - which it is urging sites like Contentville to adopt. But David Wallis, a New York-based writer who is planning to launch an elite freelancers' agency, told the Village Voice that he sees Brill's attempt at reconciliation with the NWU as a \"dodge,\" and a reaction to the \"terrible publicity and backlash\" of last week. Wallis says: \"As a media watchdog, Steve Brill has rabies.\" It is perhaps worth remembering what Brill's Content was meant to be about. In what amounts to a mission statement on the original Brill's Content website, Brill wrote: \"It's time to hold journalists accountable.

Horseracing being my other great interest, my other daily reading is the Racing Post. </p> <p> <strong> Magazines:</strong> Spectator, New Statesman, Economist. There's no time for anything lighter, except Private Eye. </p> <p> <strong> Books:</strong> I like Robert B Parker's Boston-based crime novels. Always enjoy political biographies. Haven't read much recently because I've been writing a book myself. My favourite book title is jockey Jack Leach's Sods I Have Cut on the Turf. </p> <p> <strong> Film:</strong> This is where I realise what a terribly boring person I've become. I only occasionally get to the cinema. Saw East Is East a while ago. Loved it. And The Talented Mr Ripley. My favourite of all time is a film of the Newport Jazz Festival in the 1970s: Jazz on a Summer's Day. It's the most wonderful, evocative piece of filming. </p> <p> <strong> Television:</strong> For eight years I've worked 12-15 hour days, so I watch remarkably little. I love contemporary history series like the Poisoned Chalice, about Britain's relations with Europe, or Michael Cockerell's political biographies.

Can't afford to miss Peter Riddell, Don Macintyre, Philip Stevens, Hugo Young. Always make sure I read the Sun. You can't cover politics without it. Sundays: pretty well the lot. Horseracing being my other great interest, my other daily reading is the Racing Post. Magazines: Spectator, New Statesman, Economist. There's no time for anything lighter, except Private Eye. Books: I like Robert B Parker's Boston-based crime novels. Always enjoy political biographies. Haven't read much recently because I've been writing a book myself. My favourite book title is jockey Jack Leach's Sods I Have Cut on the Turf. Film: This is where I realise what a terribly boring person I've become. I only occasionally get to the cinema. Saw East Is East a while ago. Loved it. And The Talented Mr Ripley. My favourite of all time is a film of the Newport Jazz Festival in the 1970s: Jazz on a Summer's Day. It's the most wonderful, evocative piece of filming. Television: For eight years I've worked 12-15 hour days, so I watch remarkably little. I love contemporary history series like the Poisoned Chalice, about Britain's relations with Europe, or Michael Cockerell's political biographies. I'm looking forward to watching Newsnight a lot more. Radio: The Today programme of course. Love News Quiz, World at One, and PM. I'm a fan of 5 Live - its breakfast show is good.

      "body": "<p>Keith Chegwin's naughty bits notwithstanding, Channel 5 likes its beautiful people. With the hunky antipodean himbo on security and the meticulously made-up receptionist, a visitor's first impression is that its Long Acre headquarters in London must be populated by jobbing magazine models who happen to run a TV channel in their spare time. </p> <p>It's all part of the F-factor - that's F for feelgood, before you ask - that has delivered an impressive set of audience figures to the station recently. It may be derided as Channel Filth by executives at the Daily Mail (who probably drool over Sex and Shopping in private) but the David and Dawn show is delivering the goods, which is why the paper's increasingly personal attacks on chief executive David Elstein and director of programmes Dawn Airey are beginning to grate. </p> <p>There was a time when Channel 5 could take a joke, but headlines bemoaning the \"sad and degrading\" programmes and the \"dirty lies\" of its executives are in danger of robbing the channel of its sense of humour. </p> <p>\"We put on our full metal jacket and we don't care what the Daily Mail is saying because we know it is not true,\" says Airey, a few minutes after poring over another rant. \"We know, and our viewers know, that this is a polarised view of a very, very small part of the schedule. There is excellence and depth in vast areas of our schedule.\" </p> <p>It is certainly true that the channel is beginning to get a name for itself. Its daily soap, Family Affairs, is showing a slow but steady improvement in ratings. Night Fever, the Saturday night karaoke show starring the former Madness frontman Suggs, has a cult following and has been recommissioned for a fourth series. And The People versus Jerry Sadowitz shows that the channel is committed to cutting-edge comedy. Audience share in recent weeks has neared 6%. </p> <p>Later this year it will screen two new \"reality\" gameshows that may deliver not just \"talked-about television\", something of which C5 has plenty, but also a set of ratings that will really raise its game. One is as yet undisclosed, but the other, The Mole, a Belgian format that walked away with the Golden Rose at the Montreux television festival earlier this year, sounds a winner. The idea is that a group of 10 contestants compete to solve a challenge - and discover a mole in their midst who is tasked with sabotaging their every move. </p> <p>Despite her bullish mood, Airey concedes that the attacks are getting under her skin. \"It really upsets me, and everyone at Channel 5. We all want to make Channel 5 a huge success and we know that we are significantly better than when we launched three and a half years ago. Now, we are at least as good as the other broadcasters.\" </p> <p>It's a typically brash claim from the woman who once said that C5 was about \"films, fucking and football\". It is a style which she has brought to her role as advisory chair for the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival - she describes her position as \"agent provocateur\", and promises a festival line-up that is \"relevant, revelatory and raucous\". </p> <p>Traditionally the festival is the industry's annual opportunity for navel-gazing, and an increased number of discussion sessions this year means there will be more self-evaluation than ever before. Topics up for discussion include reality TV, the future of television news, regulation in the digital age and - since Greg Dyke is delivering the keynote MacTaggart lecture, the first person in the history of the festival to perform the role twice - the future of the BBC. </p> <p>Airey appears nervous about publicising her views on the last topic, since dissing her star speaker would not exactly be a politic move. But she suggests that Dyke's lecture may draw back from what his chief lieutenant, director of television Mark Thompson, outlined in his recent speech in Canada. \"It's quite clear that the government is not thrilled by what Mark said. I think the BBC is just throwing up lots of ideas and just testing the water. I personally would be surprised if the BBC went quite so far down the polarising route it was proposing.\" </p> <p>She is charitable about Dyke's first months at the corporation - \"People are discovering that they have a pulse again\" - but she likens the director-general's job to wading through treacle. It will take some time, she predicts, before Dyke's reforms filter through to what appears on screen. </p> <p>\"From people I know there, I just get the sense that it's not as empowering or as fast or as dynamic as it should be. For an organisation that has such a huge sum of money to spend on programmes, at its most simple, the BBC should be about commissioning the best ideas from the best sources - because it's got an awful lot of money to do so. It also has such a great legacy and attracts such great talent, but why isn't the range and quality of programming appearing on screen? I think it's probably a structural issue, and, as I say, that's what Greg is trying to address at the moment.\" </p> <p>The biggest challenge for the BBC, Airey suggests, is to maintain its long-term justification for its unique and increasingly controversial method of funding - the licence fee. As digital viewing expands, the audience share for all traditional broadcasters will fall. Ratings will be the key to the BBC's future: \"I think they have to be of a certain size in terms of audience share to justify the licence fee. If the BBC doesn't connect with most of the population on a relatively frequent basis then obviously there has to be a question mark over its long-term future funding.\" </p> <p>The key test will not be the rate at which the BBC's share falls, but how that share compares with the ratings of its commercial competitors. If the gap between BBC1 and ITV widens to more than 5% - at the moment, thanks to ITV's poor performance this year, they are about neck and neck - it will become impossible for the corporation to justify a tax on every viewer. At that stage, she suggests, the BBC could only justify a future without advertising by going down the subscription route. </p> <p>On regulation, there is no case for the BBC to remain outside a reformed system. Joining the almost universal calls for abolition or at least radical reform of the BBC governors, she argues that the corporation should be brought under the wing of one \"Ofcom\" regulator. The argument is simple, she suggests: \"Why should one sector of the broadcasting industry be regulated under different rules to another?\" Because of its unique system of funding, you might think. \"But it still has to reflect the mood of the population in terms of content. You can't have a BBC doing one thing and commercial broadcasters doing another.\" </p> <p>It is a statement of the obvious to say that the BBC needs more big hits, but there are few signs of any jackpots in the corporation's current crop of ideas. Airey is delighted to have beaten BBC1 controller Peter Salmon to The Mole - it sat on his desk for a year before he realised its potential, and when the BBC came calling on the day it won the Golden Rose at Montreux, it was too late. ITV is to snap up Survivor, the Charlie Parsons format that is a runaway success in the US (think Castaway 2000 crossed with Big Brother). With only a few more Castaway instalments planned before the survival experiment ends, the BBC has some catching up to do in the reality TV game. </p> <p>Clearly, the Big Brother phenomenon will be the talk of Edinburgh (it's the subject of a Guardian-sponsored debate), since the run will be halfway through at the time of the festival. \"We all love to talk about each other, we all love to gossip about each other and the way you've got people whose lives are being broadcast into the nation's homes, you can form a view about them. With Big Brother, while the viewing figures aren't spectacular, it's certainly a talking point with a certain demographic group. It has captured the imagination.\" </p> <p> High ratings are not the defining factor, although Big Brother's figures are climbing steadily and last Thursday the show attracted almost a quarter of the available audience at 11pm, says Airey. If your show is the talk of the steamie, that's good enough. And Big Brother is certainly \"talked-about television\". </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Airey does not agree with the doom-mongers that surveillance television spells the end of authored documentary; she says it is simply an evolution of the genre - clearly, what is shown on screen in Big Brother is heavily edited and packaged. And, however much Paul Watson protests, Big Brother is firmly rooted in the Sylvania Waters tradition. \"It shows that ordinary people can be infinitely fascinating.\" </p> <p>There will be a strong US contingent at Edinburgh, including the executive from ABC who commissioned Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? - another example of how \"ordinary people\" can deliver extraordinary audiences for broadcasters. Britain is clearly leading the field in the genre, and the US cannot get enough of it. \"We do experiment more with form and type here,\" she says. \"The stakes are less high.\" </p> <p>Chairing the Edinburgh TV festival has something of a job application feel about it - previous incumbents have included Jane Root and Mark Thompson. Share options, however, lock her in to Channel 5 for the foreseeable future, and given that her boss, Elstein, is not going anywhere soon, it looks as if she is there to stay. Indeed, she insists that the only task which she is anticipating after the festival is preparing for a five-week break in Australia - perhaps she could recruit a few more security guards while she's there.</p> <p><strong>Dawn rises quickly</strong></p> <p><strong> 1984</strong> Graduates from Cambridge and joins Central TV as trainee, eventually rising to scheduling role as controller of planning: \"It was a baptism of fire: most other controllers were men in their mid-40s, who felt rather undermined that Central had the audacity to put a 26-year-old unknown woman in as a controller.\" Acquires \"Zulu Dawn\" nickname. </p> <p><strong> 1993</strong> Part of first ITV Network Centre team under Marcus Plantin, commissioning children's and daytime programmes (including Supermarket Sweep).

      "bodyText": "Keith Chegwin's naughty bits notwithstanding, Channel 5 likes its beautiful people. With the hunky antipodean himbo on security and the meticulously made-up receptionist, a visitor's first impression is that its Long Acre headquarters in London must be populated by jobbing magazine models who happen to run a TV channel in their spare time. It's all part of the F-factor - that's F for feelgood, before you ask - that has delivered an impressive set of audience figures to the station recently. It may be derided as Channel Filth by executives at the Daily Mail (who probably drool over Sex and Shopping in private) but the David and Dawn show is delivering the goods, which is why the paper's increasingly personal attacks on chief executive David Elstein and director of programmes Dawn Airey are beginning to grate. There was a time when Channel 5 could take a joke, but headlines bemoaning the \"sad and degrading\" programmes and the \"dirty lies\" of its executives are in danger of robbing the channel of its sense of humour. \"We put on our full metal jacket and we don't care what the Daily Mail is saying because we know it is not true,\" says Airey, a few minutes after poring over another rant. \"We know, and our viewers know, that this is a polarised view of a very, very small part of the schedule. There is excellence and depth in vast areas of our schedule.\" It is certainly true that the channel is beginning to get a name for itself. Its daily soap, Family Affairs, is showing a slow but steady improvement in ratings. Night Fever, the Saturday night karaoke show starring the former Madness frontman Suggs, has a cult following and has been recommissioned for a fourth series. And The People versus Jerry Sadowitz shows that the channel is committed to cutting-edge comedy. Audience share in recent weeks has neared 6%. Later this year it will screen two new \"reality\" gameshows that may deliver not just \"talked-about television\", something of which C5 has plenty, but also a set of ratings that will really raise its game. One is as yet undisclosed, but the other, The Mole, a Belgian format that walked away with the Golden Rose at the Montreux television festival earlier this year, sounds a winner. The idea is that a group of 10 contestants compete to solve a challenge - and discover a mole in their midst who is tasked with sabotaging their every move. Despite her bullish mood, Airey concedes that the attacks are getting under her skin. \"It really upsets me, and everyone at Channel 5. We all want to make Channel 5 a huge success and we know that we are significantly better than when we launched three and a half years ago. Now, we are at least as good as the other broadcasters.\" It's a typically brash claim from the woman who once said that C5 was about \"films, fucking and football\". It is a style which she has brought to her role as advisory chair for the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival - she describes her position as \"agent provocateur\", and promises a festival line-up that is \"relevant, revelatory and raucous\". Traditionally the festival is the industry's annual opportunity for navel-gazing, and an increased number of discussion sessions this year means there will be more self-evaluation than ever before. Topics up for discussion include reality TV, the future of television news, regulation in the digital age and - since Greg Dyke is delivering the keynote MacTaggart lecture, the first person in the history of the festival to perform the role twice - the future of the BBC. Airey appears nervous about publicising her views on the last topic, since dissing her star speaker would not exactly be a politic move. But she suggests that Dyke's lecture may draw back from what his chief lieutenant, director of television Mark Thompson, outlined in his recent speech in Canada. \"It's quite clear that the government is not thrilled by what Mark said. I think the BBC is just throwing up lots of ideas and just testing the water. I personally would be surprised if the BBC went quite so far down the polarising route it was proposing.\" She is charitable about Dyke's first months at the corporation - \"People are discovering that they have a pulse again\" - but she likens the director-general's job to wading through treacle. It will take some time, she predicts, before Dyke's reforms filter through to what appears on screen. \"From people I know there, I just get the sense that it's not as empowering or as fast or as dynamic as it should be. For an organisation that has such a huge sum of money to spend on programmes, at its most simple, the BBC should be about commissioning the best ideas from the best sources - because it's got an awful lot of money to do so. It also has such a great legacy and attracts such great talent, but why isn't the range and quality of programming appearing on screen? I think it's probably a structural issue, and, as I say, that's what Greg is trying to address at the moment.\" The biggest challenge for the BBC, Airey suggests, is to maintain its long-term justification for its unique and increasingly controversial method of funding - the licence fee. As digital viewing expands, the audience share for all traditional broadcasters will fall. Ratings will be the key to the BBC's future: \"I think they have to be of a certain size in terms of audience share to justify the licence fee. If the BBC doesn't connect with most of the population on a relatively frequent basis then obviously there has to be a question mark over its long-term future funding.\" The key test will not be the rate at which the BBC's share falls, but how that share compares with the ratings of its commercial competitors. If the gap between BBC1 and ITV widens to more than 5% - at the moment, thanks to ITV's poor performance this year, they are about neck and neck - it will become impossible for the corporation to justify a tax on every viewer. At that stage, she suggests, the BBC could only justify a future without advertising by going down the subscription route. On regulation, there is no case for the BBC to remain outside a reformed system. Joining the almost universal calls for abolition or at least radical reform of the BBC governors, she argues that the corporation should be brought under the wing of one \"Ofcom\" regulator. The argument is simple, she suggests: \"Why should one sector of the broadcasting industry be regulated under different rules to another?\" Because of its unique system of funding, you might think. \"But it still has to reflect the mood of the population in terms of content. You can't have a BBC doing one thing and commercial broadcasters doing another.\" It is a statement of the obvious to say that the BBC needs more big hits, but there are few signs of any jackpots in the corporation's current crop of ideas. Airey is delighted to have beaten BBC1 controller Peter Salmon to The Mole - it sat on his desk for a year before he realised its potential, and when the BBC came calling on the day it won the Golden Rose at Montreux, it was too late. ITV is to snap up Survivor, the Charlie Parsons format that is a runaway success in the US (think Castaway 2000 crossed with Big Brother). With only a few more Castaway instalments planned before the survival experiment ends, the BBC has some catching up to do in the reality TV game. Clearly, the Big Brother phenomenon will be the talk of Edinburgh (it's the subject of a Guardian-sponsored debate), since the run will be halfway through at the time of the festival. \"We all love to talk about each other, we all love to gossip about each other and the way you've got people whose lives are being broadcast into the nation's homes, you can form a view about them. With Big Brother, while the viewing figures aren't spectacular, it's certainly a talking point with a certain demographic group. It has captured the imagination.\" High ratings are not the defining factor, although Big Brother's figures are climbing steadily and last Thursday the show attracted almost a quarter of the available audience at 11pm, says Airey. If your show is the talk of the steamie, that's good enough. And Big Brother is certainly \"talked-about television\". Not surprisingly, Airey does not agree with the doom-mongers that surveillance television spells the end of authored documentary; she says it is simply an evolution of the genre - clearly, what is shown on screen in Big Brother is heavily edited and packaged. And, however much Paul Watson protests, Big Brother is firmly rooted in the Sylvania Waters tradition. \"It shows that ordinary people can be infinitely fascinating.\" There will be a strong US contingent at Edinburgh, including the executive from ABC who commissioned Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? - another example of how \"ordinary people\" can deliver extraordinary audiences for broadcasters. Britain is clearly leading the field in the genre, and the US cannot get enough of it. \"We do experiment more with form and type here,\" she says. \"The stakes are less high.\" Chairing the Edinburgh TV festival has something of a job application feel about it - previous incumbents have included Jane Root and Mark Thompson. Share options, however, lock her in to Channel 5 for the foreseeable future, and given that her boss, Elstein, is not going anywhere soon, it looks as if she is there to stay. Indeed, she insists that the only task which she is anticipating after the festival is preparing for a five-week break in Australia - perhaps she could recruit a few more security guards while she's there. Dawn rises quickly 1984 Graduates from Cambridge and joins Central TV as trainee, eventually rising to scheduling role as controller of planning: \"It was a baptism of fire: most other controllers were men in their mid-40s, who felt rather undermined that Central had the audacity to put a 26-year-old unknown woman in as a controller.\" Acquires \"Zulu Dawn\" nickname. 1993 Part of first ITV Network Centre team under Marcus Plantin, commissioning children's and daytime programmes (including Supermarket Sweep).

      "body": "<p><strong>Saturday July 1</strong><br> CBI officials question <strong>Ali Irani</strong>, former physiotherapist of the Indian cricket team, for over three hours. This follows an alleged videotaped conversation between Irani and <strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> regarding match-fixing. </p> <p><strong>Ali Bacher</strong> says that he has passed \"credible information\" to the ICC that Pakistan's matches against India and Bangladesh in the 1999 World Cup were fixed. </p> <p> <strong>Sunday July 2</strong><br> The Sunday Telegraph reports that <strong>Hansie Cronje</strong> is looking for a lucrative publishing deal to give his version of his demise. <strong>Clive Rice</strong>, the Nottinghamshire coach and former South African all-rounder, is to broker a book deal with a British publisher. </p> <p>In the News of the World Cronje is said to have recruited <strong>Max Clifford</strong>, the PR guru, in an attempt to improve his image. </p> <p> <strong>Monday July 3</strong><br> A court in New Delhi issues a warrant for the arrest of <strong>Sanjay Chawla</strong>, the Indian bookmaker who is alleged to have instigated much of Cronje's wrongdoing. </p> <p><strong>Mohammad Nasir</strong>, the manager of the Pakistan team currently touring Sri Lanka, blames India for the current match-fixing scandal. \"All the bookies are from India,\" he says. \"They are the ones who are bringing the bad name to the game.\" </p> <p>The South Africans arrive in Sri Lanka for their first tour since the allegations broke. New captain <strong>Shaun Pollock</strong> rejects suggestions that the scandal will affect his team. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday July 4</strong><br> In New Delhi <strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> is questioned for nearly three hours by the special crime branch of the CBI. He is questioned about videotapes he submitted to the agency with conversations about match-fixing between players and administrators. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday July 5</strong><br> <strong>Ricky Ponting</strong> reveals that he was approached by a bookmaker three years ago. He says that he immediately informed ACB officials and \"that was as far as it went.\" When asked if the bookmaker was Indian, Ponting shakes his head. </p> <p>The CBI plan to question former Indian captain and TV commentator <strong>Ravi Shastri</strong>. Shastri had corroborated Manoj Prabhakar's claim that <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> attempted to bribe him to underperform in a Singer Cup match in 1994. </p> <p><strong>Thursday July 6</strong><br>Director of Operations <strong> Yawar Saeed</strong> says that the Pakistan Cricket Board is waiting to receive an ICC report on umpire <strong> Javed Akhtar</strong>, who was accused by Ali Bacher of match-fixing. \"When Akhtar officiated in the Leeds Test in 1998, he was representing the ICC and we can only hold an inquiry if we get the match referee's report from that particular Test. There is nothing against Akhtar and since he is a Pakistani, we have to clear the matter,\" says Saeed. </p> <p><strong> Friday July 7 </strong><br>The Board of Control for Cricket in India fax a letter of complaint to the PCB's Yawer Saeed, in response to comments from <strong> Mohammad Nasir</strong>, the manager of the Pakistan team in Sri Lanka. Nasir had blamed India and Indian bookmakers for the current match-fixing scandal.</p> <p><strong> Saturday July 8 </strong><br>PCB chairman <strong> Tauqir Zia </strong> phones Mohammad Nasir to express his \"unhappiness, anger and disappointment\" over Nasir's remarks.</p> <p>Nasir accuses the BCCI of overreacting: \"Doesn't everybody know that there are numerous bookies in India? What is the need to overreact like this? After all, isn't India the place where Cronje's conversations were recorded and the whole Pandora's box was opened?\"</p> <p><strong> Sunday July 9 </strong><br> <strong> Rashid Latif </strong> is reported in The Sunday Telegraph as saying that he rejected an offer of \u00a315,000 to ensure his side were dismissed for under 300 in the first innings of the Lord's Test of 1996. Latif was unbeaten at the close of the first day, when he received the proposition, with his side 290-9. They made 340. He also asserts his belief that England's last game in Sharjah before the 1999 World Cup was fixed. It was England's only victory of the tournament, in which they dismissed Pakistan for 144.</p> <p><strong>Sunday July 9</strong><br> <strong>Syed Kirmani</strong>, the former Indian wicket-keeper, says that various match-fixing enquiries are taking too long. \"They should see that the entire muck is cleaned and the sooner the better,\" he says.</p> <p>Satirical playwright <strong> Aldrin Naidu</strong> begins auditions for an actor to play Hansie Cronje in his play \"Vak-Hansie.\" Naidu says his play \"will lampoon the underworld of cricket.\"</p> <p><strong> Monday July 10 </strong><br> The Guardian reports that <strong> Hansie Cronje</strong> is to be invited as an unpaid guest lecturer in sports ethics at Pretoria University. A spokeswoman says that \"Mr Cronje could, as a community service, share his experience of temptation and corruption with students.\"</p> <p> <strong>Wednesday July 12</strong><br> <strong>Salim Malik</strong> says that he is \"fed up\" with match-fixing allegations against him. He demands that the PCB take action against <strong>Rashid Latif</strong> for his \"immature and childish\" statements, which are \"destroying\" him. Latif had told The Sunday Telegraph that Malik offered him 100,000 rupees to throw a one-day match in Christchurch in December 1995.</p> <p><strong>Kapil Dev</strong> meets Indian Sports Minister <strong>S S Dhindsa</strong> in New Delhi. The Indian coach urges Dhindsa to bring the match-fixing probe to its \"logical conclusion\" as quickly as possible, saying that the delay was troubling his players. </p> <p><strong>Thursday July 13</strong><br> <strong>Christopher Doig</strong>, chief executive of the New Zealand Cricket Board, reveals plans to prepare players to handle approaches from \"disreputable people.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday July 14</strong><br><strong> KC Mittal</strong>, an Indian government prosecutor involved in the Cronje case, is given special police protection after receiving death threats. After receiving a call saying he would be attacked in his chamber, Mittal is under 24-hour guard.</p> <p><strong> Steve Waugh</strong> calls for next month's Australia-South Africa ODI series to act as a fresh start for the game: \"I think people want some positive stuff out of cricket - they are always talking about bookmakers and bribery and have associated that with cricket.\"</p> <p>In a minor demonstration in <strong> Calcutta</strong> cricket fans praise Cronje's honesty. Up to 200 fans shout \"Hansie, we hate your actions but praise your confessions\" outside Eden Gardens. They also castigate \"Indian culprits\" who put forward \"false and fabricated counter-allegations.\"</p> <p><strong>Saturday July 15</strong><br><strong> General Tauqir Zia</strong>, chairman of the PCB, again criticises Mohammad Nasir, manager of the Pakistan team in Sri Lanka, for blaming India for the current match-fixing scandal. \"It was not in his domain to comment on India's state of affairs. They have conducted a judicial investigation and Pakistan accepts it\", says Zia.</p> <p><strong>Sunday July 16</strong> <br><strong> Hansie Cronje </strong> tells Channel 9's Sixty Minutes that <strong> Shane Warne </strong> and <strong> Mark Waugh </strong> were guilty of the same offence as him. \"They basically confessed to taking money from bookmakers...and it's exactly what I did in a lot of my dealings and it is wrong.\" </p> <p>Cronje also reveals that he considered suicide. \"I honestly struggled to eat and sleep...I could not find a building high enough to jump from but I really felt bad about what I did and I supposed that was the chicken way of getting away with it, to kill yourself.\"</p> <p><strong> Ajay Jadeja </strong> is questioned by the CBI's Special Crime Branch for over two hours. He denies any match-fixing links.</p> <p><strong> Monday July 17 </strong> <br>The BCCI drafts a code of conduct, under which any cricketer or umpire found guilty of match-fixing will be banned for life.</p> <p><strong> Tuesday July 18 </strong> <br>The ACB hosts an anti-corruption meeting in Melbourne. \"If we can find common ground to fight the problem, that will benefit all sports, not just cricket,\" says ACB chief executive <strong> Malcolm Speed</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday July 19</strong><br><strong>Hansie Cronje</strong> puts off a planned visit to Britain, fearing extradition by Indian police. Cronje was due to have discussions with <strong>Max Clifford</strong>.</p> <p>London publishers <strong>Collins Willow</strong> have apparently asked for a synopsis from Cronje, detailing any revelations he plans to come out with in his book. Cronje is said to have asked for a \u00a3250,000 advance.</p> <p>A <strong>PCB meeting</strong> decides that all its players should sign an undertaking that they will not take part in any match-fixing or gambling.</p> <p><strong>Thursday July 20</strong><br><strong>Indian income-tax officials</strong> raid the homes of various players and officials across the country, including <strong>Mohammad Azharuddin</strong> and <strong>Kapil Dev</strong>. \"We are looking for wealth or assets which have not been disclosed,\" said <strong>K.V.M. Pai</strong>, chief commissioner for income tax in Bombay.</p> <p><strong>Thursday July 20</strong><br> Former ICC President <strong>Jagmohan Dalmiya</strong> warns against a witch hunt following the tax raids in India. \"If the raids are part of an effort to cleanse cricket, then I welcome it wholeheartedly. But if it means witch hunting, then it is very regettable.\" </p> <p><strong> Friday July 21 </strong><br> The income-tax raids are completed in India. Officials say that they have evidence of undisclosed income against <strong> Mohammad Azharuddin</strong>, <strong> Ajay Jadeja </strong> and <strong> Kapil Dev</strong>. They are also said to have made findings implicating a number of bookmakers.</p> <p><strong> Manoj Prabhakar </strong> welcomes the raids as an attempt to \"sincerely clean the system\" and says that he has \"nothing to hide. Nothing to declare.\"</p> <p>Indian Sports Minister <strong> SS Dhindsa </strong> warns the BCCI that they \"should not think that the government cannot interfere in its working even if it commits mistakes.\"</p> <p>The <strong> King Commission </strong> is to resume on October 2, it is announced in South Africa. An interim report will be submitted to president <strong> Thabo Mbeki </strong> on August 11.</p> <p><strong>Saturday July 22</strong><br><strong> Dhananjaya Kumar</strong>, Indian Minister of State for Finance, reveals \"cogent evidence to prove the nexus in match-fixing for amassing this kind of wealth.\" He says it will take two months to complete proceedings. </p> <p>The <strong> King commission </strong> broadens its investigation to include the financial affairs of players involved in all the matches covered by its terms of reference. </p> <p><strong> Sunday July 23 </strong> <br><strong> Hansie Cronje </strong> tells the News of the World that he contemplated suicide. \"Yes, there were dark moments when I wondered whether it was still worth living. I would think, Hansie you have fallen so far anyway. A few more feet won't matter. But I have caused so much pain to my family already I could not put them through more.

      "bodyText": "Saturday July 1 CBI officials question Ali Irani, former physiotherapist of the Indian cricket team, for over three hours. This follows an alleged videotaped conversation between Irani and Manoj Prabhakar regarding match-fixing. Ali Bacher says that he has passed \"credible information\" to the ICC that Pakistan's matches against India and Bangladesh in the 1999 World Cup were fixed. Sunday July 2 The Sunday Telegraph reports that Hansie Cronje is looking for a lucrative publishing deal to give his version of his demise. Clive Rice, the Nottinghamshire coach and former South African all-rounder, is to broker a book deal with a British publisher. In the News of the World Cronje is said to have recruited Max Clifford, the PR guru, in an attempt to improve his image. Monday July 3 A court in New Delhi issues a warrant for the arrest of Sanjay Chawla, the Indian bookmaker who is alleged to have instigated much of Cronje's wrongdoing. Mohammad Nasir, the manager of the Pakistan team currently touring Sri Lanka, blames India for the current match-fixing scandal. \"All the bookies are from India,\" he says. \"They are the ones who are bringing the bad name to the game.\" The South Africans arrive in Sri Lanka for their first tour since the allegations broke. New captain Shaun Pollock rejects suggestions that the scandal will affect his team. Tuesday July 4 In New Delhi Manoj Prabhakar is questioned for nearly three hours by the special crime branch of the CBI. He is questioned about videotapes he submitted to the agency with conversations about match-fixing between players and administrators. Wednesday July 5 Ricky Ponting reveals that he was approached by a bookmaker three years ago. He says that he immediately informed ACB officials and \"that was as far as it went.\" When asked if the bookmaker was Indian, Ponting shakes his head. The CBI plan to question former Indian captain and TV commentator Ravi Shastri. Shastri had corroborated Manoj Prabhakar's claim that Kapil Dev attempted to bribe him to underperform in a Singer Cup match in 1994. Thursday July 6 Director of Operations Yawar Saeed says that the Pakistan Cricket Board is waiting to receive an ICC report on umpire Javed Akhtar, who was accused by Ali Bacher of match-fixing. \"When Akhtar officiated in the Leeds Test in 1998, he was representing the ICC and we can only hold an inquiry if we get the match referee's report from that particular Test. There is nothing against Akhtar and since he is a Pakistani, we have to clear the matter,\" says Saeed. Friday July 7 The Board of Control for Cricket in India fax a letter of complaint to the PCB's Yawer Saeed, in response to comments from Mohammad Nasir, the manager of the Pakistan team in Sri Lanka. Nasir had blamed India and Indian bookmakers for the current match-fixing scandal. Saturday July 8 PCB chairman Tauqir Zia phones Mohammad Nasir to express his \"unhappiness, anger and disappointment\" over Nasir's remarks. Nasir accuses the BCCI of overreacting: \"Doesn't everybody know that there are numerous bookies in India? What is the need to overreact like this? After all, isn't India the place where Cronje's conversations were recorded and the whole Pandora's box was opened?\" Sunday July 9 Rashid Latif is reported in The Sunday Telegraph as saying that he rejected an offer of \u00a315,000 to ensure his side were dismissed for under 300 in the first innings of the Lord's Test of 1996. Latif was unbeaten at the close of the first day, when he received the proposition, with his side 290-9. They made 340. He also asserts his belief that England's last game in Sharjah before the 1999 World Cup was fixed. It was England's only victory of the tournament, in which they dismissed Pakistan for 144. Sunday July 9 Syed Kirmani, the former Indian wicket-keeper, says that various match-fixing enquiries are taking too long. \"They should see that the entire muck is cleaned and the sooner the better,\" he says. Satirical playwright Aldrin Naidu begins auditions for an actor to play Hansie Cronje in his play \"Vak-Hansie.\" Naidu says his play \"will lampoon the underworld of cricket.\" Monday July 10 The Guardian reports that Hansie Cronje is to be invited as an unpaid guest lecturer in sports ethics at Pretoria University. A spokeswoman says that \"Mr Cronje could, as a community service, share his experience of temptation and corruption with students.\" Wednesday July 12 Salim Malik says that he is \"fed up\" with match-fixing allegations against him. He demands that the PCB take action against Rashid Latif for his \"immature and childish\" statements, which are \"destroying\" him. Latif had told The Sunday Telegraph that Malik offered him 100,000 rupees to throw a one-day match in Christchurch in December 1995. Kapil Dev meets Indian Sports Minister S S Dhindsa in New Delhi. The Indian coach urges Dhindsa to bring the match-fixing probe to its \"logical conclusion\" as quickly as possible, saying that the delay was troubling his players. Thursday July 13 Christopher Doig, chief executive of the New Zealand Cricket Board, reveals plans to prepare players to handle approaches from \"disreputable people.\" Friday July 14 KC Mittal, an Indian government prosecutor involved in the Cronje case, is given special police protection after receiving death threats. After receiving a call saying he would be attacked in his chamber, Mittal is under 24-hour guard. Steve Waugh calls for next month's Australia-South Africa ODI series to act as a fresh start for the game: \"I think people want some positive stuff out of cricket - they are always talking about bookmakers and bribery and have associated that with cricket.\" In a minor demonstration in Calcutta cricket fans praise Cronje's honesty. Up to 200 fans shout \"Hansie, we hate your actions but praise your confessions\" outside Eden Gardens. They also castigate \"Indian culprits\" who put forward \"false and fabricated counter-allegations.\" Saturday July 15 General Tauqir Zia, chairman of the PCB, again criticises Mohammad Nasir, manager of the Pakistan team in Sri Lanka, for blaming India for the current match-fixing scandal. \"It was not in his domain to comment on India's state of affairs. They have conducted a judicial investigation and Pakistan accepts it\", says Zia. Sunday July 16 Hansie Cronje tells Channel 9's Sixty Minutes that Shane Warne and Mark Waugh were guilty of the same offence as him. \"They basically confessed to taking money from bookmakers...and it's exactly what I did in a lot of my dealings and it is wrong.\" Cronje also reveals that he considered suicide. \"I honestly struggled to eat and sleep...I could not find a building high enough to jump from but I really felt bad about what I did and I supposed that was the chicken way of getting away with it, to kill yourself.\" Ajay Jadeja is questioned by the CBI's Special Crime Branch for over two hours. He denies any match-fixing links. Monday July 17 The BCCI drafts a code of conduct, under which any cricketer or umpire found guilty of match-fixing will be banned for life. Tuesday July 18 The ACB hosts an anti-corruption meeting in Melbourne. \"If we can find common ground to fight the problem, that will benefit all sports, not just cricket,\" says ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed. Wednesday July 19 Hansie Cronje puts off a planned visit to Britain, fearing extradition by Indian police. Cronje was due to have discussions with Max Clifford. London publishers Collins Willow have apparently asked for a synopsis from Cronje, detailing any revelations he plans to come out with in his book. Cronje is said to have asked for a \u00a3250,000 advance. A PCB meeting decides that all its players should sign an undertaking that they will not take part in any match-fixing or gambling. Thursday July 20 Indian income-tax officials raid the homes of various players and officials across the country, including Mohammad Azharuddin and Kapil Dev. \"We are looking for wealth or assets which have not been disclosed,\" said K.V.M. Pai, chief commissioner for income tax in Bombay. Thursday July 20 Former ICC President Jagmohan Dalmiya warns against a witch hunt following the tax raids in India. \"If the raids are part of an effort to cleanse cricket, then I welcome it wholeheartedly. But if it means witch hunting, then it is very regettable.\" Friday July 21 The income-tax raids are completed in India. Officials say that they have evidence of undisclosed income against Mohammad Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja and Kapil Dev. They are also said to have made findings implicating a number of bookmakers. Manoj Prabhakar welcomes the raids as an attempt to \"sincerely clean the system\" and says that he has \"nothing to hide. Nothing to declare.\" Indian Sports Minister SS Dhindsa warns the BCCI that they \"should not think that the government cannot interfere in its working even if it commits mistakes.\" The King Commission is to resume on October 2, it is announced in South Africa. An interim report will be submitted to president Thabo Mbeki on August 11. Saturday July 22 Dhananjaya Kumar, Indian Minister of State for Finance, reveals \"cogent evidence to prove the nexus in match-fixing for amassing this kind of wealth.\" He says it will take two months to complete proceedings. The King commission broadens its investigation to include the financial affairs of players involved in all the matches covered by its terms of reference. Sunday July 23 Hansie Cronje tells the News of the World that he contemplated suicide. \"Yes, there were dark moments when I wondered whether it was still worth living. I would think, Hansie you have fallen so far anyway. A few more feet won't matter. But I have caused so much pain to my family already I could not put them through more. Not that.\" Cronje also talks of his realisation that he would be caught. \"I knew the game was up the second I read the messgae on my mobile from the UCB saying that there were allegations that we'd thrown the one-day series in India. I knew that wasn't true but I realised...they would get to the bottom of it. He also refutes allegations that England's series-clinching win at Headingley in 1998 was fixed by umpire Javed Akhtar. \"Well, I never thought for a second there was anything strange. I was fuming because once again we had been unable to finish off England in England.\" Monday July 24 Four Corners, an Australian documentary programme, reveals that Mohammad Azharuddin has acquired assets of $50m from match-fixing. Vishwa Gupta, an Indian tax official, is quoted as saying that \"a very leading cricket player (who Four Corners name as Azharuddin)...had actually accrued [this wealth] through fixing matches.\" The programme also says that Indian police have known about match-fixing for 25 years, but have done nothing about it. Also on Four Corners, Imran Khan questions the honesty of Mark Waugh and Shane Warne: \"With hindsight it makes no sense...why would the bookies just give money to anyone for just giving a pitch report?\" Waugh and Warne had received $9,000 for information from an Indian bookmaker in 1994. Malcolm Speed, chief executive of the ACB, says that, in the absence of further evidence, there will be no further enquiry into the payments made to Waugh and Warne. In India, the Gujarat State government decides to remove a chapter on former Indian captain and current coach Kapil Dev from the Class X schools curriculum following allegations against him in the match fixing scandal. Tuesday July 25 Income-tax authorities in India begin opening the lockers of cricketers and administrators which were sealed during last week's raids. Wednesday July 26 PCB General Tauqir Zia announces that Pakistan cricketers will be watched in a bid to avert any match-fixing. \"As per Justice Qayyum's report we have decided to keep players under tight control and an official will keep a tight check on their activities on and off the field...The notable thing is that players will not be able to know who the man watching them is and he will accompany the team during home and away series.\" Mark Waugh offers to have his financial records scrutinised in an attempt to show he has been honest about his dealings with an Indian bookmaker in 1994. \"I've been through two inquiries, the Pakistan judicial inquiry and the (ACB's) O'Regan inquiry last year, and as far as I'm concerned that's plenty.\" Saturday July 29 SS Dhindsa, the Indian Sports Minister, promises that any player found guilty of match-fixing will lose any national honours or awards previously received. He says that no such action will be taken until CBI investigations are concluded. Sunday July 30 BCCI President AC Muthiah supports Dhindsa. \"We have decided, as a penalty for the guilty, that we'll erase all records and revoke the awards.\" The Johannesburg Sunday Times confirms reports that the services of Max Clifford have been enlisted by Hansie Cronje. His duties include brokering interviews, book deals and a possible film. Kirti Azad, the former Indian cricketer and a Rajya Sabha MP, describes the BCCI as the \"worst offender\" in the match-fixing scandal. He also says the Board has \"devalued the game and presided over the crass commercialisation and corruption.\" Monday July 31 The BCCI rejects SS Dhindsa's suggestion that those implicated in the match-fixing scandal, including coach Kapil Dev, Mohammad Azharuddin, and Ajay Jadeja, should be dropped until investigations are completed. \"We will not axe players unless they are proved guilty,\" says the Board's President AC Muthiah. Ali Bacher announces that a panel of legal experts will decide the future of Herschelle Gibbs, Henry Williams and Pieter Strydom next week, after Judge King submits his interim report.",

There are two crucial votes today in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and the fragile government headed by prime minister Ehud Barak depends on the outcome. 2. In the first vote, Shimon Peres, a Barak ally, former prime minister and the wily old fox of Israeli politics, was expected to become the eighth president of the state, a largely ceremonial role. But outsider Moshe Katsav was elected instead in a result which took everyone by surprise. 3. The second vote, on a motion of no confidence in the government, is much more problematic. It could lead to the fall of the \"soldier-prime minister\", whose fragile coalition commands just 42 votes out of 120 in the Knesset. 4. The main issue, as ever, is security. The Israeli right was shocked by the concessions Barak offered during this month's Camp David summit with Palestinian president Yasser Arafat, including a measure of shared sovereignty in Jerusalem, and the abandonment of at least some Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank. 5. David Levy, the perpetually petulant foreign minister, has threatened to resign unless Barak broadens his government to include the rightwing Likud faction. 6. Groomed for high office by Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who was assassinated for making peace with the Palestinians, Barak is a former army chief who believes passionately in the peace process, but is equally passionate about the security of the state.

Although he had suffered from cancer of the throat, he had continued valiantly in his formidable practice as a solicitor. This stubborn resolution was entirely in character. The old doorstep moan, \"Politicians? They're all in it for what they can get out of it!\" never applied to him.</p> <p>Bruce Douglas-Mann was the son of another solicitor, Leslie Douglas-Mann. He was educated at the Upper Canada School in Toronto and - after national service as a leading seaman in the navy - at Jesus College, Oxford 1948-51.</p> <p>He became a solicitor in 1954, and married Helen Tucker in 1955. For Labour, he unsuccessfully contested St Albans, 1964, Maldon, 1966 and was a councillor in Kensington and Chelsea 1962-68, before being elected at North Kensington in 1970. He was Labour's MP for Mitcham and Morden from 1974-82, and for the Social Democrats from January-May 1982.</p> <p>Had he chosen to apply his lucid grasp of finance and his unfoxable resolution in negotiations to the pursuit of money in those areas of the law profitable for that sort of thing, he could have strung millions on a thread. He chose instead to be a trade union lawyer, superbly on top of industrial accident and injury legislation and case law, a specialist in everything relating to housing and (a later development which amused him) in obscenity. Bruce briefed the barrister, John Mortimer, in the case over the film, Last Tango in Paris: that, together with the cases against D H Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, and the magazine Oz, sent the censor into muttering retreat.</p> <p>But he was happiest as solicitor to injured workmen. In any struggle with the solicitors of a company's insurers, to which he would be directed by a union (for an action nominally between victim and company), he was patient, and quite implacable. He was the first solicitor, in a period of mounting inflation, to have damages proofed against the retail price index, and he refused any solution which might diminish the client's settlement, persuading union and client that proper damages were won by meticulous trench warfare.</p> <p>He was always up to the last supplementary date on Kemp &amp; Kemp, the ever-adjusted bible of personal injury tariffs, and ready to stare out the opposition to the gates of the court; he set himself to grind the faces of the insurers. I was his inept clerk for 18 months and saw him in action, burning up vast amounts of work without fuss during a long day which usually ended with housing association or council or candidate's constituency work; he inspired admiration, and we started a friendship which lasted until his death.</p> <p>His chief weakness as a lawyer was that he had no great powers of advocacy. He was diffident, unflashy, but not fluent, and he never enjoyed court. And this carried over into his political career. He knew more about housing than all but a couple of MPs. He had worked strenuously with housing associations and knew inside-out the renting and enforcing hell hole of North Kensington. But politically, he was a first-rate product which never advertised. So though he had been elected for North Kensington in 1970, he was made minister of state for housing only in 1974.</p> <p>He was a hesitant, apologetic speaker but he knew the subject backwards. He served as chairman of the parliamentary party's housing and construction group throughout the second Wilson and Callaghan governments. When Norman St John-Stevas introduced select committees, he served as vice chairman of the one on the environment which took in housing.</p> <p>He could be a dangerous backbencher, and the famous George Cunningham amendment, which effectively blocked Scottish devolution in the late 70s, was an adaptation of his earlier work.</p> <p>The end of Douglas-Mann's political career was at one with his stubbornness and idealism. Depressed by the state into which the Labour party had got itself by the time of the Tony Benn challenge to Denis Healey for the deputy leadership, on the last day of the Brighton conference he brought back to his Sussex home for lunch the MPs John Grant and George Cunningham, and myself. Over a long, dark, edge-of-the-cliff conversation he was almost ready to join the others in signing up with the emerging Social Democrats. However, the SDP were overwhelmingly pro-European and Bruce had his reservations on that subject.</p> <p>He did cross the floor in January 1982, but insisted (to the acute embarrassment of his new leaders) that he must renew his mandate from the voters of Mitcham and Morden, who had elected him on the Labour ticket. The SDP should have done this out of self-interest on its own early high tide. But it was Bruce's bad luck to make this stand of principle at the time of Margaret Thatcher's triumphalism over the Falklands. He lost to Angela Rumbold and was much smirked over. He fought the general election of 1983, but gave up parliamentary ambitions, though he continued in SDP, then Liberal Democratic, politics.</p> <p>A well read man, an admirer of Bernard Shaw and Thomas Hardy, he served for 16 years from 1981 on the Arts Council committee for special funds, was an active member of Shelter (on its board since 1974) and was, above all, still the senior partner in the firm which he had founded.</p> <p>He was very fond of sailing and as a young man had been close to selection for the British Olympic canoeing team.</p> <p>Happy in marriage to Helen, who survives him with one son and a daughter, he overcame his vicissitudes by doing the worthwhile, interesting things he had always done.

The successful candidate must be elected by at least 61 politicians in the 120-seat parliament. If no candidate receives 61 votes in the first round, then more rounds are held until a candidate receives the required majority. If more than three rounds are held, then the candidate who receives the lowest number of votes in each round is disqualified. The president is the head of state and represents the state of Israel abroad and at home. The president's most important function is the ability to grant pardons and reduce the sentences of convicted criminals. He or she also receives diplomatic credentials, swears in judges and signs laws.",

If he survives, Mr, Barak will win a three-month reprieve to pursue a peace process that has angered the right and members of his cabinet. The talks have a target date of September 13 to reach a final deal that would resolve the issues of borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlers and - the most difficult of all - the status of Jerusalem.

The bid by Gavin Mellor, 29, was resisted by the home secretary, Jack Straw, whose lawyers argued a ruling in the prisoner's favour could lead to others, including child abusers, claiming the right to father children. Mr Justice Forbes, sitting in London, ruled Mr Straw's decision not to allow Mellor to donate sperm was rational and reasonable. Mellor had met his wife while he was in prison and the judge said: \"It was reasonable for the secretary of state to take into account the fact that Mr and Mrs Mellor's relationship has not been tested in normal conditions, and that its durability is thus uncertain.\" In the first case of its kind, David Pannick QC, appearing for Mellor, had argued the home office decision to deny the prisoner's request was \"unjustifiably paternalistic\". He said: \"The home secretary has many onerous responsibilities, but whether Mr and Mrs Mellor should bring a child into the world is a matter for them and not him.\" Mellor was given a mandatory life sentence in February 1995 for the killing of 71-year-old grandfather George Sims. He had been attacked as he walked home from a working men's club in Crewe, Cheshire. He met his wife, Tracey McColl, 25, while she was working as an administration officer at Gartree Prison in Leicestershire in January 1997. They fell in love and Ms McColl later told a newspaper how she and Mellor, now at Nottingham Prison and the father of a child from a previous relationship, had regularly made love during their courtship in jail. Ms McColl resigned from the prison service so the couple could marry in July 1997. The judge said that, given the age of Mrs Mellor, the evidence about the couple's health and dates for temporary leave and the expiry of Mellor's tariff in 2006, there was no reason to believe that the refusal of artificial insemination would prevent them having a child. Should problems develop, the matter would then be reconsidered. Mr Pannick had argued the home office's approach meant \"a substantial detriment to Mrs Mellor, who undoubtedly retains all of her civil rights\". Mellor had written to the prison authorities claiming a right to have a child under Article 12 of the European convention on human rights, which guaranteed the right to found a family. Mr Pannick had told the judge: \"To deny the prisoner the right to participate in the artificial insemination of his wife is no more lawful than to deny him the right to receive any other medical treatment.\" But Ms Dinah Rose, for the home secretary, said part of the punishment involved in imprisonment was the loss of freedom to associate with family members.",

      "bodyText": "Oliver Stone (pictured) is adapting another political conspiracy for the screen. New York's Daily News reports that the JFK and Nixon director is at work on a screenplay about a plot by rich Republicans to oust President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. \"The coup d'etat planned against President Roosevelt,\" writes Stone in a new book about his paranoid perspectives on history, \"has amazingly disappeared from the history books. You don't have to wonder why when you understand the power of the conspirators or the incredible ability of the media, which were then as now basically controlled by the establishment of this country, to vaporize the incident into the black hole of ridicule.\" The conspiracy allegedly involved a group of wealthy fat cats seeking to pay angry war veterans to march on Capitol Hill and oust the President from office. After a superficial investigation - the like of which Stone-watchers may recognise from JFK - a committee concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to support the charges. \"The incident was buried,\" Stone concludes, \"largely because Roosevelt himself was weathering a major storm and feared a revolution if these events were revealed.\"",

A class that she is teaching now includes two Angolans, a Nigerian, two students from Zaire, four East Europeans (ethnic Russians from Lithuania and Estonia), two Algerians, a Palestinian and an Iranian. The professional background of students also varies greatly. One teacher I met taught a class that included farmers, soldiers, doctors, construction workers, university teachers and an ex-government minister.</p> <p>This diversity causes problems at different levels. But most importantly it means that students are used to different styles of learning. Many refugees or asylum seekers have had poor or zero schooling. Others, especially from Eastern Europe, have a level of schooling that would put lots of Britons to shame. The first group favours a communicative approach with practical examples and role-plays. The second group demands systematic grammatical explanations. It can be very difficult to balance these needs.</p> <p>Refugee or asylum-seeker classes also tend to have far more students with special requirements than normal language-school classes. Sometimes these requirements are physical: a war-crippled Bosnian, for example, who cannot climb a set of stairs to get into the classroom. Sometimes they are psychological, the result of a difficult past.</p> <p>However, at other times these requirements relate specifically to language. For example, a student whose mother tongue is a Creole English that is almost unintelligible to a Briton, or another student who has never learnt to read, as her native language has no written form. Problems like these present real difficulties for teacher and student alike, and often the only way to deal with them is to spend extra time together before or after the lesson.</p> <p>Given the spectrum of backgrounds and needs found in an immigrant class, conventional textbooks are almost useless. They can be mined for exercises. But as the basis for a course they are definitely lacking. (Articles on buying a car, throwing a party or going on a honeymoon can leave students cold and bewildered.) It is often left to the teacher to produce his or her own material.</p> <p>So how do you go about designing a course? \"I believe in teaching them what they tell me they need,\" says Sally from Dublin. In her view the student's experience should determine the syllabus. For example, students say that they have to look for housing, to deal with abuse or to apply for jobs. The teacher can then recreate these circumstances in class or find exercises that relate to them. </p> <p>The average student responds very well to this approach, as his or her life is full of these kinds of problems. But, the word 'problems' points to another of the dimensions of working with refugees or asylum seekers. The teacher is often one of the few friendly figures in the life of a student that speaks English. As a result teachers can easily find themselves drawn into the refugee's world, writing letters to officialdom, visiting landlords and negotiating with the Social Services. It can be a rewarding, frustrating and extremely time-consuming experience.</p> <p>Most institutions offer few guidelines about teaching asylum seekers or refugees. One unspoken rule is that teachers should not ask too much about the past. Many students have come from extremely difficult situations in their own country that they might not want to discuss in a lesson. There is also the added need to be sensitive about potential conflicts within the class. I once asked two Romanians to describe their homeland only to find that one belonged to Transylvania's long-suffering Hungarian minority. They seemed to be talking (or at times shouting) about two very different countries. These kinds of problems are especially acute when a teacher has students from different ethnic communities in the Balkans and Central Africa.</p> <p>There are paid and voluntary jobs teaching asylum seekers and refugees. In Britain the Refugee Council or local education authorities and Learning and Skills Councils can all be contacted. In Ireland the main co-ordinator is the Irish Refugee Council.

The Sun reports that Blackburn manager Graeme Souness has offered \u00a33m for the versatile defender - but the paper reckons he may have to increase his bid to \u00a34m to get his man. And Titi Camara could also be on his way out of Anfield. Manchester City have registered an interest, reports Teamtalk - but they think Joe Royle won't be able to afford his \u00a330,000-a-week wages. But it's not all bad news, Liverpool fans - at least Christian Ziege looks like he's on his way. Bryan Robson will make a last ditch attempt to persuade the German defender to stay at Middlesbrough later today, but the Express says Ziege is likely to sign in a \u00a39m deal - not the \u00a35.5m that has been widely reported - later this week. Meanwhile, Steve McManaman has laughed off suggestions he's about to move to Middlesbrough. \"It's barmy,\" claimed McManaman. \"I'm not taking these reports seriously and I hope nobody else is. I'm very, very happy at Real Madrid. I love the club and the city, and I have a great contract. Why anyone would think I'd swap that for Middlesbrough I don't know.\" Charlton will sign Rangers' Finnish striker Jonatan Johansson in a \u00a33.5m deal later today. \"I see a figure of \u00a32.5m has been reported,\" said Rangers manager Dick Advocaat. \"Actually, it is \u00a31m more.\" Crystal Palace manager Steve Coppell wants to tempt Ian Wright out of retirement, according to the Sun. After suffering a 6-0 defeat at Millwall, Coppell said: \"The players have lost the will to fight. Wrighty is 36, but he loves playing. Having him around can only be a benefit.\"",

It is not recorded whether the officers in question greeted Button - as once a British policeman greeted the late Ayrton Senna when he was caught speeding in Oxfordshire - with the line: \"Who do you think you are? Nigel Mansell?\" It is known, however, that Button was given a \u00a3500 fine and, after enjoying a cup of coffee in the company of his arresting officers and signing a few autographs, was allowed on his way. </p> <p>Was this the first sign that a young sporting talent, exposed so early to the trappings of fame and success in a rich and glamorous sport, had begun to spend itself tragically in an orgy of wild living? More importantly, how did he get a diesel car to go that fast? </p> <p>Diesel is not, by anyone's reckoning, a glamour fuel. It is the stuff of lorries and taxis. Depress the accelerator in a diesel car and the car responds at some point in the middle of next week. Normally by slowing down. </p> <p>Reckless impetuosity is not diesel's thing. Diesel is all about ecologically sound decisions, such as decreased fuel consumption and reduced exhaust emissions. Driving at more than twice the speed limit is not supposed to occur in a diesel car. </p> <p>Indeed, the reason Button was driving a diesel in France is that, when he is abroad, his license permits him to drive nothing but diesels until he reaches the age of 21. Diesel is the Tizer to petrol's alcohol and was supposed to impose a restraint upon his youthful tendencies. The authorities reckoned without BMW. </p> <p>These days, in a small tribute to Jenson, perhaps, but also to the car's extraordinary powers, press models of the 330d come with a stern note attached, reminding you of your personal responsibility for any offences committed while in charge of the vehicle. This is because offences are more likely in a car that gets up to 60 while you are still fiddling with the CD player. Actually, though it's no slouch, acceleration from standing is not the 330d's strongest suit. Its best trick is accelerating at high speed - the extra power it allows you quick access to at, say, 70mph, when, with a little squeeze, you can burst past that iffy-looking lorry or leave that tiresome tail-gater receding in your mirror. This is a miracle: additional power at speed is no more of a feature of diesel motoring than wings are. </p> <p>How close I came to emulating Button's speed is, I feel, a matter between me, my conscience and the traffic cameras on the M25 between the M11 and A12 intersections. I would like to stress, however, that I did NOT take the car up as far as 143mph and if this leads to accusations of timidity, then I would point out that it's not open to all of us to placate policemen by offering to sign a few hats for their kids. </p> <p>The remarkable thing about the 330d is that it's a diesel which sounds and behaves like no diesel on earth. It is the world's first diesel in disguise. True, when you turn the key there is some hint of that familiar, rattling diesel tick-over, reminiscent of Hoppa buses and black cabs. But then you drive off and all is forgotten, the engine noise reduced to a low, petrol-like thrum. </p> <p>It's a great car - luxurious but also tightly sprung and sporty, so not remotely spongey. In the long- running BMW v Audi debate, I have tended to stand unflinchingly behind Audi, believing its cars to have more elegant shapes and fewer pimp overtones. The 330d threatens to spoil the argument. The low skirts and skimpy tyres seem to be aimed at the boy racer, upon whom BMW have always looked very kindly, but the boot and bonnet shapes come from somewhere much more cool and poised. </p> <p>In black it would be inestimably smart. Unfortunately, the car I drove came in a colour which BMW calls Arizona Sun Metallic, but which you know better as Terry's All Gold. It would be hard to imagine a worse colour for a car - maximum objectionableness and maximum profile in the same eye-watering package. The attempt to reflect the colour in the wooden trim of the interior - yielding a shade matching the contents of certain nappies - is misguided. </p> <p>Amazingly, it would cost you nearly \u00a31,000 extra to have the car painted this way, Arizona Sun Metallic being what BMW rightly calls an \"individual paint colour\". The world is upside-down.

An HM Inspectorate of Constabulary study of the way crime is recorded by police forces in England and Wales found that thousands of offences, including assaults and burglaries are being left out of official statistics. The report, which comes a fortnight after the government reported a 3.8% increase in the official crime rate last year, says inconsistencies and bureaucracy are the main causes of the inaccuracy. The official figures showed that a total of 5.3m offences were reported to police in the 12 months to March, compared with 5.1m in the previous year. There was a 16% increase in violent crimes, with the number of robberies rising 26.1% and the most serious cases of violence up 12.6%. The suggestion that actual crime levels are 20% higher than the official figures will add to the pressure on the home secretary, Jack Straw. The authors of the new report found that in too many instances, decisions on whether a crime had taken place were left to individual officers. They also said that there were too many differences between forces on the categories under which offences should be recorded. After the report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary was leaked earlier this month, police chiefs and ministers said they were committed to producing as accurate a picture of crime levels as possible. A consultation paper aimed at increasing consistency between forces will accompany the report when it is officially published today.

      "byline": "Simon Hattenstone",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I'm looking for a beautiful boy with a distant look and a heavy limp. I stare hopefully at someone who could be Benjamin Lebert - he looks like him and doesn't look like him. Slightly too spotty, and imperfect. He limps up to me and shakes my hand. </p> <p>Benjamin Lebert is a bestselling author. At 15, he started writing Crazy during weekends at home from boarding school. By the time he was 16 it had been published and today, at 18, he has sold more than 300,000 copies in Germany alone. Crazy is autobiographical. The lead character is called Benjamin Lebert, it is set in a boarding school outside Munich and tells the story of a 15-year-old boy paralysed down half his body. At the same time, it is a novel - the Benjamin Lebert of the book, like the photograph on the front, is both recognisable and different. His school friends are composites of different people, many of the incidents are made up. </p> <p>Crazy is a beautiful book about someone grasping freedom for the first time. </p> <p>Benjamin, the character, revels in his adolescent discovery - girls, drink, cigarettes. The book also captures a boy who is part of the world but always separate, forever marked out by his disability. </p> <p>Like Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye, the fictional Benjamin asks the biggest existential questions in the tiniest words. He decides life is pointless unless you're brave, unless you can face up to your daily demons. </p> <p>But he's still never sure what bravery actually is. At times, his school friends mock his tedious philosophical questing. \"Where did you come up with all this shit?\" they ask him. </p> <p>We're walking to a restaurant. Lebert is struggling a few paces behind me. In Crazy, he is always struggling a few paces behind his friends. He is talking about the ways in which the character is different from himself. \"He's braver. Some girls have an idea that I'm a powerful boy and I'm not powerful, I'm weak.\" </p> <p>After the book was published, many girls wrote to Lebert and poured their heart out. Some said they loved him, some said they wanted to sleep with him, show him a good time like Marie had done in the book. In Crazy, Benjamin's disability is almost envied by friends, it makes him different, and so cool. He says this was true of his year at boarding school, but at no other point in his life. </p> <p>Lebert was born with his umbilical cord around his neck. It starved him of oxygen, hence the paralysis. He ended up in boarding school because he'd flunked all the exams at all the other schools. \"I was a loser,\" he says. It was also part of his rehabilitation into the real world. </p> <p>\"Because I was disabled my mother always tried to protect me and hide me from the world.\" He knew it wasn't good for him, but he enjoyed hiding behind his doctor mother. Much of his childhood was painful - at earlier schools he had been teased, ridiculed. \"Cripple!\" his fellow pupils shrieked at him. Or, even worse, he was ignored. </p> <p>The last few years have been so much better, he says, but even now he has periods where he feels he's the unluckiest person in the world. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I feel very good and I say I'm different. Sometimes I like it, it's a part of me. But sometimes I say, 'Oh I'm so poor and I'm so different.' I feel sorry for myself.\" </p> <p>I order drinks and am surprised when he opts for a Coke. I offer him a cigarette and he refuses. \"I don't smoke.\" I was sure you smoked, I say. </p> <p>No, that is the Benjamin of the book. If Lebert doesn't eat and drink wisely his health will rapidly deteriorate. His phone rings. He flips it open with a deft flick of his teeth. He says you adapt, gain new strengths. </p> <p>Lebert started writing when he was nine or 10 - monster stories. The longer he wrote the simpler the words and sentences and stories became. Before long he found he was writing about himself and his experiences and losing himself in his fictive universe. \"You can invent your own world. There's a kind of purity . . . you have to be very honest and very close to yourself.\" </p> <p>I ask him what his favourite bit of the book is, and without hesitation he mentions the scene in the toilet when he loses his virginity. \"It was terrific fun to write,\" he says with a squeaky giggle. A drunk girl, Marie, takes him off to the toilet. She silently lifts off her dress, places herself on top and rides him to a convulsive ecstacy. She dresses and walks off without a word. </p> <p>I was amazed that a 16-year- old could write so tenderly and so erotically, and tell him I phoned the publisher Hamish Hamilton to ask if Crazy was a hoax. </p> <p>Lebert says many people in Germany have suggested that the book was actually written by his journalist father. \"That made me angry,\" he says. \"I mean really angry. People are always so sceptical, I don't like it.\" He's a wonderful mix of excessive politeness (\"How is your pizza?\" \"To your health\") and seething impatience, doe-eyed idealism and street-wise cynicism. </p> <p>Lebert says he adapted the sex scene from life. Did she really walk off like that? Pretty much, so he says. I say that's sad. \"Yes, but also kind of beautiful,\" he says. More perfect? He shudders and says he hates the word perfect, hates the very concept of perfection. Suddenly, he's talking about the politics of cloning and there's no stopping him. \"They try to make everything perfect, especially with the cloning and stuff. There will be a brave new world, and I'm really frightened of it.\" He says what scares him most is the idea that you could choose your body like you choose a computer program. </p> <p>And that's not the way the world or nature was meant to work. \"Human beings are different. Some have big noses, some have big ears, and some have big breasts, and that's life. I hate MTV. When I look at MTV I get really upset because everybody seems so happy, and everyone seems so beautiful, dancing, but it's just sick, and no one seems to recognise it. It's going in the same direction as the Nazi thing that there must be a beautiful race . . .\" </p> <p>If gene therapy could have stopped him being paralysed . . . He interrupts my question. \"I wouldn't have done it, you know, because it's me.\" </p> <p>He asks me how my pizza is, and thanks me for taking him out to lunch. He says there are so many beautiful things in the world, why would people ever be mad enough to strive for perfection. </p> <p>Have his boarding school friends enjoyed his success? \"No, they are very angry.\" Why? \"Some are angry because of what is not true, some are angry because of what is true.\" He says they cannot accept that Crazy is a novel based on experience. \"I'm not friends with them any more, but they are not exactly like they are in the book.\" Characters such as Florian aka Girl and his hero, Janosch, are hand-crafted, the type of friends all of us would like. </p> <p>A while ago documentary-makers returned to Lebert's old school and asked the teachers about him. Did they say that they always knew he had it in him to be a successful writer? \"No. They said I was a loser. I was a loser.\" He smiles, and thinks about it. \"But I feel in some way everyone is not a loser. Everyone is brave in some way.\" </p> <p>And he limps back to his chauffeur-driven Mercedes. </p> <p>\u0095 Crazy, published by Hamish Hamilton, priced \u00a39.99.</p>",

By the time he was 16 it had been published and today, at 18, he has sold more than 300,000 copies in Germany alone. Crazy is autobiographical. The lead character is called Benjamin Lebert, it is set in a boarding school outside Munich and tells the story of a 15-year-old boy paralysed down half his body. At the same time, it is a novel - the Benjamin Lebert of the book, like the photograph on the front, is both recognisable and different. His school friends are composites of different people, many of the incidents are made up. Crazy is a beautiful book about someone grasping freedom for the first time. Benjamin, the character, revels in his adolescent discovery - girls, drink, cigarettes. The book also captures a boy who is part of the world but always separate, forever marked out by his disability. Like Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye, the fictional Benjamin asks the biggest existential questions in the tiniest words. He decides life is pointless unless you're brave, unless you can face up to your daily demons. But he's still never sure what bravery actually is. At times, his school friends mock his tedious philosophical questing. \"Where did you come up with all this shit?\" they ask him. We're walking to a restaurant. Lebert is struggling a few paces behind me. In Crazy, he is always struggling a few paces behind his friends. He is talking about the ways in which the character is different from himself. \"He's braver. Some girls have an idea that I'm a powerful boy and I'm not powerful, I'm weak.\" After the book was published, many girls wrote to Lebert and poured their heart out. Some said they loved him, some said they wanted to sleep with him, show him a good time like Marie had done in the book. In Crazy, Benjamin's disability is almost envied by friends, it makes him different, and so cool. He says this was true of his year at boarding school, but at no other point in his life. Lebert was born with his umbilical cord around his neck. It starved him of oxygen, hence the paralysis. He ended up in boarding school because he'd flunked all the exams at all the other schools. \"I was a loser,\" he says. It was also part of his rehabilitation into the real world. \"Because I was disabled my mother always tried to protect me and hide me from the world.\" He knew it wasn't good for him, but he enjoyed hiding behind his doctor mother. Much of his childhood was painful - at earlier schools he had been teased, ridiculed. \"Cripple!\" his fellow pupils shrieked at him. Or, even worse, he was ignored. The last few years have been so much better, he says, but even now he has periods where he feels he's the unluckiest person in the world. \"Sometimes I feel very good and I say I'm different. Sometimes I like it, it's a part of me. But sometimes I say, 'Oh I'm so poor and I'm so different.' I feel sorry for myself.\" I order drinks and am surprised when he opts for a Coke. I offer him a cigarette and he refuses. \"I don't smoke.\" I was sure you smoked, I say. No, that is the Benjamin of the book. If Lebert doesn't eat and drink wisely his health will rapidly deteriorate. His phone rings. He flips it open with a deft flick of his teeth. He says you adapt, gain new strengths. Lebert started writing when he was nine or 10 - monster stories. The longer he wrote the simpler the words and sentences and stories became. Before long he found he was writing about himself and his experiences and losing himself in his fictive universe. \"You can invent your own world. There's a kind of purity . . . you have to be very honest and very close to yourself.\" I ask him what his favourite bit of the book is, and without hesitation he mentions the scene in the toilet when he loses his virginity. \"It was terrific fun to write,\" he says with a squeaky giggle. A drunk girl, Marie, takes him off to the toilet. She silently lifts off her dress, places herself on top and rides him to a convulsive ecstacy. She dresses and walks off without a word. I was amazed that a 16-year- old could write so tenderly and so erotically, and tell him I phoned the publisher Hamish Hamilton to ask if Crazy was a hoax. Lebert says many people in Germany have suggested that the book was actually written by his journalist father. \"That made me angry,\" he says. \"I mean really angry. People are always so sceptical, I don't like it.\" He's a wonderful mix of excessive politeness (\"How is your pizza?\" \"To your health\") and seething impatience, doe-eyed idealism and street-wise cynicism. Lebert says he adapted the sex scene from life. Did she really walk off like that? Pretty much, so he says. I say that's sad. \"Yes, but also kind of beautiful,\" he says. More perfect? He shudders and says he hates the word perfect, hates the very concept of perfection. Suddenly, he's talking about the politics of cloning and there's no stopping him. \"They try to make everything perfect, especially with the cloning and stuff. There will be a brave new world, and I'm really frightened of it.\" He says what scares him most is the idea that you could choose your body like you choose a computer program. And that's not the way the world or nature was meant to work. \"Human beings are different. Some have big noses, some have big ears, and some have big breasts, and that's life. I hate MTV. When I look at MTV I get really upset because everybody seems so happy, and everyone seems so beautiful, dancing, but it's just sick, and no one seems to recognise it. It's going in the same direction as the Nazi thing that there must be a beautiful race . . .\" If gene therapy could have stopped him being paralysed . . . He interrupts my question. \"I wouldn't have done it, you know, because it's me.\" He asks me how my pizza is, and thanks me for taking him out to lunch. He says there are so many beautiful things in the world, why would people ever be mad enough to strive for perfection. Have his boarding school friends enjoyed his success? \"No, they are very angry.\" Why? \"Some are angry because of what is not true, some are angry because of what is true.\" He says they cannot accept that Crazy is a novel based on experience. \"I'm not friends with them any more, but they are not exactly like they are in the book.\" Characters such as Florian aka Girl and his hero, Janosch, are hand-crafted, the type of friends all of us would like. A while ago documentary-makers returned to Lebert's old school and asked the teachers about him. Did they say that they always knew he had it in him to be a successful writer? \"No. They said I was a loser. I was a loser.\" He smiles, and thinks about it. \"But I feel in some way everyone is not a loser. Everyone is brave in some way.\" And he limps back to his chauffeur-driven Mercedes. \u0095 Crazy, published by Hamish Hamilton, priced \u00a39.99.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Britain would be able to join the euro safely only if it devalued sterling by at least 10% and held a referendum within 18 months of an election, an independent commission has concluded. </p> <p>The commission includes former members of the Treasury, IMF and the Bank of England monetary policy committee. It suggests a series of parallel steps be taken before the referendum, including opening talks with European finance ministers on sterling's exchange rate - recommending entry at between 1.25 and 1.45 euros to the pound. </p> <p>The study is due to be published next month at the start of the party conference season, and will put fresh pressure on Tony Blair to set out his plans for the euro at the election. </p> <p>Ministers have agreed a pact not to discuss the economic case for the euro until after the election, promising simply to make an assessment on whether Britain has sustainably converged with the European economies. That position was criticised yesterday by Lord Haskins, the businessman and Labour peer, for showing a lack of leadership. </p> <p>The study, now in its final draft, is the most detailed attempt yet to set out a timetable to get Britain ready to join the euro and prevent destabilising speculation in the markets. </p> <p>It concludes that a referendum must be held by the autumn of 2002, assuming a May 2001 election, to ensure British membership is completed and irreversible by the time of the subsequent election. </p> <p>The study warns that the markets would not respond well, or cooperate in the necessary gradual devaluation of sterling, if a realistic political chance remained of the Conservatives going into the subsequent election on a ticket of \"the last chance to save sterling\". </p> <p>The study has been commissioned by the Liberal Democrats and was chaired by Chris Huhne, the economist and Liberal Democrat MEP. </p> <p>However, the quality and independence of the commission's membership will take its conclusions above the level of party politics. Members include Marcus Miller, on the Treasury's academic panel, Lionel Price, former head of the international division at the Bank of England, and David Peretz, a senior adviser at the World Bank and formerly deputy director of inter national finance at the Treasury. Other members include the monetary policy committee member Willem Buiter, exchange rate specialist John Williamson, and Martin Weale, a director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. </p> <p>The group concludes that convergence will be \"well nigh perfect soon after the election\" since the amount of spare capacities in the British and European economies will be very similar. It argues that, before a referendum, ministers will need to open negotiations with the European Central Bank on the terms of sterling's entry into the euro, including the likely exchange rate and prospects for getting ECB intervention in the markets to ease entry.

      "bodyText": "Britain would be able to join the euro safely only if it devalued sterling by at least 10% and held a referendum within 18 months of an election, an independent commission has concluded. The commission includes former members of the Treasury, IMF and the Bank of England monetary policy committee. It suggests a series of parallel steps be taken before the referendum, including opening talks with European finance ministers on sterling's exchange rate - recommending entry at between 1.25 and 1.45 euros to the pound. The study is due to be published next month at the start of the party conference season, and will put fresh pressure on Tony Blair to set out his plans for the euro at the election. Ministers have agreed a pact not to discuss the economic case for the euro until after the election, promising simply to make an assessment on whether Britain has sustainably converged with the European economies. That position was criticised yesterday by Lord Haskins, the businessman and Labour peer, for showing a lack of leadership. The study, now in its final draft, is the most detailed attempt yet to set out a timetable to get Britain ready to join the euro and prevent destabilising speculation in the markets. It concludes that a referendum must be held by the autumn of 2002, assuming a May 2001 election, to ensure British membership is completed and irreversible by the time of the subsequent election. The study warns that the markets would not respond well, or cooperate in the necessary gradual devaluation of sterling, if a realistic political chance remained of the Conservatives going into the subsequent election on a ticket of \"the last chance to save sterling\". The study has been commissioned by the Liberal Democrats and was chaired by Chris Huhne, the economist and Liberal Democrat MEP. However, the quality and independence of the commission's membership will take its conclusions above the level of party politics. Members include Marcus Miller, on the Treasury's academic panel, Lionel Price, former head of the international division at the Bank of England, and David Peretz, a senior adviser at the World Bank and formerly deputy director of inter national finance at the Treasury. Other members include the monetary policy committee member Willem Buiter, exchange rate specialist John Williamson, and Martin Weale, a director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The group concludes that convergence will be \"well nigh perfect soon after the election\" since the amount of spare capacities in the British and European economies will be very similar. It argues that, before a referendum, ministers will need to open negotiations with the European Central Bank on the terms of sterling's entry into the euro, including the likely exchange rate and prospects for getting ECB intervention in the markets to ease entry. The study further says that it might be possible for Britain to win formal dispensation from the treaty requirement to join the European exchange rate mechanism for two years; however, it suggests, if Britain did choose not to join, it might have to pay a negotiating price. Before the referendum, the study recommends, the Treasury should publish a new draft transitional mandate for the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, so that it no longer followed merely a domestically set inflation target. The Bank of England, to conform with the law inside the euro zone, would also need to change its legal status to be made more independent of the government. At present the chancellor retains the power to override the committee, including its membership and terms of reference. The single biggest step the government could take to bring about convergence with the euro, says the study, is to bring down the exchange rate by lowering sterling against the Deutschmark, which would also increase British competitiveness. The study concludes that the lowering of sterling would be best achieved by politicians making it clear to the markets that they were seriously determined to join the euro. Opening negotiations with Brussels to agree on a rate would be a key step. \"The greater the likelihood of EMU membership injected into the public domain before a decision, the easier it will be to get the exchange rate down,\" a member of the study team said. Previous academic assessments have suggested a rate of DM2.10 to DM2.78. The study will propose a rate below DM2.80 and above DM2.40. The current rate is DM3.17.",

In an era when cappuccino-swigging twentysomething techies have replaced horny-handed desert farmers as the new heros of Zionism, the agency is finding it can no longer replenish its ranks. Its reputation for toughness and panache badly shaken by a series of bungles, Mossad can no longer make do with making discreet approaches to likely candidates or placing vaguely worded advertisements through front companies. The agency said yesterday that it was launching its first public recruitment campaign, offering graduates aged 25-35 the chance of a \"thrilling career\" while serving the nation. \"Only you, in your heart of hearts, know that you are capable of much more, to think differently, to do more than you thought you could,\" says the advertisement, which was posted on the Hebrew version of the website for the prime minister's office yesterday. \"We offer you a future and a horizon of service in a field in which you will be able to contribute to what is dear to all of us.\" Candidates are invited to fax a freephone number with their curriculum vitae and Israeli identity-card number. Mossad's reputation was boosted in 1960 when it kidnapped Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi who masterminded the annihilation of Europe's Jews, from his hideout in Buenos Aires and brought him to Israel to stand trial. In 1986 the agency staged another coup when a blonde agent identified only as Cindy lured nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu away from London to Italy for a holiday. He was drugged and returned to Israel to be tried for exposing the country's secret nuclear programme to the Sunday Times. The advertisements are intended to counter the hi-tech boom that is siphoning off the best of a new generation, more concerned with material success than Zionist idealism. Mossad also plans to scour the ranks of graduates and send out postal solicitations to those it considers suitable. Applicants for the dozens of field intelligence officer posts on offer should be independent, creative, highly motivated and intelligent, and demonstrate resourcefulness and an ability to perform well under pressure, the ad says, warning: \"Mossad is opening - but not for everyone.\" The new recruitment method, which brings Mossad into line with the more open approach of the CIA and MI5, is a result of serious manpower shortages in all areas. \"We have more need of secret agents than ever, because of the dangers that threaten us,\" an ex-Mossad chief, Yitzhak Hofi, said. \"But we face relentless competition from the world of hi-tech.\" The malaise is also affecting Israel's army, which has seen a drop in teenagers seeking to perform their compulsory military duty in elite army units, and a rise in the number of reservists seeking to wriggle out of their annual stint of service.

      "bodyText": "Pressure is intensifying on Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, to order an investigation into British American Tobacco, with the publication today of internal documents detailing how the company exploited smuggling in Africa. The London-based corporation's memos disclose how it benefited from black marketeering in a concerted drive to boost sales. One note records discussions over a proposed deal with a businessman who \"would disguise the cigarette importations by calling the shipment something else, eg matches\" to beat restrictions in Niger. Another intermediary, targeting north Cameroon and Chad, was sold 300 cartons which was all his truck could carry \"taking into account the other merchandise which will 'hide' the cigarettes\". The BAT letters dating up to the mid-1990s were obtained by the Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) anti-tobacco campaign after a trawl of the firm's Guildford archive, opened to the public as part of a settlement last year to a health lawsuit in the US. Evidence of BAT's activities in Africa will trigger further demands for Mr Byers to approve an official Whitehall inquiry into the company. The all-party Commons health committee unanimously called for an investigation last month after the Guardian revealed how BAT exploited smuggling in South America and Asia. The European commission announced last week that it would act against unnamed tobacco companies to recover tax losses from smuggling. Yussuf Saloojee, of the South Africa-based National Council Against Smoking, said last night: \"We are pressing African governments to launch criminal investigations into BAT and its involvement in cigarette smoking. \"The days when they can march in with their colonial arrogance and treat Africa like some lawless frontier are over. \"Africa has enough problems without multinational corporations undermining the stability of our governments and national policies.\" Mr Byers is known to favour a British inquiry but some Department of Trade and Industry officials are believed to be warning that a formal inspection could prove expensive and lengthy. Lawyers in London and New York have also been appointed by BAT to prepare possible defences, and an internal inquiry was launched. A company spokeswoman yesterday declined to discuss specific allegations raised by the latest memos. \"We do not condone or collude with smugglers,\" she said. The BAT memo on Niger referred to a meeting in the firm's Woking offices on July 1987; the translated north Cameroon-Chad note was dated February 1988. Others uncovered by Ash include accounts of so-called \"umbrella operations\" under which advertising is used to promote limited legal sales and cover much bigger smuggling operations. Complaints that smugglers preferred to handle a rival's products because they were cheaper are also aired in one of the documents. Clive Bates, director of Ash, said: \"Every week that goes by, the evidence is piling up higher.\" Jenny Tonge, the Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on international development, said last night: \"We need an inquiry to get to the bottom of what has been going on.\"",

A Home Office spokesman said only one of the 30 was claiming political asylum. The men, believed to be from Bangladesh, were aged between their late teens and mid-40s. The spokesman said six had left Britain yesterday and 23 were to be taken to France tomorrow. \"None of the men was injured in the incident and they were all taken straight to police stations,\" he added. \"The main thing is they are on their way back.\" Last month 58 Chinese nationals were found dead in a lorry at the ferry port in Dover. An inquest heard that the dead had suffocated, and that a vent that might have saved their lives was closed. Seven Dutch nationals were charged with manslaughter. Mr Lee was charged with 28 counts of facilitation - illegally bringing people into the country - and was bailed to appear before Folkestone magistrates on Friday.",

Senior ministers have been told it is increasingly likely they will be not be able to clear the massive backlog of legislation through the Lords this session and that a major bill looks likely to be sacrificed. The countryside bill is already the subject of more than 300 amendments from Conservative peers and landowners who are determined to restrict access. Some ministers now believe a fight with landowners could be the right issue to revive the electorate's appetite for further reform of the Lords. They are preparing to mount a pre-election campaign attacking the continuing dominance of the landowning classes in an only partially reformed House of Lords. But both the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the environment minister, Michael Meacher, are strongly opposed to sacrificing the legislation, which contains key manifesto commitments. It is known that Lady Young of Old Scone, the chairman of English Nature, is increasingly worried the bill might be lost due to pressure of time. Lady Young warned last week that the bill \"must not become a battleground for wider matters of town versus country, or simply spoiling tactics which jeopardise the bill's passage and risk sinking the first decent wildlife legislation for 20 years\". Friends of the Earth also warned last night that the bill was in jeopardy. Matt Phillips of FoE said environmental groups would be mounting a sustained campaign through the summer to persuade the government not to jettison the bill. Mr Phillips stressed that wildlife groups with more than 6m supporters were determined to see the highly complex bill on to the statute book. He said there was every sign that some Tory backwoodsmen were planning to wreck the bill by tabling nonsensical amendments such as a ban on glue-sniffing on the land. More serious amendments have been tabled, designed to restrict the kinds of land available to ramblers, as well as prevent rambling by night. Some peers have already described the bill as a criminal's charter. Landowners are also seeking requirements on ramblers to keep dogs permanently on leads, and rights to compensation for landowners. Planned detailed consideration of the bill has been delayed until after the summer recess due to the pressure of business, including the suddenly announced football hooligan bill. In a bruising final day before the summer recess, ministers were forced to make repeated concessions to keep the government's legislative timetable vaguely on course. Ministers recognise that even with the early return of the Lords on September 27, it will be extremely difficult to steer through more than five major bills still in the upper house in time for the Queen's speech and the opening in November of what could turn out to be this government's final parliamentary session. The government feels it cannot afford to jettison other bills such as the political parties and elections and referendums bill, which will set a campaign limit on election spending by parties. The Freedom of Information Act is also seen as indispensable, even if it is subject to a growing list of amendments from Tories and Liberal Democrats.

Giorgio Stabile, a professor of the history of science at La Sapienza University, claims to have stumbled on the earliest known example of the symbol's use, as an indication of a measure of weight or volume. He said the @ sign represented an amphora, a measure of capacity based on the terracotta jars used to transport grain and liquid in the ancient Mediterranean world. The first known instance of its use, he said, occurred in a letter written by a Florentine merchant on May 4, 1536. Sent from Seville to Rome by a trader called Francesco Lapi, the document describes the arrival in Spain of three ships bearing treasure from Latin America. \"There, an amphora of wine, which is one thirtieth of a barrel, is worth 70 or 80 ducats,\" Mr Lapi informs his correspondent, representing the amphora with the now familiar symbol of an \"a\" wrapped in its own tail. The Spanish word for the @ sign, arroba , also indicates a weight or measure, which was equivalent, at the end of the 16th century, to 11.3kg (25 lb) or 22.7 litres (six gallons). \"Until now no one knew that the @ sign derived from this symbol, which was developed by Italian traders in a mercantile script they created between the middle ages and the renaissance,\" Prof Stabile said. \"The loop around the 'a' is typical of that merchant script.\" The professor unearthed the ancient symbol in the course of research for a visual history of the 20th century, to be published by the Treccani Encyclopedia. He said the sign, known to modern Italian cybernauts as la chiocciola (the snail), had made its way along trade routes to northern Europe where it took on its contemporary accountancy meaning: \"at the price of\". Having hopped on to English typewriter keyboards in the early 20th century, it was selected as a rarely used symbol to separate user names from domain addresses by the American internet engineer Ray Tomlinson. Prof Stabile believes that Italian banks may possess even earlier documents bearing the symbol lying forgotten in their archives. \"The oldest example could be of great value. It could be used for publicity purposes and to enhance the prestige of the institution that owned it,\" he said. Internet users of various tongues have adopted metaphors ranging from an elephant's trunk to a monkey's tail and even a cinnamon roll to describe the now ubiquitous squiggle.

But with John [Hahn] we now have the best telecoms team in Europe.\" Providence Equity, which first opened an office in London last year, is one of dozens of private equity and venture capital groups lured across the Atlantic by privatisation and liberalisation, but is one of few to specialise in technology, particularly telecoms. Salem says Providence Equity will focus on start-up businesses where the main challenge is to find human, not financial capital. \"John will play a key role here because he knows everyone in the industry,\" Salem said. Providence Equity claims to have been successful in all but one of the 52 companies in which it has invested more than $2bn since it opened for business in the early 1990s. \u0095 Germany's telecoms regulator expects only four bidders to win third generation mobile phone licences at the end of the German auction starting today, according to German newspaper reported. \"It's quite possible that we'll have four bidders in the end taking over three blocks of frequency each,\" Klaus-Dieter Scheurle was quoted as saying.",

But in the past few giddy months since the no-budget little Irish comedy Stones in His Pockets opened without fanfare in the West End, a procession of Hollywood's finest have beaten a path to their dressing room door at the New Ambassadors theatre. Hanks was followed by Dustin Hoffman, Calista Flockhart, Tracey Ullman, Roger Moore and, in the past few days, by Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft. When Kevin Spacey arrived in London last week, he declared: \"I've got to see these guys, everybody is talking about them.\" Stones in His Pockets is the sort of play that actors dream of - the one that will catapult them from provincial obscurity to fame - the single bravura performance that can make a career but which rarely happens these days in a West End dominated by the bankable and the bland.

      "body": "<p>The Pentagon flirted openly with the Republican party yesterday by staging a military trade show less than a mile from the party's National Convention which opens in Philadelphia today.</p> <p>The Democrats angrily claimed that the move was a breach of policy separating politics and the military.</p> <p>The arms exhibition was held at Philadelphia's naval shipyards. Only Republican party members and their guests were admitted to view a range of equipment which included the revolutionary but troubled V-22 helicopter-plane hybrid and equipment used by marine chemical- and biological-attack response teams. Journalists were barred at the gates by uniformed and plainclothes policemen.</p> <p>Democrats demanded to know how much public money had been spent on staging the event at a time when 6,300 US troops receive so little income they they are on food stamp support. The critics scoffed at the Pentagon's claims that the arms show was not part of the actual party convention.</p> <p>\"It is something that's contemporaneous with the Republican National Convention,\" the defence department spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, argued. \"It's not adjacent - it's not right on the grounds where the convention is being held. It's nearby, but not on the grounds.\"</p> <p>Ike Skelton, the most senior Democrat on the House Armed Services committee, said that argument was \"a difficult distinction for many people to make... There is no event in American politics more partisan than a national political convention\".</p> <p>The exhibition marks the first time the Pentagon has appeared alongside the giants of corporate America at a party convention and brings into the open a long-running relationship of lobbying and influence-brokering.</p> <p>The presence of the V-22 Osprey is a vivid example. The controversial aircraft, with tilting rotors allowing fast vertical and horizontal flight, has crashed three times in the past decade. But the US Marine Corps has succeeded in keeping the programme going despite fierce congressional opposition to its high cost and dubious safety record.</p> <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential contender, tried to kill the project when he was defence secretary under President Bush, his new boss's father. The V-22's appearance in Philadelphia could be interpreted as a not-so-gentle reminder from the Pentagon that, in matters deemed to involve national security, the politicians do not always get their way.</p> <p>The marines also rolled out an amphibious vehicle and anti-chemical and biological warfare equipment.

      "bodyText": "The Pentagon flirted openly with the Republican party yesterday by staging a military trade show less than a mile from the party's National Convention which opens in Philadelphia today. The Democrats angrily claimed that the move was a breach of policy separating politics and the military. The arms exhibition was held at Philadelphia's naval shipyards. Only Republican party members and their guests were admitted to view a range of equipment which included the revolutionary but troubled V-22 helicopter-plane hybrid and equipment used by marine chemical- and biological-attack response teams. Journalists were barred at the gates by uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Democrats demanded to know how much public money had been spent on staging the event at a time when 6,300 US troops receive so little income they they are on food stamp support. The critics scoffed at the Pentagon's claims that the arms show was not part of the actual party convention. \"It is something that's contemporaneous with the Republican National Convention,\" the defence department spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, argued. \"It's not adjacent - it's not right on the grounds where the convention is being held. It's nearby, but not on the grounds.\" Ike Skelton, the most senior Democrat on the House Armed Services committee, said that argument was \"a difficult distinction for many people to make... There is no event in American politics more partisan than a national political convention\". The exhibition marks the first time the Pentagon has appeared alongside the giants of corporate America at a party convention and brings into the open a long-running relationship of lobbying and influence-brokering. The presence of the V-22 Osprey is a vivid example. The controversial aircraft, with tilting rotors allowing fast vertical and horizontal flight, has crashed three times in the past decade. But the US Marine Corps has succeeded in keeping the programme going despite fierce congressional opposition to its high cost and dubious safety record. Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential contender, tried to kill the project when he was defence secretary under President Bush, his new boss's father. The V-22's appearance in Philadelphia could be interpreted as a not-so-gentle reminder from the Pentagon that, in matters deemed to involve national security, the politicians do not always get their way. The marines also rolled out an amphibious vehicle and anti-chemical and biological warfare equipment. The air force sent its unmanned surveillance aircraft, the Predator, while the army sent an Apache attack helicopter and a tactical missile defence system. Charles Lewis, the head of the Washington-based Centre for Public Integrity, described the juxtaposition of soldiers and party delegates as \"awkward\". The ban on such mingling has been a matter of precedent and policy rather than the law, but Mr Lewis argued: \"If there isn't a rule against this, it seems to me there ought to be.\" The defence secretary, William Cohen, yesterday defended the decision to hold the arms show. He said it had the backing of two Philadelphia Democrats, a congressman, Robert Brady, and the city's mayor, John Street.

From their seats on Olympus, its members will address the question of whether unlicensed photography of the prime ministerial babe needs a ruling. Zeus would not hesitate; but Lord Wakeham did not get where he is without immaculate understanding of the dynamics of procrastination. All he needs to do is apply the rule of the club. It is straightforward enough. Minors should not be photographed without their parents' consent. There, on the front pages, were the pictures. Open and shut.</p> <p>This latest episode in the Blair vs press soap opera - not to be pursued in the Tuscan sun, it must be hoped - is puzzling. Usually some kind of \"facility\" is offered when press and public interest is high. They are. Christening, like marriage, is one of the few things left that draws marginal believers into church. Babies look bonny in white. Here was an event from which a sharp press secretary was bound to extract some costless feel-good. What got printed were indeed, as Chris Smith disinterestedly observed, lovely pictures.

      "bodyText": "The Press Complaints Commission is being invited by the prime minister to gaze down upon little Leo. From their seats on Olympus, its members will address the question of whether unlicensed photography of the prime ministerial babe needs a ruling. Zeus would not hesitate; but Lord Wakeham did not get where he is without immaculate understanding of the dynamics of procrastination. All he needs to do is apply the rule of the club. It is straightforward enough. Minors should not be photographed without their parents' consent. There, on the front pages, were the pictures. Open and shut. This latest episode in the Blair vs press soap opera - not to be pursued in the Tuscan sun, it must be hoped - is puzzling. Usually some kind of \"facility\" is offered when press and public interest is high. They are. Christening, like marriage, is one of the few things left that draws marginal believers into church. Babies look bonny in white. Here was an event from which a sharp press secretary was bound to extract some costless feel-good. What got printed were indeed, as Chris Smith disinterestedly observed, lovely pictures. The Blairs' wish for a private church service is their right, but they know that, for the time being, they and their children live negotiated lives. By the crude standards of these matters, the press were calm over the drunken elder son episode. Some kind of pay-off was expected.

      "body": "<p>Paul Merton tells a story about the origins of the Irish joke. In England, he says, we tell jokes about the Irish, but in Ireland they tell jokes about the Kerryman. If you go to Kerry, however, they tell jokes about people who live in one particular road. And if you go to that road, they tell jokes about the people who live at number 46. At number 46 - you won't be surprised to hear - they tell jokes about their dad, who, says Merton, can reliably be called the source of all Irish jokes. </p> <p>BBC's The Fitz lies many miles, even centuries, from the source of the Irish joke. A sitcom about an unhinged Irish family, obvious comparisons will be made with the madcap surrealism of Father Ted, though it's actually closer to Bread, a long-running 80s sitcom about a Liverpudlian family who battled through adversity with nothing but a clutch of comedy stereotypes to pull them through. Following the success of The Royle Family, the BBC obviously feels confident about commissioning more adventurous comedy for the main channel. The Fitz must have looked good on paper, but falls well short in reality. Indeed, whilst Father Ted was jaw-droppingly original, Fitz is a gloomy viewing experience. </p> <p>The opening titles warn the viewer how \"Mad!\" (ie unfunny) the show will be, and as a laugh-free 30 minutes begin to tick slowly, painfully, inexorably past, the show slides the viewer from a state of mild expectation to one of deep depression. </p> <p>Written by Owen O'Neal, The Fitz should have been far, far funnier. O'Neal is a veteran Irish stand-up who lives in London. His stage show has always been touching and shocking by turns. Some years ago, he performed a fantastic tour de force about his early years in London as a builder, fighting racism and drink. </p> <p>If the BBC had wanted an original work to match The Royle Family, they should have commissioned a sitcom version of this show. Instead, alas, we get the classic compromise: a bit of Father Ted copyism (complete with \"fecks\" and \"shites\") and a hefty dose of racist, pre-alternative comedy sitcom. </p> <p>Some years ago, O'Neal and I produced a programme about the roots of the Irish comedy clich\u00e9. Owen argued persuasively that Irish clich\u00e9s - the whisky priest, the rustic idjut, etc - exist not because the English invented them, but because they're central to the collective myth of agricultural Ireland, perpetuated as much by the Irish as by anyone else. In the 70s, Dick Emery played an Irish detective called, wait for it, Flynn O'Thick. It was racist, of course, but the crudity and audacity of the joke actually made it funny (the very same ingredients that made American shock stand-ups like Bill Hicks so funny). Watching the Fitz, however, I'm no longer sure that such crude un-PC comedy is either as intellectually complex, or as harmless, as Owen and I would have once argued. </p> <p>In fashion terms, at least, The Fitz shares the blatant stereotyping of Dick Emery: wild ginger hair and loud kipper ties worn by gap-toothed Irishmen. But because it's so self-conscious, so worried about staying just the right side of racist, The Fitz lacks even the innocent offensiveness of Flynn O'Thick - the one thing that made Dick Emery passably amusing. </p> <p>The Fitz is so rooted in unreality, it makes Ballykissangel look like a Ken Loach movie. The set's like a sketch from The Dave Allen Show, minus the acid punchlines about the church. Corruption of the church is the sine qua non of Irish comedy clich\u00e9s, yet no one's ever come close to pinning it with the same accuracy as Allen, certainly not The Fitz. </p> <p>Commissioning O'Neal to write a sitcom, however, is a promising sign from the corporation. Last week, Rhona, written by O'Neal's contemporary, Rhona Cameron, began its run on BBC2. </p> <p>Clearly, the BBC are attempting to reinvigorate mainstream sitcom - a genre that, in Britain at least, hasn't really moved on from Terry &amp; June. In both O'Neal and Cameron's cases, however, it's a shame the BBC pulled its punches and copied existing shows (Father Ted and Ellen, respectively) rather than giving the writers free rein to do something bolder. </p> <p>The best sitcom of recent years, One Foot In The Grave, subverted the sitcom tradition with a healthy injection of bile. One Foot... didn't need the panto antics of The Fitz to make its sanguine point about modern Britain - that getting old is hell. The Fitz, by contrast, says nothing about its subject matter - a real missed opportunity at a time when the Irish are transforming from the butt of racist jokes into a modern, post-industrial society. </p> <p>And not only does it say nothing, but it manages to say nothing with the aid of special effects last seen on Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. Feckin' useless. </p> <p>\u0095 The Fitz, BBC1, Friday August 4,9.30pm Mark Lawson returns next week</p>",

      "bodyText": "Paul Merton tells a story about the origins of the Irish joke. In England, he says, we tell jokes about the Irish, but in Ireland they tell jokes about the Kerryman. If you go to Kerry, however, they tell jokes about people who live in one particular road. And if you go to that road, they tell jokes about the people who live at number 46. At number 46 - you won't be surprised to hear - they tell jokes about their dad, who, says Merton, can reliably be called the source of all Irish jokes. BBC's The Fitz lies many miles, even centuries, from the source of the Irish joke. A sitcom about an unhinged Irish family, obvious comparisons will be made with the madcap surrealism of Father Ted, though it's actually closer to Bread, a long-running 80s sitcom about a Liverpudlian family who battled through adversity with nothing but a clutch of comedy stereotypes to pull them through. Following the success of The Royle Family, the BBC obviously feels confident about commissioning more adventurous comedy for the main channel. The Fitz must have looked good on paper, but falls well short in reality. Indeed, whilst Father Ted was jaw-droppingly original, Fitz is a gloomy viewing experience. The opening titles warn the viewer how \"Mad!\" (ie unfunny) the show will be, and as a laugh-free 30 minutes begin to tick slowly, painfully, inexorably past, the show slides the viewer from a state of mild expectation to one of deep depression. Written by Owen O'Neal, The Fitz should have been far, far funnier. O'Neal is a veteran Irish stand-up who lives in London. His stage show has always been touching and shocking by turns. Some years ago, he performed a fantastic tour de force about his early years in London as a builder, fighting racism and drink. If the BBC had wanted an original work to match The Royle Family, they should have commissioned a sitcom version of this show. Instead, alas, we get the classic compromise: a bit of Father Ted copyism (complete with \"fecks\" and \"shites\") and a hefty dose of racist, pre-alternative comedy sitcom. Some years ago, O'Neal and I produced a programme about the roots of the Irish comedy clich\u00e9. Owen argued persuasively that Irish clich\u00e9s - the whisky priest, the rustic idjut, etc - exist not because the English invented them, but because they're central to the collective myth of agricultural Ireland, perpetuated as much by the Irish as by anyone else. In the 70s, Dick Emery played an Irish detective called, wait for it, Flynn O'Thick. It was racist, of course, but the crudity and audacity of the joke actually made it funny (the very same ingredients that made American shock stand-ups like Bill Hicks so funny). Watching the Fitz, however, I'm no longer sure that such crude un-PC comedy is either as intellectually complex, or as harmless, as Owen and I would have once argued. In fashion terms, at least, The Fitz shares the blatant stereotyping of Dick Emery: wild ginger hair and loud kipper ties worn by gap-toothed Irishmen. But because it's so self-conscious, so worried about staying just the right side of racist, The Fitz lacks even the innocent offensiveness of Flynn O'Thick - the one thing that made Dick Emery passably amusing. The Fitz is so rooted in unreality, it makes Ballykissangel look like a Ken Loach movie. The set's like a sketch from The Dave Allen Show, minus the acid punchlines about the church. Corruption of the church is the sine qua non of Irish comedy clich\u00e9s, yet no one's ever come close to pinning it with the same accuracy as Allen, certainly not The Fitz. Commissioning O'Neal to write a sitcom, however, is a promising sign from the corporation. Last week, Rhona, written by O'Neal's contemporary, Rhona Cameron, began its run on BBC2. Clearly, the BBC are attempting to reinvigorate mainstream sitcom - a genre that, in Britain at least, hasn't really moved on from Terry &amp; June. In both O'Neal and Cameron's cases, however, it's a shame the BBC pulled its punches and copied existing shows (Father Ted and Ellen, respectively) rather than giving the writers free rein to do something bolder. The best sitcom of recent years, One Foot In The Grave, subverted the sitcom tradition with a healthy injection of bile. One Foot... didn't need the panto antics of The Fitz to make its sanguine point about modern Britain - that getting old is hell. The Fitz, by contrast, says nothing about its subject matter - a real missed opportunity at a time when the Irish are transforming from the butt of racist jokes into a modern, post-industrial society. And not only does it say nothing, but it manages to say nothing with the aid of special effects last seen on Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. Feckin' useless. \u0095 The Fitz, BBC1, Friday August 4,9.30pm Mark Lawson returns next week",

The story is that the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, is soon to resign. Some say he won't serve beyond the next election.</p> <p>Several reasons are offered. One is that he's achieved everything he aspired to in Labour's first term - devolution, the foundations of House of Lords reform, access to justice - and wants to leave with his reputation as a radical reforming Lord Chancellor at its height. The more cynical claim is that he doesn't want to remain too long on a lord chancellor's salary (\u00a3167,760) and would like to earn real money, perhaps as something in the City. A recent twist is that he would have to go after the election anyway, because when Tony Blair resigns as PM - as many expect him to - whoever takes over will want a different lord chancellor. Irvine's successor is assumed to be Lord Williams of Mostyn, the respected attorney general, whose sparkling performances in the House of Lords have attracted much praise. But legal gossip is notoriously unreliable. It's obvious that Derry loves his job to bits, and I can't see him going voluntarily.</p> <p>\u0095 In two separate cases last week, judges lifted the ban on the media naming children convicted of serious crimes.

The story is that the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, is soon to resign. Some say he won't serve beyond the next election. Several reasons are offered. One is that he's achieved everything he aspired to in Labour's first term - devolution, the foundations of House of Lords reform, access to justice - and wants to leave with his reputation as a radical reforming Lord Chancellor at its height. The more cynical claim is that he doesn't want to remain too long on a lord chancellor's salary (\u00a3167,760) and would like to earn real money, perhaps as something in the City. A recent twist is that he would have to go after the election anyway, because when Tony Blair resigns as PM - as many expect him to - whoever takes over will want a different lord chancellor. Irvine's successor is assumed to be Lord Williams of Mostyn, the respected attorney general, whose sparkling performances in the House of Lords have attracted much praise. But legal gossip is notoriously unreliable. It's obvious that Derry loves his job to bits, and I can't see him going voluntarily. \u0095 In two separate cases last week, judges lifted the ban on the media naming children convicted of serious crimes.

But at the heart of all things Wagnerian, in the composer's theatre at Bayreuth, Germany, the responsibilities for a creative team are hugely magnified. The task for director J\u00fcrgen Flimm and conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli is to produce a vision that will continue a tradition reaching back to the first-ever performances of the cycle. </p> <p>Halfway through - with Das Rheingold and Die Walk\u00fcre already performed and Siegfried and G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung still to come - this Ring has already defined a thrillingly rich theatre of gods, giants and modern commentary. Wotan, the ruler of the gods, and Fricka, his wife, are cast as a pair of 21st-century plutocrats. The stage is littered with boxes and architectural plans, the detritus of a supernatural removal job. Behind them looms a city of scaffolding, that culminates in the imposing tower of Valhalla, which Wotan is building. Ambition is symbolised by architectural excess, with Wotan the chief developer of the celestial real estate. </p> <p>The skill of Erich Wonder's designs and Florence von Gerkan's costumes is that, for all their worldly references, there is still room for magic and myth - and no character exemplifies these more than Loge, the god of fire. Kim Begley's portrayal of the fiery schemer flickers as brightly and unpredictably as the flames he conjures. He is the controlling force behind nearly every scene of Das Rheingold, playing one side against the other in each dispute. </p> <p>Wonder's sets make visible the symbiotic bonds between the cave of the Nibelungs (dwarves) and the heights of Valhalla, in a series of lifts and rail-tracks that dominate every scene. Alberich, the Nibelung who steals from the Rhinemaidens the gold that will enable its owner to rule the world, shares Wotan's compulsive desire for power. Like Wotan's building site, Alberich's realm - with its plush office and hoards of besuited workers - bears witness to the obsessions of its creator. </p> <p>By the second act of Die Walk\u00fcre, Wotan's power has degenerated into paranoia. Alan Titus gives a towering performance, a complete portrayal of the appalling effects of misbegotten power. In a grim premonition of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, Wotan wills: \"Das Ende, Das Ende!\". Titus makes this a definitive moment, as Wotan sees that his self-inflicted wounds must bring about the end, not just of himself, but of all the gods. </p> <p>Titus's is the central performance of this Walk\u00fcre, although Gabriele Schnaut's Br\u00fcnnhilde is theatrically effective. It is the first act of Die Walk\u00fcre - the most obviously \"human\" of the Ring so far - that is the most problematic. The mortals Hunding and Sieglinde's dwelling is more detached from normality than that of the gods. Waltraud Meier as Sieglinde and Placido Domingo as Siegmund make for a starry pair of lovers, but somehow they fail to generate the frisson that their godly counterparts manage. However, there is no want of dramatic interest in the post-apocalyptic splendour of the Valkyries, Wotan's warrior daughters who swing from Valhalla's heights alongside a parade of their victims. </p> <p>Underpinning every moment is Sinopoli's superbly paced conducting. He has allowed the detail and architecture of Wagner's music to flow effortlessly - even with his occasionally slow speeds. Sinopoli and Flimm have built a fascinating foundation in Das Rheingold and Die Walk\u00fcre; Siegfried and G\u00f6tter- d\u00e4mmerung are eagerly awaited.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Anthony Clare, the psychiatrist, is sitting in his chair in his consulting room in Dublin. There are seagulls wheeling outside the window. Inside is a plant and some stately furniture and on the floor a carpet so thick that your chair, when you move it, leaves marks like the spume in the wake of a cross-channel ferry. There are two Greek masks on a shelf, as if reminding visitors that, no matter how messy and unruly their emotions, they still fit easily within the comedy and tragedy of human experience. For those not convinced, there is also a big box of tissues to blot them up or out instead.</p> <p>And there he is on the other side of the desk, head on one side, the man who for 30 years has in private counselled and medicated the troubled and dispossessed, while in public on Radio 4 wheedled secrets and vulnerability from the grand or famous or important for our shared delectation. Professor Anthony Clare, doctor and broadcaster: voice of patient understanding, voice of calm acceptance in a storm. \"So tell me Boadicea, when did you first notice this urge to push yourself forward?\"</p> <p>All things considered, you might expect him to be on the quiet side when interviewed himself. But, \"Ooh,\" he's saying, closing his eyes campishly for emphasis, \"I think it must have been very difficult being married to me. I have changed a bit, but earlier on I would have been very driving, very ambitious. And I think my wife, Jane, would say I am very irritating to argue with.\"</p> <p>Irritatingly calm? \"No. No. NO. Why am I telling you this? I can be, I can be . . . as any of my friends can tell you . . . my children [he has seven] remember me as slightly explosive. I'd come out of my study and say, 'OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE!' . . . and that would be coming out of a family that was very argumentative, and runs counter to the image of the psychiatrist. Even in my clinics, my patients might have said: 'He can be feisty.' My wife stands up for herself, she can be quite combative too.\"</p> <p>He raises his eyes to the ceiling in exaggerated exasperation. \"The children would say, 'Oh God, there we go again', if we have another of our arguments about Shakespeare in Love or whatever it happens to be. Hmm. I would not have thought I was an easy person, no, no, no. NO.\"</p> <p>Clare is explaining the personal background to his new book, On Men: Masculinity in Crisis, about the decline of \"the phallic male\", about the importance of finding a new role in a society where men are no longer the providers, the controllers, no longer vital to procreation. He argues that men need to place a greater value on family and social relationships and less on power and achievements. He keeps delving into his own experiences to back all this up - \"the career, the career, the Maudsley [hospital, London] and the getting on in British psychiatry and the Bart's chair, and then the broadcasting . . . I think if I hadn't been in psychiatric medicine and if I hadn't been married to a woman like Jane,\" he says, \"I might have got it too late. I nearly got it too late.\" At 57, he says, he has finally reached \"a watershed\".</p> <p>He is a small man with little brown eyes and the face of a benign crow, a young Walter Matthau without the crumpled gloom. But he's much neater. He's wearing shiny patent leather shoes and the short sleeves of his white shirt have been ironed into points. He seems not at all masculine and not at all in crisis. Lots of his gestures are to do with tidying - he coaxes and flicks his greying black hair over a sparse patch at the back, he fiddles with his watch, he rearranges the stapler on his desk. It's true that he does this most when talking about his formative years: the mother who \"found it difficult to praise\", who believed in life as \"a vale of tears\"; the father, a solicitor, \"who was not a man who talked about his feelings\". (Clare has \"regrets\" that he didn't try to talk to them more, though fears \"they didn't have the language\".) There is a bit of hair work too when talking about his own \"bat squeaks of depression\" as a young intern in the US. But, to be frank, all this seems to have less to do with repressed anxiety than the polite boredom of conjuring up a past that seems, to the product of his upbringing at least, a long way off.</p> <p>Tap into an enthusiasm, on the other hand, and he becomes positively theatrical, throwing himself around his chair as if on stage. He will tell you all about his children (only two still at home, one back all the time with her washing, all \"physically affectionate\"), his home on the banks of the Liffey, his wife and, of course, his work. He clearly adores his work (but that's men for you). He describes himself as an \"eclectic psychiatrist\", believing in \"the interplay of genetics and personality and circumstance and gender and social expectations and attributes and values and culture\".</p> <p>\"People say, 'What the hell is that, some sort of mishmash?' But, temperamentally, I recoil from the schools in psychiatry.\" His whole body shivers. \"I cannot stand the committed ideologists. The Freudians, the Jungians, the Behaviourists.\" His arms knife the air. \"At the moment the great rage is for biological psychiatry. People who tell you seriously that that's it, the genome, we've cracked everything. Doctors learn nothing. The hubris!\" He throws his eyes up to the ceiling, twists his torso around in horror.</p> <p>Later, he picks up a mention of Prozac and thrashes it in the air as if in the throes of an ongoing argument. \"There is no evidence whatsoever that the new generation of drugs is therapeutically superior to the old generation,\" he says, shaking his head so vigorously it's a surprise it doesn't fall off. \"None whatsoever. Where is this happy revolution? Of course not. Of course not.\"</p> <p>Clare's \"phallic\" drive has made him medical director at St Patrick's hospital in Dublin where he works most of the week, only whizzing off to the fleshpots of Broadcasting House on the 4pm Friday flight. He sees no contradiction between his two jobs - \"they overlap\", he says - and in fact thinks journalism has made him a better psychiatrist. He sits back comfortably in his chair to ponder.</p> <p>\"Psychiatry came out of the analytic model where time didn't matter and you just let it all happen. Nonsense! Time is extremely expensive and you've got to use it.\" On a few occasions, the line between celebrity and clinical interview has been even more blurred. \"It's breaking no confidence to say that RD Laing, interestingly the only psychiatrist I've interviewed, was in trouble and talked about it candidly - his drink problem. And Alice Thomas Ellis was very depressed when I saw her and Lewis Wolpert wasn't depressed but might just as easily have been. Often there is a thin line that separates them from someone who is in serious trouble and that thin line might be talent; without that they would be very vulnerable indeed.\"</p> <p>The same tricks work in both arenas too. \"One way is to wait. They're answering a question and they've stopped and they're starting to think . . . and sometimes you get a genuinely fresh answer then. A second trick is to repeat the last sentence if you think they haven't given you enough. Somebody says, 'Well, you know, my marriage was OK - as marriages go.' You might say, 'What do you mean by that?' Or, you might say, 'As marriages go?' And there is often a way of saying that. You don't need to be Tom Stoppard now. 'As marriages go...? As marriages go?'</p> <p>\"And then don't get too focused too soon - that comes out of medicine. You start big. Some interviewers can't do that. Paxman has to go in immediately. My field is lower paced. You can't risk antagonising the interviewee on the programme, especially if you're in practice as I am. You can't have someone coming out and saying, 'I was mauled by him. Disgusting! What kind of a psychiatrist is that!' \" He gives another loud laugh.</p> <p>These days, he's not so sure that In The Psychiatrist's Chair should continue. Too many interviews everywhere, he says, too much Diana bulimia revelation. He is \"giving thought\" to giving up. Which brings us to the watershed. He is giving up the medical directorship at the end of the year, to become an ordinary consultant instead. He is trying to say no to some of the journalism: \"To resist temptation\" he says revealingly.</p> <p>Instead, Clare wants to spend more time with his family, \"with English friends, and Irish friends\", to go to the cinema more and the theatre, and the opera, to travel, and to play golf. There is a course next door to his house, \"a beautiful golf course\", he says with a purr, \"a superb golf course\".</p> <p>For this reconstructed male - \"almost reconstucted, but not quite\" - a new-found identity sounds an awful lot like old-fashioned retirement.</p>",

      "byline": "Anita Chaudhuri",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Annie Sprinkle, the American porn star turned performance artist, would like a word with Jack Straw. \"It's outrageous: your customs people won't allow any of my videos into the country. What's the matter with you all? When I come over and perform my live show, they make me cut out anything that shows penetrative sex. I mean, c'mon, God has programmed all of us to be interested in sexuality, it's a gift! Britain has a lot to learn from America.\"</p> <p>The recent high court decision to allow seven hardcore films to be sold in licensed sex shops did not extend to any of Sprinkle's productions; not Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle, not the Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop. However, one east London cinema is screening her latest film, Annie Sprinkle's Herstory of Porn, as part of Porno Chic, a season that sets out to explore the timely issue that pornography, whether we like it or not, has entered mainstream culture through Channel 5, car advertising, cinema, music and the internet.</p> <p>Sprinkle's film can best be described as docu-porn, charting a 25-year career in the industry with dozens of clips from her films, accompanied by her often humorous commentary. \"In erotica you just use the feather, in porn you use the whole chicken,\" she quips. Much of it is decidedly unappealing, but the latter half of the film, showcasing the work she produced herself, is compelling if only because it shows a woman enjoying sex in a way that one never usually sees in either mainstream pornography or mainstream cinema.</p> <p>\"The film is really art,\" she claims. \"I want it to play in museums. It is not meant to be erotic.\" This is fortunate since it includes everything from cheap 1970s nasties to a hotchpotch of \"New Age\" footage featuring yogic chants, lesbian mermaids and \"cry-gasms\". \"I want women's studies students, cultural theorists and film students to see it,\" she adds. \"It's about making people think.\"</p> <p>Born Ellen Steinberg, Sprinkle rebelled against her well-to-do teacher parents and became a prostitute when she left school. She drifted into the porn industry and is one of only a handful of women to have come out the other side with her own career. She calls herself a \"pro-porn feminist\" and is evangelical about the benefits of sexually explicit material to society in general - \"There should be sex kitchens in every town like they have soup kitchens, then there would be less rape, less war, less violence\" - and to women in particular. \"Women need to be educated about how to watch porn,\" she says. \"The reason many women don't like porn is because they are filled with shame about their own bodies, they feel it's wrong to explore their own sexual pleasure.\"</p> <p>Surely it has occurred to Sprinkle that there are other, more convincing reasons why many women do not enjoy pornography? Leaving aside the usual charges that it is exploitative, violent and degrading, much of it is mind-numbingly dull and repetitive, badly produced and lacking any aesthetic allure. \"Yes, I agree a lot of porn is bad, patriarchal and misogynistic,\" Sprinkle says. \"But no matter where we stand, pornography reflects us all. That's why I went into producing, directing and starring in my own films, so we could have a product by women for women for the first time.\"</p> <p>She made a series of films with Candida Royalle, a New York producer who got \"women-friendly\" films on to the top shelves of video shops both in the US and in Britain. The work was based on the premise that women wanted their pornography to be romantic. The result was a cross between a Gold Blend ad and a Madonna video (you remember, before she got squeamish about page three girls). Trying to second-guess what kind of visual material will stimulate women has so far left the soft porn industry at a loss. Several years ago, a flurry of magazines was launched, including For Women and Bite. These disappeared as abruptly as they appeared, for the simple reason that women didn't buy them.</p> <p>Kathryn Hoyle, owner of women's sex shop Sh!, believes women are not confident about exploring pornography for themselves; they usually discover it through a partner and this is not necessarily the most positive initiation. \"How can women know if they like pornography when it's so difficult to get hold of material?\" she asks. \"Even with top shelf magazines, buying them is embarrassing. In my local newsagent's, I feel I have to say 'Oh, I'm buying these for work, you know, it's research'. If I feel like that, doing the job I do, so must most other women. There's this feeling that if you are a woman buying porn, you must either be a sad frump who can't get sex any other way, or a nymphomaniac.\"</p> <p>At Hoyle's London shop, there is a video machine so women can watch before they buy. \"Sometimes I go down to that area of the shop and there are all these women sitting on the floor watching a film, and I feel like handing round popcorn. But if we didn't provide this service, I'm not sure women would buy; they wouldn't feel confident about paying \u00a316 for a video they might not even like.\"</p> <p>Is it possible to make a general assumption about what material women enjoy? \"No. It's always said women prefer suggestive material rather than explicit, that they enjoy the spoken or written word rather than the visual, but I haven't seen much evidence to support that in my shop.\"</p> <p>In Britain, where the laws governing the distribution of pornography are among the toughest in the democratic world, the debate about women and pornography is still in its infancy. It is not a bandwagon British feminists often choose to climb aboard. A recent example was news coverage of the imminent release in this country of Baise-Moi, the controversial French film about two women who go on a spree of sex and murder. It contains explicit sex scenes, as did last year's French film Romance. The only voices of protest so far have come from the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association and the Conservative Family Group.

      "bodyText": "Annie Sprinkle, the American porn star turned performance artist, would like a word with Jack Straw. \"It's outrageous: your customs people won't allow any of my videos into the country. What's the matter with you all? When I come over and perform my live show, they make me cut out anything that shows penetrative sex. I mean, c'mon, God has programmed all of us to be interested in sexuality, it's a gift! Britain has a lot to learn from America.\" The recent high court decision to allow seven hardcore films to be sold in licensed sex shops did not extend to any of Sprinkle's productions; not Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle, not the Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop. However, one east London cinema is screening her latest film, Annie Sprinkle's Herstory of Porn, as part of Porno Chic, a season that sets out to explore the timely issue that pornography, whether we like it or not, has entered mainstream culture through Channel 5, car advertising, cinema, music and the internet. Sprinkle's film can best be described as docu-porn, charting a 25-year career in the industry with dozens of clips from her films, accompanied by her often humorous commentary. \"In erotica you just use the feather, in porn you use the whole chicken,\" she quips. Much of it is decidedly unappealing, but the latter half of the film, showcasing the work she produced herself, is compelling if only because it shows a woman enjoying sex in a way that one never usually sees in either mainstream pornography or mainstream cinema. \"The film is really art,\" she claims. \"I want it to play in museums. It is not meant to be erotic.\" This is fortunate since it includes everything from cheap 1970s nasties to a hotchpotch of \"New Age\" footage featuring yogic chants, lesbian mermaids and \"cry-gasms\". \"I want women's studies students, cultural theorists and film students to see it,\" she adds. \"It's about making people think.\" Born Ellen Steinberg, Sprinkle rebelled against her well-to-do teacher parents and became a prostitute when she left school. She drifted into the porn industry and is one of only a handful of women to have come out the other side with her own career. She calls herself a \"pro-porn feminist\" and is evangelical about the benefits of sexually explicit material to society in general - \"There should be sex kitchens in every town like they have soup kitchens, then there would be less rape, less war, less violence\" - and to women in particular. \"Women need to be educated about how to watch porn,\" she says. \"The reason many women don't like porn is because they are filled with shame about their own bodies, they feel it's wrong to explore their own sexual pleasure.\" Surely it has occurred to Sprinkle that there are other, more convincing reasons why many women do not enjoy pornography? Leaving aside the usual charges that it is exploitative, violent and degrading, much of it is mind-numbingly dull and repetitive, badly produced and lacking any aesthetic allure. \"Yes, I agree a lot of porn is bad, patriarchal and misogynistic,\" Sprinkle says. \"But no matter where we stand, pornography reflects us all. That's why I went into producing, directing and starring in my own films, so we could have a product by women for women for the first time.\" She made a series of films with Candida Royalle, a New York producer who got \"women-friendly\" films on to the top shelves of video shops both in the US and in Britain. The work was based on the premise that women wanted their pornography to be romantic. The result was a cross between a Gold Blend ad and a Madonna video (you remember, before she got squeamish about page three girls). Trying to second-guess what kind of visual material will stimulate women has so far left the soft porn industry at a loss. Several years ago, a flurry of magazines was launched, including For Women and Bite. These disappeared as abruptly as they appeared, for the simple reason that women didn't buy them. Kathryn Hoyle, owner of women's sex shop Sh!, believes women are not confident about exploring pornography for themselves; they usually discover it through a partner and this is not necessarily the most positive initiation. \"How can women know if they like pornography when it's so difficult to get hold of material?\" she asks. \"Even with top shelf magazines, buying them is embarrassing. In my local newsagent's, I feel I have to say 'Oh, I'm buying these for work, you know, it's research'. If I feel like that, doing the job I do, so must most other women. There's this feeling that if you are a woman buying porn, you must either be a sad frump who can't get sex any other way, or a nymphomaniac.\" At Hoyle's London shop, there is a video machine so women can watch before they buy. \"Sometimes I go down to that area of the shop and there are all these women sitting on the floor watching a film, and I feel like handing round popcorn. But if we didn't provide this service, I'm not sure women would buy; they wouldn't feel confident about paying \u00a316 for a video they might not even like.\" Is it possible to make a general assumption about what material women enjoy? \"No. It's always said women prefer suggestive material rather than explicit, that they enjoy the spoken or written word rather than the visual, but I haven't seen much evidence to support that in my shop.\" In Britain, where the laws governing the distribution of pornography are among the toughest in the democratic world, the debate about women and pornography is still in its infancy. It is not a bandwagon British feminists often choose to climb aboard. A recent example was news coverage of the imminent release in this country of Baise-Moi, the controversial French film about two women who go on a spree of sex and murder. It contains explicit sex scenes, as did last year's French film Romance. The only voices of protest so far have come from the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association and the Conservative Family Group. There have been no feminist protests; yes, the film is directed by a woman, but in America that would not be enough to restrain the anti-porn camp. In America, many feminist academics have made entire careers out of pornography. Among them is University of Michigan law professor Catherine MacKinnon whose anti-porn diatribe Only Words asserts: \"Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex.\" MacKinnon and fellow anti-porn campaigner Andrea Dworkin have been dubbed \"MacDworkin\" by hostile pro-porn feminists and have gone so far as to try to introduce a Pornography Victims Compensation Act which would give women - and men - the right to sue if they felt they had been injured by any form of sexual expression they found offensive. \"I don't think these anti-porn women have seen my films,\" Sprinkle says. \"But loads of other women have. That's why pro-porn feminists are winning the war, the war that says the answer to bad pornography is no pornography. That's not right and more and more feminists are agreeing with that.

By a remarkable coincidence, it turns out there would still be just enough space on that same piece of paper to accommodate everything I know about the workings of the modern automobile.</p> <p>I am not, never have been, a \"car\" person. As a kid, I never pinned a Jackie Stewart poster on my bedroom wall. I never took my driving test on my 17th birthday, or ripped apart a camshaft (whatever that is) for the sheer unalloyed joy of putting it back together again. Not for a second have I pondered the advantages of the automatic transmission over the five-speed manual gearbox. Is the Toyota Camry better than the Honda Accord? Does it matter, as long as the wheels go round? I think not.</p> <p>But guess what? I am currently \"leading the board\" in the Salesman of the Month competition at Stephen's Creek Pre-Owned Automobiles. I'm ahead of Andrew \"the Crocodile\" McDonald (recovering alcoholic and the acknowledged best car salesman ever to walk God's earth), Luis Fernandez (Nicaraguan civil war veteran), Jason \"MoFo\" Preston (rap recording artist), Baghwan Sheree (Indian spiritualist and The Car Salesman Formerly Known as BeBe), Vance McNamee (who once played soccer at school with the comedian Robin Williams), Tom Field (Vietnam war vet and holder of two Purple Hearts for bravery), Tommy \"the Tank\" Tomasello (who left his last job just after the tax inspectors moved in) and other assorted salesmen whose names are hardly worth remembering because they will be here today and gone tomorrow.</p> <p>In the past 10 days I have sold $185,000 worth of tin, including a $41,000 Sport Utility Vehicle purchased by two ageing hippies called Dan and Lisa and a $4,350 1988 Dodge Dynasty driven home by 67-year-old, alcoholic Harvard alumnus. I have made $15,230 gross profit for the dealership and $3,046 commission for myself. Best of all, the other morning I asked a customer who walked on to the lot if he needed any help and he replied \"leave me alone, I hate car salesmen\"; yet one hour later the same man wrote a cheque for $12,875 for a 1998 Toyota with 38,000 miles on the clock.</p> <p>Forgive me if this sounds boastful, but I have enjoyed a varied life. I have played in pop group in front of 70,00 people at Glastonbury. I have worked for the best newspaper in the world (the Guardian, of course). I have written two books. I have birdied the 17th at the Old Course. I am blessed with the love and friendship of a wonderful woman. But nothing, and I mean nothing, comes close to the feeling of selling a car to someone who, 60 minutes before, believed in his heart of hearts that you were a sleazy, lying, lowlife scumbag. It is better than sex. Trust me, I'm a used-car salesman.</p> <p>\"You're leading the board, Scotty. You want to be number one, don't you?\" an incredulous Andrew McDonald said to me yesterday morning as we sat down to our regular Egg McMuffin breakfast. \"You're the worst car salesman I've met in 20 years in the business. Tell me, how come you're leading the board?\"</p> <p>\"Andrew,\" I replied, giving his question careful consideration. \"I'm buggered if I know.\"</p> <p>America's love affair with the motor car is well documented, but beyond the legend of Henry Ford and photographs of James Dean's wrecked Porsche lie some startling statistics. Since the Model T rolled off the production line, 5bn cars have been sold in the United States.

More than 1m salesman of varying ability and trustworthiness work at dealerships and automalls in communities across the country.</p> <p>Steven's Creek Auto Row in San Jose, California, is classed as an automall, with dealers ranging from the high-end Mercedes and Cadillac shops to the so-called \"pot lots\" down the bottom end of the street (where buying a used car is as dangerous as juggling grenades). It is said that Stephen's Creek has the biggest concentration of car dealerships in the United States. Last year, 45,000 people from all over northern California bought their car somewhere along this three-mile strip. Every day there are 7,500 cars for sale on Creek.</p> <p>I work at a place called Stephen's Creek Pre-Owned Autos, near the eastern end of the boulevard. It's more pot lot than high end, though we don't sell wrecks and, believe it or not, a handful of our used cars even come with a warranty.

      "bodyText": "Not far from where I live in California's Silicon Valley there are scientists so skilled that they can place millions of transistors on a piece of paper no bigger than a baby's fingernail. By a remarkable coincidence, it turns out there would still be just enough space on that same piece of paper to accommodate everything I know about the workings of the modern automobile. I am not, never have been, a \"car\" person. As a kid, I never pinned a Jackie Stewart poster on my bedroom wall. I never took my driving test on my 17th birthday, or ripped apart a camshaft (whatever that is) for the sheer unalloyed joy of putting it back together again. Not for a second have I pondered the advantages of the automatic transmission over the five-speed manual gearbox. Is the Toyota Camry better than the Honda Accord? Does it matter, as long as the wheels go round? I think not. But guess what? I am currently \"leading the board\" in the Salesman of the Month competition at Stephen's Creek Pre-Owned Automobiles. I'm ahead of Andrew \"the Crocodile\" McDonald (recovering alcoholic and the acknowledged best car salesman ever to walk God's earth), Luis Fernandez (Nicaraguan civil war veteran), Jason \"MoFo\" Preston (rap recording artist), Baghwan Sheree (Indian spiritualist and The Car Salesman Formerly Known as BeBe), Vance McNamee (who once played soccer at school with the comedian Robin Williams), Tom Field (Vietnam war vet and holder of two Purple Hearts for bravery), Tommy \"the Tank\" Tomasello (who left his last job just after the tax inspectors moved in) and other assorted salesmen whose names are hardly worth remembering because they will be here today and gone tomorrow. In the past 10 days I have sold $185,000 worth of tin, including a $41,000 Sport Utility Vehicle purchased by two ageing hippies called Dan and Lisa and a $4,350 1988 Dodge Dynasty driven home by 67-year-old, alcoholic Harvard alumnus. I have made $15,230 gross profit for the dealership and $3,046 commission for myself. Best of all, the other morning I asked a customer who walked on to the lot if he needed any help and he replied \"leave me alone, I hate car salesmen\"; yet one hour later the same man wrote a cheque for $12,875 for a 1998 Toyota with 38,000 miles on the clock. Forgive me if this sounds boastful, but I have enjoyed a varied life. I have played in pop group in front of 70,00 people at Glastonbury. I have worked for the best newspaper in the world (the Guardian, of course). I have written two books. I have birdied the 17th at the Old Course. I am blessed with the love and friendship of a wonderful woman. But nothing, and I mean nothing, comes close to the feeling of selling a car to someone who, 60 minutes before, believed in his heart of hearts that you were a sleazy, lying, lowlife scumbag. It is better than sex. Trust me, I'm a used-car salesman. \"You're leading the board, Scotty. You want to be number one, don't you?\" an incredulous Andrew McDonald said to me yesterday morning as we sat down to our regular Egg McMuffin breakfast. \"You're the worst car salesman I've met in 20 years in the business. Tell me, how come you're leading the board?\" \"Andrew,\" I replied, giving his question careful consideration. \"I'm buggered if I know.\" America's love affair with the motor car is well documented, but beyond the legend of Henry Ford and photographs of James Dean's wrecked Porsche lie some startling statistics. Since the Model T rolled off the production line, 5bn cars have been sold in the United States. Last year alone, according to the National Auto Dealers Association of America, its members sold $534bn worth of vehicles. More than 1m salesman of varying ability and trustworthiness work at dealerships and automalls in communities across the country. Steven's Creek Auto Row in San Jose, California, is classed as an automall, with dealers ranging from the high-end Mercedes and Cadillac shops to the so-called \"pot lots\" down the bottom end of the street (where buying a used car is as dangerous as juggling grenades). It is said that Stephen's Creek has the biggest concentration of car dealerships in the United States. Last year, 45,000 people from all over northern California bought their car somewhere along this three-mile strip. Every day there are 7,500 cars for sale on Creek. I work at a place called Stephen's Creek Pre-Owned Autos, near the eastern end of the boulevard. It's more pot lot than high end, though we don't sell wrecks and, believe it or not, a handful of our used cars even come with a warranty. However, we do specialise in customers with credit problems who might be looking for the modest four-door \"commuter car\" in the, say, $5,000-$6,000 price range. Salesman on our lot are trained never to lie to a customer, though several of the more successful guys appear to have PhDs in semantics. We work out of a temporary wooden cabin which has been there for 10 years now. The carpets are worn bare, the desks were bought at firesale and the receptionist, Sasha, is indolent beyond salvation. The cars are parked out front on an uncompromising asphalt square, where the temperatures can hit 115 degrees in the summer. Customers who walk on to the Mercedes dealership across the street are welcomed by gorgeous \"greeters\" who will usher them inside for a fruit juice and a chat with an automobile consultant. Walking on to our lot is like making a guest appearance in Jaws; you are devoured by salesmen. Virtually all of our business is done at the weekend. During the week the salesman just sit around eating or discussing the big issues, such as \"What is the best shoe for a car salesman?\", or \"Blue shirt or white shirt - which deflects the sun best?\" Answers: Rockport, and white. Occasionally someone will make a special effort to amuse the others, by persuading a passing customer to climb into the trunk of a car, say, or by phoning up a guy who has placed an ad in the AutoTrader selling a smashed-up Ferrari for $30,000. Salesman: So, are you fixed on this $30,000 price or I can you move a little? Ferrari Man (attempting to play the hard-nosed salesman): I' m sorry, but the answer is no. Salesman: But the car is wrecked. FM: Maybe I could come down a couple of hundred dollars. It's a Ferrari, remember. Salesman: Well, what about if I gave you a top-notch blow job . . . It's been four months now and I can scarcely remember why I took the job in the first place.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister yesterday defended his decision to call in the press complaints commission over the publication of pictures showing him taking his baby son, Leo, to be christened. While Downing Street conceded the pictures that appeared in most of the Sunday newspapers were harmless, Tony Blair's spokesman said his family wanted to prevent \"open season\" on their children. The Blairs insist they do not want to appear heavy-handed, and do not plan to lodge an official complaint with the commission. Instead they will write to its chairman, Lord Wakeham, asking for clarification of the rules. The newspaper industry's code of conduct forbids the publication of pictures of children without their parents' consent: Mr Blair and his wife, Cherie, had made it clear before Saturday's event that it was private and they did not want publicity. However, there were about 300 people outside St John Fisher Roman Catholic church in Sedgefield, the prime minister's constituency, and many took photographs of the Blairs carrying Leo to and from the church. Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's spokesman, said: \"This is not a formal complaint but we are genuinely seeking [the commission's] advice on how best to handle a difficult area for the family.\" He admitted that many people were interested in the event, but said the prime minister was concerned that his children's privacy should not be invaded. \"On the one hand, it was obvious from the number of local people who turned up yesterday that this was a happy event in which people wanted to share, and the pictures published are perfectly inoffensive. \"On the other hand, the prime minister and Mrs Blair are concerned that to give consent to publication on such occasions risks giving open season to the press not just in relation to the baby but their other children too. \"This is a genuine dilemma and one which they hope can be addressed in a sensible way that takes into account their legitimate desire to see their children enjoy as normal an upbringing as possible in the abnormal circumstances of being children of a serving prime minister.\" Speaking on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme yesterday, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, said the photographs were \"lovely pictures\". He added, however: \"The point the prime minister is trying to make is that he does want Leo to be a very private matter for the family. He doesn't want intrusive attention, he would much rather they got on with the business of bringing up the family in their own way.\"",

That same old, familiar image never surprises and never challenges assumptions about who you are and what you are capable of. Your course is set. </p> <p>BP Amoco, the oil company, last week signalled that it was fed up with being predictable. Out went its shield logo, a familiar sight adorning petrol stations up and down Britain's motorways, and in came a new sunflower logo, the \"Helios mark\", self-consciously retro, with a fashionably lower case \"bp\". It was a big moment for the company - the first new look in 70 years - and a big story, deemed important enough to make the front pages of the national press. </p> <p>The costs, about \u00a34.6m to design and a further \u00a3132m to daub it on pumps and vans, were nothing compared to the boost BP - sorry, bp - believes the new image will give to its prospects: \"Its radiance is a daily reminder of our aspirations and purpose,\" gasps the company. \"In a hundred countries across the globe, a hundred thousand bp employees bring the world energy in the forms of light, warmth and mobility.\" </p> <p>Hyperbolic this may be, but the brand's \"mission statement\" illustrates how companies repackage the familiar to present it as new - and, crucially, to avoid being left behind (\"bp\" stands now not for the staid old \"British Petroleum\", but for the more ambitious \"beyond petroleum\"). But while new logos and multi-million pound image consultants are beyond the reach of the average office worker, that's not to say the stuck-in-a-rut employee can't learn a few things from the corporate revamp. </p> <p>Margaret Stead is a chartered occupational psychologist and managing director of Career Design International, which specialises in career development programmes. She believes that if a job is not leading you towards your goals, it's time for a rethink. This is more than just a new image - it's about \"repositioning\" yourself within your \"marketplace\". \"Take someone who is an administrator, and perhaps has been with the same company since leaving school,\" suggests Stead. \"They might well be thought of as part of the 'family', not in terms of future potential. This is when it can be useful to 'rebrand' the individual.\" </p> <p>One-to-one coaching, psychometric assessments and career analysis, among other techniques, are on offer, but ultimately the aim is the same: \"discovering how to position themselves to achieve what they want to achieve, and how they might present themselves to do this\". </p> <p>Presentation, of course, means rather more than making sure you wear a clean shirt to interviews. Career Design International is just one of a host of services offering to \"maximise your assets\" - no smutty sniggers please - and \"improve your marketing skills\". There have always been agencies eager to advance your career through costly training packages. But the difference now is that workers are being encouraged to realise, and work with, the skills and experience they already possess. Repackaging, in fact. </p> <p>Brook Street, a recruitment agency specialising in temporary secretarial and office staff, latched onto this idea with its recent advertising campaign, splashed across the London Underground, which put the responsibility for change firmly in the hands of workers. \"You are your own business,\" read one ad. \"Try saying, 'I'm going to do what I want to do',\" was the message on another. \"After all, if you're not enjoying the present, what hope is there for the future?\" </p> <p>All clever stuff, expensively dreamed up by top advertisers Team Saatchi. And unusual, too, as the ads featured no telephone number and no website address - the curious had to read to the end of the text to find just the name of the agency. All for a good reason, explains Odette Sullivan, PR, advertising and communications manager at Brook Street. \"The idea was to get people talking - and thinking; to reassess, to realise that they don't have to stay in the same job,\" she says. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with workers from all walks of life (even doctors) calling into branches to find out more about the tagline on the ads: \"Whatever you want to do with your life, we'll show you how to make a career of it.\" </p> <p>Many of those interested had to be directed to other agencies (Brook Street deals mostly with secretarial staff), but Sullivan believes these attitudes are particularly relevant to temporary office workers. \"The job for life is dead,\" she insists. \"Now we have professional temps, who are temping for long periods, not because they have to, but because they like the change. You're no longer 'just' a temp: it's a career.\" The ads, she says, made this more obvious to workers and employers alike: \"It is possible to have a permanent attitude and be a temporary worker.\" You just need to reposition yourself with a new mindset. </p> <p>So if your personal \"corporate logo\" is in need of a revamp, where can you start? Temporary work can be an obvious way to change career direction. Jess Davis worked as an A&amp;R co-ordinator in the music business finding new bands, before moving on to a stint in television. But, she says, it didn't suit her and a rethink was necessary. She took a temporary job last year as an administrator at Career Moves, a recruitment consultancy specialising in jobs in the media, while thinking through her options. This turned into a six-month placement covering a sabbatical as office manager. \"Dealing with the clients seemed to come very naturally,\" she explains. \"I was looking for something new, and I knew I wanted to be in the music industry. I was in an advantageous position, because I had secretarial skills, so I could temp. But I also had my knowledge of music and I know a lot of people in the industry.\" </p> <p>Putting the two together to make a brand new career was the logical step. Fortunately, her bosses at Career Moves agreed; a training programme or two later, Davis is now a recruitment consultant in the music division of the company, finding for others the jobs she once yearned for herself. \"Some really juicy jobs do come in,\" she confesses. \"But someone took a chance on me once, and now I can do that for someone else. And they'll be doing what I know they'll love. It's dream job territory.\" </p> <p>She admits, however, that landing that ideal job does require extra efforts on the part of the hopeful candidate. \"You might have all the skills there, but it's like making a cake - you have to have all the ingredients in the right amounts for it to taste fantastic. Presentation and personality are 100% important.\" </p> <p>Stead agrees. \"You need to present yourself in the best light. And for that you need an idea of what you want to do with your life. What is your purpose, your mission, your dream?\" She cites the example of a young doctor who had left the NHS, disillusioned. His real ambition was to do research into Alzheimer's disease. \"He was surrounded by opportunities - all he had to do was decide what he wanted to do with them,\" Stead explains. \"I suggested that he needed to develop himself as a centre of excellence, to network with like-minded people. It was like watching a black and white television turn to colour.\" </p> <p>Few people's dreams involve finding a cure for an intractable disease, but no matter. The point is not to be hemmed in by your job description if you think you could do more; not to stay quiet in meetings if you have an idea that might just work; not to stay stuck in that rut until you get your gold watch, a pension and a pat on the back as you wander off into retirement wondering where the best years of your life went. And don't assume your boss will pour scorn on your efforts to steer your career in a new direction. \"Some companies do worry that if they offer career coaching, it will encourage workers to leave,\" says Stead. \"The opposite is true. A more focused individual is not only a happier person, but a better employee.\" Time to talk to the boss? </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong><br> Careers Design International: <a href=\"http://www.careersnet.com\">www.careersnet.com</a><br> Brook Street: <a href=\"http://www.brookstreet.co.uk\">www.brookstreet.co.uk</a><br> Careermoves: <a href=\"http://www.cmoves.co.uk\">www.cmoves.co.uk</a></p>",

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with workers from all walks of life (even doctors) calling into branches to find out more about the tagline on the ads: \"Whatever you want to do with your life, we'll show you how to make a career of it.\" Many of those interested had to be directed to other agencies (Brook Street deals mostly with secretarial staff), but Sullivan believes these attitudes are particularly relevant to temporary office workers. \"The job for life is dead,\" she insists. \"Now we have professional temps, who are temping for long periods, not because they have to, but because they like the change. You're no longer 'just' a temp: it's a career.\" The ads, she says, made this more obvious to workers and employers alike: \"It is possible to have a permanent attitude and be a temporary worker.\" You just need to reposition yourself with a new mindset. So if your personal \"corporate logo\" is in need of a revamp, where can you start? Temporary work can be an obvious way to change career direction. Jess Davis worked as an A&amp;R co-ordinator in the music business finding new bands, before moving on to a stint in television. But, she says, it didn't suit her and a rethink was necessary. She took a temporary job last year as an administrator at Career Moves, a recruitment consultancy specialising in jobs in the media, while thinking through her options. This turned into a six-month placement covering a sabbatical as office manager. \"Dealing with the clients seemed to come very naturally,\" she explains. \"I was looking for something new, and I knew I wanted to be in the music industry. I was in an advantageous position, because I had secretarial skills, so I could temp. But I also had my knowledge of music and I know a lot of people in the industry.\" Putting the two together to make a brand new career was the logical step. Fortunately, her bosses at Career Moves agreed; a training programme or two later, Davis is now a recruitment consultant in the music division of the company, finding for others the jobs she once yearned for herself. \"Some really juicy jobs do come in,\" she confesses. \"But someone took a chance on me once, and now I can do that for someone else. And they'll be doing what I know they'll love. It's dream job territory.\" She admits, however, that landing that ideal job does require extra efforts on the part of the hopeful candidate. \"You might have all the skills there, but it's like making a cake - you have to have all the ingredients in the right amounts for it to taste fantastic. Presentation and personality are 100% important.\" Stead agrees. \"You need to present yourself in the best light. And for that you need an idea of what you want to do with your life. What is your purpose, your mission, your dream?\" She cites the example of a young doctor who had left the NHS, disillusioned. His real ambition was to do research into Alzheimer's disease. \"He was surrounded by opportunities - all he had to do was decide what he wanted to do with them,\" Stead explains. \"I suggested that he needed to develop himself as a centre of excellence, to network with like-minded people. It was like watching a black and white television turn to colour.\" Few people's dreams involve finding a cure for an intractable disease, but no matter. The point is not to be hemmed in by your job description if you think you could do more; not to stay quiet in meetings if you have an idea that might just work; not to stay stuck in that rut until you get your gold watch, a pension and a pat on the back as you wander off into retirement wondering where the best years of your life went. And don't assume your boss will pour scorn on your efforts to steer your career in a new direction. \"Some companies do worry that if they offer career coaching, it will encourage workers to leave,\" says Stead. \"The opposite is true. A more focused individual is not only a happier person, but a better employee.\" Time to talk to the boss?

Evenings and weekends are when frazzled workers let down their guards with those who know them best, showing the sides they wouldn't dream of revealing to their bosses. </p> <p>What happens, though, when your manager urgently needs an important document, but you are still sulking with him for not doing the washing-up the night before? How do you cope if your boss is your partner, or your mother, or your sister? Working alongside a family member presents particular challenges that are rarely covered in management manuals and self-help books. But new research suggests that working with a partner or parent may be the most efficient way to run your business. </p> <p>\"While society disapproves of nepotism, it works better than ever,\" says Adam Kuper, professor of social anthropology at Brunel University, who conducted the research into family-run firms. For one thing, he says, relatives develop a stronger commitment because they are more likely to benefit from a firm's success. Even employees who aren't part of the family, he argues, gain from the fact that family firms may be more efficiently managed. Plus, raising capital from the family tends to be easier and comes with better terms than from a high street bank. </p> <p>Working with a family member can be particularly beneficial in a competitive business climate, according to chartered psychologist Ben Williams. Short-term contracts, high job insecurity and bullying management methods are rife in today's working culture, he argues, \"so the decision to work with your own or someone else's family can be just what's needed to provide you with a sense of permanence, motivation and freedom - and in turn effectiveness\". </p> <p>For support staff, Williams believes, the benefits can be particularly good. \"In small family businesses, everyone has to pitch in. So your role will probably be far wider than most secretaries'. In addition, the learning curve is steep. You'll make more mistakes but you'll be a lot more knowledgeable in the end. If you decide to move on, that experience is recognised as invaluable.\" </p> <p>Alison Ellis, 46, worked as her husband's PA in Manchester for 20 years. She says that although it was \"an unbelievably hard slog\", it was great fun. \"We had such a laugh. No boss, no one telling you to be in the office at a certain time, no one demanding that you only take three weeks holiday - and the chance to be together whenever we wanted. It was fantastic.\" Non-family members of the business, she claims, also benefited. \"The good atmosphere is catching.\" </p> <p>Those who work for their parents have even more to gain, claims Bridget Hogg, an occupational psychologist. \"They learn about the company informally as they grow up. If they go off to do training and then come back, which is an increasingly popular trend, they can also bring a sense of objectivity to the business.\" </p> <p>Claire Motler works as a PA for her step-father at Vogue Superstore in High Wycombe as well as living with him, her mother and siblings. \"I've worked for him on and off since I was about 12, delivering leaflets, selling my own stuff at his stores and so on,\" she says. \"I think that's made me really wise to exactly what it is that makes his business a success. And my experience with other companies has helped me learn how to make it even more of a success.\" </p> <p>But doesn't it get a little claustrophobic? Motler argues that working with relatives allows her to deal with their moods, and thus prevent tension brewing. \"At first, I found it hard to put on different hats. If I'd had an argument with him at home, I sulked at work. But I soon learned that's a sure way to make the business suffer.\" </p> <p>Before you rush off to hand in your notice to your current corporate boss and call your partner to insist that he or she does the same, however, think carefully, says workplace counsellor Thelma Williams. \"For some couples, and indeed other family members, the dynamic works because they have their time apart during the day. For those who need independence, it is only a good idea to go into business together if the work is not entirely office-based or if you have separate space in the evenings and in your social life.\" </p> <p>Indeed, research from the Industrial Society suggests that one of the biggest causes of family feuds is the family businesses. \"For richer, for poorer\" can be pushed to the limits, points out Thelma Williams, if the business doesn't reach its targets. There are particular risks of power struggles, she says, \"if there is a support role in the equation. That person may be made to feel inferior and less integral to the team.\" </p> <p>And if troubles can arise when you are married to the boss, what happens if you are the only staff member in a firm who isn't related to one of the directors? \"I knew of one family-run accountancy firm where non- relatives never got anywhere despite their skills,\" says Ben Williams. \"If it's a good company which uses objective consultants, that's unlikely to happen. But many don't.\" </p> <p>The biggest disadvantage of all, however, is that while family-owned businesses make up 60% of UK firms, fewer than a third of them survive to the second generation. According to the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), this failure is often down to a lack of planning. \"Many put family first and don't look at the future needs of the business,\" explains a spokesperson.

About half the workforce has a sarnie for lunch. The survey also found the cost of lunches has shot up - we pay \u00a31.98 on average, a 65% rise on the \u00a31.20 of 1990. Londoners pay the most at \u00a32.40 a day, while workers in the north east shell out just \u00a31.51. But at least we're allowing ourselves longer to digest our lunch, with an average break of 39 minutes, the longest for a decade. \u0095 FREELANCE FRIEND Those who like working to their own schedule may have found a friend in Smart Eric, the cartoon figurehead of a new website for freelance secretaries, administrators and book-keepers. The site offers advice to freelances, teleworkers, and companies looking for temporary or freelance staff.

The island is one of few remaining bastions of support for Mr Speight. Witnesses said they heard four or five shots as the rebels rampaged through Dreketi, a farming community near the town of Labasa. A group of 16 youths then took the hostages. For two hours there was an uneasy standoff before other villagers intervened and the rebels released their captives. A local resident, Rafaele Waqa, said: \"The young men agreed to release them and apologised to the families in the traditional way.\" The attack came as the Fijian military extended a deadline for another group of Mr Speight's supporters to release 40 soldiers they were holding at an army barracks nearby. The rebels have until noon today London time to free the soldiers and give themselves up or face \"drastic action\", according to the military spokesman, Major Howard Politini. Last week several reports emerged documenting random attacks on ethnic Indian communities by those still loyal to Mr Speight. Some unconfirmed accounts told of assaults and even rape of ethnic Indian women. Another standoff was defused yesterday when yet more rebels said they would hand back control of Fiji's largest hydroelectric power station following negotiations on the settlement of a land claim. These flashpoints are evidence that Fiji is still in a tense and fragile state after two and a half months of unrest and violence. The disgruntled indigenous Fijian businessman George Speight launched his coup attempt on May 19 when he stormed the parliament building in the capital Suva and took hostage dozens of officials including the ethnic Indian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, and his cabinet. Mr Speight yesterday remained under military arrest, having been moved to a smaller island off the coast of Suva. He could face treason charges for his orchestration of the coup. A new Fijian government was sworn in on Friday and has promised elections within the next three years. It is predominantly made up of indigenous Fijians but is said to include no outright Speight supporters. Mr Chaudhry, who arrived in Sydney yesterday for talks with the Australian prime minister, John Howard, disagrees. He was met at the airport by his Australian-based cousins and the media. \"There is a number of people in the [new] government who were active supporters of the coup so it cannot be considered a valid government,\" he said. He was due to have talks with Mr Howard today - at which he was expected to urge him to continue economic and political pressure against Fiji until a democratically elected government is reinstalled. He will also undergo a full medical check-up while in Australia. He said he was allowed only one meal a day while he was held captive.",

      "body": "<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when a Keynesian was as rare as an Englishman in Chelsea's back four. There were a few devotees of the General Theory knocking about in the lower divisions, but the real stars were the monetarists and the neo-classicists. According to the Thatcherites, Keynesianism was responsible for everything that was wrong with Britain - inflation, unemployment, tower blocks, welfare scroungers, the permissive society, single mothers, modern art. You name it. </p> <p>Now Keynes is being rehabilitated. Gordon Brown's lecture to the Royal Economic Society earlier this month was sprinkled with references to the great man, and the Treasury has started holding private seminars, titled Keynes in the 21st century. The big increase in departmental spending announced two weeks ago was, according to Brown's advisers, the beautiful Keynesian butterfly emerging from the ugly monetarist chrysalis. </p> <p>Before we get too carried away, however, it is worth noting that the rehabilitation of Keynes is only partial, with his works selectively culled to find the bits that suit current orthodoxy. As such, the view inside the Treasury is that Keynes was misinterpreted and the purity of his thought sullied by his followers. </p> <p>The real Keynes, they say, actually believed in low inflation, the need to remedy short-term market failure, and that tackling supply-side problems was the key to economic success.

      "bodyText": "There was a time, not so long ago, when a Keynesian was as rare as an Englishman in Chelsea's back four. There were a few devotees of the General Theory knocking about in the lower divisions, but the real stars were the monetarists and the neo-classicists. According to the Thatcherites, Keynesianism was responsible for everything that was wrong with Britain - inflation, unemployment, tower blocks, welfare scroungers, the permissive society, single mothers, modern art. You name it. Now Keynes is being rehabilitated. Gordon Brown's lecture to the Royal Economic Society earlier this month was sprinkled with references to the great man, and the Treasury has started holding private seminars, titled Keynes in the 21st century. The big increase in departmental spending announced two weeks ago was, according to Brown's advisers, the beautiful Keynesian butterfly emerging from the ugly monetarist chrysalis. Before we get too carried away, however, it is worth noting that the rehabilitation of Keynes is only partial, with his works selectively culled to find the bits that suit current orthodoxy. As such, the view inside the Treasury is that Keynes was misinterpreted and the purity of his thought sullied by his followers. The real Keynes, they say, actually believed in low inflation, the need to remedy short-term market failure, and that tackling supply-side problems was the key to economic success. In other words, were he alive today, Keynes would not actually be a Keynesian at all, but - surprise, surprise - a fully signed-up member of New Labour! This line of thinking is evident from the chancellor's lecture. Whereas Keynes made it clear in the very first chapter of the General Theory that \"the postulates of classical theory are applicable to a special case only\", Brown argued precisely the opposite - that it was the immediate post-war world that represented the special case. \"The stop-go policies which were wrongly said to be Keynesian attempted to tackle high unemployment and slow growth by pulling the macroeconomic levers but reflected an approach Keynes thought appropriate for depression bound economies where the confidence of the 'animal spirits' was low.\" The paper given to the Treasury's first Keynes seminar in the spring makes broadly the same point, although its significance is enhanced by the fact that the author - Professor Charlie Bean - has subsequently been appointed chief economist at the Bank of England. Prof Bean's elegant presentation was based on the film Sliding Doors, the one in which Gwyneth Paltrow operates in two different parallel universes. In this scenario, Keynes and his fictional son, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, meet on a tube train to discuss Brown's Mais lecture in November 1999. \"Well, father, what do you think of the lecture, and indeed of the government's economic policies in general?\", asks Maynard junior. \"I find much to commend, both in the general philosophy and in the detail,\" replies Maynard senior. Maynard junior says that his school of new Keynesians are comfortable with the idea of \"a helping hand from government\", even though they would place more emphasis than Maynard senior would on the \"importance of microeconomic structural measures to correct market failures\". The elder Keynes says it is \"absolutely right\" that pursuit of price stabilty should be the central objective of policy, and that the inflation target is a sound idea which should prevent a liquidity trap. For those interested in what the chancellor once called post neo-classical endogenous growth theory there is an interesting monograph by Khaled Hussein and Tony Thirlwall in the Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics which argues that there is nothing essentially new about new growth theory, and that the grand old Keynesian Nicholas Kaldor came up with the same insight in 1957. Maynard junior argues that recent history has shown that supply-side rigidities rather than a shortage of effective demand is primarily responsible for unemployment and gives his dad a little lecture about the benefits of new growth theory - the state's role in building up human capital and boosting investment in research and development - namely that developed economies do not display diminishing returns to capital.

      "bodyText": "In a report headed Hain steps up war on arms dealers, page 17, July 28, we said that the foreign office minister Peter Hain had \"named a Ukrainian, Victor Bout\", as one of the main people breaking sanctions against rebel forces in Angola. Mr Hain, did not identify Mr Bout by nationality or country of origin. Mr Bout is in fact Russian, said, in a UN report, to have been born in Smolensk. In the lead letter, page 21, July 13, the writers Professor Shalom Lappin and Dr Colin Shindler, took issue with the views expressed in an article published in the Guardian on March 24. Professor Lappin has asked us to point out that he was mistaken in attributing the article to Martin Kettle. It was by Martin Woollacott (Israel's two big wrongs don't make it right). The Russian sail training vessel is named Sedov, not Sedlov, as it appeared in Country Diary, page 18, July 28.

Sent to judge whether the diplomatic sanctions on Austria, imposed because of fears of the political character of Mr Haider's Freedom party (FPO), should be lifted, the three-man panel of EU representatives concluded their 72-hour investigative visit tight-lipped after refusing to meet the man at the eye of the storm. Dubbed the three wise men, former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari; former Spanish foreign minister Marcelino Oreja; and leading German lawyer Jochen Frowein were appointed earlier this month to monitor Austria's political behaviour. Their mission is widely considered as a face-saving exercise now that the EU's deadlock with Austria threatens to delay its internal reforms. The impasse began in February when the entry of the FPO into the Austrian coalition government prompted the other 14 EU members to impose sanctions. But Mr Haider, best known for his controversial remarks about the Nazi period, offered a typically cheeky response by presenting a bag of goodies to the panel, including his mascot teddy bear, a CD of folk songs and a promotional video of the southern province of Carinthia where he is governor.

Downe Hall was a battered but splendid listed 18th century mansion, in an overgrown garden laid out as a miniature Georgian country estate, in the market town of Bridport. Catherine Searle, a grandmother living in the town on income support, launched a campaign to stop expensive houses being built in the hall's grounds after reading a planning notice at the end of its drive. She lost, and the houses were built and sold after a campaign that went all the way to the House of Lords. But her crusade has had important national consequences. Because of the Downe Hall furore, English Heritage, the government's conservation adviser, changed its planning guidance to local authorities on \"enabling development\". This was a developer's ploy of the 1980s: requesting permission to break normal planning and listed building regulations as the only way to secure the future of a listed building. English Heritage now warns councils that enabling development should be allowed only in the most exceptional circumstances. Enabling development was the argument accepted by West Dorset district council when it gave planning permission for the houses, breaking its own development plan. English Heritage also speeded up work on updating its register of nationally important gardens. It had missed the significance of Downe Hall. The conservation societies are horrified at Ms Searle's plight. Her house is also listed, a two-up two-down ropemaker's cottage near Downe Hall.

She was in the WAAF quarters when, shortly after midnight on May 31, she heard the sound of an aircraft clearly in trouble - one engine was out - heading towards the airfield.</p> <p>Pulling on her clothes and grabbing her steel helmet, Pearson ran outside just as the aircraft crashed through trees and ploughed into a field. Ignoring warnings from guards, she dashed towards the airfield perimeter fence, opening the gate as she went for the ambulance and fire crews who would follow, and stumbled down an incline to the damaged aircraft. Others already at the scene were trying to drag the pilot clear of the wreckage.</p> <p>Shouting at them to let her deal with the airman, she told the men to get the fence down to allow the crash crews to come through. The aircraft was on fire, but Pearson began to pull the pilot away, although he was in such pain that she was forced to delay to give him what first aid she could. Despite his injuries, the pilot was able to warn her that the aircraft still had its full bomb load aboard. Desperate to get the pilot away, Pearson dragged him clear and into cover as the plane's fuel tanks exploded.</p> <p>She threw herself on top of the pilot to protect him from the blast and flying metal, and covered his head with her helmet as one of the air craft's 120 pound bombs went off. Corporal Pearson was giving the pilot further first aid, with the help of a soldier who had arrived, when there was another huge explosion. The blast knocked the rescuers off their feet and sent showers of flying metal and debris everywhere.</p> <p>When the ambulance and rescue crews arrived, Pearson went to help the medical officer to lift the stretcher over the fence, and the pilot was then taken to safety. The rest of the bombs went off, but, still ignoring the danger, Pearson ran back to the burning aircraft wreckage in search of the wireless operator; however, he was already dead. Later that morning, Corporal Pearson calmly reported for duty as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.</p> <p>The announcement of her award of the Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM) appeared on July 19, 1940, a few weeks after Daphne Pearson was commissioned as an Assistant Section Officer, WAAF. Her EGM was the first award made to a woman for gallantry in the second world war.</p> <p>Three months later, on September 24, 1940, came the announcement of the king's intention to create a new award that would bear his name, the George Cross. The EGM was to be abolished and all living holders, and those who had been awarded the medal since the outbreak of war, were required to exchange their insignia for the GC. Pearson was the first woman to receive the new award.</p> <p>Born in Mudeford, Hampshire, Pearson was the daughter of a clergyman, and educated at St Brandon's Clergy Daughters' School, Bristol. She had trained as a photographer and ran her own portrait studio in St Ives, Cornwall, for eight years, before ill health forced her to sell up and to change the direction of her career. At the beginning of the war, she was managing the retail fruit section of a large farm in Kent.</p> <p>A life-long aviation enthusiast, she had learned to fly and was only a few hours short of gaining her licence when hostilities put an end to civilian flying for the duration. For the rest of the war, despite bouts of ill health, Pearson served in postings with Bomber Command and in services recruiting. After she was demobilised in 1946, she began a job as assistant governor at a women's borstal at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, going to evening classes in horticulture. She later worked at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, as assistant to the keeper of the herbarium. Following a successful period running her own shop in Kew, which sold gardening equipment, flowers and fresh produce, in 1959 she emigrated to Australia.</p> <p>There, while working for the Department of Agriculture, she was able to combine her interest in flying with her knowledge of horticulture. For some years, she helped a friend run a farm outside Melbourne.</p> <p>Daphne Pearson was a woman of great character. Determined, robust and dignified, but with a great sense of humour, she was intensely patriotic. Although she spent 40 years in Australia, she never gave up her British passport and maintained close ties, returning \"home\" to Britain at least every other year. It was only failing health that forced her to miss the most recent reunion, 18 months ago in London, of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association.</p> <p>The striking portrait of her, painted in 1940 by Dame Laura Knight, now hangs in the Victoria Cross and George Cross Room at the Imperial War Museum, London.</p> <p>Daphne Pearson, WAAF and horticulturalist, born May 26 1911; died July 24 2000</p>",

Desperate to get the pilot away, Pearson dragged him clear and into cover as the plane's fuel tanks exploded. She threw herself on top of the pilot to protect him from the blast and flying metal, and covered his head with her helmet as one of the air craft's 120 pound bombs went off. Corporal Pearson was giving the pilot further first aid, with the help of a soldier who had arrived, when there was another huge explosion. The blast knocked the rescuers off their feet and sent showers of flying metal and debris everywhere. When the ambulance and rescue crews arrived, Pearson went to help the medical officer to lift the stretcher over the fence, and the pilot was then taken to safety. The rest of the bombs went off, but, still ignoring the danger, Pearson ran back to the burning aircraft wreckage in search of the wireless operator; however, he was already dead. Later that morning, Corporal Pearson calmly reported for duty as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. The announcement of her award of the Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM) appeared on July 19, 1940, a few weeks after Daphne Pearson was commissioned as an Assistant Section Officer, WAAF. Her EGM was the first award made to a woman for gallantry in the second world war. Three months later, on September 24, 1940, came the announcement of the king's intention to create a new award that would bear his name, the George Cross. The EGM was to be abolished and all living holders, and those who had been awarded the medal since the outbreak of war, were required to exchange their insignia for the GC. Pearson was the first woman to receive the new award. Born in Mudeford, Hampshire, Pearson was the daughter of a clergyman, and educated at St Brandon's Clergy Daughters' School, Bristol. She had trained as a photographer and ran her own portrait studio in St Ives, Cornwall, for eight years, before ill health forced her to sell up and to change the direction of her career. At the beginning of the war, she was managing the retail fruit section of a large farm in Kent. A life-long aviation enthusiast, she had learned to fly and was only a few hours short of gaining her licence when hostilities put an end to civilian flying for the duration. For the rest of the war, despite bouts of ill health, Pearson served in postings with Bomber Command and in services recruiting. After she was demobilised in 1946, she began a job as assistant governor at a women's borstal at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, going to evening classes in horticulture. She later worked at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, as assistant to the keeper of the herbarium. Following a successful period running her own shop in Kew, which sold gardening equipment, flowers and fresh produce, in 1959 she emigrated to Australia. There, while working for the Department of Agriculture, she was able to combine her interest in flying with her knowledge of horticulture. For some years, she helped a friend run a farm outside Melbourne. Daphne Pearson was a woman of great character. Determined, robust and dignified, but with a great sense of humour, she was intensely patriotic. Although she spent 40 years in Australia, she never gave up her British passport and maintained close ties, returning \"home\" to Britain at least every other year. It was only failing health that forced her to miss the most recent reunion, 18 months ago in London, of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. The striking portrait of her, painted in 1940 by Dame Laura Knight, now hangs in the Victoria Cross and George Cross Room at the Imperial War Museum, London. Daphne Pearson, WAAF and horticulturalist, born May 26 1911; died July 24 2000",

      "bodyText": "Australia has come under renewed fire from the United Nations for the way it treats its Aboriginal population. A report by the UN's Human Rights Committee released at the weekend chastised Australia for its mandatory sentencing laws - the compulsory jailing of offenders for minor crimes. Australia was also accused of failing to fully compensate the victims of the \"stolen generation\" - Aborigines who were forcibly removed from their families and brought up in white households. The report added that the high levels of social exclusion and poverty facing indigenous people were a matter of urgent concern, and that the present levels of protection and promotion of traditional Aboriginal forms of economy and sites of religious or cultural significance were inadequate. The Australian government came out fighting yesterday with the attorney general, Daryl Williams, saying that the administration had every reason to be proud of its human rights record. \"The government does not agree that many of the steps suggested by the committee are either necessary or desirable,\" he said. Many Australians have been calling on the government to do more to bring white and Aboriginal communities together, and to work towards a coalition. Thousands walked across the Sydney Harbour bridge two months ago to protest at the lack of governmental action. Some believe an apology is needed from the government for victims of the stolen generation, but the prime minister, John Howard, has steadfastly refused, saying that the government is not liable for the acts of previous administrations. Some Australians and media commentators reacted angrily to the UN's criticism yesterday, accusing it of trying to portray the country as an international pariah, such as South Africa under apartheid. A leading indigenous rights group, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, said the government should see the report as a positive document that could help it to comply with international treaties. The report praised Australia for enacting some anti-discrimination laws and for partially helping those taken away from their homes as children. But it clearly levelled its sights at mandatory sentencing, currently active in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Juveniles (under 17) convicted of their third home burglary get a 12-month minimum sentence in Western Australia. Juveniles aged 15-16 who have already been convicted of a property offence get a minimum 28-day sentence in the Northern Territory. Adults get at least 14 days for a first property offence in the Northern Territory, 90 days for a second and one year for further offences. The report said: \"Legislation regarding mandatory imprisonment, which led in many cases to imposition of punishments that were disproportionate to the seriousness of the crimes committed and would seem to be inconsistent with the strategies adopted by the state [Australia] to reduce the over-representation of indigenous persons in the criminal justice system, raised serious issues of compliance with ... the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights].\" Arrests of Aborigines are currently more than four times those of whites in the Northern Territory. \"In addition, the mandatory detention under the migration act of \"unlawful non-citizens\", including asylum-seekers, raised question of compliance with covenant,\" it said. The UN criticism comes just a couple of weeks after it emerged that Tony Blair's wife, Cherie Booth, in her role as a QC, was involved in presenting a case before the same committee, on behalf of Aborigines from the Northern Territory imprisoned for minor property offences. Irked by the case, Mr Howard accused the UN of butting its nose into Australian affairs. He will no doubt be further perturbed by this weekend's UN report.",

AP, Budapest Tremor shakes Japanese coast A strong earthquake jolted a string of islands off Tokyo yesterday, one of thousands of tremors to hit the area in recent weeks as a volcano rumbled back to life. The 6.2-magnitude quake hit hardest on Miyakejima, home to some 4,000 people about 200 miles south of Tokyo, where the volcanic Mount Oyama has spewed columns of ash several times this month. There were no reports of damage or injuries. AP, Tokyo Human cargo runs aground A ship carrying 418 illegal immigrants ran aground yesterday off southern Italy. Police said that the boat carried Kurds and other would-be immigrants from Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Senegal and elsewhere. Italian media said nearly 80 children were among them. The ship was towed to the Calabrian port of Crotone. AP, Crotone Russian theatre figure shot dead Sergei Isayev, the head of the Russian Academy for the Performing Arts, has been shot dead at his country house outside Moscow. NTV television reported that Mr Isayev was shot five times from outside the window of the room where his body was found. Mr Isayev, 49, had worked at the academy for 30 years. Police said they knew of no motive for the shooting, but did not rule out that Isayev was the victim of a contract killing. AP, Moscow Ransom paid to free journalist The German news weekly, Der Spiegel, has admitted paying Philippine rebels a ransom to secure the release of its reporter Andreas Lorenz after nearly four weeks in captivity. The magazine paid an unspecified \"exit fee\" through middlemen to secure his release. The Lost Command rebels who abducted Mr Lorenz are not linked to the Abu Sayyaf Muslim militants holding a group of tourists hostage on the Philippine island of Jolo. Reuters, Berlin",

      "body": "<p>Headteacher George Benham had laid on a barbecue, but the end of term staff party at Cardinal Hinsley high school was a subdued affair. Of 50 teachers at the Roman Catholic boys' school in Willesden, north-west London, 26 were leaving that day. Two others had left already</p> <p>Because so many were leaving, Mr Benham had requested there be no collections or presentations. He stayed 20 minutes for the sausages, burgers and sala. Though his deputy, Gerry Connolly, later said a few words of thanks to experienced staff, for those present (some of whom had worked at the school for more than 20 years) it was an anti-climactic finale.</p> <p>It was also the end of a difficult first year for Mr Benham, subject to intense criticism from staff when he unveiled a new management structure for September that would merge departments. Teachers were told they would have to re-apply for their jobs, and there were threats of up to six redundancies.</p> <p>As it turned out, so many left voluntarily that redundancies were not required. Eighteen new teachers have been appointed, and last week Mr Benham was interviewing for some of the remaining seven vacancies.</p> <p>So why did so many quit? It depends on who you ask. To Mr Benham and Brent council, the changes are an inevitable outcome of the reorganisation and of staff moving on to better jobs.</p> <p>Teachers tell a different story. Some spoke to the Guardian, though almost all were reluctant to go on the record, either because they were staying on or they did not want to be seen as disloyal by their new employers. The unions have tried to keep the school out of the media.</p> <p>Documents obtained by the Guardian include a letter by union representatives to the chairman of governors, John Fox, alleging that the school environment had become \"unsafe for pupils and staff\", and that Mr Benham was \"unwilling or unable to deal effectively with pupils' violent or disruptive behaviour\" and in consequence was \"jeopardising the safety of pupils and staff, and undermining teaching and learning\".</p> <p>He rejects the complaint, saying it was \"strategic game playing\" because of anxiety about the reorganisation. \"You are dealing partly with a side issue, as tactically how you approach a debate. They didn't want to deal with such a large scale change. We had some difficult kids, no question. Was the school dangerous in that sense? I don't believe it was.\"</p> <p>Mr Benham was already controversial when he arrived last September. A former director of education at Brent, he was the council's chief executive from 1995 until 1998, when he stepped down a year early with a \u00a3700,000 pay-off, including a car and an annual pension of \u00a351,768 brought forward 10 years. By his own admission, he was responsible for big cuts in teacher numbers at Brent.</p> <p>Cardinal Hinsley, a voluntary aided, former grant maintained school, has results below average and attracts a thin strand of middle class children. A third of pupils are local, the remainder from elsewhere, including some who cannot get in to the London Oratory.</p> <p><b> Respect</b><br> The school's last Ofsted report, in 1996, was broadly positive - \"a generally well ordered and supportive environment, based upon its Catholic ethos, in which pupils make sound academic progress and develop well socially,\" inspectors said. \"Pupils' behaviour is generally satisfactory and all relationships within the school are good, based on mutual respect.\"</p> <p>But pupil numbers were falling, and when the then head, Michael Metcalfe, announced plans for redundancies in the Easter of 1998, teachers passed a vote of no confidence in Mr Metcalfe in June 1998, a move kept secret from parents. In January 1999, he took early retirement. After the post was advertised but not filled, Mr Benham was approached by the Westminster diocese and agreed to take over.</p> <p>Abolition of grant maintained status lost the school opportunities for extra funding. Mr Benham says he arrived to face a deficit of \u00a3154,000, reserves used up, five years of falling pupil rolls, and a long-serving, relatively expensive staff.</p> <p>The thing about experienced staff, he said, was that \"it's brilliant for stability, it's difficult for economics\". He told teachers he would reorganise the school; he would be pro-active in recruiting pupils at local primary schools; and he was prepared to take on difficult children. A few weeks into the autumn term, the number of pupils had increased from 780 to 860, meaning more money under the funding formula.</p> <p>Mr Benham said five pupils expelled from other schools came to Cardinal Hinsley; in all perhaps \"six or seven genuinely difficult kids\". Other staff claim it was many more. \"He was very much in favour of the government's policy of social inclusion,\" says one senior teacher. (David Blunkett has set schools a target of reducing exclusions by a third.)</p> <p>Refugee children from Kosovo, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Sudan, many of whom could not speak English, came. Some Russian children arrived. Disruptive children among the intake encouraged the wilder elements of the existing intake. \"We seemed to have no way of coping with them. It's been such a volatile atmosphere,\" said one experienced senior teacher who was leaving.</p> <p>\"There was a lot more graffiti, a lot more challenging authority, a lot more aggressiveness towards teachers. They told you to eff off to your face, whereas before that just wasn't the case.\" Teachers say they were assaulted, women teachers say they were sexually harassed, and when a French teacher had a missile thrown at her in class, she called the police. The boy who did it, the son of a world famous athlete, has since been excluded.</p> <p>Though there was little racial tension, there were vicious fights. Nearby Roundwood Park became a battleground after school, often with pupils from Willesden high. Mr Benham brought forward the end of the school day so it did not coincide with Willesden's. Two weeks ago three Russian pupils were set upon. Incidents \"were happening so fast that you couldn't keep up with them ... there were so many fights\", said one teacher. Mr Benham himself said: \"We had a couple of really nasty incidents, and I mean really nasty incidents, of boys beating other boys up.\"</p> <p>Staff allege he failed to support efforts to discipline pupils, particularly for intimidation or violence against teachers. They claim he took the pupils' side, or allowed excluded pupils back in class too quickly.</p> <p>Liz Milton, a food technology teacher, says pupils quickly decided Mr Benham was a soft touch. \"I was assaulted this year, which has never happened to me before. Benham was totally unsympathetic. He said: 'The boys don't lie'.\" She adds: \"I have never seen so many women crying in the ladies as in the last year.\"</p> <p>A petition signed by 49 teachers and three secretaries on March 13 said: \"We must express deep concern and distress with regard to the sharp rise in physical and verbal attacks by the pupils on members of teaching and non-teaching staff. This is gravely affecting staff morale and we feel that the general decline in pupil behaviour seriously contravenes the Catholic ethos.\"</p> <p>After a staff meeting on June 29, teachers Gary Wallis and Stuart Reid, representatives of the teaching unions at the school, wrote a joint letter to the chairman of governors, Peter Fox. It said that the school was unsafe for both pupils and staff; that staff were deeply dissatisfied with the headteacher because he did not always believe staff who reported serious incidents to him, accepting rather the views of pupils. He \"frequently sends pupils who have threatened other pupils or members of staff back into the same class. We regard this as utterly unacceptable and thoroughly dangerous.\" It went on to say that the head did not consistently consult or involve the teachers concerned, or heads of year, on pupils' unacceptable behaviour, and did not consistently report to relevant staff action taken or targets set; he \"appears unwilling or unable to deal effectively with pupils' violent or disruptive behaviour\". It concluded: \"Conditions under which we are being asked to work and in which pupils are attempting to learn are not humanly acceptable.\"</p> <p>In reply, Mr Fox told them to first go to Mr Benham, \"in accordance with procedure\". Other governors are worried. Geraldine O'Sullivan said: \"I'm a parent governor so I'm doubly concerned. I keep saying to my son, 'do you feel OK, do you want to change schools?' We'll give it to Christmas and then see. I want to be loyal to the school, but I am not going to be loyal if my son suffers.\"</p> <p>A parent governor, Jeremy Travis, said he was concerned about discipline. \"There are quite a lot of issues really. The school does have quite serious problems at the moment. There have been a lot of new students just to try and get the numbers up. I think everyone is being accepted.\"</p> <p>Mr Benham denies ignoring teacher complaints. Pupils were excluded, he said; by the end of term, four had been expelled; and three more excluded pupils are believed to be awaiting the outcomes of appeals. He says he was careful not to prejudice appeals against exclusion.</p> <p>In a statement, Jacky Griffin, director of education at Brent, said: \"The school is working with the support of the education authority to address student behavioural problems that have been identified.\" CCTV cameras are being put in every classroom.</p> <p><b> Restructuring</b><br></p> <p>On March 13, Mr Benham announced his restructuring plan. \"Everybody knew I had to drive down costs ... Since they have all known me since I was director of education, [they] know that, if I said it was going to happen, it was going to happen.\"</p> <p>Five senior management posts are being merged into three; and, instead of 14 heads of department, there will be seven - turning \"14 lieutenants into seven majors\" as Mr Benham put it. Heads of year posts are also being merged.</p> <p>The teachers immediately fired off a protest, criticising him for failing to consult and condemning the likely loss of \"many long-serving and dedicated teachers\". According to teachers, many staff decided to leave after a difficult meeting with Mr Benham on April 6. They allege he said he expected the school would fail its next Ofsted inspection and believed it would be put under special measures. Mr Benham denies that form of words: \"I didn't expect it - I'm concerned that there is a danger of that,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>On April 10, staff condemned the \"lack of sound educational evidence behind the proposed restructuring\". Several resignations came in late. \"It surprised me on May 31 when I got a raft of resignations which I didn't have a handle on at all,\" said Mr Benham. \"I thought I'd done my numbers.\" The 28 departees are mostly off to new jobs. One has a promotion, to deputy head, though most are moving sideways or downwards. Four are taking early retirement, and one is ill.</p> <p>To say goodbye, they produced a souvenir pamphlet, The Great Escape, distributed between them. Garry Wallis wrote: \"I am full of mixed emotions, not really knowing whether to be happy or sad, but I do feel cheated! The circumstances in which 27 other colleagues and I are leaving, I believe, could have been avoided, and the repercussions of this 'escape' may not be known for some time.\"</p> <p>In a statement, Hank Roberts, Brent secretary for both the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"It was clearly a mistake to seek to make all the staff redundant and have to re-apply for their jobs. I believe the management of the school and the governors will have learnt from this and other problems, and adopt a more consensual approach in future.\"</p> <p>Mr Benham is \"90% delighted\" with how the restructuring has turned out. But he accepts: \"I have got some vacancies at a very difficult time in London ... London at the moment is crying out for teachers.\" He adds: \"We have got quality people. Some posts have been taken on at lower salary levels. Certainly next year we will be starting with a staff that has less staffroom experience, that's true. The senior management team has plenty of experience.\" There were \"a fair number\" of newly qualified teachers.</p> <p>Some of the old staff who will be there next term think about leaving, others want to see it through. \"There have been some very good years, and I think there'll be some to come. I am prepared to see where it goes next,\" said one. Brent does not appear unduly concerned. Jacky Griffin said: \"This is an exciting time for the school, which is embarking with great energy on an ambitious improvement strategy.\"</p>",

Liz Milton, a food technology teacher, says pupils quickly decided Mr Benham was a soft touch. \"I was assaulted this year, which has never happened to me before. Benham was totally unsympathetic. He said: 'The boys don't lie'.\" She adds: \"I have never seen so many women crying in the ladies as in the last year.\" A petition signed by 49 teachers and three secretaries on March 13 said: \"We must express deep concern and distress with regard to the sharp rise in physical and verbal attacks by the pupils on members of teaching and non-teaching staff. This is gravely affecting staff morale and we feel that the general decline in pupil behaviour seriously contravenes the Catholic ethos.\" After a staff meeting on June 29, teachers Gary Wallis and Stuart Reid, representatives of the teaching unions at the school, wrote a joint letter to the chairman of governors, Peter Fox. It said that the school was unsafe for both pupils and staff; that staff were deeply dissatisfied with the headteacher because he did not always believe staff who reported serious incidents to him, accepting rather the views of pupils. He \"frequently sends pupils who have threatened other pupils or members of staff back into the same class. We regard this as utterly unacceptable and thoroughly dangerous.\" It went on to say that the head did not consistently consult or involve the teachers concerned, or heads of year, on pupils' unacceptable behaviour, and did not consistently report to relevant staff action taken or targets set; he \"appears unwilling or unable to deal effectively with pupils' violent or disruptive behaviour\". It concluded: \"Conditions under which we are being asked to work and in which pupils are attempting to learn are not humanly acceptable.\" In reply, Mr Fox told them to first go to Mr Benham, \"in accordance with procedure\". Other governors are worried. Geraldine O'Sullivan said: \"I'm a parent governor so I'm doubly concerned. I keep saying to my son, 'do you feel OK, do you want to change schools?' We'll give it to Christmas and then see. I want to be loyal to the school, but I am not going to be loyal if my son suffers.\" A parent governor, Jeremy Travis, said he was concerned about discipline. \"There are quite a lot of issues really. The school does have quite serious problems at the moment. There have been a lot of new students just to try and get the numbers up. I think everyone is being accepted.\" Mr Benham denies ignoring teacher complaints. Pupils were excluded, he said; by the end of term, four had been expelled; and three more excluded pupils are believed to be awaiting the outcomes of appeals. He says he was careful not to prejudice appeals against exclusion. In a statement, Jacky Griffin, director of education at Brent, said: \"The school is working with the support of the education authority to address student behavioural problems that have been identified.\" CCTV cameras are being put in every classroom. Restructuring On March 13, Mr Benham announced his restructuring plan. \"Everybody knew I had to drive down costs ... Since they have all known me since I was director of education, [they] know that, if I said it was going to happen, it was going to happen.\" Five senior management posts are being merged into three; and, instead of 14 heads of department, there will be seven - turning \"14 lieutenants into seven majors\" as Mr Benham put it. Heads of year posts are also being merged. The teachers immediately fired off a protest, criticising him for failing to consult and condemning the likely loss of \"many long-serving and dedicated teachers\". According to teachers, many staff decided to leave after a difficult meeting with Mr Benham on April 6. They allege he said he expected the school would fail its next Ofsted inspection and believed it would be put under special measures. Mr Benham denies that form of words: \"I didn't expect it - I'm concerned that there is a danger of that,\" he told the Guardian. On April 10, staff condemned the \"lack of sound educational evidence behind the proposed restructuring\". Several resignations came in late. \"It surprised me on May 31 when I got a raft of resignations which I didn't have a handle on at all,\" said Mr Benham. \"I thought I'd done my numbers.\" The 28 departees are mostly off to new jobs. One has a promotion, to deputy head, though most are moving sideways or downwards. Four are taking early retirement, and one is ill. To say goodbye, they produced a souvenir pamphlet, The Great Escape, distributed between them. Garry Wallis wrote: \"I am full of mixed emotions, not really knowing whether to be happy or sad, but I do feel cheated! The circumstances in which 27 other colleagues and I are leaving, I believe, could have been avoided, and the repercussions of this 'escape' may not be known for some time.\" In a statement, Hank Roberts, Brent secretary for both the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"It was clearly a mistake to seek to make all the staff redundant and have to re-apply for their jobs. I believe the management of the school and the governors will have learnt from this and other problems, and adopt a more consensual approach in future.\" Mr Benham is \"90% delighted\" with how the restructuring has turned out. But he accepts: \"I have got some vacancies at a very difficult time in London ... London at the moment is crying out for teachers.\" He adds: \"We have got quality people. Some posts have been taken on at lower salary levels. Certainly next year we will be starting with a staff that has less staffroom experience, that's true. The senior management team has plenty of experience.\" There were \"a fair number\" of newly qualified teachers. Some of the old staff who will be there next term think about leaving, others want to see it through. \"There have been some very good years, and I think there'll be some to come. I am prepared to see where it goes next,\" said one. Brent does not appear unduly concerned. Jacky Griffin said: \"This is an exciting time for the school, which is embarking with great energy on an ambitious improvement strategy.\"",

      "bodyText": "A British Airways Concorde bound for New York was diverted to Canada last night after passengers complained about a petrol-like smell in the cabin, a spokeswoman for the airline said. British Airways, which resumed its supersonic flights last Wednesday, the day after the crash in France that claimed 114 lives, said the flight from Heathrow airport landed at Gander, Newfoundland and was grounded pending safety checks. \"It is purely a precautionary measure,\" said the spokeswoman, Jemma Moore. \"The captain became aware of smell at rear of the cabin and we never take any chances.\" Following the safety checks, the flight was expected to proceed to New York, she added. The unscheduled landing in Canada was the second time yesterday that a British Airways Concorde flight experienced problems. Earlier in the day, a Concorde also bound for New York was delayed by more than an hour at Heathrow airport because of a technical fault with its refuelling system, forcing the company to use a backup plane. The airline declined to give further details but said that the problem was \"specific to the plane involved\". The passengers later arrived safely in New York. The two incidents came as French investigators said that the flames that spewed from the wing of an Air France Concorde minutes before it crashed last Tuesday were probably due to a massive fuel leak rather than an engine problem. The French Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA) said that part of the debris found on the runway of Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, where the plane took off, appeared to come from a fuel tank. This bolsters the theory that one or more tyres ruptured on takeoff, spewing debris that pierced a part of the plane near one of the engines, leading to a fire. \"The flames seen after takeoff do not originate from an engine but, most likely, from an important fuel leak,\" it said in a statement. The BEA, which heads the technical inquiry into the disaster, had previously said that as many as two of the tyres may have burst before takeoff. The Concorde, bound for New York, plunged into a hotel in Gonesse, four miles south-west of the airport, within minutes of taking off, killing all 109 on board and five people on the ground. Despite fears over the aircraft's safety, Air France is expected to follow BA's lead and resume flights in the next few days. The transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, will meet international aviation experts today to discuss possible new safety measures before he approves the resumption. After first focusing on a last-minute repair to a thrust reverser, aviation experts are increasingly focusing on the theory of a burst tyre and damage to the undercarriage. Chunks of rubber and metal may have punctured a fuel tank and damaged the engines, turning the 25-year-old jet into what one expert called \"a giant cigarette lighter\".
