Negotiations between the London exchange and the Deutsche Borse of Germany are understood to have been successfully concluded and one City source said last night that it was now up to London to cement the deal. Assuming executives at the London exchange are able to agree among themselves on terms the union is expected to be announced next week, in time for the May 4 deadline imposed by the Germans. The deal is understood to be structured around the creation of a new company, with the two exchanges taking an equal stake. Nasdaq, the high-tech stock market in the US, which was thought to have been involved in three-way talks, is not expected to be included at this stage but may be invited to join the alliance in the coming weeks. The German exchange is expected to delay its plans for an initial public offering. May 4 was set as the deadline for the talks because this was the day the exchange was due to issue its prospectus. London is in the process of demutualising to become a privately-owned company, enabling it to take a 50% stake in the new company. The London exchange has persuaded the Deutsche Borse to exclude its clearing business interests from the negotiations which, if included, would have given the German exchange a larger stake in any combined company. That raised the prospect of the London exchange being criticised of selling out to the newer German exchange, which has been more successful than London in developing a market for high technology stocks. The move to create a new exchange, which will probably be headed by the Frankfurt exchange's chief executive Werner Seifert, is expected to be interpreted by the Paris Bourse as a sign that it is being frozen out of any pan-European alliance.

TIW When the 13 bidders lined up for the auction of next generation mobile phone licences eight weeks ago, few people would have put their money on little-known Telesystem International Wireless. Yet the Montreal-based company yesterday saw off competition from higher-profile candidates Virgin, MCI WorldCom, Global Crossing and NTL.

TIW is a regular participant in beauty parades held for conventional mobile phone licences and recently partnered British Telecom in a failed bid to run a network in Hungary. In January Hutchison Whampoa, which is partnering TIW in its mobile venture in Britain, took a 5% stake in the Canadian operator. One2One The smallest of the four networks in Britain, One2One, launched in 1993 as a venture between Cable &amp; Wireless and American telecoms firm US West. The company was the first digital network in Britain but in its early years suffered from a series of marketing gaffes - including free weekend and evening calls, which led to consumers not using them at any other time. In recent years its performance has improved and the originally limited network, which now covers 98% of the population, has just over 5m customers. The For Sale sign was hoisted over One2One last year. Germany's Deutsche Telekom agreed a deal to buy it for \u00a38.4bn.

The company launched in 1994 and was the first network to develop a strong consumer brand. It now has over 6m customers.

      "body": "<p>Egil Olsen's fragile grasp on Wimbledon's managerial hot seat appeared to weaken further yesterday when the club unveiled their new assistant manager Terry Burton. </p> <p>Burton was Joe Kinnear's right-hand man before becoming academy director on Olsen's arrival and the move, reportedly made at the behest of the club's senior players, appears to isolate Olsen, something that Burton was predictably keen to deny. \"The spirit in training has been excellent and everyone is 100% behind the manager,\" he said. </p> <p>This, however, is not the signal that has been coming from the dressing room. Many of the most influential players have been linked with moves away from the club, including Neil Sullivan, who will be available on a free transfer, Jason Euell, John Hartson, Ben Thatcher, Michael Hughes and Carl Cort. </p> <p>Cort said this week: \"If the players are less confident in the formation and have no confidence in the manager they will not perform well. I'm having to think about my career, and if we go down I'll think even deeper.\" </p> <p>Olsen had hinted that Burton's appointment might be a stopgap measure. \"The main reason for Terry's appointment is the situation we are in,\" he said. \"After a lot of defeats you need to do something and that's what we have done. It's a positive decision and it could be good.\" He added: \"I don't believe the things that Carl Cort is reported to have said. I have not seen the English papers but you cannot trust the tabloids. It is not true at all.\" </p> <p>Burton said: \"I don't see this as a short-term appointment, but who knows what will happen in football?\" </p> <p>With Sunday's crucial relegation decider at Bradford looming, Olsen has strangely decided to take a few days off to collect an award in Norway. </p> <p>\"The Norwegian FA's highest honour is their gold award, which has gone to only three or four people before Egil,\" said the first-team coach Lars Tjernaas. \"In nine years he took Norway from a land of eskimos to the No2 international team in the world. Normally the award goes to ex-presidents who are about 176 years old.\" </p> <p>If Olsen should leave, one suggested replacement is Aage Hareide, the first Norwegian to play in England when he moved to Manchester City in 1983. \"That's news to me,\" he said when told of the speculation. He is currently managing Brondby, whom he joined in January after winning the Swedish league title with Helsingborg last year. He previously worked at the Norwegian club Molde with Bjorn Gjelsten, now Wimbledon's co-owner.</p>",

I'm having to think about my career, and if we go down I'll think even deeper.\" Olsen had hinted that Burton's appointment might be a stopgap measure. \"The main reason for Terry's appointment is the situation we are in,\" he said. \"After a lot of defeats you need to do something and that's what we have done. It's a positive decision and it could be good.\" He added: \"I don't believe the things that Carl Cort is reported to have said. I have not seen the English papers but you cannot trust the tabloids. It is not true at all.\" Burton said: \"I don't see this as a short-term appointment, but who knows what will happen in football?\" With Sunday's crucial relegation decider at Bradford looming, Olsen has strangely decided to take a few days off to collect an award in Norway. \"The Norwegian FA's highest honour is their gold award, which has gone to only three or four people before Egil,\" said the first-team coach Lars Tjernaas. \"In nine years he took Norway from a land of eskimos to the No2 international team in the world. Normally the award goes to ex-presidents who are about 176 years old.\" If Olsen should leave, one suggested replacement is Aage Hareide, the first Norwegian to play in England when he moved to Manchester City in 1983. \"That's news to me,\" he said when told of the speculation. He is currently managing Brondby, whom he joined in January after winning the Swedish league title with Helsingborg last year. He previously worked at the Norwegian club Molde with Bjorn Gjelsten, now Wimbledon's co-owner.",

Lewis was today criticised by ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin after it was revealed that there was insufficient evidence to press ahead with an investigation into match-fixing among the England side. </p> <p>In a strongly-worded letter to the counties refuting Lewis' claims, the ECB said they had taken no action after being furnished with the names of three England players which he claimed sports promoter Ashim Kheterpal had told him had taken money to influence matches. </p> <p>Lewis was hauled before the ECB two weeks ago after revealing details of the allegations in a paid newspaper article. </p> <p>He has since been booed while appearing for Leicestershire in a Benson &amp; Hedges game against Lancashire at Old Trafford this week and agent Gareth James is concerned that his player is being made a scapegoat. </p> <p>\"It doesn't make sense,\" said James, barely able to control his emotions at today's events. \"As soon as Chris was approached, he went straight to the ECB and now we are having to read a complete re-invention of our meeting with them. </p> <p>\"At the time, it was agreed between myself, Chris and Simon Pack at the ECB, that it wouldn't be any use revealing the names of the three people involved because there was no proof and the whole thing had probably been invented by Kheterpal anyway. </p> <p>\"Then a couple of weeks after that, Chris was contacted by someone at the ECB who said he should go to the police, which he did. </p> <p>\"At no stage during that time did the ECB ever ask for the names of the three England players - if they had Chris would have supplied them. </p> <p>\"Either Lord MacLaurin has been completely misled - or I hate to think of the other option.\" </p> <p>James also rejected MacLaurin's assertion that there was no independent witness at the initial meeting between Lewis and the ECB who could recollect the precise nature of the conversation. \"Simon Pack was took a padful of notes and I would like to see them,\" he said. \"The gloves are off in this case because Chris has done everything right, yet he is the one getting the stick. </p> <p>\"I have no problem with the findings of the inquiry but it amazes me that it took so long to reach adecision because the only information the ECB didn't have before was the names of the three players - and that was because they never asked for them.\" </p> <p>The day's dramatic events began with the ECB issuing a statement through Gerard Elias QC, chairman of their disciplinary committee, clearing England players past and present of any involvement of match-fixing. </p> <p>Their response to Lewis' allegations, however, was far more forthright with MacLaurin stressing: \"I'm satisfied there is no foundation whatsoever in the idea that those involved at the Board were not interested in the information that was made available by Chris Lewis. </p> <p>\"To suggest that the Board did not seek to establish immediately from Chris Lewis the names of the England players allegedly involved as soon as this information was divulged is unbelievable.\" </p> <p>MacLaurin also claimed there was \"no truth\" in accusations of a cover-up and dismissed allegations that the Board leaked the story as \"unrealistic and untrue\" and claimed only six Board members knew of the story including himself, chief executive Tim Lamb, International Teams Director Simon Pack and chairman of selectors David Graveney. </p> <p>\"For the Board to have leaked details of this case would only have served to undermine the very investigation which it had instigated,\" insisted MacLaurin. \"The allegations are utterly refuted and I hope this will lay to rest any suspicion that the Board has acted improperly.\" </p> <p>But having dismissed all of Lewis' revelations, MacLaurin has stopped short of implementing disciplinary action against him for bringing the game into disrepute and urged cricket followers to allow him to continue with his career. </p> <p>\"We have no reason to take action against him,\" explained MacLaurin. \"He came to us and it showed a lot of guts to come forward - we don't wish to discourage anybody coming to us with information that may be important. </p> <p>\"We also have no reason to be embarrassed. We dealt with situation entirely properly and, if we had our time over again, we would deal with it in exactly the same fashion. </p> <p>He added: \"It's very sad for a sportsman like Chris to put up with jeers from the fans - he should now be allowed to continue his career.\" </p>",

He has since been booed while appearing for Leicestershire in a Benson &amp; Hedges game against Lancashire at Old Trafford this week and agent Gareth James is concerned that his player is being made a scapegoat. \"It doesn't make sense,\" said James, barely able to control his emotions at today's events. \"As soon as Chris was approached, he went straight to the ECB and now we are having to read a complete re-invention of our meeting with them. \"At the time, it was agreed between myself, Chris and Simon Pack at the ECB, that it wouldn't be any use revealing the names of the three people involved because there was no proof and the whole thing had probably been invented by Kheterpal anyway. \"Then a couple of weeks after that, Chris was contacted by someone at the ECB who said he should go to the police, which he did. \"At no stage during that time did the ECB ever ask for the names of the three England players - if they had Chris would have supplied them. \"Either Lord MacLaurin has been completely misled - or I hate to think of the other option.\" James also rejected MacLaurin's assertion that there was no independent witness at the initial meeting between Lewis and the ECB who could recollect the precise nature of the conversation. \"Simon Pack was took a padful of notes and I would like to see them,\" he said. \"The gloves are off in this case because Chris has done everything right, yet he is the one getting the stick. \"I have no problem with the findings of the inquiry but it amazes me that it took so long to reach adecision because the only information the ECB didn't have before was the names of the three players - and that was because they never asked for them.\" The day's dramatic events began with the ECB issuing a statement through Gerard Elias QC, chairman of their disciplinary committee, clearing England players past and present of any involvement of match-fixing. Their response to Lewis' allegations, however, was far more forthright with MacLaurin stressing: \"I'm satisfied there is no foundation whatsoever in the idea that those involved at the Board were not interested in the information that was made available by Chris Lewis. \"To suggest that the Board did not seek to establish immediately from Chris Lewis the names of the England players allegedly involved as soon as this information was divulged is unbelievable.\" MacLaurin also claimed there was \"no truth\" in accusations of a cover-up and dismissed allegations that the Board leaked the story as \"unrealistic and untrue\" and claimed only six Board members knew of the story including himself, chief executive Tim Lamb, International Teams Director Simon Pack and chairman of selectors David Graveney. \"For the Board to have leaked details of this case would only have served to undermine the very investigation which it had instigated,\" insisted MacLaurin. \"The allegations are utterly refuted and I hope this will lay to rest any suspicion that the Board has acted improperly.\" But having dismissed all of Lewis' revelations, MacLaurin has stopped short of implementing disciplinary action against him for bringing the game into disrepute and urged cricket followers to allow him to continue with his career. \"We have no reason to take action against him,\" explained MacLaurin. \"He came to us and it showed a lot of guts to come forward - we don't wish to discourage anybody coming to us with information that may be important. \"We also have no reason to be embarrassed. We dealt with situation entirely properly and, if we had our time over again, we would deal with it in exactly the same fashion. He added: \"It's very sad for a sportsman like Chris to put up with jeers from the fans - he should now be allowed to continue his career.\"",

      "bodyText": "The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, yesterday formally opened the World Education Forum in Dakar, and accused politicians of failing children and ignoring human rights. The ceremony itself, at the lavish Meridien Hotel, added weight to the belief that senior politicians ignore the educational needs of the poorest people. Just three government leaders - none from the richest countries - were present, and most of the invited world statesmen failed to arrive. And, while representatives from grassroots groups from all over the world clamoured to attend the opening, and thousands of children and teachers demonstrated outside, Mr Annan launched the conference in front of a crowd of mostly junior ministers, diplomats and bureaucrats. \"It is shameful,\" said one woman who was denied entry despite representing a coalition of more than 400 non-governmental groups covering more than 2m teachers. Mr Annan, who could barely hide his frustration, told the conference that \"125m children, 880m adults and a quarter of a billion children working in hazardous or unhealthy conditions ... are being denied a fundamental human right spelt out in international instruments their governments have signed on to\". He added that \"the communities where they live are being denied a future labour force of healthy, literate and employable citizens, they are being denied the foundations for development and a future place in the global economy. They are being denied the future itself.\" To the annoyance of some governments, Mr Annan concentrated on the need to give girls an elementary education and restore their human rights. \"Of the more than 110m children who should be in school and who are not, two-thirds are girls.

Mr Annan specifically endorsed the Global Action Plan, a non-governmental initiative from Oxfam, ActionAid and development groups in 180 countries which is gathering strength in Dakar. There is a growing realisation within governments, the UN and financial institutions that unless elements of the plan are adopted by the conference, Dakar will be condemned as just another talking shop which achieves nothing and the UN system will be further discredited. The action plan will be further endorsed today when the head of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, announces a fast-track initiative to bring education to everyone in some countries within a few years. Mr Wolfensohn intends to throw the bank's resources behind countries which agree to put education at the heart of development and which come up with plans to work with non-governmental groups and the private sector. No country with a viable action plan will be held back by a lack of financial or technical resources, he is expected to tell the conference. However, the bank is treading on politically delicate ground, and is expected to be accused of muscling in on traditional UN territory and upsetting some major donors who do not accept that new money is available or needed.",

      "bodyText": "The trial of two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing will go ahead in Holland as planned on May 3, the trial judge ruled today. The presiding judge, Lord Ranald Sutherland rejected a prosecution request for an eight-week postponement to give more time to assess the evidence, at a hearing in the specially constructed court house at Camp Zeist, Holland. Lord Sutherland based his decision on the fact that Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima had already been in custody for more than 400 days - an unprecedented length of time under Scottish law, which is the terms on which the unique case is being heard. \"I am not satisfied that a postponement is necessary,\" he said. Prosecutors in the trial applied for postponement of the much-anticipated case on Tuesday, claiming that they had not been given sufficient access to lists of defence witnesses and evidence. Last Thursday, the defence said they would be calling 119 witnesses, most of whom are from Libya, although others are scattered across Malta, Sweden, Germany and the United States. At a pre-trial hearing, lawyers for the accused revealed plans to try to prove that others were responsible for the bombing of the Boeing 747 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie which killed 270 people. Under a deal brokered by the United Nations last year, Libya handed over the two men to stand trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law at a former US military base ceded to Britain for the trial. Shortly before Christmas last year the defence was granted a postponement to prepare the case. Jim Swire, head of UK Families Flight 103, said that any further postponement would be unwelcome, but that if it improved the quality of the defence or prosecution, they would accept the judge's decision.",

      "body": "<p>Clifton McGowan, the brother of one of the two black men found hanged in Telford, admitted yesterday that it might be impossible to charge and convict the racists who, he says, were responsible for double murder.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Mr McGowan said the police effort may have come too late and that detectives were still trying to \"fob them off\" with excuses.</p> <p>\"On a scale of one to 10, I would say the chances of finding and convicting the murderers is minus 5, especially when you consider the track record of the police so far. It is a very, very long shot.</p> <p>\"But nothing else will be acceptable to the family. I am hopeful the truth will come out one day, but it might take years.\"</p> <p>Mr McGowan said he blamed the West Mercia force for the death of his 20-year-old nephew Jason who was found hanging from iron railings on New Year's Day, six months after his uncle Harold \"Errol\" McGowan, 34, was found dead. Both men had suffered racial abuse and death threats in the months before they died.</p> <p>Clifton McGowan offered fresh evidence to support the family's claim that the police were too quick to dismiss Errol's death as suicide.</p> <p>\"Six to eight weeks after he died a white man gave a statement to the police in which he named the men who had killed Errol. He said to the police 'I know who killed Errol'.</p> <p>\"Before he gave the statement he was threatened that if he ever told anyone what he knew then he would end up the same way as Errol.</p> <p>\"Jason approached him and persuaded him to speak up. I cannot give you his name and I have never spoken about this before. You would've thought that this would have been investigated properly by the police but it wasn't.</p> <p>\"Two weeks later this man's house was raided. The police said they'd had a tip-off he was hiding stolen goods, but he wasn't. I'm not sure whether the police have re-interviewed him since. I have not been told.\"</p> <p>West Mercia police last night said they had been given several names of racists who had allegedly been harassing Errol but could not confirm the details.</p> <p>Mr McGowan, who has been at the forefront of the campaign to have the deaths re-investigated, was also withering about Jack Straw, saying the home secretary had not been in touch with the family since a meeting at the beginning of March despite a pledge that he would get back to them swiftly.</p> <p>Since January the chief constable of West Mercia, Peter Hampson, has apologised for the way his officers \"reached premature conclusions\" over the deaths and ordered a further inquiry run by Detective Superintendent Mel Shore.</p> <p>With the support of the solicitor Imran Khan, who acts for the family of Stephen Lawrence, the McGowans have also secured an overseeing role for Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force headed by Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve.</p> <p>Mr Grieve has said the deaths are being investigated \"on the presumption of foul play\". He defined foul play as including murder, manslaughter, complicity in another person's suicide and obstructing the coroner.</p> <p>Although both Errol and Jason were the victims of racial abuse before they died, whether they were murdered or not remains far from clear.</p> <p>Errol, a father of three, was found hanged from a door knob by the flex of an iron on July 2 last year.</p> <p>He had complained about racist abuse from men he had turned away from the pub where he worked as a doorman, and had talked about leaving Telford for good.</p> <p>But there were no marks or bruises on his body and there appeared to be no evidence that he was drugged. Jason is known to have been deeply disturbed by the death. He began investigating the circumstances and found he was being targeted for similar abuse.</p> <p>He was found hanging by his belt from railings near the pub where hours earlier he had been celebrating millennium eve. There were no marks or bruises on his body.</p> <p>Talk of a Combat 18 cell operating in Telford has been dismissed by the police and Searchlight, the anti-fascist magazine which monitors far right activity.</p> <p>Clifton McGowan accepts there is a huge difference between racial abuse and cold-blooded murder. But he is convinced that Errol would not have taken his own life.</p> <p>They were very close and he believes his brother would have \"poured his heart out to me\" if he had felt really depressed.</p> <p>\"I believe Errol was trapped in the house by more than one person. The police say there was no sign of a struggle but there are ways of immobilising people.</p> <p>\"And I blame the police for Jason's death. He was trying to do their job for them.\"</p> <p>He described how he received a call on his mobile phone last December. The voice said \"McGowan? If you lot don't back off this Errol thing, one of you will pay.\"</p> <p>Mr McGowan added: \"On January 1 they carried out their threat. Jason was finding things out. People were pointing the finger at certain people. Something was happening, that's for sure. He was getting very close.</p> <p>\"If the police convict people of racist offences for what happened to Errol before he died, that will not be consolation. I want to see them catch the men who murdered Errol and Jason.\"</p> <p>Mr McGowan believes the current investigation will end up with the family being fobbed off with excuses.</p> <p>\"The police will say they can not do anything because it is too late. They will say they do not have enough clues to work on because it has been such a long time since Errol died. I think the clues are still there and it's a matter of pulling them all together.</p> <p>\"People will not speak up when they are concerned for their own safety. In time, things will move on and slowly the information will come out. The truth will become transparent.</p> <p>\"The police have their own mindset. They are patronising us in a way hoping that we will go away and that media interest will slow down so they can get out of the spotlight.</p> <p>\"I am not going to give up, no matter how long it takes. I'm going to keep on asking the questions they don't want to answer.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Clifton McGowan, the brother of one of the two black men found hanged in Telford, admitted yesterday that it might be impossible to charge and convict the racists who, he says, were responsible for double murder. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Mr McGowan said the police effort may have come too late and that detectives were still trying to \"fob them off\" with excuses. \"On a scale of one to 10, I would say the chances of finding and convicting the murderers is minus 5, especially when you consider the track record of the police so far. It is a very, very long shot. \"But nothing else will be acceptable to the family. I am hopeful the truth will come out one day, but it might take years.\" Mr McGowan said he blamed the West Mercia force for the death of his 20-year-old nephew Jason who was found hanging from iron railings on New Year's Day, six months after his uncle Harold \"Errol\" McGowan, 34, was found dead. Both men had suffered racial abuse and death threats in the months before they died. Clifton McGowan offered fresh evidence to support the family's claim that the police were too quick to dismiss Errol's death as suicide. \"Six to eight weeks after he died a white man gave a statement to the police in which he named the men who had killed Errol. He said to the police 'I know who killed Errol'. \"Before he gave the statement he was threatened that if he ever told anyone what he knew then he would end up the same way as Errol. \"Jason approached him and persuaded him to speak up. I cannot give you his name and I have never spoken about this before. You would've thought that this would have been investigated properly by the police but it wasn't. \"Two weeks later this man's house was raided. The police said they'd had a tip-off he was hiding stolen goods, but he wasn't. I'm not sure whether the police have re-interviewed him since. I have not been told.\" West Mercia police last night said they had been given several names of racists who had allegedly been harassing Errol but could not confirm the details. Mr McGowan, who has been at the forefront of the campaign to have the deaths re-investigated, was also withering about Jack Straw, saying the home secretary had not been in touch with the family since a meeting at the beginning of March despite a pledge that he would get back to them swiftly. Since January the chief constable of West Mercia, Peter Hampson, has apologised for the way his officers \"reached premature conclusions\" over the deaths and ordered a further inquiry run by Detective Superintendent Mel Shore. With the support of the solicitor Imran Khan, who acts for the family of Stephen Lawrence, the McGowans have also secured an overseeing role for Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force headed by Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve. Mr Grieve has said the deaths are being investigated \"on the presumption of foul play\". He defined foul play as including murder, manslaughter, complicity in another person's suicide and obstructing the coroner. Although both Errol and Jason were the victims of racial abuse before they died, whether they were murdered or not remains far from clear. Errol, a father of three, was found hanged from a door knob by the flex of an iron on July 2 last year. He had complained about racist abuse from men he had turned away from the pub where he worked as a doorman, and had talked about leaving Telford for good. But there were no marks or bruises on his body and there appeared to be no evidence that he was drugged. Jason is known to have been deeply disturbed by the death. He began investigating the circumstances and found he was being targeted for similar abuse. He was found hanging by his belt from railings near the pub where hours earlier he had been celebrating millennium eve. There were no marks or bruises on his body. Talk of a Combat 18 cell operating in Telford has been dismissed by the police and Searchlight, the anti-fascist magazine which monitors far right activity. Clifton McGowan accepts there is a huge difference between racial abuse and cold-blooded murder. But he is convinced that Errol would not have taken his own life. They were very close and he believes his brother would have \"poured his heart out to me\" if he had felt really depressed. \"I believe Errol was trapped in the house by more than one person. The police say there was no sign of a struggle but there are ways of immobilising people. \"And I blame the police for Jason's death. He was trying to do their job for them.\" He described how he received a call on his mobile phone last December. The voice said \"McGowan? If you lot don't back off this Errol thing, one of you will pay.\" Mr McGowan added: \"On January 1 they carried out their threat. Jason was finding things out. People were pointing the finger at certain people. Something was happening, that's for sure. He was getting very close. \"If the police convict people of racist offences for what happened to Errol before he died, that will not be consolation. I want to see them catch the men who murdered Errol and Jason.\" Mr McGowan believes the current investigation will end up with the family being fobbed off with excuses. \"The police will say they can not do anything because it is too late. They will say they do not have enough clues to work on because it has been such a long time since Errol died. I think the clues are still there and it's a matter of pulling them all together. \"People will not speak up when they are concerned for their own safety. In time, things will move on and slowly the information will come out. The truth will become transparent. \"The police have their own mindset. They are patronising us in a way hoping that we will go away and that media interest will slow down so they can get out of the spotlight. \"I am not going to give up, no matter how long it takes. I'm going to keep on asking the questions they don't want to answer.\"",

Meanwhile in Brussels, MCI WorldCom's plans to join forces with Sprint were dealt a severe blow yesterday after the European Commission voiced \"serious competition concerns\" over the \u00a380bn merger plan. Competition commissioner Mario Monti said that a statement of objections would be issued in the next few days. The commission's main concerns - which originally prompted its investigation - are that the new entity would dominate the internet backbone and the supply of global telecoms services to multinationals. It is now thought unlikely to approve the merger unless the companies offer new concessions. The two have already signalled their willingness to sell off Sprint's internet backbone division but that is not thought to go far enough. Sources familiar with the deal believe MCI WorldCom may now have to consider disposing of its UUNet internet business, something which it has so far refused to contemplate. The two companies are expected to ask for a hearing to argue their case before the commission's deadline for a decision on July 12.",

      "body": "<b>How is Mr Dobson going to deal with spiralling house rental prices in the capital?<br> Rory Cook</b> <br> There is a two-tier housing problem in London - what might be described as traditional problem of people who are homeless or nowhere decent to live, and the relatively new problem of people who are being priced out of London by the increase in house prices and rents. I have been pressing for changes in both law and practice to try to deal with this new problem. In his Green Paper on housing, John Prescott accepted my idea of free or low interest loans for people like new police officers, teachers, nurses and social workers. I also believe we need far bigger \"planning gain\" to provide more affordable housing and a real effort to involve housing associations and councils to become the tennants of disused residential space above high street shops. This would provide extra housing and a steady and reliable income for the shop keepers. <b>Hugo Young named Ken Livingstone as the 'postmodern' candidate. I concur with his analysis. Livingstone is post-politics, post-argument - he is little more than a lefto 'cheeky-chappy'. Nevertheless I am concerned that New Labour has not made more of this. If Ken, the likely victor, is post-politics, what does this say for the whole position of the London mayor? Is the position inherently apolitical? Is it a red-herring where accountability is dissipated, but has since spun out of Tony's control? Or can it rejuvenate debate in a demoralised capital?<br> Yours etc., Seven7of9</b> <br> I don't know when Ken Livingstone is post-modern but I do not believe that he will be a serious and accountable mayor of London. My principle concern is that while the well off. well informed and trendy will be well able to look after their own interests whatever the mayor does poor people living in deprived areas where they need better healthcare, better housing, more and better jobs and a huge reduction in crime and disorder will suffer. <b>Do you support the introduction of mayors in other cities? If so, what should be different about the campaigns and candidates? Can the London model be transported to, say, Liverpool?</b> <br> I support the introduction of executive mayors in other English cities if that is what local people want. They will of course have very different powers and duties than the mayor of London because the new arrangements for the government of London are intended to provide a London-wide authority with strategic powers and duties over a limited range of topics. It might well be that a mayor of Birmingham or Liverpool may have some executive responsibility for all the services provided by those cities, not just a strategic position. <b>I am not a Livingstone supporter, but I have to ask whether you do not think that the planned poster campaign, based on the line \"Beware the costs of Livingstone\", is far too reminiscent of the Tories' campaign throughout the '80s and early '90s against planned Labour tax increases?<br> Jacques Warren, Magdalen College, Oxford</b> <br>My principal concerns about the cost of Ken Livingstone's policies have been two-fold. Firstly, he has made it clear time and again, given the opportunity, he would levy a congestion charge even if there was no other transport for Londoners to use, he favours an additional corporation tax for London and other additional taxes to be levied to be levied on London residents and businesses. This could only raise the cost of providing jobs in London which is already sufficiently high to put off some employers and potential employers. In addition he favours financing the renewal of the tube system by the issue of a bond which would have to be underwritten by Londoners. In view of the record of London Underground investment projects the prospects of having to find huge additional sums to pay for cost overruns is more of a certainty than a risk. The Jubilee line extension, which is still not complete, though two years late, has cost \u00a31.5bn more than the original estimate. Had it been financed by a London bond, Londoners would now be having to find the additional \u00a31.5bn - equal to \u00a3500 per family. The estimated cost of doing up the tube is \u00a38bn, cost overruns on the same scale as the Jubilee line extension would add \u00a36bn to that cost. All of which would have to be met from fare increases or London local taxation. With dosh on that scale at risk I think saying to Londoners beware the cost of Livingstone borders on being an understatement. <b>In the event of you not being elected, do you plan to go back to your job in Health?</b> <br> In the event of me not being elected I will be the member of parliament for Holborn and St Pancras, as I have been for the last 20 years. Most people interested in politics would be delighted just to represent that seat and I certainly am. <b>How would Mr Dobson answer the charge that his first priority always seems to be obedience to the party leadership rather than to reflect the views of Londoners?<br> His policies seem to be too often pre-determined by decisions made at cabinet level (e.g. John Prescott's decision on tube financing). How can Londoners be assured that Mr Dobson will be make the views of Londoners heard even when they conflict with existing government policy?<br></b> My first priority as mayor of London would be to represent the interests of Londoners. Until last October, when I announced my decision to stand, virtually every political correspondent in the news media used to portray me as an old Labour cuckoo in the New Labour nest - a person with a mind of my own. I do have a mind of my own and I try to learn from experience. My experience as health secretary involved launching the biggest programme of hospital building in the history of the NHS with 19 hospitals financed through public private partnerships as well as some financed with public capital. Up to then the history of hospital building had been characterised by scandalous delays and huge cost overruns. One of the 19 PFI projects is a month behind - all the rest are on time or ahead of schedule and if there are any cost overruns the private consortium involved will pick up the tab. I believe that it is sensible to test out such an approach to modernising the tube. After all the Docklands light railway extension, which was a PPP, was completed early and to price but I have made clear that as mayor I would vet all the bids using a panel independent of government, London underground or any contractors to advise what would be the best deal for Londoners. The odds are that it would be a PPP but if it wasn't tough luck on the governments plans. <br> <br> <b>Following on from the electoral college which chose you as the Labour candidate is the winner of your proposed London lottery going to be the person/people with the least numbers?<br> Matthew Simpson</b> <br>Ho ho. What a wit. I am proposing a London lottery which would raise \u00a350m a year to be spent on projects designed to make London a better place. Under my scheme, Londoners would decide how the money is spent. There is evidence that more people would buy tickets for such a lottery of they knew the money was going towards what they believed were good causes. All the other candidates are opposed to this sensible proposition. <br> <br> <b>What will you do to for London's cyclists? How will you encourage people to cycle and how will you make it safer?</b> <br> The present arrangements for cycling in London are a dangerous half-way house. I would complete and probably extend the cycle network so that cycling would become much safer. Because I believe pedestrians should be safe, improvements for cyclists should be matched in unlawful cycling on pavements, which is a cause of accidents especially for elderly pedestrians. <br> <br> <b>In today's Guardian, an article about Susan Kramer suggests that she believes that Mr Dobson has been unclear about his policy on congestion charging:<br> \"He [Frank Dobson] had troops out at a busy junction yesterday, telling motorists Mr Livingstone would cost them money without mentioning that his own policy is different only in nuance.\"<br> What are the differences in policy?<br> Asher Jacobsberg</b> <br>Susan Kramer and Ken Livingstone are both in favour of introducing congestion charges to pressure drivers to get out of their cars and travel on the tube instead. The tube is full already so that would be bad for the drivers who changed to public transport and even worse for existing users of our overcrowded tube. Both of them say they want to cut car use by 15% but introducing a congestion charge just for the central area would only achieve a minute reduction because most traffic in London doesn't go into the centre. To achieve even a 10% reduction would require a \u00a310 charge in the centre, a \u00a35 charge anywhere inside the north and south circular roads and additional charges in crowded high streets. Therefore costing as much as \u00a3300 a month for people in outer London. <br> <br> <b>None of the mayoral candidates have said anything of note about London's arts.<br> Why is it of such a low priority? I don't want to vote for a mayor who doesn't rate as important such a vital part of London life. What would you do to improve accessibility to and awareness of the many and varied performances that are available around the capital? I heard someone (sorry can't remember who) talking about a 'London card' which would give residents can get reduced price access to e.g. museums, theatres. What do you think of that?</b> <br>I have not been giving low priority to the arts. I believe theatres, parks, museums, concert halls, cinemas, all contribute to civilised living in London and that civilised living is a major attraction for companies from abroad to invest in London. I am committed to improving access to the arts and to encouraging local and community arts I have a track record on this from when on the Camden council when we had a major arts festival and also introduced very successfully large numbers of local neighbourhood festivals. <p>Thank you for your interest. Vote Labour.</p> <p>Frank</p>",

Had it been financed by a London bond, Londoners would now be having to find the additional \u00a31.5bn - equal to \u00a3500 per family. The estimated cost of doing up the tube is \u00a38bn, cost overruns on the same scale as the Jubilee line extension would add \u00a36bn to that cost. All of which would have to be met from fare increases or London local taxation. With dosh on that scale at risk I think saying to Londoners beware the cost of Livingstone borders on being an understatement. In the event of you not being elected, do you plan to go back to your job in Health? In the event of me not being elected I will be the member of parliament for Holborn and St Pancras, as I have been for the last 20 years. Most people interested in politics would be delighted just to represent that seat and I certainly am. How would Mr Dobson answer the charge that his first priority always seems to be obedience to the party leadership rather than to reflect the views of Londoners? His policies seem to be too often pre-determined by decisions made at cabinet level (e.g. John Prescott's decision on tube financing). How can Londoners be assured that Mr Dobson will be make the views of Londoners heard even when they conflict with existing government policy? My first priority as mayor of London would be to represent the interests of Londoners. Until last October, when I announced my decision to stand, virtually every political correspondent in the news media used to portray me as an old Labour cuckoo in the New Labour nest - a person with a mind of my own. I do have a mind of my own and I try to learn from experience. My experience as health secretary involved launching the biggest programme of hospital building in the history of the NHS with 19 hospitals financed through public private partnerships as well as some financed with public capital. Up to then the history of hospital building had been characterised by scandalous delays and huge cost overruns. One of the 19 PFI projects is a month behind - all the rest are on time or ahead of schedule and if there are any cost overruns the private consortium involved will pick up the tab. I believe that it is sensible to test out such an approach to modernising the tube. After all the Docklands light railway extension, which was a PPP, was completed early and to price but I have made clear that as mayor I would vet all the bids using a panel independent of government, London underground or any contractors to advise what would be the best deal for Londoners. The odds are that it would be a PPP but if it wasn't tough luck on the governments plans. Following on from the electoral college which chose you as the Labour candidate is the winner of your proposed London lottery going to be the person/people with the least numbers? Matthew Simpson Ho ho. What a wit. I am proposing a London lottery which would raise \u00a350m a year to be spent on projects designed to make London a better place. Under my scheme, Londoners would decide how the money is spent. There is evidence that more people would buy tickets for such a lottery of they knew the money was going towards what they believed were good causes. All the other candidates are opposed to this sensible proposition. What will you do to for London's cyclists? How will you encourage people to cycle and how will you make it safer? The present arrangements for cycling in London are a dangerous half-way house. I would complete and probably extend the cycle network so that cycling would become much safer. Because I believe pedestrians should be safe, improvements for cyclists should be matched in unlawful cycling on pavements, which is a cause of accidents especially for elderly pedestrians. In today's Guardian, an article about Susan Kramer suggests that she believes that Mr Dobson has been unclear about his policy on congestion charging: \"He [Frank Dobson] had troops out at a busy junction yesterday, telling motorists Mr Livingstone would cost them money without mentioning that his own policy is different only in nuance.\" What are the differences in policy? Asher Jacobsberg Susan Kramer and Ken Livingstone are both in favour of introducing congestion charges to pressure drivers to get out of their cars and travel on the tube instead. The tube is full already so that would be bad for the drivers who changed to public transport and even worse for existing users of our overcrowded tube. Both of them say they want to cut car use by 15% but introducing a congestion charge just for the central area would only achieve a minute reduction because most traffic in London doesn't go into the centre. To achieve even a 10% reduction would require a \u00a310 charge in the centre, a \u00a35 charge anywhere inside the north and south circular roads and additional charges in crowded high streets. Therefore costing as much as \u00a3300 a month for people in outer London. None of the mayoral candidates have said anything of note about London's arts. Why is it of such a low priority? I don't want to vote for a mayor who doesn't rate as important such a vital part of London life. What would you do to improve accessibility to and awareness of the many and varied performances that are available around the capital? I heard someone (sorry can't remember who) talking about a 'London card' which would give residents can get reduced price access to e.g. museums, theatres. What do you think of that? I have not been giving low priority to the arts. I believe theatres, parks, museums, concert halls, cinemas, all contribute to civilised living in London and that civilised living is a major attraction for companies from abroad to invest in London. I am committed to improving access to the arts and to encouraging local and community arts I have a track record on this from when on the Camden council when we had a major arts festival and also introduced very successfully large numbers of local neighbourhood festivals. Thank you for your interest. Vote Labour. Frank",

The structure is losing orbit at a rate of about 1-1/2 miles a week because a long-overdue Russian service module, dubbed Zvezda, cannot be launched until summer. </p> <p>When Atlantis eventually docks with the station, shuttle commander James Halsell and pilot Scott Horowitz will use the shuttle's thrusters to boost the station's orbit to 250 miles above Earth, where it will wait for Zvezda, which carries enough fuel for the station to maintain that orbit. </p> <p>King said Atlantis could be ready to go again in as little as three days.

      "bodyText": "Nasa scrubbed the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis for the third straight day on Wednesday and may not be able to try again to dock with and repair the International Space Station until mid-May. Although high winds at the Kennedy Space Centre were responsible for grounding the shuttle on Monday and Tuesday, it was rain and heavy crosswinds at emergency landing sites in Spain and North Africa that caused Wednesday's cancellation. \"We were there, we were ready, and the weather just didn't cooperate,\" launch director Dave King said. It was the first time in the shuttle program's history that Nasa had tried to launch three days in a row. Still waiting in space for the seven Atlantis astronauts are the first components of the $60 billion International Space Station. The structure is losing orbit at a rate of about 1-1/2 miles a week because a long-overdue Russian service module, dubbed Zvezda, cannot be launched until summer. When Atlantis eventually docks with the station, shuttle commander James Halsell and pilot Scott Horowitz will use the shuttle's thrusters to boost the station's orbit to 250 miles above Earth, where it will wait for Zvezda, which carries enough fuel for the station to maintain that orbit. King said Atlantis could be ready to go again in as little as three days. Conflicts with commercial and other unmanned launches from the neighbouring Cape Canaveral Air Force Station make it more likely that the shuttle will be launched sometime between May 3 and 18. Nasa maintains three emergency landing sites in Spain and Morocco in case a space shuttle must abort its flight soon after launch but with enough height and speed to make it across the Atlantic Ocean. On Wednesday it was raining on the runways at Moron and Zaragoza, Spain. At Ben Guerir, Morocco, the flight team was hoping a 16-knot crosswind would change direction and allow a landing. But with everyone from security guards to Nasa Administrator Dan Goldin eyeing clocks and watches, time ran out on that option. The astronauts took the latest delay in stride. \"We think all three attempts were the right thing to do,\" Halsell said. \"We'll be ready to go again as soon as the team is.\" In the past, whenever the launch team at the Kennedy Space Centre has needed three launch attempts because of weather or technical problems, a delay of at least 48 hours was built into the schedule to give the launch teams some rest.

The afternoon launch times had not kept the teams working late into the night, and there were none of the unscheduled holds in the countdown that can extend workdays by hours. The slowly decaying orbit of the space station was something the station's designers had not anticipated. A recent cycle of intense solar activity has caused Earth's atmosphere to expand, and although it remains thin where the space station orbits, there has been enough atmospheric drag on the station to accelerate the orbital decay experienced by all satellites. The space station is being built by a international partnership led by the United States and Russia. When completed, it will house a crew of seven and sprawl over an area the size of two American football fields. In the shuttle's cargo bay are more than 2,000 pounds (900 kg) of supplies for the station waiting to be transferred. During docked operations, spacewalking astronauts will make repairs to the outside of the station and finish work on a Russian-built construction boom begun on an earlier mission. Inside the station, the crew will replace four of six batteries that have been overtaxed by months of operations without support from the large solar power array that will arrive with Zvezda. Besides Halsell and Horowitz, the crew is made up of spacewalkers Jeffrey Williams and Jim Voss, mission specialists Mary Ellen Weber and Susan Helms, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Usachev. The astronauts were expected to return to the astronaut training facility at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston on Wednesday night.

      "body": "<p><strong>GA:</strong> You've said in interviews in the past that you like it when a director has given you the green light to invent.</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> When actors come and see me and I ask if they had a good day, and they say: \"Well yes, but the director is just not directing me\", I say: \"Well, aren't you pleased?\" Christ, what luxury. I don't know what they mean by that, I don't know if they think you turn up and you haven't done any thinking at all, that would be so strange. You must have something in your imagination that you are able to offer. And if the director says: \"I like the way that's going,\" and fans the flames well that's fantastic, you feel a terrific freedom and then you start working with a director rather than for one and that's when things begin to cook, that's when things happen.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And has that desire to invent ever led you into great conflict with any directors?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> No conflict that I didn't win. I remember there was a bit of a conflict with Herbie Wise when we'd come back from a rather good lunch. And we were feeling particularly inventive. And I climbed into bed with my grandmother and thought that this would really be a rather good idea and Herbie was getting slightly worried about how far it was going. But after many conversations and discussions we said, Well, how far can Caligula go?, and the answer was pretty much as far as possible. And so that did remain in it. No, I'm being facetious in a sense. When you're really working well with a director then you can be as outrageous as you like and so can he. And there's no worry about it.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you actually have a favourite film or any favourite memories from working on a movie?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well I have lots of favourite memories but I can't say that I have a favourite film. I have favourite parts which are not in particularly successful films. I have to say that although it's now a highly regarded film among film-goers, The Hit was not a particular success, and for me it's a favourite film as a piece of cinema and a favourite role. When you feel you've achieved something on cinema, which is not just creating a part but making it fit into a cinematic understanding. It's difficult to say because they're all so different, it's like saying what's your favourite director. I couldn't possibly begin to tell you that because I've been very fortunate, I've worked with people from Fred Zinnemann, John Houston, through to Richard Fleischer, all of those boys from Hollywood and so on and Sam Peckinpah and then the Mike Radfords... I've been incredibly lucky with the directors I've worked with. You don't realise it at the time it's just in retrospect if you look back you think Jeez, when I saw that CV it nearly frightened the life out of me. I thought: \"That's not bad for an old drunk.\"</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Have you ever been tempted to direct a movie yourself?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Funny you should say that. I have been tempted. And finally I capitulated to the temptation. As Oscar Wilde says, the best way to deal with temptation is to give in to it. I'm not going to say what it is because it is not announced as yet, we're in the very early stages, but I have acquired a very good book indeed which I think will make a rather wonderful film. And my friends have persuaded me that instead of talking about film all the time, I'd better put it into practice.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you have any unfulfilled ambitions apart from so far, not having directed?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> It would be difficult to have any unfulfilled ambitions because I don't have any ambitions. I've never been that kind of performer. As I said, when I first started, I literally said to myself: \"Would I be prepared to stick it out in repertory for the rest of my life?\" and I'd said yes. Anything that has happened to me better or more than that is the way the world has treated me and the way things have gone. I never had any ambition to be a star, or whatever it is called, and I'm still embarrassed at the word. I just wanted to act as well as I could act. I'm sounding really goody two shoes now! But that's the truth. I haven't had ambitions. I never had the ambition to play Hamlet, if I had come across it and it had been offered me in the right circumstances I'm sure I would've said yes, but I love being surprised by doing things that I'd never think of playing.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You've worked a lot in either low budget or independent film-making. Do you have a natural sympathy for that sort of stuff?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Again, you don't realise it is happening at the time. If you get an offer to do a film and you get excited by it and then you realise that it's an independent film... and the time it didn't really worry me. Now of course I can look back. It's quite a dangerous career move to go wilfully on making films that may not find a distributor. It's quite a dangerous way to go. In which case I've lived quite a dangerous life. But I didn't live it in any knowledge of the danger at the time. It's just when you look back at it and you think: \"Ah yes, really what I should've been doing is going over and licking a few arses in Hollywood,\" and getting on with it there. But I've never been very good at that and I've never been particularly good at selling myself in that way, thank God one has agents to do that, and I've been very fortunate in having good ones. And in the independent market, I have to say that more than in the studio market I've found things which have interested me and the sort of things that I like making. </p> <p>I think it's a dreadful shame personally that one is not able to go to a studio with a piece like Love and Death on Long Island, for instance, and say, Why don't we make this? There certainly was a time when that was possible. And I think Alec Guinness, in terms of the mainstream English films, was one of the really fortunate actors in film. He was breaking new ground as well, but he was doing it in a mainstream way, which I think is more difficult now, because the mainstream has dumbed down considerably.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Has there ever been any actor who has been an inspiration for you?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> An inspiration, yes. I just mentioned him, Alec Guinness, without question. Because Alec - though I never worked with him and only met him on a few occasions, because he was so shy and I was even shyer so hardly a word was spoken, but to me, what he so successfully did... he broke ground as a performer, he was able to marry the tradition of British theatre and take it to the cinema and make it work. And I think he was the first person really to play so many characters both leading and supporting and be visually different and thinking differently and realising that the camera can actually photograph thought. So he was a huge inspiration to me. The first thing I ever saw of him was Oliver Twist and I will never, ever, couldn't possible forget 20 images I can think of straight off of his Fagin. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You've been described more than once as a brave actor. Would you agree with that assessment? </p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> One is always shy of such compliments and also you think of knights in shining armour, don't you? Brave... I was actually having a conversation with friends of mine and I said: \"They keep talking about brave. What have I done that's been particularly brave?\" And they said: \"You've got to remember that in Hollywood, if you are say, glamorous, and you scrape your hair back into a bun, that is considered to be brave.\" And the penny dropped. </p> <p> <strong>Questions from the audience</strong></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What has been your most emotionally draining role, either on stage or screen?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Physically draining, I can understand. Emotionally draining, you never quite know, because if you're really into what doing at the time there is always, whether it be screen or stage, such a buzz of electricity that you really don't know whether you're drained or not and it isn't until you eat, or something like that, that you collapse with tiredness. But emotionally draining... I've got such a poor memory I go back very little distance. If you're doing it right, I don't think you can get more draining than Krapp's Last Tape, quite honestly. It's an extraordinarily intense little piece and you're on your own, too, which I've never done before. I say you're on your own, but of course you're not, you're with yourself but only 30 years younger. But only on tape, of course. But as I say, when you come off, you get such a buzz, such a thrill if it's gone well, that you forget about being emotionally drained.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there any characters left you want to do? And who do you see when you look in the mirror?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I've no idea who I am anymore. But I cease to be confused about it and frankly I'm not too worried. I'm motoring towards the end of it all in the most enjoyable way and does it really matter if I know who I am? I don't think it does, no. I do see a flicker.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You've been extraordinarily modest about your work and tributes that have been paid to you. Who made you aware, if anybody, of the wonderful gift of your voice?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> You know what they used to say? You know how to ruin a young actor? You say: \"You know you've got a wonderful voice.\" My voice has been blamed on Guinness and on Gauloises and all sorts of things like that but I'm here to tell you that it's a family voice entirely. My voice is the same timbre as my brothers, except of course that he's more Cambridge, and my father had exactly the same voice only he, of course, was a bit more north country. But the timbre of the voice is a family thing. I'm not being modest I'm being very grateful. I do love working vocally.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Didn't you once do a film in which you were a bag lady, it was a version of Romeo and Juliet and the cast was almost completely feline?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I am discovered, yes. That's one of those. That came up and I thought it was so bizarre. Armando Acosta was the American director. He had all sorts of people in Belgium who had all given up their salaries, I didn't know this at the time, and they decided to do a production almost entirely with cats. And he would go on at great length saying: \"You just want to watch that cat. It is so stunning, the cat that is playing Juliet.\" And I thought, I've got to go in for this ride. This can't be anything but interesting. I didn't ask him why he wanted me to be a boatwoman. I think he felt that I had some great and deep spirituality that was going to fill the role. And obviously he felt that I was going to have some great affinity with cats, too. When one actually jumped off the boat and into the canal and wasn't able to swim, he found there was a very deep significance in this. I did suggest to him that it was not a good idea. It was a fairly extraordinary film.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Did you see the film?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Yes I did. He put it on with a full philharmonic orchestra in capitals of the world. And I did go to one in Brussels. It was the most bizarre evening. You got people coming out and literally saying: \"Well that tabby cat really was very special.\"</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How did you find working with Michael Cimino on Heaven's Gate?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Do you want to be here all night? I found it a difficult film because I can't bear that sort of indulgence and also it was at a time in my life when I couldn't treat it with a sense of humour. Obviously I was still holding onto the idea that you could control the indulgences of this business, which of course you couldn't. It was a very difficult experience all together. And I was working with a lot of people who'd worked together before and thought that it would be a very powerful film. It was not an easy time for anybody and it brought a studio to its knees.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Were you aware while filming Alien just how startling that Alien moment would be when the special effects were installed?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I think we were all hoped that it would be startling in terms of the film. I don't think anybody realised that it was going to become a kind of classic moment, because I don't think you do realise these things. I don't suppose Bogart realised it when he said: \"Play it again Sam.\" These things happen by accident. It was all shot in a moment. I know I'm going to get asked this so I may as well tell you now. The rest of the cast did know roughly what was going to happen but they did not know that there were going to be explosive caps on it so that the blood would fly everywhere, all over everybody else. They might have guessed something was going to happen because Ridley didn't normally use, in a scene as tight as that, five cameras. And there were five cameras rolling. It worked - he got it in one. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You once said in an interview that sci-fi is the most tedious thing for an actor.</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Oh, the most boring thing to do. It's endless waiting around. It's great fun for the director because he's playing with all the toys and he's going up and down and round tracks and then saying: \"No, I don't think that works, let's put the track over here.\" By which stage you've been made up since eight in the morning and you don't do anything for one day, or the next day, or the next day, and it begins to get tedious. There's not a lot of acting to be done in it. I mean, there's a bit of \"bleuaarghbrooohhh...\" but that's one morning out of fourteen weeks.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How closely do you keep to the original with the film version of Krapp?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> It's entirely to the text, the Beckett estate would never allow it to be made if it wasn't as near as possible to how Beckett would have it made. It was shot by Atom Egoyan and he did some very elegant and eloquent moves in it and I can't tell you whether it works yet. I am slightly worried that it will be slightly indulgent, but I'm hoping it won't be. But you never know. But I'm very hopeful and certainly Atom is absolutely delighted with it, and I hope the audiences will be.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I don't want to sound really morbid, but if you were to die tomorrow, how do you think the public as a whole would remember you?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Several ways of answering that! If I were to die tomorrow I wouldn't think, for one. But if I thought now about dying tomorrow... it's quite interesting. There's no point in being big headed about this because even the greatest actors , like Olivier, basically the two things that were mentioned were Richard III and Wuthering Heights in almost every obituary. If I was to be as lucky as him and have two things mentioned, I suspect they would be the Naked Civil Servant and The Elephant Man and maybe in certain magazines it would be Alien, And then you'd all be able to forget about me. As Beckett said, it's not enough to die, one has to be forgotten as well.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How easy was it to stay with the Night Train project?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> The statement made by Gabriel Garcia Marquez that every man has his public life, his private life and his secret life, is wonderful because as I said earlier, so much of film is successful when it is dealing with the secret life, way beyond the private life. The film went through many different incarnations of the script but it always kept that intimacy, it was always dealing with the secret of two people's lives and it fascinated me. I thought that Aodhan Madden had written it absolutely wonderfully. So it wasn't difficult to stay with it. It was a film that was always going to interest me.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you see Quentin Crisp now?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> How do I feel about Quentin now after all these years? He was an extremely enigmatic man, but that's part of Quentin in a sense, other than his crusade. I feel that Quentin is a rather remarkable and oblique philosopher, quite apart from the crusade of homosexuality that he was committed to. Indeed he transcended that in some of his writings and certainly in the show that he did. He became like an old fashioned philosopher and a rather oblique one with it. He never answered a question in the way that you expect a direct question to be answered. He had chosen to live in New York, and I remember he said: \"I don't believe in abroad, I think everyone speaks English behind our backs.\" So he was a very untravelled man and after the success of the Civil Servant on both sides of the Atlantic he was asked to take his show to New York. He went over there and took one look at the Chelsea Hotel and said: \"Home.\" And he loved New York and he stayed there and New York has loved him - the whole exhibitionistic approach to his life was immensely appreciated there. But anyway, I said: \"What is it that actually made you come and live in New York?\" and he said: \"Well, three weeks is a meaningful relationship.\" They are very oblique truths and he wasn't afraid to be truthful and he wasn't afraid to live truthfully either. He's the only philosopher that I can think of who lived his philosophy. I think very highly of Quentin, I'm a great admirer of him as a person. Heaven alone knows if you could find the secrets of Quentin's life but in a sense he has less to be secretive about because he presented everything. Or seemingly so. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What misgivings might you have about becoming a director?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well I hope I won't tell everybody what to do. I've worked with a lot of people making their first film, including Jeremy Thomas, god knows how many films he had produced with fantastic amazing directors, and all I can say is that whatever misgivings he had at the beginning he became totally enthralled with the business of directing and by the end of it, as I remember, was saying: \"I can't wait to start my next one.\" Decision making, more than anything. But it's my avowed intent to have it very well planned before I start. I'm a great believer in structure but because structure is there it doesn't move that it can't be changed, it's not indestructible, it can be moved about. But the structure must be there to start with, you must feel that it is there on paper. I don't know... don't get me thinking about that.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was Jim Jarmusch like to work with as a director?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Absolutely wonderful. I only had three days with him. He's a director that really builds and builds upon things and he works in a kind of artistic frenzy when he gets going and yet he'd incredibly cool when he's not. Everyone's idea of the perfect artist. But it all works, and he's brilliant when he's doing it and it's very exciting to be part of.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think British actors have a responsibility to independent film?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I'd rather go to Hollywood than be in rep all my life, but that's not what I said. What I said was would I be prepared to be in rep for the rest of my life should that be the case. And I didn't say that I would be happy, just would I be prepared. And the answer to that was yes. But heavens, much more exciting things came up than being in rep all your life. I think it's great to be in Rep for a bit. I've spent a great deal of my life doing independent film, and that is partly because the subject matter interests me and partly because that is the basis of the film industry. That's where the film-makers come from, it's where they start and sometimes its where they should have stayed.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> If your acting career hadn't worked out and you'd decided you couldn't even make a living in Rep, what would you have liked to have done, if you hadn't been an actor?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well I suppose I would've tried to be a rather poor painter and been teaching for the rest of my life. I really don't know. There's nothing else I can do.</p>",

I couldn't possibly begin to tell you that because I've been very fortunate, I've worked with people from Fred Zinnemann, John Houston, through to Richard Fleischer, all of those boys from Hollywood and so on and Sam Peckinpah and then the Mike Radfords... I've been incredibly lucky with the directors I've worked with. You don't realise it at the time it's just in retrospect if you look back you think Jeez, when I saw that CV it nearly frightened the life out of me. I thought: \"That's not bad for an old drunk.\" GA: Have you ever been tempted to direct a movie yourself? JH: Funny you should say that. I have been tempted. And finally I capitulated to the temptation. As Oscar Wilde says, the best way to deal with temptation is to give in to it. I'm not going to say what it is because it is not announced as yet, we're in the very early stages, but I have acquired a very good book indeed which I think will make a rather wonderful film. And my friends have persuaded me that instead of talking about film all the time, I'd better put it into practice. GA: Do you have any unfulfilled ambitions apart from so far, not having directed? JH: It would be difficult to have any unfulfilled ambitions because I don't have any ambitions. I've never been that kind of performer. As I said, when I first started, I literally said to myself: \"Would I be prepared to stick it out in repertory for the rest of my life?\" and I'd said yes. Anything that has happened to me better or more than that is the way the world has treated me and the way things have gone. I never had any ambition to be a star, or whatever it is called, and I'm still embarrassed at the word. I just wanted to act as well as I could act. I'm sounding really goody two shoes now! But that's the truth. I haven't had ambitions. I never had the ambition to play Hamlet, if I had come across it and it had been offered me in the right circumstances I'm sure I would've said yes, but I love being surprised by doing things that I'd never think of playing. GA: You've worked a lot in either low budget or independent film-making. Do you have a natural sympathy for that sort of stuff? JH: Again, you don't realise it is happening at the time. If you get an offer to do a film and you get excited by it and then you realise that it's an independent film... and the time it didn't really worry me. Now of course I can look back. It's quite a dangerous career move to go wilfully on making films that may not find a distributor. It's quite a dangerous way to go. In which case I've lived quite a dangerous life. But I didn't live it in any knowledge of the danger at the time. It's just when you look back at it and you think: \"Ah yes, really what I should've been doing is going over and licking a few arses in Hollywood,\" and getting on with it there. But I've never been very good at that and I've never been particularly good at selling myself in that way, thank God one has agents to do that, and I've been very fortunate in having good ones. And in the independent market, I have to say that more than in the studio market I've found things which have interested me and the sort of things that I like making. I think it's a dreadful shame personally that one is not able to go to a studio with a piece like Love and Death on Long Island, for instance, and say, Why don't we make this? There certainly was a time when that was possible. And I think Alec Guinness, in terms of the mainstream English films, was one of the really fortunate actors in film. He was breaking new ground as well, but he was doing it in a mainstream way, which I think is more difficult now, because the mainstream has dumbed down considerably. GA: Has there ever been any actor who has been an inspiration for you? JH: An inspiration, yes. I just mentioned him, Alec Guinness, without question. Because Alec - though I never worked with him and only met him on a few occasions, because he was so shy and I was even shyer so hardly a word was spoken, but to me, what he so successfully did... he broke ground as a performer, he was able to marry the tradition of British theatre and take it to the cinema and make it work. And I think he was the first person really to play so many characters both leading and supporting and be visually different and thinking differently and realising that the camera can actually photograph thought. So he was a huge inspiration to me. The first thing I ever saw of him was Oliver Twist and I will never, ever, couldn't possible forget 20 images I can think of straight off of his Fagin. GA: You've been described more than once as a brave actor. Would you agree with that assessment? JH: One is always shy of such compliments and also you think of knights in shining armour, don't you? Brave... I was actually having a conversation with friends of mine and I said: \"They keep talking about brave. What have I done that's been particularly brave?\" And they said: \"You've got to remember that in Hollywood, if you are say, glamorous, and you scrape your hair back into a bun, that is considered to be brave.\" And the penny dropped. Questions from the audience Q: What has been your most emotionally draining role, either on stage or screen? JH: Physically draining, I can understand. Emotionally draining, you never quite know, because if you're really into what doing at the time there is always, whether it be screen or stage, such a buzz of electricity that you really don't know whether you're drained or not and it isn't until you eat, or something like that, that you collapse with tiredness. But emotionally draining... I've got such a poor memory I go back very little distance. If you're doing it right, I don't think you can get more draining than Krapp's Last Tape, quite honestly. It's an extraordinarily intense little piece and you're on your own, too, which I've never done before. I say you're on your own, but of course you're not, you're with yourself but only 30 years younger. But only on tape, of course. But as I say, when you come off, you get such a buzz, such a thrill if it's gone well, that you forget about being emotionally drained. Q: Are there any characters left you want to do? And who do you see when you look in the mirror? JH: I've no idea who I am anymore. But I cease to be confused about it and frankly I'm not too worried. I'm motoring towards the end of it all in the most enjoyable way and does it really matter if I know who I am? I don't think it does, no. I do see a flicker. Q: You've been extraordinarily modest about your work and tributes that have been paid to you. Who made you aware, if anybody, of the wonderful gift of your voice? JH: You know what they used to say? You know how to ruin a young actor? You say: \"You know you've got a wonderful voice.\" My voice has been blamed on Guinness and on Gauloises and all sorts of things like that but I'm here to tell you that it's a family voice entirely. My voice is the same timbre as my brothers, except of course that he's more Cambridge, and my father had exactly the same voice only he, of course, was a bit more north country. But the timbre of the voice is a family thing. I'm not being modest I'm being very grateful. I do love working vocally. GA: Didn't you once do a film in which you were a bag lady, it was a version of Romeo and Juliet and the cast was almost completely feline? JH: I am discovered, yes. That's one of those. That came up and I thought it was so bizarre. Armando Acosta was the American director. He had all sorts of people in Belgium who had all given up their salaries, I didn't know this at the time, and they decided to do a production almost entirely with cats. And he would go on at great length saying: \"You just want to watch that cat. It is so stunning, the cat that is playing Juliet.\" And I thought, I've got to go in for this ride. This can't be anything but interesting. I didn't ask him why he wanted me to be a boatwoman. I think he felt that I had some great and deep spirituality that was going to fill the role. And obviously he felt that I was going to have some great affinity with cats, too. When one actually jumped off the boat and into the canal and wasn't able to swim, he found there was a very deep significance in this. I did suggest to him that it was not a good idea. It was a fairly extraordinary film. GA: Did you see the film? JH: Yes I did. He put it on with a full philharmonic orchestra in capitals of the world. And I did go to one in Brussels. It was the most bizarre evening. You got people coming out and literally saying: \"Well that tabby cat really was very special.\" Q: How did you find working with Michael Cimino on Heaven's Gate? JH: Do you want to be here all night? I found it a difficult film because I can't bear that sort of indulgence and also it was at a time in my life when I couldn't treat it with a sense of humour. Obviously I was still holding onto the idea that you could control the indulgences of this business, which of course you couldn't. It was a very difficult experience all together. And I was working with a lot of people who'd worked together before and thought that it would be a very powerful film. It was not an easy time for anybody and it brought a studio to its knees. Q: Were you aware while filming Alien just how startling that Alien moment would be when the special effects were installed? JH: I think we were all hoped that it would be startling in terms of the film. I don't think anybody realised that it was going to become a kind of classic moment, because I don't think you do realise these things. I don't suppose Bogart realised it when he said: \"Play it again Sam.\" These things happen by accident. It was all shot in a moment. I know I'm going to get asked this so I may as well tell you now. The rest of the cast did know roughly what was going to happen but they did not know that there were going to be explosive caps on it so that the blood would fly everywhere, all over everybody else. They might have guessed something was going to happen because Ridley didn't normally use, in a scene as tight as that, five cameras. And there were five cameras rolling. It worked - he got it in one. GA: You once said in an interview that sci-fi is the most tedious thing for an actor. JH: Oh, the most boring thing to do. It's endless waiting around. It's great fun for the director because he's playing with all the toys and he's going up and down and round tracks and then saying: \"No, I don't think that works, let's put the track over here.\" By which stage you've been made up since eight in the morning and you don't do anything for one day, or the next day, or the next day, and it begins to get tedious. There's not a lot of acting to be done in it. I mean, there's a bit of \"bleuaarghbrooohhh...\" but that's one morning out of fourteen weeks. Q: How closely do you keep to the original with the film version of Krapp? JH: It's entirely to the text, the Beckett estate would never allow it to be made if it wasn't as near as possible to how Beckett would have it made. It was shot by Atom Egoyan and he did some very elegant and eloquent moves in it and I can't tell you whether it works yet. I am slightly worried that it will be slightly indulgent, but I'm hoping it won't be. But you never know. But I'm very hopeful and certainly Atom is absolutely delighted with it, and I hope the audiences will be. Q: I don't want to sound really morbid, but if you were to die tomorrow, how do you think the public as a whole would remember you? JH: Several ways of answering that! If I were to die tomorrow I wouldn't think, for one. But if I thought now about dying tomorrow... it's quite interesting. There's no point in being big headed about this because even the greatest actors , like Olivier, basically the two things that were mentioned were Richard III and Wuthering Heights in almost every obituary. If I was to be as lucky as him and have two things mentioned, I suspect they would be the Naked Civil Servant and The Elephant Man and maybe in certain magazines it would be Alien, And then you'd all be able to forget about me. As Beckett said, it's not enough to die, one has to be forgotten as well. Q: How easy was it to stay with the Night Train project? JH: The statement made by Gabriel Garcia Marquez that every man has his public life, his private life and his secret life, is wonderful because as I said earlier, so much of film is successful when it is dealing with the secret life, way beyond the private life. The film went through many different incarnations of the script but it always kept that intimacy, it was always dealing with the secret of two people's lives and it fascinated me. I thought that Aodhan Madden had written it absolutely wonderfully. So it wasn't difficult to stay with it. It was a film that was always going to interest me. Q: How do you see Quentin Crisp now? JH: How do I feel about Quentin now after all these years? He was an extremely enigmatic man, but that's part of Quentin in a sense, other than his crusade. I feel that Quentin is a rather remarkable and oblique philosopher, quite apart from the crusade of homosexuality that he was committed to. Indeed he transcended that in some of his writings and certainly in the show that he did. He became like an old fashioned philosopher and a rather oblique one with it. He never answered a question in the way that you expect a direct question to be answered. He had chosen to live in New York, and I remember he said: \"I don't believe in abroad, I think everyone speaks English behind our backs.\" So he was a very untravelled man and after the success of the Civil Servant on both sides of the Atlantic he was asked to take his show to New York. He went over there and took one look at the Chelsea Hotel and said: \"Home.\" And he loved New York and he stayed there and New York has loved him - the whole exhibitionistic approach to his life was immensely appreciated there. But anyway, I said: \"What is it that actually made you come and live in New York?\" and he said: \"Well, three weeks is a meaningful relationship.\" They are very oblique truths and he wasn't afraid to be truthful and he wasn't afraid to live truthfully either. He's the only philosopher that I can think of who lived his philosophy. I think very highly of Quentin, I'm a great admirer of him as a person. Heaven alone knows if you could find the secrets of Quentin's life but in a sense he has less to be secretive about because he presented everything. Or seemingly so. Q: What misgivings might you have about becoming a director? JH: Well I hope I won't tell everybody what to do. I've worked with a lot of people making their first film, including Jeremy Thomas, god knows how many films he had produced with fantastic amazing directors, and all I can say is that whatever misgivings he had at the beginning he became totally enthralled with the business of directing and by the end of it, as I remember, was saying: \"I can't wait to start my next one.\" Decision making, more than anything. But it's my avowed intent to have it very well planned before I start. I'm a great believer in structure but because structure is there it doesn't move that it can't be changed, it's not indestructible, it can be moved about. But the structure must be there to start with, you must feel that it is there on paper. I don't know... don't get me thinking about that. Q: What was Jim Jarmusch like to work with as a director? JH: Absolutely wonderful. I only had three days with him. He's a director that really builds and builds upon things and he works in a kind of artistic frenzy when he gets going and yet he'd incredibly cool when he's not. Everyone's idea of the perfect artist. But it all works, and he's brilliant when he's doing it and it's very exciting to be part of. Q: Do you think British actors have a responsibility to independent film? JH: I'd rather go to Hollywood than be in rep all my life, but that's not what I said. What I said was would I be prepared to be in rep for the rest of my life should that be the case. And I didn't say that I would be happy, just would I be prepared. And the answer to that was yes. But heavens, much more exciting things came up than being in rep all your life. I think it's great to be in Rep for a bit. I've spent a great deal of my life doing independent film, and that is partly because the subject matter interests me and partly because that is the basis of the film industry. That's where the film-makers come from, it's where they start and sometimes its where they should have stayed. GA: If your acting career hadn't worked out and you'd decided you couldn't even make a living in Rep, what would you have liked to have done, if you hadn't been an actor? JH: Well I suppose I would've tried to be a rather poor painter and been teaching for the rest of my life. I really don't know. There's nothing else I can do.",

He has my barman and me engrossed for hours with his tales, but is strangely reluctant to remember any of his own stats! Can you tell us his career record?</strong> asks Darren Hepburn from the Rose and Crown</p> <p>Gard played 112 matches for Somerset between 1976 and 1989, although he wasn't a regular first-teamer until Derek Taylor retired in 1982. He scored 1389 runs at an average of 13.75, and made 178 catches and 39 stumpings. He made two half-centuries in first-class cricket: 51 not out against the Indian tourists at Taunton in 1979, and 51 v Glamorgan at Swansea in 1983. Perhaps his finest hour was in the 1983 NatWest Trophy final at Lord's - I remember two lightning legside stumpings to send back Chris Cowdrey (for 0) and Derek Aslett of Kent. Somerset went on to win that match by 24 runs.</p> <p><strong>Has any player been given out more than once for obstructing the field in first-class cricket?</strong> asks Toby Cox</p> <p>The unlucky man was Thomas Straw, a Worcestershire wicketkeeper, who managed to get out in this odd fashion twice, in 1899 and 1901, both times against Warwickshire. Oddly, each time he was out obstructing the field he was dismissed by Frank Field for a duck in the second innings. Wisden is curiously silent about both incidents - and the 1960 edition also fails to give Straw an obituary after he died in 1959.</p> <p><strong>I believe England once made around 600 chasing 650 or something like that in a Test. When was this?</strong> asks Sumedh Pathak</p> <p>This was the famous \"Timeless Test\" on England's 1938-39 tour of South Africa. It was the final Test of the series, at Durban, and with England 1-0 up it was decided to play the match out to a finish. It lasted ten days, one of which was rained off. England were set 696 to win, and had reached 654 for 5 (Bill Edrich 219, Wally Hammond 140, Paul Gibb 120) by the end of the tenth day. Unfortunately, the England team then had to leave to catch the train to reach their boat home, so the match was drawn anyway. The general view was that it had been a pointless exercise, and there have been no timeless Tests since (all Tests in Australia between 1881-82 and 1946-47 were played out to a finish). Nowadays travel and administrative constraints would make the prospect of such matches even more unattractive. Since 1950 Tests in England have been scheduled to last five days (with the occasional six-dayer to round off a series if a decider was needed).</p> <p><strong>I am having an argument with my father about when Chris Lewis last played for England. Can you help?</strong> asks Deborah Brown</p> <p>His last appearances to date came in the one-day internationals against South Africa at the start of their tour of England in 1998. He played in the first two, at The Oval and Old Trafford, but was left out for the final match. Lewis's last Test was against Pakistan at The Oval in 1996, during which he was famously late one morning after his car had a puncture and he had mislaid the free mobile phone the England sponsors had given to each player.</p> <p><strong>Can you confirm the England team which played Australia at Lord's in 1997, including anyone who was called up but didn't play?</strong> asks Tony Hortopp</p> <p>The team that played was Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, John Crawley, Mark Ealham, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Andy Caddick and Devon Malcolm. Phil Tufnell and Adam Hollioake were left out of the chosen 13, and Ashley Cowan of Essex was added to the squad to soak up some Test-match atmosphere. \"Soak up\" was appropriate: little more than two days' play was possible in a soggy draw, although Glenn McGrath found time to demolish England (77 all out) with 8 for 38.</p> <p><strong>Could you please settle a bet between two of my work colleagues: has anyone ever scored 200 in a one-day international?</strong> asks Paul Stenhouse</p> <p>No man has done it (the highest score is Saeed Anwar's 194 for Pakistan v India at Chennai in 1996-97) - but a woman has. Belinda Clark, Australia's captain, cracked 229 in 157 balls against Denmark at Bombay during the women's World Cup in December 1997.</p> <p><strong>What was the story behind the dead sparrow that's in the Lord's museum?</strong> asks Nicky Farr</p> <p>The incident happened in 1936, during the MCC v Cambridge University match at Lord's. Jahangir Khan of Cambridge (the father of Majid, who later captained Pakistan) was bowling to Tom Pearce on the third day. Pearce played forward, then someone noticed that the bails had been disturbed, and a fielder spotted a dead sparrow lying by the stumps. Pearce was given not out and batted on, and later the bird was stuffed for the Lord's museum. The Times correspondent wrote that \"the sparrow had chosen to commit suicide in an altruistic attempt to save TN Pearce's wicket\". Tim Rice's book \"Treasures of Lord's\" adds that \"Both ball and bird were declared dead.\"</p> <p><strong>I was intrigued to read last week's question about cricket in Philadelphia. It might interest the person asking to know that cricket is still being played in the area. Haverford College maintains a team, and their ground is also used by my own club, the British Officers Cricket Club. Superb facilities are also available at the Philadelphia, Germantown and Merion Cricket Clubs as well (although these revert to the more financially rewarding game of tennis from late May to September). All four venues will be used shortly for the Philadelphia Cricket Festival, which features 12 teams from as far afield as California, New York, Canada and the UK. So while not perhaps in the same class as yesteryear, cricket is by no means dead in this part of the world.

Can you confirm the England team which played Australia at Lord's in 1997, including anyone who was called up but didn't play? asks Tony Hortopp The team that played was Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, John Crawley, Mark Ealham, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Andy Caddick and Devon Malcolm. Phil Tufnell and Adam Hollioake were left out of the chosen 13, and Ashley Cowan of Essex was added to the squad to soak up some Test-match atmosphere. \"Soak up\" was appropriate: little more than two days' play was possible in a soggy draw, although Glenn McGrath found time to demolish England (77 all out) with 8 for 38. Could you please settle a bet between two of my work colleagues: has anyone ever scored 200 in a one-day international? asks Paul Stenhouse No man has done it (the highest score is Saeed Anwar's 194 for Pakistan v India at Chennai in 1996-97) - but a woman has. Belinda Clark, Australia's captain, cracked 229 in 157 balls against Denmark at Bombay during the women's World Cup in December 1997. What was the story behind the dead sparrow that's in the Lord's museum? asks Nicky Farr The incident happened in 1936, during the MCC v Cambridge University match at Lord's. Jahangir Khan of Cambridge (the father of Majid, who later captained Pakistan) was bowling to Tom Pearce on the third day. Pearce played forward, then someone noticed that the bails had been disturbed, and a fielder spotted a dead sparrow lying by the stumps. Pearce was given not out and batted on, and later the bird was stuffed for the Lord's museum. The Times correspondent wrote that \"the sparrow had chosen to commit suicide in an altruistic attempt to save TN Pearce's wicket\". Tim Rice's book \"Treasures of Lord's\" adds that \"Both ball and bird were declared dead.\" I was intrigued to read last week's question about cricket in Philadelphia. It might interest the person asking to know that cricket is still being played in the area. Haverford College maintains a team, and their ground is also used by my own club, the British Officers Cricket Club. Superb facilities are also available at the Philadelphia, Germantown and Merion Cricket Clubs as well (although these revert to the more financially rewarding game of tennis from late May to September). All four venues will be used shortly for the Philadelphia Cricket Festival, which features 12 teams from as far afield as California, New York, Canada and the UK. So while not perhaps in the same class as yesteryear, cricket is by no means dead in this part of the world. More information can be found on our website at www.bocccricket.com, writes Angus Dawe Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly We regret that not all questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into",

      "body": "<p>It's been two years since Consumer volunteered to take on those modern bogeymen - customer service centres and automated helplines - on behalf of our long-suffering readers. To mark the anniversary it seems only fair to credit those companies who have, by their unorthodox interpretations of customer care, kept Dear Anna going. Your letters have, as always, been many and varied, ranging from the bizarre (with apologies to the gentleman who sought help for his genital rash) to the heart-breaking, but, it seems, our fragmenting nation remains united by our hatred for three indispensables: computers, telecoms and the privatised gas industry. </p> <p>You are evidently a technologically adventurous lot, judging from your wrangles with high street electrical giants, but computers - which represented the largest slice of complaints last year - have slipped to third place, perhaps due to the launch of digital television, which has helped put the telecoms industry at the top of this year's list. Laments in this category accounted for just under a third of all the letters we received, and half of that number concerned mobile phones. Unsurprisingly, recently published figures show that these tiny contraptions, designed to smooth life's path, are now up there with second-hand car dealers and double-glazing salesmen when it comes to complaints. </p> <p>The problem is not so much the quality of the product, but the attitude of the customer services. If you're lucky enough to get through, that is. The man hours spent by most of you listening to Vivaldi on automated helplines would suffice to build a millennium dome for Manchester. Telecommunications giants, it seems, are not too hot at communicating. </p> <p>Another familiar bugbear is the privatised utilities. As myriad new gas companies do battle for custom, more and more of you have outed yourselves as ETs (erroneous transfers), poached without your knowledge by a rival gas company or left in limbo between two suppliers. And while some of you have had to face down debt collection agencies over bills from suppliers you've never heard of, others are struggling to get a bill out of anyone at all. British Gas, being the largest of them, is not unnaturally the favourite enemy, accounting for 6% of our total postbag (1% up on last year). </p> <p>Trailing behind is the iniquitous world of insurance (6% of complaints) and mail order (9%). </p> <p>More unexpected is the small number of complaints about our train services, although Virgin must be congratulated on achieving 56% of rail gripes. Possibly we have become too resigned to late and cancelled trains to bother raising our voices. Most of the complaints we did receive concerned the bizarre routines required to book through tickets on the privatised system. Not even the rail operators seem entirely sure of what is valid where and one reader's \u00a31,200 season ticket turned out to be valid solely on a train that didn't exist. \"I saw a copy of the routing guide once and got the fright of my life,\" a spokesman from the Association of Train Operators told us recently. </p> <p>Finally, Ikea and the Dixons Group deserve a little mention all of their own for providing 1.5% and 2% of our mailbag respectively. Keep up the good work, chaps - we'll ensure you see your name in lights! </p> <p> <strong> The One You Most Love to Hate:</strong> </p> <p>Despite its best efforts, poor British Gas has been usurped this year by the truly spectacular achievements of Cable &amp; Wireless. Its phantom phone lines, vanishing engineers, impenetrable automated queuing systems and unforgettable customer services account for 10% of your complaints. C&amp;W has admitted that \"there have been some problems and are trying to do something about it\". </p> <p> <strong> The Most Prolific Newcomer:</strong> </p> <p> Few of us had heard of 1st Line at the beginning of last year. Now 5% of our correspondents have received its won't-take-no-for-an-answer cold-calls, inviting them to accept a free trial mobile. Then comes the fun; unsanctioned direct debit instructions, unexpected fees, and more aggressive hard sell when they try to break free. 1st Line have printed apologies in five national tabloids for problems arising from \"incredible demand\". </p> <p> <strong> The Biggest Blip:</strong> </p> <p> The car hire company Hire For Lower burst into our consciousness last summer when 2% of our year's mailbag highlighted cliff-hanging waits for rental documents that often turned out to be invalid or incomplete when presented at check-in desks. In response, the firm promised to triple its customer services (to three) and the complaints dried up. </p> <p> <strong> The Biggest Climbdown:</strong> </p> <p> And the winner is Virgin Holidays. Its constantly changing flight and hotel schedules jeopardised the nuptials of two couples who'd booked a double wedding package in Antigua. Virgin declared itself powerless, but when Consumer protested, Virgin offered to charter a special plane for the wedding party to help get them home. </p> <p> <strong> The Favourite Excuse:</strong> </p> <p> \"It was the computers' fault.\" (All companies.) An invaluable blame deflector when official letters threaten blameless customers (and non-customers) with debt collection agencies, close/open accounts without warning, or when charges are debited in tripli cate from the wrong account. Also handy for the non-delivery of orders, the non-arrival of technicians and the non-call-back from customer services. </p> <p> <strong> The Most Surreal Excuse:</strong> </p> <p> Step forward Cable &amp; Wireless who told Barbara Smoker of Bromley that her new phone line had been mistakenly installed at her neighbour's house because her neighbour had the same name as herself (not that this stopped C&amp;W sending the bills to Smoker). In an attempt to make amends, good old C&amp;W, having previously confused Smoker's address with her neighbour's, switched them round and gave her neighbour Smoker's address. Thus Smoker received a change-of-name form intended for the neighbour, which the latter couldn't fill out because she never had been called Barbara Smoker. </p> <p> <strong> The Creakiest Customer Services:</strong> </p> <p> Hooray once more for British Gas, which eventually compensated G Rigby three years after messing up his central heating system. </p> <p> <strong> The Best Example of Bureaucratic Logic:</strong> </p> <p> It would be a shame not to give Ikea its moment of well-deserved glory. Several readers, who checked before setting out that certain large items were in stock, drove across country to find them unavailable. The goods were, in fact, on a top shelf, reachable only by a fork lift. Could they be fetched down? Too dangerous; can only be done overnight. Could they be fetched overnight and put aside? No, we don't take overnight orders. Could extra numbers be brought down to meet demand? Sorry, the computer only allows two at a time. If you want three you'll have to make two trips. </p> <p> <strong> The Most Effective Vanishing Act:</strong> </p> <p> The Wrought Iron Bed Factory which, having promised to waft its customers to cut-price dream land, left them sleepless after disappearing in August 1999 with thousands of pounds worth of orders unfulfilled. A sign at the shop said, \"On holiday, back on August 31\", but when Consumer went to welcome back the staff, there was nobody there. Consumer has had no news of them since. </p> <p> <strong> The Most Bashful Sales Team:</strong> </p> <p> Surprise, surprise, it's those unassuming double-glazing salesmen again. This time at Highgrove Windows based in Kent. Not that they admit to that. \"Why are you being so pushy?\" demanded the telephonist on Consumer's fourth attempt to establish the company's whereabouts. \"I don't know where we're based,\" ventured another. When Consumer caught the managing director unawares on his mobile, he was overcome with sudden earache and had to ring off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's been two years since Consumer volunteered to take on those modern bogeymen - customer service centres and automated helplines - on behalf of our long-suffering readers. To mark the anniversary it seems only fair to credit those companies who have, by their unorthodox interpretations of customer care, kept Dear Anna going. Your letters have, as always, been many and varied, ranging from the bizarre (with apologies to the gentleman who sought help for his genital rash) to the heart-breaking, but, it seems, our fragmenting nation remains united by our hatred for three indispensables: computers, telecoms and the privatised gas industry. You are evidently a technologically adventurous lot, judging from your wrangles with high street electrical giants, but computers - which represented the largest slice of complaints last year - have slipped to third place, perhaps due to the launch of digital television, which has helped put the telecoms industry at the top of this year's list. Laments in this category accounted for just under a third of all the letters we received, and half of that number concerned mobile phones. Unsurprisingly, recently published figures show that these tiny contraptions, designed to smooth life's path, are now up there with second-hand car dealers and double-glazing salesmen when it comes to complaints. The problem is not so much the quality of the product, but the attitude of the customer services. If you're lucky enough to get through, that is. The man hours spent by most of you listening to Vivaldi on automated helplines would suffice to build a millennium dome for Manchester. Telecommunications giants, it seems, are not too hot at communicating. Another familiar bugbear is the privatised utilities. As myriad new gas companies do battle for custom, more and more of you have outed yourselves as ETs (erroneous transfers), poached without your knowledge by a rival gas company or left in limbo between two suppliers. And while some of you have had to face down debt collection agencies over bills from suppliers you've never heard of, others are struggling to get a bill out of anyone at all. British Gas, being the largest of them, is not unnaturally the favourite enemy, accounting for 6% of our total postbag (1% up on last year). Trailing behind is the iniquitous world of insurance (6% of complaints) and mail order (9%). More unexpected is the small number of complaints about our train services, although Virgin must be congratulated on achieving 56% of rail gripes. Possibly we have become too resigned to late and cancelled trains to bother raising our voices. Most of the complaints we did receive concerned the bizarre routines required to book through tickets on the privatised system. Not even the rail operators seem entirely sure of what is valid where and one reader's \u00a31,200 season ticket turned out to be valid solely on a train that didn't exist. \"I saw a copy of the routing guide once and got the fright of my life,\" a spokesman from the Association of Train Operators told us recently. Finally, Ikea and the Dixons Group deserve a little mention all of their own for providing 1.5% and 2% of our mailbag respectively. Keep up the good work, chaps - we'll ensure you see your name in lights! The One You Most Love to Hate: Despite its best efforts, poor British Gas has been usurped this year by the truly spectacular achievements of Cable &amp; Wireless. Its phantom phone lines, vanishing engineers, impenetrable automated queuing systems and unforgettable customer services account for 10% of your complaints. C&amp;W has admitted that \"there have been some problems and are trying to do something about it\". The Most Prolific Newcomer: Few of us had heard of 1st Line at the beginning of last year. Now 5% of our correspondents have received its won't-take-no-for-an-answer cold-calls, inviting them to accept a free trial mobile. Then comes the fun; unsanctioned direct debit instructions, unexpected fees, and more aggressive hard sell when they try to break free. 1st Line have printed apologies in five national tabloids for problems arising from \"incredible demand\". The Biggest Blip: The car hire company Hire For Lower burst into our consciousness last summer when 2% of our year's mailbag highlighted cliff-hanging waits for rental documents that often turned out to be invalid or incomplete when presented at check-in desks. In response, the firm promised to triple its customer services (to three) and the complaints dried up. The Biggest Climbdown: And the winner is Virgin Holidays. Its constantly changing flight and hotel schedules jeopardised the nuptials of two couples who'd booked a double wedding package in Antigua. Virgin declared itself powerless, but when Consumer protested, Virgin offered to charter a special plane for the wedding party to help get them home. The Favourite Excuse: \"It was the computers' fault.\" (All companies.) An invaluable blame deflector when official letters threaten blameless customers (and non-customers) with debt collection agencies, close/open accounts without warning, or when charges are debited in tripli cate from the wrong account. Also handy for the non-delivery of orders, the non-arrival of technicians and the non-call-back from customer services. The Most Surreal Excuse: Step forward Cable &amp; Wireless who told Barbara Smoker of Bromley that her new phone line had been mistakenly installed at her neighbour's house because her neighbour had the same name as herself (not that this stopped C&amp;W sending the bills to Smoker). In an attempt to make amends, good old C&amp;W, having previously confused Smoker's address with her neighbour's, switched them round and gave her neighbour Smoker's address. Thus Smoker received a change-of-name form intended for the neighbour, which the latter couldn't fill out because she never had been called Barbara Smoker. The Creakiest Customer Services: Hooray once more for British Gas, which eventually compensated G Rigby three years after messing up his central heating system. The Best Example of Bureaucratic Logic: It would be a shame not to give Ikea its moment of well-deserved glory. Several readers, who checked before setting out that certain large items were in stock, drove across country to find them unavailable. The goods were, in fact, on a top shelf, reachable only by a fork lift. Could they be fetched down? Too dangerous; can only be done overnight. Could they be fetched overnight and put aside? No, we don't take overnight orders. Could extra numbers be brought down to meet demand? Sorry, the computer only allows two at a time. If you want three you'll have to make two trips. The Most Effective Vanishing Act: The Wrought Iron Bed Factory which, having promised to waft its customers to cut-price dream land, left them sleepless after disappearing in August 1999 with thousands of pounds worth of orders unfulfilled. A sign at the shop said, \"On holiday, back on August 31\", but when Consumer went to welcome back the staff, there was nobody there. Consumer has had no news of them since. The Most Bashful Sales Team: Surprise, surprise, it's those unassuming double-glazing salesmen again. This time at Highgrove Windows based in Kent. Not that they admit to that. \"Why are you being so pushy?\" demanded the telephonist on Consumer's fourth attempt to establish the company's whereabouts. \"I don't know where we're based,\" ventured another. When Consumer caught the managing director unawares on his mobile, he was overcome with sudden earache and had to ring off.",

He first became aware of Van Nistelrooy's burgeoning talents when the striker was only 17 and playing with the Dutch second division side Den Bosch. Ferguson utilised the foot soldiers among an extensive scouting network that is headed by the chief scout, and former United assistant, Mick Brown and Ferguson's own brother Martin, who carries the title \"overseas scout\". United also have numerous part- and full-time scouts in Britain and three full-time overseas scouts, two of them based in France and Sweden. About three years ago Martin Ferguson, who served as assistant manager with Hibernian and St Mirren before linking up with his brother, drew up his first dossier on a player who was gaining the attention of the big Dutch clubs, including the then PSV manager Bobby Robson. Robson kept the United manager informed about the striker's development after signing him from Den Bosch, recommending him as a United star of the future. By 1998 Martin was urging his brother to think seriously about signing Van Nistelrooy. The reports and videos continued to pile up on Ferguson's desk and Robson, bumping into Martin Ferguson on one of his visits to PSV this season, urged him to recommend an immediate move. \u0095 Fiorentina's goalkeeper Francesco Toldo has said that he will leave the Italian club at the end of the season and that Manchester United are one of the favourites to sign him. \u0095 Sir Bobby Charlton last night handed the European Cup over to the safekeeping of the city of Paris where this year's final will be played on May 24.",

      "body": "<p>Gregory Doran has lately become a jet-setting director. By the time the less-than-flattering reviews of his Stratford As You Like It appeared last month, he was already in Tokyo to supervise the transfer of his triumphant Royal Shakespeare Company Macbeth. \"As the Stratford reviews were faxed through,\" he says, \"I felt like committing hara-kiri. I'd also done five shows in 15 months and felt knackered. Then a fax arrived from the Stratford company simply saying, of the critics, 'Fuck 'em.' \" </p> <p>For Doran As You Like It was a hiccup in a run of success with the RSC. He first worked with the company as an actor in 1987, when he met his partner, Antony Sher - there's an oft-told story of how, playing Solanio, he one night described Sher's Shylock as \"the most impenetrable cur that ever slept with [instead of kept with] men.\" Now Doran, who is in his early 40s, has emerged from Sher's shadow to become a highly prized RSC associate director, often tipped as Adrian Noble's eventual successor - an idea he politely squashes. </p> <p>Although Doran and Sher have thriving separate careers, they have worked together four times - on a South African Titus Andronicus plus Cyrano de Bergerac, The Winter's Tale and Macbeth for the RSC. Is there ever a danger of he and Sher pre-empting the rehearsal process by sorting out problems at home. </p> <p>\"I don't think so. For a start we're complete opposites. Tony's a pessimist and I'm an optimist. He has a dark, brooding African spirit whereas I have a soft, greyly monotonous English quality. I'm maybe calmer in temperament than he is. But also we're quite rigorous about how we work together. When we did Titus in South Africa we took the work home with us and I began to feel I needed my own space. Now we ration our discussions so that with Macbeth [now on at the Old Vic] I probably talked in advance as much to Harriet Walter as I did to Tony. Having been a spear-carrier at Stratford, I also feel Shakespeare's plays only work when you get a total investment from the whole company.\" </p> <p>Some ideas, however, have to start with the director. And one of Doran's most brilliant in Macbeth is to begin the play in pitch darkness. \"That evolved,\" he says, \"from directing Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy. I insisted on an absolute blackout for the opening scene which meant turning off all the exit lights. On the Guildford first night I was standing at the back and a man rushed past me in panic saying, 'I've got to get out.' Another night I heard a strange gurgling sound and discovered it was a deaf person suffering from total sensory deprivation. It alerted me to how quickly you could remove people from the simple things they require to keep a sense of equilibrium. </p> <p>\"It's also absolutely right for Macbeth, which taps into all our primal instincts, though initially I made the mistake of having the witches' voices on amplifiers that flew out over the audience. It was too tricksy.\" </p> <p>But why does Macbeth so often fail? In my lifetime, I've seen only a handful of successful productions: Trevor Nunn's Other Place version in 1976, Ninagawa's Japanese elegy in 1986 and now Doran's intimate RSC production. \"I suspect,\" he says, \"people normally start back to front with it. They start with the theatricality of the witches or the supernatural. The first three or four scenes also go by in a rush of generalised war. In fact, what's happening is absolutely specific. There's an attempted coup d'etat. Maybe Macbeth fights as hard as he does not to re-establish Duncan but to ensure that Cawdor does not become king. But if Cawdor can rebel, why can't he? We felt that the Macbeths seize their opportunity and that the witches are simply observers. I said to Tony one day: imagine someone stops you in the street and predicts you'll win an Oscar. Your agent then phones up to say you've been nominated. Do you rely on a chance prediction or do you get out to Hollywood and do all the promotion? In terms of Macbeth, it's the coincidence of the witches' prophecy rather than the malign purpose of it that strikes one.\" </p> <p>If Doran hit the mark dead centre with Macbeth, he is widely perceived to have missed it with As You Like It. But he still believes strongly in the central idea: of Arden as a forest of the mind that becomes an extension of the tapestry Rosalind is working on and that is filled with her own vivacity and imagination. He also laughs off the notion that the rough reviews have lengthened the odds against his ever taking over the RSC. </p> <p>\"Is it my ambition to run the RSC? I don't think so. The job isn't up for grabs so it's not an issue. My sole desire is to direct the plays I want to do. I want to direct an Othello in The Swan with Tony as Iago. And I'd like to do a new version of the Morte d'Arthur for Stratford since I feel it deals with the matter of England.\" </p> <p>This summer, however, he's taking a break from the RSC to direct the York Mystery plays in York Minster. Since he was born in Yorkshire, educated at Preston Catholic College and had an uncle who was a Benedectine abbot, he seems the right man for the job. But his own catholicism lapsed when it came into conflict with his sexuality, and anyway he sees the Mysteries as expressions of civic pride rather than openly didactic works.

      "bodyText": "Gregory Doran has lately become a jet-setting director. By the time the less-than-flattering reviews of his Stratford As You Like It appeared last month, he was already in Tokyo to supervise the transfer of his triumphant Royal Shakespeare Company Macbeth. \"As the Stratford reviews were faxed through,\" he says, \"I felt like committing hara-kiri. I'd also done five shows in 15 months and felt knackered. Then a fax arrived from the Stratford company simply saying, of the critics, 'Fuck 'em.' \" For Doran As You Like It was a hiccup in a run of success with the RSC. He first worked with the company as an actor in 1987, when he met his partner, Antony Sher - there's an oft-told story of how, playing Solanio, he one night described Sher's Shylock as \"the most impenetrable cur that ever slept with [instead of kept with] men.\" Now Doran, who is in his early 40s, has emerged from Sher's shadow to become a highly prized RSC associate director, often tipped as Adrian Noble's eventual successor - an idea he politely squashes. Although Doran and Sher have thriving separate careers, they have worked together four times - on a South African Titus Andronicus plus Cyrano de Bergerac, The Winter's Tale and Macbeth for the RSC. Is there ever a danger of he and Sher pre-empting the rehearsal process by sorting out problems at home. \"I don't think so. For a start we're complete opposites. Tony's a pessimist and I'm an optimist. He has a dark, brooding African spirit whereas I have a soft, greyly monotonous English quality. I'm maybe calmer in temperament than he is. But also we're quite rigorous about how we work together. When we did Titus in South Africa we took the work home with us and I began to feel I needed my own space. Now we ration our discussions so that with Macbeth [now on at the Old Vic] I probably talked in advance as much to Harriet Walter as I did to Tony. Having been a spear-carrier at Stratford, I also feel Shakespeare's plays only work when you get a total investment from the whole company.\" Some ideas, however, have to start with the director. And one of Doran's most brilliant in Macbeth is to begin the play in pitch darkness. \"That evolved,\" he says, \"from directing Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy. I insisted on an absolute blackout for the opening scene which meant turning off all the exit lights. On the Guildford first night I was standing at the back and a man rushed past me in panic saying, 'I've got to get out.' Another night I heard a strange gurgling sound and discovered it was a deaf person suffering from total sensory deprivation. It alerted me to how quickly you could remove people from the simple things they require to keep a sense of equilibrium. \"It's also absolutely right for Macbeth, which taps into all our primal instincts, though initially I made the mistake of having the witches' voices on amplifiers that flew out over the audience. It was too tricksy.\" But why does Macbeth so often fail? In my lifetime, I've seen only a handful of successful productions: Trevor Nunn's Other Place version in 1976, Ninagawa's Japanese elegy in 1986 and now Doran's intimate RSC production. \"I suspect,\" he says, \"people normally start back to front with it. They start with the theatricality of the witches or the supernatural. The first three or four scenes also go by in a rush of generalised war. In fact, what's happening is absolutely specific. There's an attempted coup d'etat. Maybe Macbeth fights as hard as he does not to re-establish Duncan but to ensure that Cawdor does not become king. But if Cawdor can rebel, why can't he? We felt that the Macbeths seize their opportunity and that the witches are simply observers. I said to Tony one day: imagine someone stops you in the street and predicts you'll win an Oscar. Your agent then phones up to say you've been nominated. Do you rely on a chance prediction or do you get out to Hollywood and do all the promotion? In terms of Macbeth, it's the coincidence of the witches' prophecy rather than the malign purpose of it that strikes one.\" If Doran hit the mark dead centre with Macbeth, he is widely perceived to have missed it with As You Like It. But he still believes strongly in the central idea: of Arden as a forest of the mind that becomes an extension of the tapestry Rosalind is working on and that is filled with her own vivacity and imagination. He also laughs off the notion that the rough reviews have lengthened the odds against his ever taking over the RSC. \"Is it my ambition to run the RSC? I don't think so. The job isn't up for grabs so it's not an issue. My sole desire is to direct the plays I want to do. I want to direct an Othello in The Swan with Tony as Iago. And I'd like to do a new version of the Morte d'Arthur for Stratford since I feel it deals with the matter of England.\" This summer, however, he's taking a break from the RSC to direct the York Mystery plays in York Minster. Since he was born in Yorkshire, educated at Preston Catholic College and had an uncle who was a Benedectine abbot, he seems the right man for the job. But his own catholicism lapsed when it came into conflict with his sexuality, and anyway he sees the Mysteries as expressions of civic pride rather than openly didactic works. He even relishes the prospect of working with 200 amateur actors. \"I was auditioning the other day and a man came up to me and said 'I'm not good at coming in on time and I can't learn lines but I could shout \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\" if push came to shove.' So he's in. But what I hope to combine is the highly competitive nature of the original Guild shows with Christian iconography. I'm no longer actively religious but, as Sartre said, 'We have a God-shaped hole in our consciousness which we've never learned to fill.' I undoubtedly have one in mine.

      "body": "<p>When Apple decided to supply a copy of a little program called Hypercard on all Macintosh computers back in the 80s, it prepared the way for what would become the web's most distinctive feature, hypertext. It also unknowingly launched a small literary revolution. </p> <p>Hypertext is the bone and muscle of the web, the crucial element that lets people move through cyberspace rather than sit looking at a static image on a screen. Click with a mouse on a bit of hypertext (which can be a letter, a word, or a chunk of text), and you're whisked off to whatever is linked to it. But hypertext existed well before the web, and Hypercard introduced hundreds of thousands of people to the concept. </p> <p>Hypercard enabled people to connect information by association rather than in the more structured sequence of a written document. Users could create \"stacks\" of virtual notecards (hypercards) on a subject, and create links between cards (hyperlinking them). A reader - or, more appropriately, an explorer - could go literally anywhere, in any direction through the stack. </p> <p>Hypercard gave ordinary computer users the physical embodiment of one of the most startling insights of Vannevar Bush, science advisor to Franklin D Roosevelt, who wrote a prescient essay in 1945 called As We May Think (archived at <a href=\"http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush\">www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush</a>). In it, he imagined the Memex, an electromechanical device much like a modern day PC, which could store information and allow it to be recalled in wayward but sensible patterns. The human mind, he argued, works not by creating hierarchies of information but by \"association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next. In accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.\" </p> <p>By 1972 computer pioneer Ted Nelson was exploring this concept on computers and had coined the word hypertext. When in the early 90s Tim Berners-Lee mated the visual world of Hypercard and hypertext and the interactive connections of the internet, a powerful new hybrid, the world wide web, was born. But well before the web was conceived, writers had begun experimenting with Hypercard and soon seized upon the artistic possibilities of hypertext. What if one could read in a non-linear way, enabling - or, some would argue, forcing - the reader to create a new reading of a poem or story every time one ventured into it? </p> <p>Soon a program for writing hypertext was on the market, which allowed writers to structure a work by deciding how text would unfold to a reader. To read a hypertext, a reader moves between screens of text called lexias. A lexia can contain one or many links - usually an interactive word or phrase - to other lexias. Sometimes a certain lexia cannot be revealed until a reader has read other lexias first. Reading becomes a fluid experience - and a highly uncertain, unstable one. With the advent of the web, writers quickly moved to creating works online as well as on disk, and a wide variety of work can be perused from your desktop. Disk-based works tend to have more structural complexity, however. </p> <p>Hypertext proponents say that hypertext enables a writer (and reader) to break free of the rigid, linear format of the print book. They point to Sterne with Tristram Shandy, Woolf with To The Lighthouse, and Joyce with Ulysses, as authors who struggled to do this in print. Hypertext, they argue, pushes literature into places it has been trying to go for decades. </p> <p>Critics say hypertext is a lot of complex and pointless literary nonsense, merely a vehicle for testing out the pet theories of convoluted postmodern theorists like Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida. But their longstanding complaint that it's annoying to read a work on a computer may have to be abandoned with the availability of new, small reading devices. </p> <p>One of the best places to delve into hypertext is at the site of its leading publisher, <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com\">Eastgate</a>. Publisher Mark Bernstein is both a devotee, writer and essayist and nurtures a range of writers, sells hypertext works and critical writings about it, and has extensive links to essays, online hypertext and more. While there, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/TwelveBlue/Welcome.html\">Twelve Blue</a> by Michael Joyce, who wrote the haunting Afternoon, A Story, considered a hypertext classic. </p> <p>One of the more extravagant online hypertext works is Mark Amerika's <a href=\"http://www.grammatron.com\">Grammatron</a> while a wide range of texts reside at <a href=\"http://www.turbulence.org.\">www.turbulence.org</a>. You can even view James Joyce in hypertext at <a href=\"http://www.mpx.com.au/~charles/WR/intro.htm\">www.mpx.com</a>. </p> <p>Non-fiction works abound as well: try the Dictionary of Sensibility, <a href=\"http://www.engl.virginia.edu/\">www.engl.virginia.edu/~enec981/dictionary</a>, or <a href=\"http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/pmc/current.issue/8.2miles.html\" target=\"_new\">Singing In The Rain: a Hypertextual Reading</a>. </p> <p> Poetry has also proved popular as an online hypertext format.

Users could create \"stacks\" of virtual notecards (hypercards) on a subject, and create links between cards (hyperlinking them). A reader - or, more appropriately, an explorer - could go literally anywhere, in any direction through the stack. Hypercard gave ordinary computer users the physical embodiment of one of the most startling insights of Vannevar Bush, science advisor to Franklin D Roosevelt, who wrote a prescient essay in 1945 called As We May Think (archived at www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush). In it, he imagined the Memex, an electromechanical device much like a modern day PC, which could store information and allow it to be recalled in wayward but sensible patterns. The human mind, he argued, works not by creating hierarchies of information but by \"association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next. In accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.\" By 1972 computer pioneer Ted Nelson was exploring this concept on computers and had coined the word hypertext. When in the early 90s Tim Berners-Lee mated the visual world of Hypercard and hypertext and the interactive connections of the internet, a powerful new hybrid, the world wide web, was born. But well before the web was conceived, writers had begun experimenting with Hypercard and soon seized upon the artistic possibilities of hypertext. What if one could read in a non-linear way, enabling - or, some would argue, forcing - the reader to create a new reading of a poem or story every time one ventured into it? Soon a program for writing hypertext was on the market, which allowed writers to structure a work by deciding how text would unfold to a reader. To read a hypertext, a reader moves between screens of text called lexias. A lexia can contain one or many links - usually an interactive word or phrase - to other lexias. Sometimes a certain lexia cannot be revealed until a reader has read other lexias first. Reading becomes a fluid experience - and a highly uncertain, unstable one. With the advent of the web, writers quickly moved to creating works online as well as on disk, and a wide variety of work can be perused from your desktop. Disk-based works tend to have more structural complexity, however. Hypertext proponents say that hypertext enables a writer (and reader) to break free of the rigid, linear format of the print book. They point to Sterne with Tristram Shandy, Woolf with To The Lighthouse, and Joyce with Ulysses, as authors who struggled to do this in print. Hypertext, they argue, pushes literature into places it has been trying to go for decades. Critics say hypertext is a lot of complex and pointless literary nonsense, merely a vehicle for testing out the pet theories of convoluted postmodern theorists like Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida. But their longstanding complaint that it's annoying to read a work on a computer may have to be abandoned with the availability of new, small reading devices. One of the best places to delve into hypertext is at the site of its leading publisher, Eastgate. Publisher Mark Bernstein is both a devotee, writer and essayist and nurtures a range of writers, sells hypertext works and critical writings about it, and has extensive links to essays, online hypertext and more. While there, have a look at Twelve Blue by Michael Joyce, who wrote the haunting Afternoon, A Story, considered a hypertext classic. One of the more extravagant online hypertext works is Mark Amerika's Grammatron while a wide range of texts reside at www.turbulence.org. You can even view James Joyce in hypertext at www.mpx.com. Non-fiction works abound as well: try the Dictionary of Sensibility, www.engl.virginia.edu/~enec981/dictionary, or Singing In The Rain: a Hypertextual Reading. Poetry has also proved popular as an online hypertext format. Visit the Electronic Poetry Center, Ubuweb, or Rice, a suite of poems about Vietnam, www.idaspoetics.com.au/rice/riceheading.html. A recent edition of online zine Feed featured an essay on hypertext by writer and critic Robert Coover, with links to previous Feed discussions on the topic, www.feedmag.comdocument/do291_master.html. If by now you are appalled, entranced or outraged by hypertext, jump into the continuing online discussion that follows the essay.",

Ionel Ganea then went close but eventually found the target after being upended in the area; Hagi, the usual penalty taker, handed the job to the Universitatea Craiova striker. </p> <p>At Stade de France the World Cup holders were given a scare by Slovenia, going two behind after eight minutes. However, David Trezeguet equalised after 63 minutes, Laurent Blanc made it 2-2 and Trezeguet bundled in the winner deep in injury-time. </p> <p>Gert Verheyen scored twice to give Belgium a 2-0 win over Norway in Oslo. The home side dominated the first half and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer missed three chances; he did not appear for the second period. But Verheyen turned the game in the 55th minute and added a second just before the final whistle. \"We weren't as aggressive as we should have been,\" said Solskjaer. </p> <p>In Moscow Yegor Titov and Valery Karpin scored second-half goals to give Russia a 2-0 win against the United States in the first game between them to be played on Russian soil. </p> <p>Sweden defeated Denmark 1-0 in Copenhagan, Kaiserslautern's striker Joergen Pettersson joining the small but expanding ranks of those who have beaten the Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel with a lob. </p> <p>Bayern Munich's president Franz Beckenbauer was in Sofia to receive an honorary doctorate and went on to watch the friendly between Bulgaria and Ukraine. \"I haven't come with an offer for [Andrei] Shevchenko, who is definitely a high-class player,\" he said.

It was a particularly memorable evening for Gheorghe Hagi, the local hero who provided much of Romania's attacking verve and in whose honour the stadium had been renamed. More than 20,000 fans were present to witness the occasion and it was Hagi, winning his 121st cap, who knocked in a free-kick which set up Adrian Mutu for the opening goal after 58 minutes. Ionel Ganea then went close but eventually found the target after being upended in the area; Hagi, the usual penalty taker, handed the job to the Universitatea Craiova striker. At Stade de France the World Cup holders were given a scare by Slovenia, going two behind after eight minutes. However, David Trezeguet equalised after 63 minutes, Laurent Blanc made it 2-2 and Trezeguet bundled in the winner deep in injury-time. Gert Verheyen scored twice to give Belgium a 2-0 win over Norway in Oslo. The home side dominated the first half and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer missed three chances; he did not appear for the second period. But Verheyen turned the game in the 55th minute and added a second just before the final whistle. \"We weren't as aggressive as we should have been,\" said Solskjaer. In Moscow Yegor Titov and Valery Karpin scored second-half goals to give Russia a 2-0 win against the United States in the first game between them to be played on Russian soil. Sweden defeated Denmark 1-0 in Copenhagan, Kaiserslautern's striker Joergen Pettersson joining the small but expanding ranks of those who have beaten the Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel with a lob. Bayern Munich's president Franz Beckenbauer was in Sofia to receive an honorary doctorate and went on to watch the friendly between Bulgaria and Ukraine. \"I haven't come with an offer for [Andrei] Shevchenko, who is definitely a high-class player,\" he said. The Milan striker's 54th-minute header duly won the game for Ukraine.",

      "bodyText": "A 19-year-old female student has been charged with assault and unlawful imprisonment of Germaine Greer, the academic and feminist icon. The student, believed to be from Nottingham, was arrested at Ms Greer's home in Great Chesterford, near Saffron Walden in Essex, on Monday evening after police received a call alerting them that the writer was being held at the property against her will. Last night police refused to name the student, who was questioned by detectives before being bailed to appear before magistrates in Harlow on May 4, charged with unlawful imprisonment and as sault occasioning actual bodily harm. Ms Greer, who is professor of comparative literature at Warwick university, was unavailable for comment. A spokeswoman at her London agent, Gillon and Aitken, who was unaware of the incident, said the author was speaking at the Galway Literary festival in Ireland, where she was promoting the paperback version of her latest book, The Whole Woman. A spokesman for Essex police said: \"At about 6.30pm on April 24 an incident occurred at a residential premises in Walden Road, Great Chesterford, where a resident was held against her will. As a result a 19-year-old female was arrested and has been charged.\" Police refused to give any information on the nature of the assault or injuries sustained by Ms Greer, or the length of time she was allegedly held captive. The academic and author became a household name in the 1970s after the publication of her groundbreaking book, The Female Eunuch, which was considered the bible of feminism. Last night Ms Greer's \u00a3500,000 Georgian house was empty. Born in Australia and educated at Melbourne and Oxford universities, she lives alone at the property with her two standard poodles, Molly and Margo, and her cats. It is not the first time Ms Greer has found herself troubled by unwelcome visitors to her home. In 1994, writing in the Big Issue Magazine, she issued an open invitation to homeless people to come and live in her rambling farmhouse. The first person to take up the offer was a Mail on Sunday reporter, masquerading as a homeless person, who subsequently wrote a three-page diary of his three-day stay. She has also been involved in a number of heated disputes with other feminist writers, most notably her infamous spat with Suzanne Moore, whom she described in personal and unflattering terms.",

A few miles to the south-west, stands a shabby row of miners' terraced houses; while, some 80 miles further south, the ghostly ruins of a once-booming iron works totter against the sky. The images - from Cwmystwyth, Pontrhydfendigaid and Ynyscedwyn, in Powys and Ceredigion - contrast starkly with the dramatic and picturesque beauty more commonly associated with the principality, and point instead to the grim reality of rural deprivation and despair. Yet, in the wake of the highly-successful British films Trainspotting and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - both of which relied on the gritty backdrops - such views are now being used to tempt movie moguls to the country. Instead of relying on stock images of the Brecon Beacons or the Elan Valley, the Mid Wales Film Commission has included the likes of the disused mines, shabby houses and even a 1960s bungalow in a glossy brochure aimed at film directors. The decision to include the sites among the 350 on offer seemed natural to Mike Wallwork, the commissioner. \"The inquiries we get are for a whole range of different locations and directors are just as likely to want to shoot a scene in an old mine or shabby terrace as they are on a stunning Welsh mountainside,\" he said. \"Yes, mid Wales has some stunning landscapes - we've just had Martin Clunes filming for ITV in the Elan valley - but less attractive locations have just as much appeal.\" The commissioner added that filming in gritty, industrial locations was not a new phenomenon in Wales: the 1959 classic Tiger Bay was filmed in the Cardiff docks, while many scenes for the 1996 cult film Twin Town were filmed around a rundown caravan in front of Port Talbot oil refinery.

      "body": "<p><strong>What is broadband?</strong><br> Broadband is short for \"wide bandwidth\". It is the capacity to send huge quantities of information over phone lines, cables and wireless connections, giving users high-speed internet access and making it easier to send video and audio material over the internet. Conventional internet access down a phone line to a UK home is slow, narrow bandwidth.</p> <p><strong>What is BT offering?</strong><br> Through its <a href=\"http://www.btopenworld.com/flash.html\">BTopenworld</a> subsidiary, BT will offer broadband internet access to UK home users and businesses in July. After a small box is installed in your house, you will be able to get internet access about 10 times faster than with a good modem, connect more than one PC to the internet, and continue to use the phone while you are online. The old system of dialling up also ends, as broadband gives a continuous connection. </p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br> BT's broadband uses asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) technology. ADSL enables more data to travel down ordinary phone lines or cables - a far cheaper option than installing completely new cables. It is called asymmetrical because information can travel far quicker down the line to a consumer than it can if a consumer wants to send information back up the line. As most people use the internet to download rather than upload information, they probably won't notice the asymmetry. </p> <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br> BTopenworld does not charge for calls, billing customers a fixed fee for unlimited access. Home users will pay \u00a339.99 a month for the line and a \u00a3150 connection fee (free if you sign up before June 30). This is more expensive than the latest unmetered deals for conventional internet access offered by companies such as <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,213138,00.html\">NTL and AltaVista</a>, but you get a faster service for your money. </p> <p><strong>What are the drawbacks?</strong><br> \u0095 Not everyone in Britain can sign up for the service. Currently, only 26% of the UK will have access to BT's ADSL network. BT says one in three UK households and businesses will be within range by its July launch, covering London, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Oxford, Brighton and 20 other cities. </p> <p>\u0095 The ADSL lines offered by BT are still not quick enough to enable home users to watch video over the internet. BT hopes to upgrade speeds by the autumn, but even then the US, which has had ADSL technology since 1998, has far faster lines.</p> <p>\u0095 The asymmetric nature of ADSL makes a mockery of claims that the internet is truly \"interactive\". <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,213138,00.html\">John Naughton</a> argues that it doesn't bother corporations that consumers cannot send large amounts of information back up the lines because \"they don't care about the punters sending anything back - except their credit card numbers\". ADSL keeps the consumer passive rather than empowering them to use the high-speed technology to, for instance, serve up their own websites from home instead of paying an ISP.</p> <p><strong>Could BT do better?</strong><br> The <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4012233,00.html\">European Commission says</a> BT has been too slow to open up its telephone network to competitors wanting to offer similar broadband services. The British government has required that BT update and open up its network by 2001. Its competitors will be able to install their own ADSL equipment in local exchanges to gain access to the local loop.</p> <p><strong>What are the alternatives?</strong><br> Other service providers, such as the UK market leader Freeserve, are trying out the technology and are bound to offer equivalent ADSL services as soon as they can. But there are other ways of getting broadband internet access with and without ADSL technology. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>ADSL through your television</strong><br> Probably the most advanced way of getting broadband services this way is through <a href=\"http://www.kitv.co.uk\">Kingston Interactive Television's</a> ADSL network. Launched in January, it provides video on demand, conventional multi-channel television services and full internet access for \u00a314.99 a month. The disadvantage?

      "bodyText": "What is broadband? Broadband is short for \"wide bandwidth\". It is the capacity to send huge quantities of information over phone lines, cables and wireless connections, giving users high-speed internet access and making it easier to send video and audio material over the internet. Conventional internet access down a phone line to a UK home is slow, narrow bandwidth. What is BT offering? Through its BTopenworld subsidiary, BT will offer broadband internet access to UK home users and businesses in July. After a small box is installed in your house, you will be able to get internet access about 10 times faster than with a good modem, connect more than one PC to the internet, and continue to use the phone while you are online. The old system of dialling up also ends, as broadband gives a continuous connection. How does it work? BT's broadband uses asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) technology. ADSL enables more data to travel down ordinary phone lines or cables - a far cheaper option than installing completely new cables. It is called asymmetrical because information can travel far quicker down the line to a consumer than it can if a consumer wants to send information back up the line. As most people use the internet to download rather than upload information, they probably won't notice the asymmetry. How much does it cost? BTopenworld does not charge for calls, billing customers a fixed fee for unlimited access. Home users will pay \u00a339.99 a month for the line and a \u00a3150 connection fee (free if you sign up before June 30). This is more expensive than the latest unmetered deals for conventional internet access offered by companies such as NTL and AltaVista, but you get a faster service for your money. What are the drawbacks? \u0095 Not everyone in Britain can sign up for the service. Currently, only 26% of the UK will have access to BT's ADSL network. BT says one in three UK households and businesses will be within range by its July launch, covering London, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Oxford, Brighton and 20 other cities. \u0095 The ADSL lines offered by BT are still not quick enough to enable home users to watch video over the internet. BT hopes to upgrade speeds by the autumn, but even then the US, which has had ADSL technology since 1998, has far faster lines. \u0095 The asymmetric nature of ADSL makes a mockery of claims that the internet is truly \"interactive\". John Naughton argues that it doesn't bother corporations that consumers cannot send large amounts of information back up the lines because \"they don't care about the punters sending anything back - except their credit card numbers\". ADSL keeps the consumer passive rather than empowering them to use the high-speed technology to, for instance, serve up their own websites from home instead of paying an ISP. Could BT do better? The European Commission says BT has been too slow to open up its telephone network to competitors wanting to offer similar broadband services. The British government has required that BT update and open up its network by 2001. Its competitors will be able to install their own ADSL equipment in local exchanges to gain access to the local loop. What are the alternatives? Other service providers, such as the UK market leader Freeserve, are trying out the technology and are bound to offer equivalent ADSL services as soon as they can. But there are other ways of getting broadband internet access with and without ADSL technology. \u0095 ADSL through your television Probably the most advanced way of getting broadband services this way is through Kingston Interactive Television's ADSL network. Launched in January, it provides video on demand, conventional multi-channel television services and full internet access for \u00a314.99 a month. The disadvantage? You have to live in Hull. \u0095 Cable TV internet Cable companies Cable &amp; Wireless and Telewest both provide a \"walled garden\", ie a restricted selection of 40-odd websites specially adapted for TV. Their cable modems also provide email services and enough bandwidth to offer video on demand. Although fast, cable is not available to everyone in the UK. For serious internet users, this kind of restricted TV internet is no substitute for full access via a PC. Cable modems also slow down the more individual users are connected to them - a bit like the conventional \"narrow band\" internet we are used to, which becomes congested at peak times. \u0095 Fibre-optic cable This technology offers the most potent form of broadband, with the capacity to transfer three hours of TV pictures down the wire in less than a second. However, fibre-optic requires the installation of new cables for the whole country - too expensive to happen in the immediate future then. \u0095 Wireless Wireless broadband services are one of the best hopes for cheap, fast internet access. Switzerland, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Germany have already auctioned off parts of their spectrum for such services and, alongside the auction of third-generation mobile phones, the UK government is now planning the lucrative sale of 10-year licences for airwaves. Operators could bypass BT and cable companies, but their services will be primarily aimed at businesses and, once again, their speed will depend on the number of customers using the system at the same time.

The judges heard a lengthy report by the investigator Juan Guzman, who formally requested the lifting of Gen Pinochet's congressional immunity so he can face trial. Gen Pinochet has immunity as a senator-for-life, a post he created for himself in the constitution written by his regime. After listening to the report, the judges were to hear tomorrow and Friday arguments by the lawyers for Gen Pinochet and the plaintiffs. The judges did not immediately rule on a request by Gen Pinochet's defence lawyer that medical tests be ordered to determine whether the 84-year-old is fit enough to stand trial. The proceedings could decide whether he will face charges on one of the most notorious cases of rights abuses during his regime - the so called \"caravan of death\". The caravan was a group of military officers who toured several Chilean cities by helicopter soon after the 1973 coup led by Gen Pinochet, dragging political prisoners from jail and executing them. Seventy-five people were killed. Seven members of the caravan are indicted, including a general once close to Gen Pinochet. The plaintiffs claim the members of the caravan acted on Gen Pinochet's orders. The situation of the embattled former strongman has caused concern within the army, which he commanded for 25 years. Retired General Rafael Villarroel, once deputy commander under Gen Pinochet, called the legal action against his former boss \"an insult to the entire armed forces\". But President Ricardo Lagos yesterday said there should be no reason for concern. \"Chile is calm, because its institutions are doing what they have to do,\" Mr Lagos said. \"The courts are doing their job, and as we have told the world, everybody in Chile, the humble and the powerful, is subject to the courts. \"What is starting today is a pre-trial, and I am sure whatever the ruling by the courts will be accepted by everybody.\" Mr Lagos said he discussed the situation with the army commander, General Ricardo Izurieta, the night before, stressing that the case is entirely in the hands of the courts. Gen Pinochet returned home last month after being held in Britain for 16 months. Doctors here determined he was physically and mentally unfit for trial. AP",

Two coalition deputies are ill and a handful have left their allegiance unclear. One predecessor, Romano Prodi, unexpectedly lost his job by one vote when a deputy stayed at home to breast-feed her baby.",

Store of memories: where Beatles' first record deal was won The former Beatles producer Sir George Martin yesterday unveiled a plaque to record the role a record store played in bringing the band to fame. The HMV shop in Oxford Street, London, which is to close on Saturday, was instrumental in winning a record deal for the band. It was a visit to the shop in 1962 by the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, that set wheels in motion for a deal with Parlophone Records. Sir George said: \"If he hadn't come in here, I would never have heard them - who knows what might have happened?\" Epstein had unsuccessfully touted his recordings of the \"Fab Four\" around London.

The store, opened in 1921 by Sir Edward Elgar, is being closed in favour of a new shop across the road. Trust gets first woman director The National Trust yesterday committed itself to a higher profile and a more political future in announcing the appointment of its youngest, and first woman, director general, Fiona Reynolds. Ms Reynolds, 42, will next January 1 move to the trust from the Cabinet Office, where she is director of the women's unit. She was director of the countryside charity, the CPRE, from 1992 to 1998. The National Trust is an immensely wealthy charity, and the largest conservation charity in Europe. In recent years it has quietly been moving away from its cosy image as the purveyor of afternoon teas at beautifully preserved Georgian country houses. The present director general, Martin Drury, has led the trust into some controversial decisions, including the ban on stag hunting across trust land, and surprising new purchases, including a small terraced house which was Paul McCartney's home in Liverpool. It is now one of the trust's most popular properties, usually booked out weeks in advance. Anger at charge for GM protest Backbench MPs have accused the government of restricting freedom of speech by charging people for the right to oppose the sale of new genetically modified seeds to farmers. About 250 individuals and organisations, including some MPs, have paid up to \u00a390 to register objections with ministers under rarely used procedures which will lead to the first public local hearings into the new technology. Nick Brown, agriculture minister, is prepared to give Aventis, makers of Chardon LL, a type of GM maize used for animal feed, permission to use the seed commercially after technical committees passed it as safe. The company has promised it will wait until the end of government-sponsored field trials in 2002 before doing so, even if it passes all legal hurdles. But Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs are angry that the process is even under way when the point of field trials is to find whether GM crops will affect the environment - and 23 MPs have signed a Commons early day motion to raise the issue. James Meikle Constable art thieves jailed Two car dealers caught trying to sell a \u00a31m pair of Constable art works stolen from the Victoria and Albert Museum were jailed yesterday. Kevin Gande, 34, from Laindon, Essex, and Kevin Jones, 38, from Bow, east London, were given four years at Isleworth crown court, south-west London, after admitting handling stolen goods. Jones was also sentenced to two years to run consecu tively for possession of a loaded firearm and possession of ammunition. The works - Dedham, Lock and Mill (from 1810-1815) and Sketch for Valley Farm (from 1835) - were taken from a vault at the museum in November 1998 but were not missed until another museum asked to borrow them months later. Detectives from the national crime squad were tipped off that Gande and Jones were involved and mounted a surveillance operation. They were arrested by undercover officers while trying to sell the works at a hotel in west London in January. Roads in worst state for 20 years Road users in England and Wales face the worst conditions since records began more than 20 years ago, new figures revealed yesterday. The government's annual road maintenance survey showed that conditions deteriorated during the last year with increasing incidences of potholes and crumbling verges rendering one in every 20 miles of motorway in urgent need of repair. Transport ministers blamed the decline on under-investment during the last years of Tory government. But motoring groups and opposition MPs said the figures highlighted Labour's failure to fulfil its promise of making road repair a priority. Jonathan Bullock, of the British Road Federation, said worsening road conditions would inevitably lead to a rise in the number of accidents. \"The government has not achieved its objective of halting the decline, let alone restoring conditions to an acceptable level.

Among the new measures are plans for an army of \"learning mentors\" - school staff who will patrol corridors and playgrounds armed with pagers to assist teachers in trouble. David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, will reveal the plans this morning to teachers attending the annual conference of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers in Llandudno, north Wales. But he will face calls from the organisation - the second largest teaching union - to \"get real\" about the growing problems for teachers of dealing with violent classroom thugs and demands to deal with problem pupils in self-contained units well away from school premises. At the moment, there are only 420 so-called \"sin bins\", or school-based learning support units in England and Wales, which have been set up by local education authorities. But Mr Blunkett wants to more than double this to 1,000 by 2002. As well as announcing plans to set up an extra 200 units in innercity areas, the programme will be extended to rural schools. He will also make it clear to teachers that he does not expect any school to keep a troublemaker in class if there is a serious risk to staff and other pupils. Mr Blunkett will announce targets to extend teaching hours in the units, which can offer pupils as little as 10 hours a week. The schools have also been given the go-ahead to employ 800 \"learning mentors\". Government sources said yesterday that the expansion of the units within schools would give heads more flexibility when dealing with troublesome youngsters. As the pupils will not be excluded from school, the government's drive to cut the number of permanently excluded pupils - currently nearly 1,300 a year - will not be undermined. But the union's general secretary, Nigel de Gruchy, warned last night that the proposal did not go far enough because the sin bins would be on school sites, leaving the disruptive children free to hang around the gates. Mr de Gruchy would like to see more self-contained pupil referral units - more commonly used for children who need longer-term help. He is calling for a change in the law so that heads would still be in charge of the units on a different site and would not have to exclude their pupils. Mr de Gruchy said: \"I have said to Mr Blunkett: 'Get real.' We don't really know how difficult these youngsters can be to teach. Many come to school with weapons and under the influence of drugs.\" The union is dealing with at least 10 cases a month where it is supporting members refusing to teach troublemakers still in class despite having carried out serious assaults. Calling for a sin bin in every major town, Mr de Gruchy said: \"Let's have zero tolerance of bad behaviour. Where a youngster's behaviour threatens to disrupt education, or where it affects the staff or pupils, they should be out.\" The package will be funded by some of the \u00a3500m allocated in the Budget to improve school discipline over the next three years, along with cash from the standards fund. But the shadow education secretary, Theresa May, warned the conference that the funding would probably be more \"fantasy figures\" from the government - money that had already been announced rather than genuinely fresh cash. Yesterday delegates backed a motion calling for \"suitable provision\" for disruptive pupils to be properly provided and funded nationally, and for the government \"to promote policies which recognise the rights of the vast majority of pupils to a classroom environment conducive to a good level of teaching and learning\". During the debate, delegate Jules Donaldson described a visit to a school \"where the headteacher had been head-butted and it took five police to escort the pupil off the premises\". Earlier, delegates sanctioned a ballot to decide whether to press ahead with action to ease the growing burden of bureaucracy on teachers. Any action would start with members refusing extra tasks such as chasing pupil absences, bulk photocopying, administering exams and stocktaking. Mr de Gruchy, who condemned the National Union of Teachers' threat of a strike over performance-related pay, said his union's action would not harm pupils in any way.",

      "body": "<p> <strong>GA:</strong> To start at the very beginning, when did you first decide you wanted to act?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well I first decided when I wanted to act very early, I didn't know how to become an actor, as such, nor did I know that it was possible to be a professional actor, but I first decided that I wanted to act when I was nine. And I was at a very bizarre prep school at the time, to say high anglo-Catholic would be a real English understatement. It was so high it was flying. So I already had an enormous sense of theatre, if you see what I mean, from an early age and the first part that I ever played was the girl in Maeterlinck's The Bluebird and I felt an extraordinary feeling that I was in the place that I was meant to be. And as I say, I didn't think of being an actor as such because the world was a much much bigger place and I had no idea how one would go about becoming an actor. That's when I first wanted to act.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And what was the thrill of it for you? </p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> It's very hard to say, I was effused with a feeling of complete and total enjoyment and I felt that that's where I should be... I don't know what psychological terms I could use, but I felt absolutely in the right place. I felt in the centre of myself and I felt that I could express myself in that way. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Was it also the idea of make-believe and pretending you were somebody else?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well, yes, pretending to be other people is my game and that to me is the essence of the whole business of acting. Dame Edith Evans was once being interviewed by a very zealous young man down from Oxford on television and saying: \"Tell me, Dame Edith, how do you go about it? What do you do? Do you research it? How do you get into them?\" and finally she just said: \"I pretend, dear boy.\". It may be a rather simplistic way of putting it! I remember once when I told Lindsay Anderson at a party that acting was just a sophisticated way of playing cowboys and Indians he almost had a fit.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> When you decided you wanted to take acting more seriously, was it a stage career or a film career that you had in mind?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I'll put it onto a more sombre note. I was such a serious young man, or older boy, or whatever I was at that time, and it seemed to me such a huge decision what you're going to do with your life, and I'd already seen the headmaster at Lincoln School, Mr Franklin, in that dreaded interview, when he said: \"What are you going to do with your life?\" And after swallowing whatever lump was in my throat, I said: \"Well, I'd really like to be an actor.\" And he just laughed, and said: \"Well, you may be alright in school plays but you wouldn't stand a chance in the profession.\" Which I always consider to be something of an irresponsible act for a headmaster. However, where was I? I digress...</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> I was asking whether it was films or the stage that you...</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Ah yes, the question that I asked myself was would I be prepared to stick the rest of my life out in repertory. And the answer that I came up with was yes I would. And so I went forward with it eventually, after many other stories which you might get later.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> But you'd actually been to St Martin's School of Art first, as a painter.</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Yes, I was. Not that that was what I'd decided to do with my life, but my parents felt that acting was far too insecure. Don't ask me what made them think that painting would be more secure. I think it was down to the fact that at that time you could take what was called an ATD, an art teacher's diploma, and therefore I could be a teacher. Not only would that be secure but it would also be respectable. And for the generation that went through the war, respectability was a very considerable thing and something to be sought.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And your father was a clergyman, wasn't he?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> He was, yes.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Did he approve when you did become an actor, by profession?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well, he couldn't really disapprove, could he? It's just the same business but a different department. So, he didn't disapprove. But I finally presented them with the fact that I was going to go to the Royal Academy because I'd got a scholarship. And I didn't tell them that until I knew I'd got a scholarship, because I'd used my grant at St Martin's School of Art and therefore I had to get a scholarship if I was going to have any other secondary education. And having presented them with the idea of having a scholarship then everything was fine. He was certainly not against the theatre, in fact, they were the ones that took me. My mother loved the theatre and they took me to the theatre, Cleethorpes Rep, on a regular basis, on a Tuesday evening (because it was cheaper). </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Were you quite interested in the movies as a child? Did you have any heroes and did you think I would love to be like Cary Grant, or somebody?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well, no. Films were somewhat frowned upon at that time. Theatre was fine. I was never allowed to go to Saturday morning pictures and things, and the cinema was right across the road from the Vicarage and I could see these lines of people going in there. With enormous envy I watched them go. Apart from anything else, which is a bit of a paradox really, it was considered to be common. Which coming from a clergyman, I would've thought was an odd attitude to take. And indeed I said so, at the age of 16, quite forcibly I believe. Never mind... So I didn't really see much cinema, and television was just coming in. I remember previous to being in Grimsby, there was another wonderful parish that my father sought out - he seemed to seek out the best possible parishes - was a place called Woodville in Derbyshire, in mining country, and there was a certain Mrs Fox-Robinson who had a television that was made of Bakelite, which had a tiny screen and to me was totally captivating, and at every possible opportunity I got to go down there I took to watch whatever it was. But it wasn't films, because they didn't show films then, it was just live performances and news. I never quite understand why we watch the news. There doesn't really seem much point watching somebody tell you what the news is when you could quite easily listen to it on the radio... but anyway, I digress again. That was my first introduction to a screen of any sort. And the first film I saw that I remember quite distinctly was Treasure Island - The Robert Newton one.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> I remember talking to you a couple of years ago at the time of Love and Death on Long Island and you were saying that you became very, very interested in French and Italian cinema at some point in your life. Was that when you came to London and were studying here?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well yes, that was in the later period. If you've read, and I'm sure you have, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, it's all sort of planned out there, isn't it? Using long words and things like that. I'm definitely into Antonioni, into Truffaut and all of the directors at that time. I used to go to the Camden Poly to see the French films and the more esoteric English films, and some of the French films, at the Academy in Oxford Street. I made a pilgrimage to see Jules et Jim on seven consecutive Sundays. And thinking at the time, of course, if they're making them in France now by the time I leave RADA they'll be making them here. Disappointment.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> But you did actually have your film debut around this time in The Wild and the Willing.</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Yes, the alliteration is really embarrassing. The Wild and the Willing. It was made by Jeremy Thomas' father, Ralph Thomas, produced by Betty Box, in black and white and it was for an English market. And that was 1962 and I was incredibly fortunate really. I left drama school and went straight into a 10-week film for which I was paid \u00a375 I might say, which for 1962 was one heck of a lot of money. I also got Ian McShane the job, too. He got \u00a3100 a week.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> How did that film actually come about for you. Did you just audition? </p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> It came about through the late, great Julian Belfridge, who saw the film coming up. I'd already signed with him while I was at the Academy and he sent me along for an interview and they gave me a test, which I didn't think I'd get because I knew that Brian Bedford had also tested, and I thought he'd get it but he didn't, it went to me. And I think the reason, forgive me, Jeremy, if you're here, is that I was a little cheaper.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You were, of course, working a great deal in theatre at that time, and you still do, you recently had great success with Krapp's Last Tape. Do you find that you have a preference for film acting, or stage acting and which do you prefer?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well, I think there's kind of two general answers to that. One is that of Helen Mirren, who when asked that says, I always want to be doing the one that I'm not doing at the minute. Or you can be rather more boring and say I like doing the one that I am doing at the minute, and that is really the course that I would go. You don't even think about the other one. If I'm in theatre, cinema doesn't even cross my mind. Similarly when I'm making a film, theatre doesn't cross my mind. Actually I've just done something, a first in my life, having done Krapp's Last Tape on stage here this year we just filmed it at Ardmore Studios in Ireland. And I've never ever had to transpose a stage performance to a film performance and it's really not easy. Not easy to do at all. I'm not sure that I wish to do that again, because your thinking is somewhat blurred.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you find the discipline you bring to the two types of acting very different? Because movie acting is very disjointed, you're not shooting in sequence.</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I always reckon that a lot of that is common sense, but you do have to plan a performance in a film and you do have to know where you are. A very good difference was put to me by Michael Colgan who is the artistic director of the Gate theatre in Dublin under whose auspices Krapp's Last Tape was done. And he said: \"When you've found your theatrical muscle again, then you're really going to begin to enjoy it.\" And the thing is, it's rather like two different sports, you use two completely different sets of muscles, and it's the best analogy that I've come across.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Without getting into the situation where you turn around and tell me: \"I just pretend,\" do you do a lot of preparation for your roles? I know you're not very keen on 'The method' </p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Interviews. If you do an interview in 1960 something it's bound to change by the year 2000. And if it doesn't then there's something drastically wrong. For a start morals have changed, ethics have changed. So do opinions. Let me qualify. I've never really been anti the method as Stanislavski put it down, at a time when Russian theatre was in its doldrums and the Arts Theatre in particular, and he was inspired by the fact that he wanted to get a group of actors together that were really going to use their imagination. Constantly through that book it's all to do with stimulation of the imagination. And whatever method you may use, if that is what you are getting to I would find it completely praiseworthy. No two actors that I've come across work in exactly the same way. And often, like myself, don't work the same way on different parts. Each thing is totally individual. So it would be ridiculous of me to decry somebody's method of working if it is going to produce the kind of work that the method has produced from, say, Brando, Dean, to De Niro, Pacino and so on. Brilliant and fantastic performers. If that's their way, that's their way. It's not my way. And perhaps there was a misunderstanding there that I was perhaps saying that my way was right and that I didn't like the method because I thought it wasn't good.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> So what is your way?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I saw that was coming.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> I'm always interested in how actors do what they do</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> There are six questions a journalist asks, and all of them are: \"How do you act?\"</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Isabelle Huppert told me that she liked to find the key to a character and for some reason - this sounded quite bizarre to me but then I'm not an actor - she had to get the shoes right.</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well that's the same as Alec Guinness.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you have some key to a character that you usually look for?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> No, as I say, I'm not aware of working in the same way... My springboard is always the script. Even if the script is taken from a novel, I often haven't read the novel, I didn't read, for instance, Crime and Punishment before I did it. I read it afterwards. And it was quite interesting to see how critics had managed to say how like I was to particular areas. It's amazing - it's in the eye of the beholder isn't it? The only way I can describe it is that I put everything I can into the mulberry of my mind and hope that it is going to ferment and make a decent wine. How that process happens, I'm sorry to tell you I can't describe.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Well we won't take that any further. You said you like to work from the script. When you are presented with a project, what is it usually that you look for? Is it the script itself, is it the part you have to play, is it the director, or does it change?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well if I've got the luxury - it's a popular misconception that we have hundreds of scripts on our desks: \"Well I think I'll do that one. I'll do that one later in the year\" - that does not happen. It's an immensely competitive business and I can tell you the older you get the parts are fewer and the people who are proven performers are greater. It doesn't get any less competitive, that's not how it works. But if I have the luxury of saying the rent is paid and so on, what do I look for? First of all I would look to see if the script would stand the chance of succeeding on the level that it was intended. In other words, I don't mind if it be low comedy, I don't mind if it be an intellectual piece, and everything in between. So long as it stands a chance of working on that level. After that I'd look at the part and say: \"Is there anything I can do personally with this? Is there anything I can offer this that is going to be individual, unusual and that I can hopefully make my own?\" That's the most luxurious way of being able to choose, but generally speaking, I mark a script like an exam, and I try not to do anything under 50 per cent. Similarly with the part. And also film is a peculiar thing, parts don't necessarily read in script form anything like as well as they can do when it comes to materialising. Which is quite unlike the stage in that sense. I have one example of that in my own life, it was White Mischief. I'd just done 1984 with Mike Radford and I said to him: \"What are you going to do next?\" And he said: \"Well, I'm going to do this film White Mischief, but I don't think there's anything for you in it.\" And I said: \"Oh what a shame\". And he said: \"Well there's a small part if you're really interested.\" So I had a look at it and the part was Colvile and it wasn't a long part but it was a fantastic part for screen and I really would've been very sorry not to have done it. But you know, that's how things can happen, how they come about. I mean, you can take the same gamble and it doesn't work.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> I can't think of any low comedy that you've done</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Only in the street.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You are often thought of as a very serious actor who plays quite often very vulnerable people, but actually there is this wonderful comic talent that you have - as we've just seen in the clips from The Naked Civil Servant and Love and Death on Long Island. And yet when you play comedy, it seems to me, that you play it very straight. That's the wrong word to use with Naked Civil Servant. But you don't play for laughs in a very obvious way, you remain true to the emotions of the character. Would you say that's true?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Well yes I hope so, I don't like it when you jump out of the play, out of the story or out or the character. For one, I don't think it's very funny when you do that. If you're making a film that is lifelike, the humour very often isn't something that the character considers to be amusing. And if it's going to be funny then I think you have to stay with it.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You've also played quite a few characters based on real people. If those people have been recently alive or indeed are still alive do you feel an extra responsibility or is that more difficult to play people simply because you don't want to mimic them?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I try not to mimic, for one I'm not a particularly good mimic. Secondly, I don't think that's the exercise. I don't think there's any difference as far as I'm concerned in approach to whether a person be fiction or real. As far as I'm concerned they're fiction. It still requires the same leap of imagination to get from the page to the physical presence. Quentin [Crisp] did come down to the set once or twice in the Naked Civil Servant and I did have him up to my house a couple of Sundays and interesting it was too. I remember offering him a Guinness because I'd heard he liked Guinness and I'd seen the BBC documentary they made. So I offered him a Guinness and he said: \"Yes.\" So I poured it out for him and we were talking and he finished it so I offered him another Guinness and he said: \"Yes.\" So I poured him another and after that I said: \"Would you like another Guinness?\" and he said: \"No thank you, anymore would be a debauch.\" It's those sort of delights for an actor. It said everything in a sense. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you need to feel some sort of sympathy for the character you are playing? Could you play somebody who you felt had no redeeming features or virtues of at all?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I think it would be very difficult to play somebody if they didn't think they had any virtues or redeeming characteristics. You can play an unlovable character because society doesn't find them easy to love, but somewhere deep inside most people, who do not commit suicide, is a love for themselves. And I think it would be very difficult to play somebody if that area was completely missing, because so much of it would be supposition and so much of it would therefore be a worry. There was that serial killer recently who was a doctor [Harold Shipman] and people said that would be a good role for me to play, but I don't think so. I don't think anybody really knows how that mind works and I think it's too irresponsible to try to understand that kind of thing if is it's going to be based entirely on supposition.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Quite often people have written that you're good at playing victims, I'm not sure if that's the right way of looking at it, but certainly people who are quite frail and vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Yes, but a victim is basically the ultimate of most of us. There's a huge amount of vulnerability in everyone who sits in this room. And if you put them under the microscope of the drama, you'd soon find that vulnerability. It's one of the things that I think cinema deals with fantastically well because it deals with privacy and private moments that are material as opposed to literary and I think it's a wonderful medium to be able to understand more clearly the depths and secrecies of people's lives, and can lead to a great deal more understanding.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> At this point I would like to bring in a specific film, The Elephant Man, which I think is a remarkable performance in a remarkable film. You had to go through seven hours of make-up a day or something like that...</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> You've hit the nail on the head, seven hours of make-up every day. Well obviously it wasn't every day, you had to evolve a different way of shooting because you couldn't make up for seven hours, then do a full day and be back on call at 6 or 8 in the morning. So I made up from 4 in the morning until noon basically with odd stops to suck a couple of raw eggs mixed with orange juice between those dreaded gums. We shot then with a running buffet for the crew. I couldn't eat then, at the time - I just want your hearts to bleed - and we finished at 10 at night and then it would take two hours to get off [the make-up], so basically you'd taken up a 24-hour day. And the next day we rehearsed for about three hours in civvies, the scenes we would do the next day. And it turned out in the end to be a very productive way of working. The crew loved it, and in one of those days we were getting about two and a half days work done.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Apart from the ordeal of the make-up process...</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> Oh I can tell you, the first time it was applied by Chris Tucker, it took 12 hours, and the rest of the cast and the crew were waiting around for this aberration to appear, and I finally did. I was terrified that there was going to be a laugh because no one had seen it. We had no idea when we were creating it whether or not it would be a successful image. Chris Tucker had endeavoured to do in six weeks what it would normally take six months to do. As it happens I kept persuading him because I could see that there was so much tension within the scenes with the disguise, that if we used the disguise until a third of the way through the movie, before you actually see the Elephant Man, we'd keep the suspense going a great deal better. And I knew that David Lynch, he'd deny this now, but I can tell you it's true, he wanted to see the elephant man almost in the second scene, in his full glory as it were, or lack of it. And I reckoned that I knew more dramatically than he did. I certainly didn't know more in terms of image on screen because I don't think anybody does, he is the greatest director in the world for image on screen - that's around at the minute - when he's at his best. But in terms of drama he sometimes does lose it, and I felt he did there, so that's how that came about. I was digressing again.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> What I was trying to get out is that given you were talking about characters being put under the microscope in cinema, here you were playing a character under all this weight of make-up and yet you give such an expressive performance and it's about a character who hadn't been allowed to express himself prior to the story of the film, as it were. So did you find it very difficult or frustrating to become very expressive under all that make-up?</p> <p><strong>JH:</strong> I have to say on the first day - oh yes, I got back to where I was in the story anyway, I can continue now - fortunately they didn't laugh, you could have heard a pin drop. From then on that gave me and David Lynch (who was a very young director at the time) confidence, and also all the cast and the crew. At that moment we knew we had something. You never know with film but we felt there was a chance of succeeding. After the first time I actually shot with make-up, I thought they had found a way of me not enjoying filming and at the end of that day I thought: \"How am I possibly going to get through to the end of this? It's agony, it's so difficult.\" But oddly enough, like everything else, you grow used to it, you begin to take on the challenges that it offers you and also the wonderful thing about film, you can see light at the end of the tunnel. You did realise that it is going to come to an end at some stage and finally it did become incredibly enjoyable. It became like a very tight family, the whole making of that film. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Guardian_NFT/interview/0,4479,214857,00.html\">John Hurt interviewed by Geoff Andrew (II)</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "GA: To start at the very beginning, when did you first decide you wanted to act? JH: Well I first decided when I wanted to act very early, I didn't know how to become an actor, as such, nor did I know that it was possible to be a professional actor, but I first decided that I wanted to act when I was nine. And I was at a very bizarre prep school at the time, to say high anglo-Catholic would be a real English understatement. It was so high it was flying. So I already had an enormous sense of theatre, if you see what I mean, from an early age and the first part that I ever played was the girl in Maeterlinck's The Bluebird and I felt an extraordinary feeling that I was in the place that I was meant to be. And as I say, I didn't think of being an actor as such because the world was a much much bigger place and I had no idea how one would go about becoming an actor. That's when I first wanted to act. GA: And what was the thrill of it for you? JH: It's very hard to say, I was effused with a feeling of complete and total enjoyment and I felt that that's where I should be... I don't know what psychological terms I could use, but I felt absolutely in the right place. I felt in the centre of myself and I felt that I could express myself in that way. GA: Was it also the idea of make-believe and pretending you were somebody else? JH: Well, yes, pretending to be other people is my game and that to me is the essence of the whole business of acting. Dame Edith Evans was once being interviewed by a very zealous young man down from Oxford on television and saying: \"Tell me, Dame Edith, how do you go about it? What do you do? Do you research it? How do you get into them?\" and finally she just said: \"I pretend, dear boy.\". It may be a rather simplistic way of putting it!

GA: When you decided you wanted to take acting more seriously, was it a stage career or a film career that you had in mind? JH: I'll put it onto a more sombre note. I was such a serious young man, or older boy, or whatever I was at that time, and it seemed to me such a huge decision what you're going to do with your life, and I'd already seen the headmaster at Lincoln School, Mr Franklin, in that dreaded interview, when he said: \"What are you going to do with your life?\" And after swallowing whatever lump was in my throat, I said: \"Well, I'd really like to be an actor.\" And he just laughed, and said: \"Well, you may be alright in school plays but you wouldn't stand a chance in the profession.\" Which I always consider to be something of an irresponsible act for a headmaster.

GA: You were, of course, working a great deal in theatre at that time, and you still do, you recently had great success with Krapp's Last Tape. Do you find that you have a preference for film acting, or stage acting and which do you prefer? JH: Well, I think there's kind of two general answers to that. One is that of Helen Mirren, who when asked that says, I always want to be doing the one that I'm not doing at the minute. Or you can be rather more boring and say I like doing the one that I am doing at the minute, and that is really the course that I would go. You don't even think about the other one. If I'm in theatre, cinema doesn't even cross my mind. Similarly when I'm making a film, theatre doesn't cross my mind. Actually I've just done something, a first in my life, having done Krapp's Last Tape on stage here this year we just filmed it at Ardmore Studios in Ireland. And I've never ever had to transpose a stage performance to a film performance and it's really not easy. Not easy to do at all. I'm not sure that I wish to do that again, because your thinking is somewhat blurred. GA: Do you find the discipline you bring to the two types of acting very different? Because movie acting is very disjointed, you're not shooting in sequence. JH: I always reckon that a lot of that is common sense, but you do have to plan a performance in a film and you do have to know where you are. A very good difference was put to me by Michael Colgan who is the artistic director of the Gate theatre in Dublin under whose auspices Krapp's Last Tape was done. And he said: \"When you've found your theatrical muscle again, then you're really going to begin to enjoy it.\" And the thing is, it's rather like two different sports, you use two completely different sets of muscles, and it's the best analogy that I've come across. GA: Without getting into the situation where you turn around and tell me: \"I just pretend,\" do you do a lot of preparation for your roles? I know you're not very keen on 'The method' JH: Interviews. If you do an interview in 1960 something it's bound to change by the year 2000. And if it doesn't then there's something drastically wrong. For a start morals have changed, ethics have changed. So do opinions. Let me qualify. I've never really been anti the method as Stanislavski put it down, at a time when Russian theatre was in its doldrums and the Arts Theatre in particular, and he was inspired by the fact that he wanted to get a group of actors together that were really going to use their imagination. Constantly through that book it's all to do with stimulation of the imagination. And whatever method you may use, if that is what you are getting to I would find it completely praiseworthy. No two actors that I've come across work in exactly the same way. And often, like myself, don't work the same way on different parts. Each thing is totally individual. So it would be ridiculous of me to decry somebody's method of working if it is going to produce the kind of work that the method has produced from, say, Brando, Dean, to De Niro, Pacino and so on. Brilliant and fantastic performers. If that's their way, that's their way. It's not my way. And perhaps there was a misunderstanding there that I was perhaps saying that my way was right and that I didn't like the method because I thought it wasn't good. GA: So what is your way? JH: I saw that was coming. GA: I'm always interested in how actors do what they do JH: There are six questions a journalist asks, and all of them are: \"How do you act?\" GA: Isabelle Huppert told me that she liked to find the key to a character and for some reason - this sounded quite bizarre to me but then I'm not an actor - she had to get the shoes right. JH: Well that's the same as Alec Guinness. GA: Do you have some key to a character that you usually look for? JH: No, as I say, I'm not aware of working in the same way... My springboard is always the script. Even if the script is taken from a novel, I often haven't read the novel, I didn't read, for instance, Crime and Punishment before I did it. I read it afterwards. And it was quite interesting to see how critics had managed to say how like I was to particular areas. It's amazing - it's in the eye of the beholder isn't it? The only way I can describe it is that I put everything I can into the mulberry of my mind and hope that it is going to ferment and make a decent wine. How that process happens, I'm sorry to tell you I can't describe. GA: Well we won't take that any further. You said you like to work from the script. When you are presented with a project, what is it usually that you look for? Is it the script itself, is it the part you have to play, is it the director, or does it change? JH: Well if I've got the luxury - it's a popular misconception that we have hundreds of scripts on our desks: \"Well I think I'll do that one. I'll do that one later in the year\" - that does not happen. It's an immensely competitive business and I can tell you the older you get the parts are fewer and the people who are proven performers are greater. It doesn't get any less competitive, that's not how it works. But if I have the luxury of saying the rent is paid and so on, what do I look for? First of all I would look to see if the script would stand the chance of succeeding on the level that it was intended. In other words, I don't mind if it be low comedy, I don't mind if it be an intellectual piece, and everything in between. So long as it stands a chance of working on that level. After that I'd look at the part and say: \"Is there anything I can do personally with this? Is there anything I can offer this that is going to be individual, unusual and that I can hopefully make my own?\" That's the most luxurious way of being able to choose, but generally speaking, I mark a script like an exam, and I try not to do anything under 50 per cent. Similarly with the part. And also film is a peculiar thing, parts don't necessarily read in script form anything like as well as they can do when it comes to materialising. Which is quite unlike the stage in that sense. I have one example of that in my own life, it was White Mischief. I'd just done 1984 with Mike Radford and I said to him: \"What are you going to do next?\" And he said: \"Well, I'm going to do this film White Mischief, but I don't think there's anything for you in it.\" And I said: \"Oh what a shame\". And he said: \"Well there's a small part if you're really interested.\" So I had a look at it and the part was Colvile and it wasn't a long part but it was a fantastic part for screen and I really would've been very sorry not to have done it. But you know, that's how things can happen, how they come about. I mean, you can take the same gamble and it doesn't work. GA: I can't think of any low comedy that you've done JH: Only in the street. GA: You are often thought of as a very serious actor who plays quite often very vulnerable people, but actually there is this wonderful comic talent that you have - as we've just seen in the clips from The Naked Civil Servant and Love and Death on Long Island. And yet when you play comedy, it seems to me, that you play it very straight. That's the wrong word to use with Naked Civil Servant. But you don't play for laughs in a very obvious way, you remain true to the emotions of the character. Would you say that's true? JH: Well yes I hope so, I don't like it when you jump out of the play, out of the story or out or the character. For one, I don't think it's very funny when you do that. If you're making a film that is lifelike, the humour very often isn't something that the character considers to be amusing. And if it's going to be funny then I think you have to stay with it. GA: You've also played quite a few characters based on real people. If those people have been recently alive or indeed are still alive do you feel an extra responsibility or is that more difficult to play people simply because you don't want to mimic them? JH: I try not to mimic, for one I'm not a particularly good mimic. Secondly, I don't think that's the exercise. I don't think there's any difference as far as I'm concerned in approach to whether a person be fiction or real. As far as I'm concerned they're fiction. It still requires the same leap of imagination to get from the page to the physical presence. Quentin [Crisp] did come down to the set once or twice in the Naked Civil Servant and I did have him up to my house a couple of Sundays and interesting it was too. I remember offering him a Guinness because I'd heard he liked Guinness and I'd seen the BBC documentary they made. So I offered him a Guinness and he said: \"Yes.\" So I poured it out for him and we were talking and he finished it so I offered him another Guinness and he said: \"Yes.\" So I poured him another and after that I said: \"Would you like another Guinness?\" and he said: \"No thank you, anymore would be a debauch.\" It's those sort of delights for an actor. It said everything in a sense. GA: Do you need to feel some sort of sympathy for the character you are playing? Could you play somebody who you felt had no redeeming features or virtues of at all? JH: I think it would be very difficult to play somebody if they didn't think they had any virtues or redeeming characteristics. You can play an unlovable character because society doesn't find them easy to love, but somewhere deep inside most people, who do not commit suicide, is a love for themselves. And I think it would be very difficult to play somebody if that area was completely missing, because so much of it would be supposition and so much of it would therefore be a worry. There was that serial killer recently who was a doctor [Harold Shipman] and people said that would be a good role for me to play, but I don't think so. I don't think anybody really knows how that mind works and I think it's too irresponsible to try to understand that kind of thing if is it's going to be based entirely on supposition. GA: Quite often people have written that you're good at playing victims, I'm not sure if that's the right way of looking at it, but certainly people who are quite frail and vulnerable. JH: Yes, but a victim is basically the ultimate of most of us. There's a huge amount of vulnerability in everyone who sits in this room. And if you put them under the microscope of the drama, you'd soon find that vulnerability. It's one of the things that I think cinema deals with fantastically well because it deals with privacy and private moments that are material as opposed to literary and I think it's a wonderful medium to be able to understand more clearly the depths and secrecies of people's lives, and can lead to a great deal more understanding. GA: At this point I would like to bring in a specific film, The Elephant Man, which I think is a remarkable performance in a remarkable film. You had to go through seven hours of make-up a day or something like that... JH: You've hit the nail on the head, seven hours of make-up every day. Well obviously it wasn't every day, you had to evolve a different way of shooting because you couldn't make up for seven hours, then do a full day and be back on call at 6 or 8 in the morning. So I made up from 4 in the morning until noon basically with odd stops to suck a couple of raw eggs mixed with orange juice between those dreaded gums. We shot then with a running buffet for the crew. I couldn't eat then, at the time - I just want your hearts to bleed - and we finished at 10 at night and then it would take two hours to get off [the make-up], so basically you'd taken up a 24-hour day. And the next day we rehearsed for about three hours in civvies, the scenes we would do the next day. And it turned out in the end to be a very productive way of working. The crew loved it, and in one of those days we were getting about two and a half days work done. GA: Apart from the ordeal of the make-up process... JH: Oh I can tell you, the first time it was applied by Chris Tucker, it took 12 hours, and the rest of the cast and the crew were waiting around for this aberration to appear, and I finally did. I was terrified that there was going to be a laugh because no one had seen it. We had no idea when we were creating it whether or not it would be a successful image. Chris Tucker had endeavoured to do in six weeks what it would normally take six months to do. As it happens I kept persuading him because I could see that there was so much tension within the scenes with the disguise, that if we used the disguise until a third of the way through the movie, before you actually see the Elephant Man, we'd keep the suspense going a great deal better. And I knew that David Lynch, he'd deny this now, but I can tell you it's true, he wanted to see the elephant man almost in the second scene, in his full glory as it were, or lack of it. And I reckoned that I knew more dramatically than he did. I certainly didn't know more in terms of image on screen because I don't think anybody does, he is the greatest director in the world for image on screen - that's around at the minute - when he's at his best. But in terms of drama he sometimes does lose it, and I felt he did there, so that's how that came about. I was digressing again. GA: What I was trying to get out is that given you were talking about characters being put under the microscope in cinema, here you were playing a character under all this weight of make-up and yet you give such an expressive performance and it's about a character who hadn't been allowed to express himself prior to the story of the film, as it were. So did you find it very difficult or frustrating to become very expressive under all that make-up? JH: I have to say on the first day - oh yes, I got back to where I was in the story anyway, I can continue now - fortunately they didn't laugh, you could have heard a pin drop. From then on that gave me and David Lynch (who was a very young director at the time) confidence, and also all the cast and the crew. At that moment we knew we had something. You never know with film but we felt there was a chance of succeeding. After the first time I actually shot with make-up, I thought they had found a way of me not enjoying filming and at the end of that day I thought: \"How am I possibly going to get through to the end of this? It's agony, it's so difficult.\" But oddly enough, like everything else, you grow used to it, you begin to take on the challenges that it offers you and also the wonderful thing about film, you can see light at the end of the tunnel. You did realise that it is going to come to an end at some stage and finally it did become incredibly enjoyable. It became like a very tight family, the whole making of that film.

      "bodyText": "William Hague's speech in the wake of the Tony Martin case marked a major development in Conservative party policy on crime. He claimed that public confidence in the criminal justice system was close to collapse under Labour and pledged a series of policy changes. Self-defence Mr Hague pledged to \"re-balance the justice system to protect people who defend their families, their homes and their property against criminals.\" He said: \"Vigilantes have no place in a civilised society. \"But there is all the difference in the world between the career criminal who sets out deliberately to burgle a house and the terrified homeowner who acts to protect himself and his home. Unless our laws reflect natural justice, then they fall into disrepute. \"The next Conservative government will overhaul the law with a strong presumption that, in future, the state will be on the side of people who protect their homes and their families against criminals.\" Analysis: The current law already provides substantial protection to people who kill or inflict harm while defending themselves, their property or other people, or to prevent a crime. If a defendant argues, as Tony Martin did at his trial, that he was acting in self-defence, the jury must acquit him of any crime if it believes the force he used was reasonable in the circumstances. The onus is on the prosecution to convince the jury that the force used went beyond what was reasonable. \"Reasonable force\" is not defined in law but is left to the common sense of the jury. Making the presumption that the defendant acted in self-defence any stronger would mean sanctioning a disproportionate response, encouraging householders to use guns, electric fences and rottweilers. It might also fall foul of the right to life guarantee in the Human Rights Act, which comes into force this October. An alternative way for the state to lessen the impact of the law on those who step over the mark is to repeal the mandatory life sentence for murder. Judges could then tailor the sentence to the circumstances of the crime and impose a range of sentences, as they do now for manslaughter. The House of Lords select committee on murder and life imprisonment recommended the change in 1989. So did an independent committee chaired by Lord Lane, the former Lord Chief Justice, in 1993.

      "body": "<p>In any election campaign, there are moments of supreme banality. The Liberal Democrats in the London mayoral election hit one yesterday morning. The party's candidate, Susan Kramer, and her son Jonathan were at Vauxhall station trying to negotiate passage to Twickenham, taking into account their possession of two travelcards for zones 1-3 and one young person's railcard.</p> <p>The clerk shook his head, consulted a thick volume, looked skywards and eventually came up with a figure, which may or may not have been the right one. Who knows these days? I rather thought the candidate might.</p> <p>There are only two real issues in this election. One is the question Frank Dobson tried and failed to face down on the day he was chosen by Labour. Is London willing to give Ken the mayoralty to make up for him being shafted? Question two: transport.</p> <p>This is the train-spotters' election. Almost every conversation on the campaign trail degenerates into London Transport minutiae, either because that is what voters are complaining about, or because it is necessary before deciding how to get to the next stop. We spent ages yesterday debating which buses ran in and out of Hounslow and whether any of them might get us there before the vote next Thursday.</p> <p><b> Worked</b><br></p> <p>But for one more week, you can listen to the candidates and everything will seem possible: even the building of the Chelsea-Hackney tube line, which has been talked about as long as the Second Coming, but with rather less probability of occurring.</p> <p>And Mrs Kramer is the most can-do candidate of the lot. She got the nomination because she decided she wanted it, and worked like hell inside the party. But she has still only been in front-line politics since last August. While her rivals, Mr Dobson, Ken Livingstone and Steve Norris, were all deep in the seething hatreds of London politics in the 1980s, she was living in Chicago blissfully unaware of it all. There she acquired different perceptions: \"We walk down a street here and see something horrible, we go 'Look at that'. The mayor of Chicago walks down the street, says 'Look at that', and somebody does something about it.</p> <p>\"Ken and Steve say you can't do anything about transport in the first four years. But it's just like going into a chaotic and untidy room - within 10 minutes it can be tidy. What's difficult about this? Making London Transport work is just like having a reasonably tidy sock drawer.\"</p> <p>She could easily sound like Margaret Thatcher and, if she becomes mayor, after a couple of years she probably will. She certainly has Thatcheresque reserves of energy. But at the moment she makes everything sound perfectly straightforward and fair. Living in America has given her a few distinctive speech inflections, and a very un-British determination.</p> <p>Mrs Kramer was travelling with Charles Kennedy to do the customary bizarre melange of campaign stops and photo-ops. One moment they were in a DNA testing lab; next they were in the market square of Kingston-upon-Thames, standing alongside a group of folk singers dressed as medieval minstrels. She has a nice eye for these dissonances. The DNA lab was inside the government chemist's laboratory at Teddington. There the sign announcing Division of Electrical Science, Microfabrication Facility was next to one saying Bushy Tails Creche. \"I like that,\" she said.</p> <p>Normally when the party leader turns up at a local campaign, the candidate simpers in the background, hoping to sidle into photographs and get a pat on the head before the Great One rushes elsewhere. But it isn't that kind of election; Mr Kennedy isn't that kind of leader; and Mrs Kramer certainly isn't that kind of candidate.</p> <p>Given that their 9am joint press conference had attracted a total attendance of 15 - more than half of them party workers - it was difficult to pretend his mere presence somehow lifted the campaign into the stratosphere. But there has been a vague sense for some time that the Liberal Democrats have been treading roughly in a straight line and possibly upwards.</p> <p>The party started from such a low base that it is unlikely to make much difference. But there is a straw to clutch at, based on the fact that voters in this election get a first and a second choice, and that none of the non-Ken candidates has yet emerged as the clear runner-up.</p> <p>The voting system does give the Liberal Democrats an advantage from their traditional role as everyone's second choice - if she can get into the top two before the other candidates are eliminated and their supporters' second choice gets counted.</p> <p><b> Disgrace</b><br></p> <p>For Mrs Kramer has been able to appear like a mouse trying not to be trampled by the surrounding elephants and, simultaneously, above it all as well: \"The people of London have thought it a disgrace all the way through. I think events inside both the Labour and Tory parties have put off both sets of core voters, which is a tough thing to do.\"</p> <p>Yet, curiously, this has been a remarkably good-natured election. Uniquely in the history of English democracy, the candidates have spent long hours together in TV green rooms and backstage in borough town halls, but the civility, however icy, has outweighed the hatred. This is largely because there is no incumbent, and because the mayoralty is such a blank sheet of paper. The real malice will come afterwards when everyone has to cope with the consequences of the result.</p> <p>But so far Susan Kramer has spent eight months campaigning, and still left people thinking she's nice. She has tramped down 126 high streets in her Liberal-yellow Doc Marten's walking boots, listened politely and smiled engagingly. She is, however, rather cross about Mr Dobson's stance on congestion charging. He had troops out at a busy junction yesterday, telling motorists Mr Livingstone would cost them money without mentioning that his own policy is different only in nuance. \"Frank's having a real problem,\" she said. \"He is trying to have it both ways. I think he is being [and she paused for a microsecond of dramatic effect] MISLEADING.\"</p> <p>Now we know there's a fight on. Misleading, indeed! Who knows what adjectives might now be hurled in this supposedly disgraceful election?

The pat on the back from MI6's traditional adversary came from Sergei Ivanov, head of the Russian security council and adviser to President Vladimir Putin. Asked by Argumenti i Fakti, a weekly newspaper, which country had the best agents, Mr Ivanov replied: \"Ours, British and Israeli.\" American spies, he added, had too much money and were spoilt. \"British counter-intelligence has an excellent school and traditions, they prepare their agents very well,\" he said.

He is also assumed to be referring to the MI6 training centre near Gosport in Hamp shire rather than Eton or Cambridge, the training grounds of such British double agents as Philby, Burgess, and Blunt. MI6 can be particularly flattered since Mr Ivanov, like Mr Putin, is a former KGB officer. The agency was unavailable for comment but Oleg Gordievsky, the former KGB officer who defected to MI6 in 1985, was willing to oblige. He said the KGB regarded MI6 officers as \"careful and imaginative, devious and dangerous\". Unlike CIA agents, they were \"courteous and polished\". The special relationship between the Russian and British intelligence agencies - sometimes described as \"the great game\" - began before the Russian revolution. Mr Gordievsky said that while KGB officers were able to track CIA and other western agents in Moscow, MI6 was able to shake them off. Mr Ivanov said the Americans \"have too much money. This leads to an impression that everything in the world can be bought and you don't have to use your head\". In a foreword to a booklet, National Intelligence Machinery, published by the Cabinet Office, Mr Blair said: \"Secret intelligence gives the government a vital edge in tackling some of the most difficult problems we face.\" The intelligence agencies \"serve this country well. We owe them a great deal for their unsung work,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Channel 4's movie channel is to screen explicit sex scenes on the internet to highlight the strict rules which restrict what can be shown on television. FilmFour will show a doctored version of The Idiots, which caused controversy when it was given a cinema certificate, on its subscription channel. But it will \"webcast\" the most controversial scenes, uncut, on its website. The channel denied yesterday that it was deliberately courting prurient viewers, insisting that it wanted a rational debate on what it believes are anomalous rules. The Idiots centres on a group of middle class friends who try to shock and provoke \"normal\" society by pretending to be mentally handicapped. It features penetrative sex. The British Board of Film Classification allowed explicit scenes in the cinema version because its target audience was art house cinemagoers who would understand the context. But broadcasters cannot show erect penises or penetrative sex on television - even on subscription digital channels which have \"parental lock\" facilities available to viewers. A FilmFour spokesman said: \"We believe the FilmFour audience is intelligent enough to make choices about what they should watch. We disagree with the discrepancies that exist between what can be broadcast on television and seen on video and believe the viewers should be allowed to make their own choices.\" The Idiots, which is being screened on FilmFour on May 5, will be shown by Channel 4 later in the year. The FilmFour web site www.filmfour.com is to host an online debate on the issues of censorship as well as screening the scenes. \u0095The first digital television channel dedicated solely to the arts is to be launched within the year. Artsworld will offer news and reviews covering a wide range of visual and performing arts, including music, film, literature and dance. The service, a collaboration between investors including the Guardian Media Group and British Sky Broadcasting, will be available throughout Britain and Ireland exclusively to Sky Digital subscribers.",

      "bodyText": "An attempt by William Hague to exploit public anger over the Tony Martin case backfired last night when it emerged that the Tory leader had voted against a change in the law which could have allowed the Norfolk farmer to walk free. As Mr Hague was roundly condemned for demanding changes to the law on self-defence on the back of one court case, the Tories suffered further embarrassment when a former minister confirmed that the last government shelved such plans in the mid-1990s. The Tory leader provoked an outcry yesterday when he called for greater protection to be given to people who were forced to defend their homes against intruders. In a bid for Tory votes ahead of next week's local elections, Mr Hague said that a Conservative government would introduce a \"strong presumption\" in favour of the likes of Martin, who was convicted of the murder last week of a teenage burglar. However, Mr Hague's credibility was dented when it was confirmed that he had voted against a change in the law which could have allowed Martin to walk free last week even after being convicted of murder. As a new MP in 1991, Mr Hague voted against an amendment to the criminal justice bill which would have abolished mandatory life sentences for murder. Lord Ackner, the former law lord who proposed the amendment, said that Martin would probably be serving a shorter sentence if his amendment had been passed because his lawyers would have been able to urge mitigating factors. The disclosure of Mr Hague's voting record was seized on by his political opponents as a sign that yesterday's speech was a knee-jerk response to score political points ahead of the local elections. Mr Hague suffered another blow when a former Tory minister admitted that the last government had rejected the central proposals in yesterday's speech by the Tory leader. David Maclean, the former home office minister, said: \"We looked at [the law on self defence], but we decided we had other priorities.\" Another former Tory home office minister said he saw no reason to change the law. Sir Peter Lloyd said: \"The law at the moment does give courts the discretion to interpret whether reasonable force was used.\" His remarks were echoed by senior police officers. Crispian Strachan, chief constable of the Northumbria police, warned that Mr Hague's proposal would lead to a \"serious increase in violent crime\" similar to levels in the US. \" Colin Langham-Fitt, the acting assistant chief constable of Norfolk whose force handled the Martin case, said there was no need to change the law. \"There's nothing in the Martin trial or its verdict that takes away from people the right to defend themselves. I can't see how you could practically change the law without risking all sorts of miserable sad effects and uninvited consequences.\" Lawyers also condemned Mr Hague's proposal.

This was voiced by Peter Bradley, head of the rural group of Labour MPs, who said Mr Hague appeared to be advocating a move to a US-style gun law which could foster a \"kind of lynch mob mentality\". On Monday Ann Widde combe, the shadow home secretary, said she saw no need for a change in the law, although she insisted yesterday that she agreed with Mr Hague's speech. \u0095 Last night further allegations of intimidation in the Tony Martin trial emerged when a caller to a local radio station claimed the jury had been stared at by people in the public gallery of the courtroom. A producer at Radio Norfolk in Norwich telephoned a relative of a juror after a call to the station and was told that jurors had felt uncomfortable coming to and from the courtroom. He said one juror would have preferred to have heard the evidence from behind a screen.so he could not be identified.",

Ministers claim current exemptions mean more than 100,000 in that age group are receiving benefit but do not actively have to seek work. They believe this sends a strong signal that the government does not really regard work as a serious option for the over-60s. Mr Darling was speaking as the Cabinet Office published a blueprint, Winning the Generation Game, designed to bring more than 2.8m unemployed men and women aged between 50 and 65 back into the labour force. The massive pool of unemployed reduces national output by \u00a316bn a year and places a direct cost on the Treasury of up to \u00a35bn, the paper says. Mr Darling said: \"Unless we do something now this country will pay a huge price. If we neglect the over-50s and continue to let this age group be written off and become unemployed, as they started to do 20 years ago, we will all suffer.\" He wanted to convince the public, employers and volun tary agencies that \"life begins at 50\".

Mr Darling denied that the Labour cabinet with its Cool Britannia rhetoric had itself in the past implicitly run down the usefulness of the elderly. He also insisted he was not trying to drive the voluntarily retired off the golf courses and into work. \"If people have enough money to retire at that age, that is a matter of their choice.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.aol.com\" target=\"_NEW\">America Online</a> chief executive officer Steve Case told me recently that the newspaper business was \"somewhere between beleaguered and dying\". The high priests of the internet have been predicting the death of the newspaper for some time, often with the affected clinical indifference of the technological Darwinian. </p> <p>Anyone of consent age in a civilised place would have to be brain dead not to recognise the power of the internet. Newspaper proprietors who fail to bridge the culture with internet developers and users are doomed to a precarious existence in a no-growth industry. But those who recognise the internet's potential, and the power of a strong newspaper franchise as a platform for internet operations, will prosper. </p> <p>It is anachronistic that we should continue to be informed and entertained much as we were a century ago by the distribution through congested city streets of large quantities of newsprint, wrought from distant forests. In newspapers, as in other media, the content is important and there is considerable flexibility to accommodate the preferences of the consumer in matters of delivery. Virtually all newspapers are published on the internet now. </p> <p>But there is also a false messianism in the claims of hi-tech zealots that the internet is an antidote to all evils. In this era of overwhelming cascades of information and entertainment from a proliferation of sources, the premium on the editorial function will grow, and the goodwill in the trademarks of authoritative newspapers is a tremendous asset. Properly managed, these franchises are beacons built on solid foundations. Unlike some newer media endeavours, these are not exercises in hucksterism, faddishness and financial flimflam. </p> <p>Too many US and Canadian newspapers are essentially one-city monopolies, combining the arrogance and indolence that comes from an absence of direct competition with a defeatist attitude to other and newer media. Intimidated first by television, and then by the internet, too many newspaper publishers, instead of making their products more interesting and accessible and marketing them more imaginatively, have cowered behind uneconomically low cover prices. </p> <p>Canada is as populated with newspapers as the US, and when we launched a new nationwide newspaper, the National Post, in late 1998, it had an electrifying effect on the Canadian media, almost immediately gaining a paid circulation of 300,000. In part, this was because the National Post took a different view than the usual soft-left Canadian media preoccupation with rather trivial distinctions between Canada and the US. But mainly its success was because of a sharper, more humorous and more crisply edited style than Canadians are accustomed to from their worthy but not overly rollicking media. </p> <p>The internet probably poses a greater direct threat to television than to newspapers. When bandwidth problems are resolved in the next few years, TV and internet transmissions will have comparable picture definition and will be received on the same screens. Already internet surfing, along with the multiplication of channels, has reduced and atomised TV viewing. The number of TV viewers, according to some surveys, has declined by a greater proportion in the past two years than US daily newspaper circulation has since 1970. Yet few people are predicting the demise of television. </p> <p>The concern most frequently expressed for the commercial viability of newspapers is that they will lose all their classified advertising revenue. In one sense this is true, but intelligent publishers will lose it to themselves. Already all seriously managed newspapers put their classified advertising on the net, and almost all of them in a way that interlinks with other newspapers to make regional or national networks. </p> <p>Our Chicago Sun-Times offers advertisers space in the newspaper, on the web and in a speciality publication called Digital Chicago. To small businesses we offer microsites, accessible through the <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Sun-Times</a> site, that greatly expand the potential reach of their advertising dollar.

      "bodyText": "America Online chief executive officer Steve Case told me recently that the newspaper business was \"somewhere between beleaguered and dying\". The high priests of the internet have been predicting the death of the newspaper for some time, often with the affected clinical indifference of the technological Darwinian. Anyone of consent age in a civilised place would have to be brain dead not to recognise the power of the internet. Newspaper proprietors who fail to bridge the culture with internet developers and users are doomed to a precarious existence in a no-growth industry. But those who recognise the internet's potential, and the power of a strong newspaper franchise as a platform for internet operations, will prosper. It is anachronistic that we should continue to be informed and entertained much as we were a century ago by the distribution through congested city streets of large quantities of newsprint, wrought from distant forests. In newspapers, as in other media, the content is important and there is considerable flexibility to accommodate the preferences of the consumer in matters of delivery. Virtually all newspapers are published on the internet now. But there is also a false messianism in the claims of hi-tech zealots that the internet is an antidote to all evils. In this era of overwhelming cascades of information and entertainment from a proliferation of sources, the premium on the editorial function will grow, and the goodwill in the trademarks of authoritative newspapers is a tremendous asset. Properly managed, these franchises are beacons built on solid foundations. Unlike some newer media endeavours, these are not exercises in hucksterism, faddishness and financial flimflam. Too many US and Canadian newspapers are essentially one-city monopolies, combining the arrogance and indolence that comes from an absence of direct competition with a defeatist attitude to other and newer media. Intimidated first by television, and then by the internet, too many newspaper publishers, instead of making their products more interesting and accessible and marketing them more imaginatively, have cowered behind uneconomically low cover prices. Canada is as populated with newspapers as the US, and when we launched a new nationwide newspaper, the National Post, in late 1998, it had an electrifying effect on the Canadian media, almost immediately gaining a paid circulation of 300,000. In part, this was because the National Post took a different view than the usual soft-left Canadian media preoccupation with rather trivial distinctions between Canada and the US. But mainly its success was because of a sharper, more humorous and more crisply edited style than Canadians are accustomed to from their worthy but not overly rollicking media. The internet probably poses a greater direct threat to television than to newspapers. When bandwidth problems are resolved in the next few years, TV and internet transmissions will have comparable picture definition and will be received on the same screens. Already internet surfing, along with the multiplication of channels, has reduced and atomised TV viewing. The number of TV viewers, according to some surveys, has declined by a greater proportion in the past two years than US daily newspaper circulation has since 1970. Yet few people are predicting the demise of television. The concern most frequently expressed for the commercial viability of newspapers is that they will lose all their classified advertising revenue. In one sense this is true, but intelligent publishers will lose it to themselves. Already all seriously managed newspapers put their classified advertising on the net, and almost all of them in a way that interlinks with other newspapers to make regional or national networks. Our Chicago Sun-Times offers advertisers space in the newspaper, on the web and in a speciality publication called Digital Chicago. To small businesses we offer microsites, accessible through the Sun-Times site, that greatly expand the potential reach of their advertising dollar. This service, leveraged on the goodwill in the Sun-Times' brand, will not vanish without a struggle. Advertising goes to the media where it is effective, and newspapers, operated with any tactical skill, will not lose their attraction as multimedia classified buys. Internet portals' professed policy of posting classified advertising without charge and calling it content could be somewhat troublesome for newspapers. But either it will lead to an avalanche of unpaid advertising that would be unwieldy, as well as expensive to the service provider, or it will not catch on outside a few categories. Resourceful newspaper publishers will be able to defend most of their revenue. The internet affords the newspaper publisher the opportunity to expand his circulation vastly, if his product is more than regionally competitive. He will be able to reduce raw material costs to the extent that people desire the newspaper on their screens rather than on newsprint. He will be able to sell access to his archives and generally increase both advertising and circulation revenue if the quality of his product is competitive. For the greater newspapers, it certainly will be. Anyone will be able to set up on the internet and compete directly with telecasters and established internet sites. In this era of overwhelming choice, the central question is: who can attract the proverbial eyeballs? As the profusion of dot.com advertising in the Wall Street Journal Europe demonstrates, there is no better platform for launching, promoting, co-branding and joint selling with internet sites than an authoritative newspaper. Serious newspapers will offer their loyal readers a range of internet services as varied as their content. Those that can bridge the newspaper and internet cultures will have their full share in the rise of the internet. They will retain a base of goodwill and brand loyalty that other media will rival only with great persistence and difficulty. Reprinted from the Wall Street Journal \u00a9 March 6, 2000.

As atoms and stars and galaxies condensed from this \"space explosion\", the universe settled down to expanding, much as it still does. But the effect was to stretch space so that, unlike the stars and planets within it, it was flat - much as the Greek geometer Euclid imagined it to be 2,500 years ago.</p> <p>The project began more than a decade ago with a Nasa satellite, the Cosmic Background Explorer.

The experiment, called Boomerang, was a balloon launched from Antarctica to measure the faintest glow in the universe: the embers of the \"big bang\" in which matter, time and space were all created about 15bn years ago. Then, the universe was incredibly dense and hot. Now the background temperature has cooled to about minus 270C, about 2.7 degrees above absolute zero. Boomerang was looking for tiny variations - ripples in space - in this back ground temperature. These would provide a snapshot of what the universe must have seemed like when it was only 300,000 years old. These small variations would explain why galaxies formed into clusters, and stars into galaxies. The instruments had to filter out the light from the stars so that the original background glow could be detected. The data, published in Nature today, show a universe in which space is flat and just dense enough to go on expanding forever, because it does not contain enough matter to collapse one day into itself and become the ultimate black hole. Paolo deBernardis of the University of Rome La Sapienza said: \"The light we have detected has travelled across the entire universe before reaching us, and we are perfectly able to distinguish it from the light generated in our own galaxy.\" The scientists, from London, Italy, California, Oxford, Paris, Massachusetts and Toronto, report that data from the unmanned balloon flight match the predictions of cosmic inflation, a relatively new theory. This proposes that in the first thousandth of a second of time, space expanded, far faster than the speed of light, from a region smaller than the nucleus of an atom to something bigger than the entire observable universe today. As atoms and stars and galaxies condensed from this \"space explosion\", the universe settled down to expanding, much as it still does. But the effect was to stretch space so that, unlike the stars and planets within it, it was flat - much as the Greek geometer Euclid imagined it to be 2,500 years ago. The project began more than a decade ago with a Nasa satellite, the Cosmic Background Explorer. This year Nasa launches a second, much more sensitive, satellite to take the temperature of the sky in still finer detail.",

      "bodyText": "A breakthrough in fertility treatment may one day allow women using donated eggs to have babies that are genetically their own, but is likely to raise concerns that it could facilitate human cloning. The success of a group of scientists from France, Italy and Spain in developing a technique to help the childless demonstrates how close the ethical boundary runs between the compassionate and the unacceptable in reproductive medicine. Jan Tesarik and colleagues today describe in the journal Human Reproduction their new technique for assisting the one in 10 infertile women who cannot have children because of defects in the cytoplasm, the material around the nucleus of the egg. Their only chance of a baby is a donated egg, fertilised with their partner's sperm, but the child that results is not a genetic relation of the mother. In their laboratories, the European scientists have succeeded in replacing the nucleus of the donated egg with the nucleus of the egg from the patient. The child born from such a restructured egg will have almost all their DNA (except for 37 female genes which come from the cytoplasm) from their mother and father. This is the first time scientists have successfully removed the nucleus from a human egg and replaced it with another nucleus without immediately activating the egg - triggering cell division. The European researchers are intent only on producing an egg containing the mother's DNA which can then be fertilised with her partner's sperm to create a baby. But the technique has the potential to overcome one of the problems in human cloning, where sperm is not required but cell division is not wanted until the nuclear transfer is complete. They used two methods - one chemical and one mechanical. In both, the new nucleus was treated with an organic compound which acted as a kind of glue. Then it was either fused using another chemical or by being manipulated into place with a micropipette of the kind used to fertilise an egg with a single sperm. These techniques could be used in human cloning, to fuse a cell into an egg either to grow human tissue or, in the distant but conceivable future, to create a human clone - a being identical to the person whose genetic material was inserted into the egg. But Dr Tesarik, from the Laboratoire d'Eylau in Paris, and his colleagues point out that their only intention is to help infertile women. They intend to produce a restructured egg that can then be fertilised, so that it would contain the DNA from two human beings and not one. But because of the ethical concern in Europe over the creation of embryos, there are legal restrictions which prevent the researchers from attempting to fertilise their restructured eggs. One of the scientists, Zolt Nagy from Italy, has recently moved to Brazil where there are no regulations, and has already succeeded in fertilising such eggs, although his work has not yet been published. The researchers need to know, says Dr Tesarik, that any embryos produced are chromosomally normal.

Since the early 1990s he has been the leader of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the organisation that represents the country's main labour unions. Once a compliant organisation that took its cues from the Mugabe government, the ZCTU was transformed by Mr Tsvangirai into the leading opposition. In 1997 and 1998 it held a series of successful national anti-government strikes which brought the country to a halt. The strikes also brought the wrath of the Mugabe government and in December 1998 Mr Tsvangirai was beaten unconscious by a gang who attempted to throw him out of the window of his 10th floor office. The perpetrators were identified as supporters of Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. Such is Mr Tsvangirai's popularity that many workers downed tools until they found out whether he would live. Mr Tsvangirai, 49, grew up in a large family in the southern area of Buhera . He went to secondary school but when his father died he went to work in the mines to support his family. When questioned about his lack of a degree, Mr Tsvangirai shoots back with the retort: \"This government has lots of people with degrees and doctorates, but they are not doing such a good job of running the country.\" He became involved in union administration and rose through the ranks. He is credited with being instrumental in forming the National Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of church groups, unions, human rights groups and other civic organisations that pressed Mr Mugabe to draw up a new constitution. When Mr Mugabe created his own draft constitution to entrench his powers, Mr Tsvangirai led the assembly in a successful campaign to reject it. He founded the new Movement for Democratic Change, launched in January, which draws on a wide range of Zimbabweans, black and white.",

Nefertiti TV is the name of a controversial new Egyptian channel dedicated to sex education. </p> <p> <b> Surely the land of Cleopatra needs no lessons in love? </b> Egypt's health minister, Ismail Salam, begs to differ. A 30s population of 18m has rocketed to more than 60m today.

Appearance: \"Heiress, Great in the Palace, Fair of Face, Adorned with the Double Plumes, Mistress of Happiness, Endowed with Favours, at hearing whose voice the King rejoices, the Chief Wife of the King, his beloved,\" according to one ancient eulogist. Bit of a looker, then. Indeed, but not just a pretty face: besides helping to popularise a new religion based on worship of the sun-disk Aten, she's now a high-profile TV personality. But she's been dead for three millennia! If you think that's any kind of obstacle to a successful career in television, you clearly haven't been watching Kilroy recently. Nefertiti TV is the name of a controversial new Egyptian channel dedicated to sex education. Surely the land of Cleopatra needs no lessons in love? Egypt's health minister, Ismail Salam, begs to differ. A 30s population of 18m has rocketed to more than 60m today. Family planning advice, previously taboo, is much needed. Is Nefertiti qualified? Debatable: she had at least six children herself. Clearly Akhenaten couldn't resist the way she wore those double plumes, or maybe it was something to do with her famous bust (discovered in 1914 and now in the Berlin Museum). It's another porn channel masquerading as a 'lovers' guide', presumably? The opening schedule's full of wholesome educational chat shows, actually. As for the future, Nefertiti TV executives are keeping a sphinx-like silence. But it won't all be sex, sex, sex? Rumours of new lifestyle shows - Changing Mausoleums, Good Morning With Isis and Osiris, that sort of thing - are unconfirmed. Still, Egypt's religious authorities must be furious. \"Islam dictates that everything must be taught scientifically,\" channel director Fatima Fouad insists. \"This channel will leave no issue untouched and everything will be discussed bravely.\" And who'll pay to advertise on Nefertiti TV? Pyramid sales schemes, perhaps?",

Until the moment in November 1998 when two American teams announced that they had \"immortalised\" human embryonic stem cells and were growing them in laboratory dishes, it seemed a dream. </p> <p>Stem cell therapy sounds like the ultimate in transplant surgery. You don't commandeer someone else's tissue so that you can live, with a little help from immunosuppressant drugs. You grow your own in a dish, treat yourself and walk away, at ease with the new bit of you inside. </p> <p>There are no polymer implants, no alien grafts, no synthesised drugs on prescription. Just a fresh bit of you, fashioned by the same natural machinery that took you from a single fertilised cell to a whole human being in nine months. Five years ago, it was unimaginable. Two years ago, it was just impossible. Now there are a dozen biotech companies doing research on human stem cells, taken from foetuses, embryos and adult human tissue. </p> <p>With these cells, they believe they could one day offer hope for people with Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis, heart disease and Huntington's, macular degeneration and multiple sclerosis, strokes and spinal cord injuries. </p> <p>Stem cells are life's magic cauldron: they go on providing more. Humans begin as one single cell, a fertilised egg. They end as several trillion cells, of more than 200 different kinds. The process in between is a display of evolution's wizardry. First the embryonic egg clones, and clones again and again, and with each division, the cells contain the potential for twins, or quadruplets, or octuplets and so on. Then, at some finely balanced point, the nature of the cells begins to change. Some of them become stem cells. They can no longer become a whole human, but they can become anything a human might need, launching a cascade of changes that end with teeth and toenail tissue, or nerve cells, or the inner lining of the arteries, or the tough outer skin of a foot, or the tissue of a heart valve. </p> <p>If there were some way of keeping such cells alive, scientists reasoned, they might be a new weapon in the war against degenerative diseases. If there were some way of understanding how and why cells differentiate, there might be a way of turning the clock back, of making new stem cells that would replace failed tissue. And then things began to happen. In some cancers, cells can somehow turn their own clocks back, go haywire, start making the wrong tissue in the wrong place. If cells can do that in the wrong place, at the wrong time, maybe they could do it to order. </p> <p>In 1996, scientists at the Roslin Institute in Scotland took an adult cell from a fully grown sheep and persuaded it go back to square one, and produced from it Dolly the clone. </p> <p>And at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1998 - paid for by the Geron Corporation of California - and at the University of Wisconsin, teams of scientists separately isolated and kept alive human embryo stem cells. Words like \"holy grail\" were used. To illustrate the possibilities, commentators seized on celebrity sufferers who might - just might - benefit. One was Muhammad Ali, with Parkinson's disease. And one was Christopher Reeve himself, who had gone from being Superman to wheelchair-bound. </p> <p> Right now, a little private company called Layton BioScience in Atherton, California, is working with a neuroscientist from the Harvard Medical School to test the effect of neural stem cells in laboratory rats before possible tests in humans. Right now, Geron BioMed at the Roslin Institute is waiting for the word from the British government before it marries the technology that led to Dolly with stem cell research and opens a new pathway in medicine, towards \"therapeutic cloning\". </p> <p>Therein lies the catch. In the US, there is no federal money for human embryo research or anything that might seem like human cloning. On the other hand, there are no restrictions on what private companies might do. In Britain, there is a government appointed body that authorises experiments with human embryos, but only to help with infertility or certain tragic inherited diseases. The US hastily banned human cloning research in the world outcry after the announcement of Dolly the sheep. And the British government - reeling at the public reaction to the idea of genetically-altered soybean - found an excuse not to authorise new research but instead to refer the whole problem to a committee led by the chief medical officer of health, Liam Donaldson. Hope, as some see it, is blocked by red tape and squeamishness. </p> <p>But there is more to it than squeamishness. The first step towards such research involves experiments with human eggs, human embryos. They will be at a very early stage - just bundles of cells - but to many they will be potential humans. Their use right now is justified because the research has led not just to new life, but to desperately longed-for life. It might seem a huge step to use what some people will see as potential life to do engineering on behalf of people who have had a life, and want to enjoy an even longer one. But each day brings new ethical puzzles: today, European fertility experts report a new way of fusing human eggs to make babies possible for women whose pregnancies have failed, and this, too raises problems of embryo research. </p> <p>The chances are that stem cell therapy will go ahead. The betting is also that the use of five or six-day-old embryos will only be a stage in the adventure. Just as there are not enough donor hearts to meet demand for transplant surgery, so there will not be enough donated embryos to meet the demand for therapeutic cloning. So the dream answer is to isolate the stem cells from the patient, and use them to make the new tissue that could be injected into, or stitched into, the patient. There are huge obstacles. But if the stem cell machinery can conjure up a whole human in 40 weeks from a cell the size of a full stop, then, scientists reason, it ought to be able to conjure up a new heart valve, or endothelial cells for arteries, or eliminate damage done by diabetes, or cirrhosis, or hepatitis. </p> <p>And, they think, in five or 10 years, there could be human trials for stem cell therapy - for Parkinson's, and, yes, spinal cord injury. Christopher Reeve can see the future, and from where he sits, it must look good. </p> <p> Tim Radford is the Guardian's science editor.<br><a href=\"mailto:tim.radford@theguardian.com\">tim.radford@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Mr Cook stressed yesterday that Britain would be putting no new money on the table to help with land reform beyond the \u00a358m package promised two years ago. The British government is reluctant to see President Robert Mugabe rewarded for unleashing a wave of violence. \"Britain is ready to help the government of Zimbabwe but we are not going to appease,\" Mr Cook said. \"There can be no help unless there is an end to the occupations and a start to elections.\" The Zimbabwean delegation, which is made up of three cabinet ministers, is being led by John Nkomo, the housing minister and a close confidant of Mr Mugabe.

Word is that Lucasfilm is seeking a more culturally diverse cast for the next instalment of the prequel trilogy. </p> <p>\"This character will be bad, dirty, fast and extremely skilled in the martial arts arena,\" says Ladbrokes' Ed Nicholson. The popularity of Darth Maul in Episode One means that this will be a sought-after role, especially as that part is contracted to last through to Episode Three.\" </p> <p>And if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't get to play a grown-up Anakin Skywalker, perhaps this would appeal? </p> <p>\"It would do his acting good to play a monster,\" says Ed. \"However, he simply doesn't have the characteristics to become believable.\" </p> <p>After Fight Club, Brad Pitt (pictured) as a tough guy would be an inspired choice, Ed reckons. \"He's certain to bring in the female audiences. But the cast is looking hunk-full, with Christopher Walken and Ewan McGregor already signed up. My feeling is that they may go for an unheard-of name. </p> <p>\"If that's the case, then I think we've found the dark horse. His name is Li Lian-Jie. He's a martial arts expert, a wu shu champion - and I'm told that, despite sounding a little unthreatening, wu shu champions are hard. He also has form in the acting world, having taken part in that epic must-see film of 1982, Once Upon A Time in China. I'm not going to argue with him.\" </p> <p>With Lucas having just given the go-ahead digitally film Episode Two digitally, a completely virtual enemy isn't out of the question. \"It would certainly cost less in catering bills, but it would probably cost 10 times more to create and activate.\" </p>",

      "bodyText": "Brad Pitt .......................5/1 Li Lian-Jie ..................14/1 Virtual actor ................16/1 Leonardo DiCaprio .....20/1 After accusations of using ludicrous, racially caricatured voices for Episode One, you can only hope that George Lucas's Sith assassin character in the next Star Wars installation handles the kung fu stereotypes with more sensitivity. Word is that Lucasfilm is seeking a more culturally diverse cast for the next instalment of the prequel trilogy. \"This character will be bad, dirty, fast and extremely skilled in the martial arts arena,\" says Ladbrokes' Ed Nicholson. The popularity of Darth Maul in Episode One means that this will be a sought-after role, especially as that part is contracted to last through to Episode Three.\" And if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't get to play a grown-up Anakin Skywalker, perhaps this would appeal? \"It would do his acting good to play a monster,\" says Ed. \"However, he simply doesn't have the characteristics to become believable.\" After Fight Club, Brad Pitt (pictured) as a tough guy would be an inspired choice, Ed reckons. \"He's certain to bring in the female audiences. But the cast is looking hunk-full, with Christopher Walken and Ewan McGregor already signed up. My feeling is that they may go for an unheard-of name. \"If that's the case, then I think we've found the dark horse. His name is Li Lian-Jie. He's a martial arts expert, a wu shu champion - and I'm told that, despite sounding a little unthreatening, wu shu champions are hard. He also has form in the acting world, having taken part in that epic must-see film of 1982, Once Upon A Time in China. I'm not going to argue with him.\" With Lucas having just given the go-ahead digitally film Episode Two digitally, a completely virtual enemy isn't out of the question. \"It would certainly cost less in catering bills, but it would probably cost 10 times more to create and activate.\"",

During a visit to Dover yesterday the home secretary witnessed nine stowaways being caught by immigration officers during checks on vehicles arriving from the continent. Mr Straw was in the Kent port to see how new government measures, whereby drivers can be fined up to \u00a32,000 for each stowaway found in their vehicles, are working. Minutes after Mr Straw's arrival at the freight clearance centre at Dover's eastern docks, a lone stowaway, who told immigration officers he was from Kosovo, was detected by an officer using a hand-held carbon dioxide probe. Mr Straw shook the Kosovan by the hand as he was taken off the lorry. The bemused refugee, who was in a truck which had come from Barcelona, had been hiding in an 18in by 5ft space between two pallets when he was discovered by customs officers measuring for raised levels of carbon dioxide, indicating stowaways are on board. About 10 minutes later a body-detector dog found eight refugees in the back of a lorry from Prague. Seven adults and a child, who had cut the security seal around the load to get on board, were taken out of the lorry. Praising immigration officers, Mr Straw insisted Britain was meeting its international obligations but would not be a soft touch to those who sought to \"profit from human traffic\". Warning drivers that they faced a \u00a32,000 fine for each stowaway found in their lorries, Mr Straw said the message was getting through to British truckers but it was going to take a little more time with foreign drivers. The home secretary said the government had been talking extensively with French ministers to try to improve security at Calais, as well as increasing the number of immigration staff at Dover by 30% with 133 more staff.

      "body": "<p>When the folk singer, Sheena Wellington, sang \"A man's a man for a' that\", Burns's great ode to egalitarianism, at the opening of the Scottish parliament last year, it was not so much a musical tribute as a statement of intent: a plea to pull together for a common aim and a promise of accessibility and accountability.</p> <p>And it didn't matter that her strong, clear voice was blunted by the acoustics of Edinburgh's old Assembly Hall, the parliament's temporary home. Soon there would be a new building to symbolise the nation's pride in devolution - a striking, contemporary political campus for the foot of the Royal Mile, designed by the Catalan architect Enric Miralles.</p> <p>A year on from the parliament's inception and recrimination is now the most common refrain. Recrimination for policies gone awry, for political posturing and for the demise of the building that was in some way supposed to signal the end of all that.</p> <p>Now Scotland's answer to the Reichstag is a balsa wood model, so changed from its original concept that it will go back before city planners this week. It is so expensive that it will cost more than five times the original amount; some \u00a3200m. And it is so shrouded in secrecy that no one knows whose signature should be written on its base, when it will be ready or what exactly it will look like.</p> <p>\"We just don't know what we're getting,\" says Margo Macdonald, the SNP politician whose dogged determination to track the project kept the issue alive when others might have hoped it would be left well alone.</p> <p>\"At first, there were concerns about the money. Now I have concerns about whether or not this will be a thing of beauty to behold and add to Edinburgh's architectural heritage.\"</p> <p>Indeed, those who have seen the latest scale model, revealed only to a select few this past week, say it looks \"scrunched up\", with some parts six to seven storeys high, and the distinctive upturned boat design of the original replaced by what are ominously referred to as \"towers\".</p> <p>Earlier this month, the parliament voted to continue with the project, despite the rising costs and growing doubts over the exact role of Miralles, the Barcelona-based architect who won the international competition to create the building. He is recuperating after being taken ill in America and parliamentarians have been told that much of the responsibility now falls to his Scottish partners in the venture, the Edinburgh architects RMJM.</p> <p>But Miralles does not appear to have been the hands-on presence Scots were previously led to believe. And yesterday, Ms Macdonald was drafting a letter to the parliament's presiding officer, Sir David Steel, asking who crafted the latest model and whose name could be put on the finished product. \"Is Miralles the architect in this?\" she asked. \"And if he's not why are we paying so much for a building by someone else?\" She has already been told such questions are \"distasteful\" given Miralles's ill-health.</p> <p>RMJM say they don't talk to the press. A parliamentary spokesman first said it was never solely Enric Miralles's building, then added that it was his building but others had always been involved. He described RMJM as the design engineers, saying that this is the stage the scheme has moved to.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many of those in the Scottish architectural community have reacted with horror at the unfolding saga. They say the latest plan is barely recognisable from the original; that it is far too dense and will be a disaster for what is a world heritage site. They talk of the desecration of the adjoining Queens berry House, the elegant 17th-century A-listed building, that has been saved from demolition but is to be bomb and bullet-proofed. And they fear the entire project will deal a body blow to Scottish architecture.</p> <p>Hardest of all to take, however, is the lack of information forthcoming on the project. One architect has described it as Scotland's \"state secret\". It is a sign that the parliament, for all its fine intentions, has been unable to shake the old hands-off culture that haunted the Scottish Office in the past. Decision-making responsibilities have been cushioned from uncomfortable questions.</p> <p>\"This is our new parliament, our new democracy, all open and all accountable. Stuff and nonsense,\" says Margo Macdonald. \"But what are we supposed to do as MSPs? We know people are fed up hearing about the Scottish parliament but it is such a huge amount of public money, a huge responsibility.\"</p> <p>She's right that Scots are wearying of the saga. We were promised a development to rival the best architecture of Europe's other great cities, but many could not now care less about bricks and mortar. We had hoped for that which Sheena Wellington and Robert Burns had articulated so clearly. Accessibility. Accountability. Community. A parliament that would work with us as well as for us. But the debacle over its permanent home has exposed that there is as little a sign of that happening as there is of an inspiring new structure filling the gap at Holyrood anytime soon.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Kirsty.Scott@theguardian.com\">Kirsty.Scott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "When the folk singer, Sheena Wellington, sang \"A man's a man for a' that\", Burns's great ode to egalitarianism, at the opening of the Scottish parliament last year, it was not so much a musical tribute as a statement of intent: a plea to pull together for a common aim and a promise of accessibility and accountability. And it didn't matter that her strong, clear voice was blunted by the acoustics of Edinburgh's old Assembly Hall, the parliament's temporary home. Soon there would be a new building to symbolise the nation's pride in devolution - a striking, contemporary political campus for the foot of the Royal Mile, designed by the Catalan architect Enric Miralles. A year on from the parliament's inception and recrimination is now the most common refrain. Recrimination for policies gone awry, for political posturing and for the demise of the building that was in some way supposed to signal the end of all that. Now Scotland's answer to the Reichstag is a balsa wood model, so changed from its original concept that it will go back before city planners this week. It is so expensive that it will cost more than five times the original amount; some \u00a3200m. And it is so shrouded in secrecy that no one knows whose signature should be written on its base, when it will be ready or what exactly it will look like. \"We just don't know what we're getting,\" says Margo Macdonald, the SNP politician whose dogged determination to track the project kept the issue alive when others might have hoped it would be left well alone. \"At first, there were concerns about the money. Now I have concerns about whether or not this will be a thing of beauty to behold and add to Edinburgh's architectural heritage.\" Indeed, those who have seen the latest scale model, revealed only to a select few this past week, say it looks \"scrunched up\", with some parts six to seven storeys high, and the distinctive upturned boat design of the original replaced by what are ominously referred to as \"towers\". Earlier this month, the parliament voted to continue with the project, despite the rising costs and growing doubts over the exact role of Miralles, the Barcelona-based architect who won the international competition to create the building. He is recuperating after being taken ill in America and parliamentarians have been told that much of the responsibility now falls to his Scottish partners in the venture, the Edinburgh architects RMJM. But Miralles does not appear to have been the hands-on presence Scots were previously led to believe. And yesterday, Ms Macdonald was drafting a letter to the parliament's presiding officer, Sir David Steel, asking who crafted the latest model and whose name could be put on the finished product. \"Is Miralles the architect in this?\" she asked. \"And if he's not why are we paying so much for a building by someone else?\" She has already been told such questions are \"distasteful\" given Miralles's ill-health. RMJM say they don't talk to the press. A parliamentary spokesman first said it was never solely Enric Miralles's building, then added that it was his building but others had always been involved. He described RMJM as the design engineers, saying that this is the stage the scheme has moved to. Meanwhile, many of those in the Scottish architectural community have reacted with horror at the unfolding saga. They say the latest plan is barely recognisable from the original; that it is far too dense and will be a disaster for what is a world heritage site. They talk of the desecration of the adjoining Queens berry House, the elegant 17th-century A-listed building, that has been saved from demolition but is to be bomb and bullet-proofed. And they fear the entire project will deal a body blow to Scottish architecture. Hardest of all to take, however, is the lack of information forthcoming on the project. One architect has described it as Scotland's \"state secret\". It is a sign that the parliament, for all its fine intentions, has been unable to shake the old hands-off culture that haunted the Scottish Office in the past. Decision-making responsibilities have been cushioned from uncomfortable questions. \"This is our new parliament, our new democracy, all open and all accountable. Stuff and nonsense,\" says Margo Macdonald. \"But what are we supposed to do as MSPs? We know people are fed up hearing about the Scottish parliament but it is such a huge amount of public money, a huge responsibility.\" She's right that Scots are wearying of the saga. We were promised a development to rival the best architecture of Europe's other great cities, but many could not now care less about bricks and mortar. We had hoped for that which Sheena Wellington and Robert Burns had articulated so clearly. Accessibility. Accountability. Community. A parliament that would work with us as well as for us. But the debacle over its permanent home has exposed that there is as little a sign of that happening as there is of an inspiring new structure filling the gap at Holyrood anytime soon.

Isn't it the best proof yet available of how mandatory life sentences can offend popular instincts? Couldn't the thorny issues of what is appropriate self-defence and what is reasonable force be dealt with, after the jury has spoken, precisely by the judicial discretion that the mandatory sentence takes away?

A decade of answering what Hague now righteously calls \"an explosion of anger among millions of law abiding people\" with explosions of anger by ranting politicians had limited success in crime-reduction, and still less in restoring to society a hard sense of the difference between right and wrong.</p> <p>There are many reasons for that failure: moral decline, godless materialism, social neglect, personal indifference, a duty-free society. For vigilante-ism to be written into law, the remedy Hague comes close to proposing, is insupportable, but people must be able, within the law, to defend themselves proportionately to the threat they face. Martin had an illegal weapon, and committed a shocking crime. The issue is the context, especially the legal context, in which this should henceforth be dealt with. There are sharply contrasting possibilities.</p> <p>The politicians' way is to pass sweeping laws of ever greater crudity. These are what have put Tony Martin in jail for life, and Hague wants more of them. They reject individual justice, in favour of grand statements that brush aside particulars. They may catch some serious criminals and send them down for a long time, but people of minor as well as major evil are caught in a penal regime which, more and more over the past decade, has promoted political over judicial decision-making. Life sentences, with discretion over the real time served given to the home secretary, are a burgeoning phenomenon of the British system, now extending well beyond murder. They undermine the notion of justice as a juridical not a political commodity, applying to people not to categories, addressing real lives and not tabloid furies.</p> <p>The judges' way is different. The judge uses his judgment in all the circum- stances. He can look at Tony Martin and see he's not one of the Krays. Restoring his power to discriminate between one murderer and another would restore justice without imperilling social order in any way. Judges can be as hard as politicians, but aren't locked into a system that guarantees injustice. Actually, they will get their power back. As the Bulger case showed, political intervention in sentencing is beginning to seep away, because it violates the European human rights convention. This will retrieve some sanity.

      "bodyText": "The political future of the Scottish first minister, Donald Dewar, was thrown into severe doubt yesterday as it emerged he is to undergo major heart surgery. In the next few weeks Mr Dewar, 62, will have a cardiac operation to replace a leaking aortic valve. He will be out of action for around three months, leaving a political and power vacuum at the heart of the Scottish executive. In his absence the Liberal Democrat deputy first minister, Jim Wallace, will take control of cabinet, but he will not take the title of acting first minister. Although there was widespread concern for Mr Dewar yesterday, there was also acknowledgment that the coalition deal which brought him to power last May turns his illness from a worrying personal matter into a real political dilemma. While Mr Wallace can, in theory, run the partnership government as Mr Dewar convalesces, this would leave the Labour majority group answering to a political master from another party. To counter this, the enterprise minister, Henry McLeish, emerged yesterday as Mr Dewar's de facto political replacement. No firm date has been set for the first minister's operation, which will be carried out on the NHS at Glasgow royal infirmary. But his cardiologist, Kerry-Jane Hogg, said Mr Dewar would be in hospital for 10 days, with a 12-week recovery period. The first minister, who is divorced with two children, told reporters that he was in \"good form\" yesterday as he left hospital, and his spokesman, David Whitton, said later that he would return to work today in time for his question time session. Mr Whitton said the first minister had known there was a problem with his heart for some time, but had not realised its severity until he underwent tests on Tuesday. It has always been assumed - though never confirmed - that Mr Dewar would leave the Scottish parliament at the next election in 2003. Mr Dewar's cardiologist stressed that he should make a full recovery from his \"major but fairly routine\" surgery. However, his illness, coming on top of widely reported back problems, has sparked rumours that he will quit before the next Scottish election. If Mr Dewar were to go, his most likely successor would be Mr McLeish. The first minister had all but anointed the communities minister, Wendy Alexander, as his heir apparent, but her poor performance in the section 28 row has badly damaged her immediate prospects. The only other candidates would be the finance minister, Jack McConnell, and the health minister, Susan Deacon, whose surprise star performance gives her an outside chance of replacing Mr Dewar. But Mr Dewar is far from gone yet and when he returns to work today he will face a punishing schedule. Taking on the full mantle of power has been difficult for Mr Dewar, who is regarded as notoriously bad at delegating, and he has been stung by personal attacks on his handling of the Scottish parliament building and on his decision to sack his former chief adviser, John Rafferty. Although he undoubtedly retains the affection of Scotland for his \"father of the nation\" role, his illness will further highlight the gap in age between himself and the up and coming members of his cabinet - and the difficulties involved in presiding over coalition government. \u0095 The furore over plans to scrap section 28 intensified yesterday as it emerged that millionaire businessman Brian Souter had found a polling society prepared to conduct his self-financed referendum. The Stagecoach tycoon, who has vowed to spend all his money in an attempt to keep the clause, is paying polling group Vote It \u00a31m to send out voting papers to 4m Scots. He had been turned down by the Electoral Reform Society. The news comes as the Scottish parliament today prepares for a stormy debate on the matter. Voting papers will be sent out to households across Scotland early next week and the result will be declared on May 30.",

      "body": "<p>Something is missing. Amid all the shouting and sniping over the London mayoral elections, debate about the arts is almost entirely absent. </p> <p>It is a decidedly British anomaly. If there is anything London should be proud of it is the arts. The capital of Britain is arguably the cultural capital of Europe. The Millennium Dome notwithstanding, London boasts an unparalleled collection of cultural jewels. It is home to the flagship national companies (the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Opera); it hosts the economic powerhouse that is the West End, and the South Bank Centre, the largest arts complex in Europe; the British Film Institute is based in the capital, alongside more than 100 cinemas; while the bulk of the national collections are to be found in the city, at the ever-expanding Tate, the National Gallery, the British Library, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and others. </p> <p>Alongside the institutionalised creative activity, London is home to a frenetic community of artists, musicians, writers and performers, while the wider creative community stretches from the media to design and architecture. Much of the money behind Britain's burgeoning creativity - the \"creative industries\", as New Labourspeak once had it - is located in London. Down the road from the Houses of Parliament, the Arts Council of England sits in judgment over and dispenses money to a range of projects across the country. </p> <p>With all this activity, one would imagine that the four main mayoral candidates would be rushing to cover themselves in reflected glory. Not so. Ken Livingstone harks back to his Festival of Britain childhood, when trips to the zoo were top of his cultural agenda. Frank Dobson avows, \"I'm a conservative about visual art. If I can't hang it on my wall at home, I'm not interested.\" Steven Norris tells us that, \"My radio is almost permanently tuned to Classic FM.\" Susan Kramer reads a lot. London's cultural life, they wail, is a super thing, if only they had more time for it. </p> <p>It is to be hoped that the new mayor might make time for it, although like so much else surrounding the role of the mayor, precisely how he or she will be able to affect the cultural life of the city is not clear. The mayor is required to appoint a cultural strategy group, which will then advise him or her on the only other task they are required to carry out, which is to devise a cultural strategy. Tellingly, the mayor is not required to implement that strategy, which is probably a necessary omission as the mayor's powers are severely limited. </p> <p>The only cultural institution over which the mayor will have direct control is the London Transport Museum. The mayor will be able to provide \"financial or other assistance\" to London's cultural institutions, though as the revenue-raising powers of the London Assembly are also limited, it is not clear where any extra money for grants could come from. </p> <p>Sue Robertson, chief executive of the London Arts Board, chairs an organisation called the Cultural Strategy Partnership (CSP), which has no official relationship with the mayor, but was put together specifically to consider the issues affecting the cultural life of London and how the mayor could get involved. The CSP includes organisations such as English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund, London Film Commission, the London Tourist Board and the National Lottery Charities Board. </p> <p>Together, the organisations within the CSP have far more spending power than the new mayor will have for culture; even so, Robertson says that they will look to the mayor to provide leadership and direction. \"We hope that the mayor will be a broker for new resources,\" Robertson says. \"But what the mayor can really do that none of us can on our own, is link the cultural policy with other policies. I hesitate to use the phrase joined-up thinking, but there is a real opportunity to link culture with economic [planning], environmental sustainability, and transport strategies to make some sense of London.\" </p> <p>Echoing this, there is a sense of optimism among London's arts figures that the mayor can make a positive difference. The Guardian asked a number of the capital's leading arts figures to comment on what they thought the first priority of the new mayor should be in terms of culture.

The three pages of minutes, a victory for freedom of information campaigners, also reveal concern about leaks and premature press coverage of job announcements. If the leaks continued \"then there could be a damaging effect upon potential future investment and all the agencies concerned needed to respect the investor's wishes on the handling of announcements\", the minutes state. The minutes cover a cabinet meeting on March 13 and are said to be a full account except for issues of commercial confidentiality. The minutes of the British cabinet are kept secret for 30 years and the home secretary, Jack Straw, is still under pressure from peers to make further concessions over his much-criticised freedom of information bill. The director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, Maurice Frankel, praised Mr Morgan. \"The minutes reveal business-like, practical and sometimes mundane discussions and suggest that the traditional secrecy in this area may have more to do with protecting mystique than real secrets or highly sensitive discussions. \"The public can be told what is going on without bringing the process of government to its knees.\" The minutes were published on the internet in English and Welsh as part of Mr Morgan's drive to make the assembly one of the most open governments in Europe. Mr Morgan wants all assembly information, including advice to ministers from civil servants, to be made publicly available unless there is an overwhelming reason not to disclose. The minutes also reveal that Mr Morgan is considering setting up a separate honours awards system, perhaps on St David's day, to recognise the good works undertaken by Welsh men and women.

The BBC1 makeover expert pleaded guilty to 14 charges of obtaining a money transfer by deception and four charges of obtaining property by deception. Inner London crown court heard she swindled the wife of fellow host Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen out of \u00a32,000, presenter Anna Ryder Richardson out of \u00a3500, and former Blue Peter host Mark Curry out of \u00a31,000. Wagstaff, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, who admitted the charges, also took \u00a312,000 from her former boyfriend Mark Thurgood, it was stated. She had denied 19 charges at an earlier hearing but changed her pleas yesterday. One charge of obtaining money from Mrs Llewelyn-Bowen was allowed to lie on file. The court heard that Wagstaff's deception of colleagues at Bazal Productions, which makes Changing Rooms for the BBC, started early last year, and that over the course of the year she conned money out of production staff including Michael Jewitt and Caroline Officer, and landscape gardener Peter Beech, who also worked on the show.

Wagstaff, who has had her blond hair cut short and dyed black since she appeared on the show, which regularly attracts 10m viewers, left the court without commenting. But she said in a statement issued through her solicitor: \"I am very sorry to have let down people who were kind to me and who I regarded as friends.\" \u0095 The makers of Ground Force are considering suing an Australian TV channel over a series they believe to be a \"rip-off\", it was announced yesterday.

      "bodyText": "An Australian journalist and a 26-year-old British man have been arrested in north-east Italy for alleged involvement in what is believed to be the world's biggest shipment of ecstasy, Italian police said yesterday. The men were arrested on Monday near the town of Udine and police seized a consignment of 333,000 ecstasy tablets, with a street value of around \u00a34m. The tablets, allegedly found in the back of the British suspect's car, were on their way from Holland to America, police said. The Australian, a 30-year-old correspondent for an Australian newspaper, lives in Los Angeles and had allegedly flown to Italy to collect them. \"This is the largest ecstasy seizure ever carried out in Europe and perhaps in the world,\" officials said in a statement. Colonel Carlo Germi, commander of the revenue guard in Udine, said the Briton was born in Bournemouth and the Australian was from Sydney. He added that he believed the Briton had bought the drugs in Holland and held them for two months before moving them to Italy. Trieste anti-Mafia prosecutor Federico Frezza said the arrests were part of an on-going police operation that had already led to 35 arrests for drug trafficking in Italy. Police had tapped the mobile phone of the alleged Australian drug trafficker but still had difficulty in identifying the time and place of the drug handover because of the extreme circumspection shown by those involved. A third man, known as Dave, allegedly coordinated the drug consignment arrangements from the United States. \"He was the brains behind the operation. We don't know where he lives because he was always contacted by cellphone,\" Col Germi said.",

The British Olympic Association could not afford uniforms. They wore ages-old team sweaters under old-fashioned peak caps and were still shivering from their long wait in the wet cold.</p> <p>Police and security guards were everywhere. The huge German crowd waited breathlessly. Then the British team did what, at a lengthy meeting the previous evening, had been agreed. They put their arms out sidewise in the formal manner of the Olympic salute, but over the loudspeakers the announcer boomed, \"It is the Heil Hitler salute!\" and the crowd burst in to wild applause. Soon afterwards, Mrs Tomkinson recalled, came the turn of the Swiss, who performed only \"eyes right,\" and were received in stony silence.</p> <p>She was one of the British team of six and finished 25th, the event being decided on the combined result of downhill and slalom, Alpine skiing having been accepted as a discipline for the first time thanks to the lobbying of Britain's Arnold Lunn. The experience of skiing for her country convinced her she should carry on, although racers had little or no support. \"In the three weeks before the Olympics it was wonderful to have training at Muerren, organised and paid for - unheard of in those days.\"</p> <p>Mrs Tomkinson was in good company. The British had one of the strongest women's teams of the time. Esme McKinnon had won the first ever World Championship in 1931; Evie Pinching, a member of the 1936 Garmisch team, three weeks later went on to win the World Championship downhill at Innsbruck. It was a race which came to be known as the \"Innsbruck Massacre.\" Mrs Tomkinson was one of the few to finish a course frozen to sheet ice. Men racers formed a line down the finishing straight to stop the more exhausted women racers crashing on to tree stumps.</p> <p>Helen Blane began to ski at the age of 12 in Villars, Switzerland. It was a time when skiers packed long dresses and evening jackets for formal parties. Her mother, Lady Blane, was keen Helen should learn languages, and after a year in France she spent the 1934-35 winter season in Kitzbuehel, learning German and competing in the local ski club races. She was quickly good enough to make the British ladies' team, finding the money to pay for herself from work in the winter sports department of Woollands in Knightsbridge, or guiding Alpine walking tours.</p> <p>Women racers in the mid-30s still wore plus fours or gabardine trousers, and raced on heavy wooden skis without release bindings. Helen Blane competed in the 1937, 1938 and 1939 World Championships at Chamonix, Engelberg and Zakopane and went on to win the Czech international championship, a title she was to hold for many years. Holding firm to her Austrian friends, she would speak to them where others, after the Anschluss, and the crushing together of Austrian and German teams, refused to do so. She also had kind words for Christl Cranz, German winner of the 1936 Olympic Alpine gold, who, she said, took good care of her team and always trained with the weakest member.</p> <p>Of highly independent mind, she was guiding a Thomas Cook tour in Austria in August, 1939, when a Polish-Jewish woman in her railway carriage asked her to carry a parcel through customs into Switzerland. The woman was searched, but Helen safely brought the package through. During the war, her languages came in useful as a censorship officer and she worked for a time at Wormwood Scrubs prison before moving to Holborn.</p> <p>In post-war years she became a senior technical delegate with the International Ski Federation, serving regularly on Olympic and World Championship juries, and supervising the safety of courses and rule observance. She sat on the FIS ladies' committee for 20 years, and in 1983 became only the second woman made an honorary member by that organisation. She was chairman of the Kandahar Club from 1962 to 1967 and as chair of the FIS Citadin committee from 1975 to 1983 worked assiduously for amateur racers in an increasingly professional environment.</p> <p>In 1979 she was awarded an MBE. She had married Bill Tomkinson in 1940 and is survived by her two sons and two daughters, one of whom, Diana, skied with the 1960s British team.</p> <p>\u0095 Helen Tomkinson, ski racer, born June 25 1913; died April 12 2000</p>",

Esme McKinnon had won the first ever World Championship in 1931; Evie Pinching, a member of the 1936 Garmisch team, three weeks later went on to win the World Championship downhill at Innsbruck. It was a race which came to be known as the \"Innsbruck Massacre.\" Mrs Tomkinson was one of the few to finish a course frozen to sheet ice. Men racers formed a line down the finishing straight to stop the more exhausted women racers crashing on to tree stumps. Helen Blane began to ski at the age of 12 in Villars, Switzerland. It was a time when skiers packed long dresses and evening jackets for formal parties. Her mother, Lady Blane, was keen Helen should learn languages, and after a year in France she spent the 1934-35 winter season in Kitzbuehel, learning German and competing in the local ski club races. She was quickly good enough to make the British ladies' team, finding the money to pay for herself from work in the winter sports department of Woollands in Knightsbridge, or guiding Alpine walking tours. Women racers in the mid-30s still wore plus fours or gabardine trousers, and raced on heavy wooden skis without release bindings. Helen Blane competed in the 1937, 1938 and 1939 World Championships at Chamonix, Engelberg and Zakopane and went on to win the Czech international championship, a title she was to hold for many years. Holding firm to her Austrian friends, she would speak to them where others, after the Anschluss, and the crushing together of Austrian and German teams, refused to do so. She also had kind words for Christl Cranz, German winner of the 1936 Olympic Alpine gold, who, she said, took good care of her team and always trained with the weakest member. Of highly independent mind, she was guiding a Thomas Cook tour in Austria in August, 1939, when a Polish-Jewish woman in her railway carriage asked her to carry a parcel through customs into Switzerland. The woman was searched, but Helen safely brought the package through. During the war, her languages came in useful as a censorship officer and she worked for a time at Wormwood Scrubs prison before moving to Holborn. In post-war years she became a senior technical delegate with the International Ski Federation, serving regularly on Olympic and World Championship juries, and supervising the safety of courses and rule observance. She sat on the FIS ladies' committee for 20 years, and in 1983 became only the second woman made an honorary member by that organisation. She was chairman of the Kandahar Club from 1962 to 1967 and as chair of the FIS Citadin committee from 1975 to 1983 worked assiduously for amateur racers in an increasingly professional environment. In 1979 she was awarded an MBE. She had married Bill Tomkinson in 1940 and is survived by her two sons and two daughters, one of whom, Diana, skied with the 1960s British team. \u0095 Helen Tomkinson, ski racer, born June 25 1913; died April 12 2000",

Once, at a party, I saw a man I thought was chatting up my girlfriend. If he wanted to kiss her, I told him, he'd have to kiss me first. What followed was a strange, spiky snog - half headbutt, half wrestle. We had both been drinking. We separated uneasily. I found myself not knowing what to think. Had I won? I thought so. But I think he thought he had won, too.</p> <p>Another time I was kissed by a man was at Ibrox stadium in Glasgow, the home of Rangers. A neutral spectator sitting in the Celtic seats, I stood and clapped when Celtic scored an equalising goal. I didn't see the kiss coming. My kisser was an elderly man. He kissed me on the mouth, quite hard, and hugged me. It was a sort of triumphant attack. There was aggression involved. During the kiss, I realised he was kissing me legitimately - one of the only times a man is free to kiss another man is when their team scores. He had mistaken me for a Celtic fan. I went along with it. It was all right, I told myself. It was fine.</p> <p>But it's not usually all right. There are few heterosexual guy-on-guy role models when it comes to kissing. The only one I can think of is the scene in Planes, Trains And Automobiles, starring Steve Martin and John Candy, in which the two big guys find themselves sharing a bed. In the morning, the half-asleep Martin cuddles his bedmate, mistaking him for a woman. When he opens his eyes, he's mortified. Martin darts out of bed and does a dance of horror, as if exorcising demons. When Candy gets out of bed, the two men, both terrified, back away from each other. To calm things down, Martin begins talking about his team, the Chicago Bears. \"What about the Bears?\" he shouts. Only then does Candy start to relax.</p> <p>Anglo-Saxon guys find it hard to kiss each other, even when it's just a peck on the cheek. You can feel the other man's neck stiffen up when you do it. Of course, you can do it if one of you is French or Italian, or if one of you is pretending to be French or Italian. You can do it when you declare it in advance as a joke. But that's about it.</p> <p>\"Countries like ours which have a powerful military history tend to be a bit more inhibited,\" says the anthropologist Desmond Morris. So it doesn't surprise me at all that a survey published this week reveals that British men feel uncomfortable about kissing each other. Of course they do - they always have. It's going to take more than a few decades of feminism to change things.</p> <p>Of 1,000 men polled by NOP, 60% said they would rather shake a man's hand than kiss him; 62% said they didn't kiss other men in case people thought they were gay; 23% of Scotsmen said they would kiss a man only if they were drunk or celebrating a sporting triumph. Perhaps most ominously, over half of Yorkshiremen were prepared to answer a male kiss with physical violence.</p> <p>Why? Partly because they don't want to seem gay and partly because they don't want to seem vulnerable. When footballers, or football supporters, kiss each other, it is an act of mania, not an act of affection. It is a moment outside control. The kissing takes place at the moment of least vulnerability - when your team has scored.</p> <p>Men, who also see the public kissing of women as an act of ownership, of anti-vulnerability, are naturally wary of kissing each other. What if the kissee is a Yorkshireman? It's a big risk to take. On a night out, men subtly signal their heterosexuality to each other; they narrow their eyes with approval at the entrance of an attractive woman and nod at each other with relief.</p> <p>Maybe this reluctance of men to kiss each other is not such a bad thing. Gloria Steinem once wondered what if men, instead of women, had periods; she surmised that they would hang around on street corners and say things like: \"Yeah, man, I'm on the rag!\"</p> <p>Imagine what men would be like if they stopped worrying about kissing each other.

It said the development further soured the political atmosphere ahead of a push to save the Good Friday agreement, and it was seeking talks with the Irish government.</p> <p>Prison officials announced the move after warder Tom Shaughnessy was held hostage on Sunday in a drunken incident at Castlerea open prison, Co Roscommon.</p> <p>He was freed unharmed, but has been on sick leave since the incident.</p> <p>Colleagues, who were considering strike action, were taken aback. One said the move could have \"huge ramifications because their treatment is a part of the Good Friday agreement. We are genuinely surprised.\"</p> <p>The IRA inmates had been celebrating the Easter Rising of 1916. Bottles of vodka were found in a follow-up search.</p> <p>The inmates had been transferred four months ago from the strict regime at Portlaoise prison to Castlerea, then newly opened. They enjoyed considerable freedom there, living unsupervised in bungalows, and according to one report, being able to order deliveries of Chinese food. None of the 10 is entitled to early release under the agreement.</p> <p>Those transferred back to Portlaoise include a man jailed earlier this month for 20 months for assault after vigilantes killed a Dublin heroin addict. Two others are also anti-drugs activists.</p> <p>One of the prisoners locked the warder in a kitchen.

      "bodyText": "The last 10 IRA prisoners in the Irish Republic were yesterday transferred back to Portlaoise, the country's maximum security jail, amid fears they were planning an escape attempt. One is Pearse McAuley, who broke out of Brixton prison in south London with a smuggled gun nine years ago. Sinn Fein reacted furiously, and dismissed as nonsense the suggestions of a planned jailbreak. It said the development further soured the political atmosphere ahead of a push to save the Good Friday agreement, and it was seeking talks with the Irish government. Prison officials announced the move after warder Tom Shaughnessy was held hostage on Sunday in a drunken incident at Castlerea open prison, Co Roscommon. He was freed unharmed, but has been on sick leave since the incident. Colleagues, who were considering strike action, were taken aback. One said the move could have \"huge ramifications because their treatment is a part of the Good Friday agreement. We are genuinely surprised.\" The IRA inmates had been celebrating the Easter Rising of 1916. Bottles of vodka were found in a follow-up search. The inmates had been transferred four months ago from the strict regime at Portlaoise prison to Castlerea, then newly opened. They enjoyed considerable freedom there, living unsupervised in bungalows, and according to one report, being able to order deliveries of Chinese food. None of the 10 is entitled to early release under the agreement. Those transferred back to Portlaoise include a man jailed earlier this month for 20 months for assault after vigilantes killed a Dublin heroin addict. Two others are also anti-drugs activists. One of the prisoners locked the warder in a kitchen. He was said to be angry that Mr Shaughnessy, who had come to deliver a message, had failed to ask permission to enter the IRA chalet, and the warder was freed only when Kevin Walsh, the IRA's officer commanding, intervened. Republicans said the anti-drugs activists were allowed into the IRA's accommodation for their own protection. But it is widely believed the IRA is behind a series of attacks on drugs dealers. McAuley, serving 14 years for manslaughter, and three others were jailed last year over the shooting of detective Jerry McCabe, 53. He was killed in June 1996 during an abortive IRA robbery in Ardare, Co Limerick. Bertie Ahern, the taoiseach, sought to quell public outrage in the Irish Republic by announcing they would not qualify for early release. But the decision to move them to Castlerea last December was widely seen as an initial step towards reducing their sentences. Unionist politicians lambasted Mr Ahern for hypocrisy. They compare his decision to deny early release to police killers in the republic with his insistence that RUC murderers must qualify in Northern Ireland. But now Sinn Fein is leading criticism of him. It believes the decision to transfer the IRA men back to Portlaoise was aimed at reassuring the garda that Mr McCabe's killers will serve their sentences, and say that the breakout claims were an excuse. They are angry, too, at the arrests this year of three IRA men on extradition warrants. One, Nessan Quinlivan, escaped from Brixton with McAuley in July 1991. All are now free on bail.",

      "bodyText": "The government is facing high court action to prevent it from demolishing a group of listed buildings in London. The Department of the Environment, Camden council and London Underground are being asked to explain why they intended to use legislation passed by the Conservatives to speed up the Channel tunnel rail link to tear down the Victorian railway milk terminus at King's Cross for an entirely different purpose. Normally planning permission is required to destroy listed buildings, but none was sought, so the high court has required the three \"conspirators\" to explain - giving the cobbled platforms, designed in a v-shape for use by horse-drawn wagons, a reprieve. At the heart of the action is the development of 150 acres of railway land behind King's Cross and St Pancras stations. The case against the government is that the Channel tunnel rail link legislation cannot be used to demolish buildings and start the development unless the works are associated with the link. At present there is no certainty that the second leg of the link, joining Stratford in east London to St Pancras, will ever be built, because the \u00a32bn needed from the private sector to complete the work has not been found. The government still claims that construction of this leg will start next year and be completed by 2007, but lawyers say that cannot justify speculative demolition of listed buildings. The property company working with the government has signed an agreement with the joint venture developers Argent Group and St George and is pressing ahead with plans to demolish listed buildings. Buildings at the site have repeatedly been featured in films and television shows in \"atmospheric\" scenes of Victorian London, and the Victorian Society wants them to be part of a World Heritage site. But they stand in the way of the government, which is the landlord, and developers: both will make money if they are torn down whether the rail link is built or not. Under an agreement made by John Prescott with the consortium London &amp; Continental Railways in 1998 the government gets half the money from any money-making property developments at King's Cross. LCR is supposed to start the rail link next year but has not raised the money so far, and Railtrack, which is required to take up an option to back the scheme, will not decide whether it wants to until June. The sticking point is the 14.25 miles of tunnel through Essex and east London required to join the rail link on its final leg from the Channel tunnel to St Pancras. The astronomical cost overruns on the underground Jubilee line extension will have frightened away most investors. The government is prepared to back the scheme to the tune of \u00a33.8bn, partly through a bond issue, but that leaves \u00a32bn to be raised. Meanwhile, the government and Camden council, which wants the area \"improved\", were prepared to let the developers start demolishing the milk terminus - to provide a builder's yard for contractors improving King's Cross underground ticket hall. The high court's decision to allow a judicial review is a victory for Julien Burcher, a tenant of Stanley Buildings, a group of Victorian model workers' flats also due for demolition. Mr Burcher, who with other tenants has fought to save the area for years, said: \"It is time the conspirators who want to flatten this area without justification are forced to explain their actions.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence is spending nearly \u00a340m a year renting and maintaining 14,000 empty houses, auditors disclose today. Despite this high vacancy rate, it also spent \u00a311m last year renting private sector accommodation for 700 families. The report by the national audit office, parliament's financial watchdog, criticises the management of the MoD's 63,000 family quarters. Of these, 23% were vacant last year, costing the ministry \u00a339m in wasted rent and maintenance charges. It spent a further \u00a34m renting houses which were unavailable for families because they were being used for other purposes. Married quarters are owned by Annington Homes and leased back to the ministry under a sale agreement accepted in 1996 by Michael Portillo, then Tory defence secretary. Its defence housing executive remains responsible for managing, maintaining and upgrading the estate. The deal with Annington, a Japanese-led consortium, was savaged by the NAO in 1997 when it found that the MoD had wasted \u00a3139m of public money in the \u00a31.7bn sale. It said Mr Portillo knew from his department's own figures that over 25 to 30 years it would have paid to retain ownership, selling only quarters that were surplus. Discounted value to the armed forces of owning their housing, plus proceeds of selling the surplus, amounted to between \u00a377m and \u00a3139m more than the sale price, it said. The MoD's housing stock was at the centre of further controversy last year when refugees were prevented by the Home Office from using more than 270 empty ministry houses near Cambridge on the grounds that the accommodation was too good. Today's report says the defence housing executive acknowledged that such a high level of empty and unavailable quarters was unacceptable. It admitted planning assumptions needed improvement. The NAO acknowledges that the MoD needs some flexibility, given the uncertainty surrounding relocation of service personnel, but not as much as the ministry says it needs.",

As police set up a mobile incident room on Gowan Avenue in Fulham, Scotland Yard revealed that 31 potential new witnesses had been uncovered in the past few days. A woman who saw a man in a suit carrying a mobile phone loitering near the television presenter's home on April 26 last year, but had not contacted police, was discovered on Tuesday after being stopped by officers posted around the area as part of the operation based on the anniversary of the shooting.

It confirms on a national scale what smaller, local studies had already found. Since 1992, 47 states have expanded their laws to punish more juveniles as adults and according to the justice department, there are between 6,000 and 8,000 inmates under the age of 18 in US adult prisons on any given day. Teenage inmates are five times more likely to be sexually abused and eight times more likely to commit suicide in adult institutions than in specialised juvenile facilities. Black youths represent 15% of the US under-18 population, but 26% of all under-18s arrested and 58% of the youth population in adult prisons. A recent survey in Maryland found that young whites appearing before a juvenile court were five times more likely to be referred for psychiatric counselling than black teenagers, who more often ended up behind bars. Proponents of tough juvenile sentencing have argued in the past that this imbalance is due to a higher crime rate among minorities, but the new report suggests that an unequal treatment by the justice system is the more important factor. \"We are faced with a very serious national civil rights issue, virtually making our system juvenile injustice,\" Hugh Price, the president of the National Urban League, a civil rights pressure group, said yesterday. \"The depth of the disparities is breathtaking and can only be explained by a rampant pattern in the justice system of locking young black males away. \"What it does is to take our young black males out of play before they have a chance to become productive members of society.\"",

But the art this museum seems made for exists already, and it was made in New York half a century ago. </p> <p>Abstract expressionist paintings, made to look good in skyscrapers, seem to have found a home from home high up over the Thames. There are two entrances to the Rothko room at Tate Modern, low square doorways leading into a tall rectangular room painted grey. The lighting panels mimic the sombre illumination you might get through a skylight in a basement. Here hang the nine paintings Rothko donated to the Tate in 1968-9, before his suicide in 1970. </p> <p>A blood-red rectangle floats in a velvety void, a black cloud parts to expose a purple doorway. The shapes can be described like this, but the words turn to dust in your mouth. Doors, portals - maybe, but also not at all. What is unmissable is the terminal quality of these paintings. They are what you imagine the last thing you might see being like - a red retinal flash. </p> <p>This was what the businessman dining at the Four Seasons restaurant would have seen if Rothko had kept to the terms of his 1958 commission for paintings to go in Manhattan's newest skyscraper, the Seagram Building, designed by Mies van der Rohe and Phillip Johnson. </p> <p>Rothko, born in the Russian city of Dvinsk in 1903, came to the USA in 1913 and won a scholarship to Yale before dropping out, reportedly alienated by anti-semitism, to \"starve a bit\" and study art in New York. For the rest of his life he hated to leave the city. He emerged as one of the abstract expressionists in the 40s, and in the 50s he became celebrated for his big paintings with numinous rectangular panels of colour. The Seagram building job was his first big commission, and the building itself was the highpoint of 50s corporate modernism, a bronze-and-glass-fronted palace of business that was elegant, authoritative and radiated rational control of its surroundings. </p> <p>Rothko went to the task with a passion, but then in 1959 returned the money and kept the paintings. A decade later he finally gave a selection of them to the Tate, on condition that they would be shown in their own room. It was a coup for the Tate, obtained by reassuring Rothko that he would get the perfect display conditions he believed no American museum would provide. The Rothko room has been a sacred part of the Tate since it opened in 1970. The display of these paintings is one of the tests by which the new museum will be judged. </p> <p>The Tate has in the past portrayed Rothko as a mystic - it displayed his paintings as he insisted, in a clean, purified space that fitted in with the religious way he had come to see his art by the end of his life. I prefer the less reverential way they are displayed at Tate Modern. There has long been a tacit agreement that whatever Rothko was thinking about when he created these exalted canvases it cannot have been cocktails and steaks. He cannot have ever really intended them as restaurant murals. But in an interview with Phillip Johnson and Phyllis Lambert, daughter of the then chairman of the Seagram corporation, to be broadcast this weekend, the artist's claim that he misunderstood the commission, that he thought the canvases would be visible from a worker's canteen, is denied. They say, on the con trary, that Rothko always knew these paintings were for a restaurant. </p> <p>At Tate Modern, the curators have departed from the last, chapel-like hanging of the Rothko murals at Millbank. There they were in a solitary hall. Here they have a grand, tenebrous setting, but one that can be passed through on the way to other galleries. You get vistas that combine the Rothkos with other paintings: Monet waterlilies, a De Chirico. But best of all the Rothko room at Tate Modern is high up, reached by escalators, situated just a few feet from a sweeping view of the city - a setting in the same modernist mould as the Seagram building. One that makes you see these paintings not in a religious void but playing their part in the city, as backdrops to life, backdrops that are meant to usurp the foreground, architectural decorations that subvert the architecture around them. </p> <p>Abstract expressionism has had a bad press for 30 years, rejected by younger artists, and yet at Tate Modern it can be revealed as an art with a deeply ambivalent relationship with the modern world. There is no more modern artist than Pollock or Rothko and there is no contemporary installation art more subversive than the Seagram murals. No one thinks of Rothko as a joker. But in a speech about his art in 1958 he listed \"wit, humour\" and \"irony\" as requirements for art. If you accept for a moment that he really was thinking of the Seagram Building when he painted these murals, their irony becomes savage. </p> <p>The architectural allusions in Rothko's murals are clear. The shapes in the paintings suggest doors, the arrangement of pillar and lintel, and most of all they replicate the shapes of Manhattan skyscrapers. But these rectangles are collapsing. Straight lines turn fuzzy. The rational space of Mies van der Rohe is being disrupted by something organic, something that presses at the walls, an irresistible flood. The skyscraper is full of blood. </p> <p>\u0095 Rothko's Rooms is broadcast on BBC2, at 6.55pm on Sunday. Tate Modern, Bankside, London SE1, opens on May 12. Information: 020-7887 8008.</p>",

The restaurant, in Riverside Drive, Los Angeles, has been designated a California State Point of Historical Interest.</p> <p>Built in 1949, this drive-in diner, complete with car-hop service and classic car shows on Friday evenings, is a key monument to US post-modern architecture and just the kind of building the East Coast architect Robert Venturi had in mind when he wrote his Po-Mo set-texts Complexity and Contradiction In Architecture (1966) and Learning From Las Vegas (1973), a celebration of US roadside design.</p> <p>Yet where Venturi's view of this architecture was, if fond, ironic, McAllister was in earnest when he designed some of the best drive-ins, diners and dance lounges to be found in the automobile-addicted California of the 1940s and 1950s. McAllister designed for the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pig 'n' Whistle chains as well as for Bob's Big Boy. \"I just ran a modest office,\" he told the LA Times in a 1998 interview, \"and did modest work\".

      "bodyText": "There are lots of Bob's Big Boy restaurants in California, but only one was designed by Wayne McAllister, unsung hero of United States roadside architecture, who has died after a fall aged 92. The restaurant, in Riverside Drive, Los Angeles, has been designated a California State Point of Historical Interest. Built in 1949, this drive-in diner, complete with car-hop service and classic car shows on Friday evenings, is a key monument to US post-modern architecture and just the kind of building the East Coast architect Robert Venturi had in mind when he wrote his Po-Mo set-texts Complexity and Contradiction In Architecture (1966) and Learning From Las Vegas (1973), a celebration of US roadside design. Yet where Venturi's view of this architecture was, if fond, ironic, McAllister was in earnest when he designed some of the best drive-ins, diners and dance lounges to be found in the automobile-addicted California of the 1940s and 1950s. McAllister designed for the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pig 'n' Whistle chains as well as for Bob's Big Boy. \"I just ran a modest office,\" he told the LA Times in a 1998 interview, \"and did modest work\". Yet he was one of the first architects to understand and respond to the way the car was changing American life. Bob's Big Boy on Riverside Drive remains an unmistakeable building with its 70-ft mast topped with a pink-and-white neon logo and sweeping glass facade. Its design makes reference to the futuristic New York World's Fair pavilions of 1940 as well as to Frank Lloyd Wright's desert home and studio, Taliesin West. And of course to the bright lights of nearby Hollywood. A later generation of Po-Mo architects paid homage to its complex, high-spirited design as well as to McAllister's rich palette of materials.

All aspects of air traffic control are highly regulated and controlled by law. A comprehensive system of safety locks is already in place. None of these can be affected by a change of ownership of Nats. For example, the hours worked by air traffic controllers could not be changed by new management, or affected in any way by a change of ownership. The only way air traffic controllers could work longer hours would be if the law were changed. PPP would mean clear separation between the provision and regulation of air traffic services. The CAA will stay in the public sector, separate and independent. Nats would be regulated by the CAA, exactly as it currently regulates BA and the BAA and the 35 air traffic providers referred to in your article, which are already in the private sector. By bringing greater transparency, by strengthening the regulator, and by giving Nats access to investment, the PPP should in fact reinforce the UK's excellent safety record.

      "bodyText": "Belgian scientists are preparing to fit a blind woman with an artificial eye which will link directly with the optic nerve and allow her to \"see.\" If the technique works, it could restore vision to many who are blind because retinas have been damaged or destroyed. The eye - lens and all - is like a video camera: wavelengths of optical light hit the retina and are transmitted but the information still has to be processed into a picture in the head. The brain is the viewer that actually makes sense of the signals transmitted from the optic nerve. For decades, researchers have believed that just as artificial aids could enable some deaf people to \"hear\", and implants could help throat cancer patients speak, so some mechanical device could one day enable blind people to see. A team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore two years ago started work on a Star Trek-style \"eye chip\" to bypass non-functioning eye cells and transmit signals directly to cells in the retina. All 15 volunteers reported being able to see either spots of light, or more complex patterns. Some patients had not seen for four decades, and were able after a while to identify the shapes of letters transmitted to them. However, such a technique, provided that it worked well enough, could only help a small percentage of sightless people. Scientists at the Catholic University of Louvain, according to New Scientist today, believe that a coil wrapped around the optic nerve could widen horizons for many others. With a shift in the phase and a variation in the strength of the singals, the coil could stimulate different parts of the optic nerve, rather in the way that electron guns light up dif ferent parts of a television screen. The signals would come from an externally fitted camera and be transmitted to the implant through a radio antenna and microchip fitted under the skin and just behind the ear. Trials with one woman volunteer have been going on for two years. The scientists think that success is likely to be with people who had once been sighted, and would therefore have some experience in interpreting images. The hope is that with such a device, blind people might at least be sure of \"seeing\" and avoiding obstacles. If the implant is a success, it is hoped that trials on three more patients could begin in August.",

      "bodyText": "A quarter of a century after the fall of Saigon, the United States and Vietnam are at peace. More surprisingly, the issue that divided America as no other confict has done since the civil war has finally been laid to rest. All this week, television channels, magazines and newspapers have been running anniversary reflections on the war which claimed 58,000 US lives and 2-3 million Vietnamese: the tone has been overwhelmingly conciliatory. This year, for the first time, a presidential election will be fought between two candidates who are both from the Vietnam war generation. Al Gore, who was an opponent of the war, is nevertheless a Vietnam veteran, though not quite as battle-hardened as he tries to imply. George W Bush, a supporter of American policy, managed to avoid being sent to Vietnam by means which have not been satisfactorily explained. When Bill Clinton ran for the presidency in 1992, the issue haunted him, because Mr Clinton was both an opponent of the war and a draft evader who feared to say why. For many of America's rightwing Clinton-haters, that remains at the centre of their visceral hostility. Yet in the 2000 election, the sting of Vietnam seems to have been drawn. \"What did you do in the Vietnam war?\" is rarely asked and when it is it creates no scandals, even among Vietnamese- Americans. There are far more Vietnamese refugees living in the US today than Cuban refugees. Yet in southern California, where the highest concentration of Vietnamese emigrants now live, there is little of the obsessional sort of politics which marks Florida's Cuban population. When relations between the US and Vietnam were normalised in 1995, there was no explosion in California's Little Saigon of the kind which would break out in Florida's Little Havana under comparable circumstances in US-Cuba relations. Nevertheless, the Vietnam war has played a subtle role in the 2000 election. Senator John McCain's unsuccessful run for the Republican nomination focused on his war record as a five-year prisoner in the so-called \"Hanoi Hilton\". But while banners proclaiming him an American hero won MrMcCain support among Republicans, his magnanimity about Vietnam attracted independents and Democrats who had opposed the war. Vietnam is certainly not a resolved issue for all Americans. When a Vietnamese-American shopkeeper put up a poster of Ho Chi Minh in his Los Angeles video store last year, it provoked nightly demonstrations from refugees and war veterans until he took it down. And when a group in New Jersey founded what is still the only Vietnam war museum in the country in 1998, they outraged war veterans by planning a section on the anti-war movement. When the museum opened, there were no pictures of Jane Fonda, all references to US soldiers taking drugs had been removed and a video about anti-war protest was replaced with one of soldiers' stories. Each year in late May, when Memorial Day celebrations take place in Washington, the city fills with thousands of ageing men in leather riding Harley Davidsons up and down the avenues, ostensibly as part of a campaign to bring justice and \"closure\" for families of the 2,000 US service personnel still listed as \"missing in action\" in south-east Asia, 1,500 of them in Vietnam. The \"MIA\" issue casts a long shadow over US politics and public life. Last month, when William Cohen became the first US defence secretary to visit Vietnam since Melvyn Laird during the Nixon era, the public relations centrepiece of his visit was a trip to a rice field 20 miles west of Hanoi. There an American team and more than 200 Vietnamese villagers were digging through a wartime crater for evidence that a plane shot down in May 1967 was piloted by one of the MIAs, Commander Richard Rich. Senator John McCain returned to Vietnam for his eighth post-war visit this week and made the obligatory trip to the same rice field where the \"Operation Full Accounting\" unit is still at work. In American universities, the subject which fired a generation - including many of today's college professors - has largely dropped off the curriculum. \"This new generation of students is as likely to take a course on the Peloponnesian war as the Vietnam war,\" says Allan Goodman, a former Georgetown University professor. Other teachers say their students have only the vaguest knowledge of the events of the war, and understand far less about the issues involved than they do about the second world war. As the Vietnam era slips further into the past a new iconoclasm is emerging, exemplified in Michael Lind's 1999 book Vietnam: The Necessary War. The writer, whose previous book was a critique of American conservatism, argued that the \"hawks\" who lost the war had nevertheless been right to believe that they had to fight international communism. \"What's interesting to me is how little is happening any more to learn the lessons of Vietnam,\" says analyst Richard Haass of the Brookings institution. \"I don't think there are any very clear lessons being drawn any longer about whether and when the United States is likely to get involved militarily around the world.",

Foreign investment creates five times fewer jobs in Vietnam than in China for the same sum of money \"A Chinese farmer who earns several times more than his Vietnamese counterpart pays half the price for a motorbike,\" said a government statistician, Dao Ngoc Lam. This month Honda Vietnam pledged to lower its prices, admitting that it is under severe presure from Chinese competition It is an appropriate example in a capital city where hundreds of scooters swarm like fireflies around the historic Hoan Kiem lake, as Vietnam's emerging middle class has more money to spend. But although veteran residents lament the quickening pace of life, Hanoi is still an oasis of calm compared to other major Asian cities, including Saigon, which has become as brash and noisy as it was before the 1975 \"liberation\". \"We were saved by the Asian economic crisis,\" said a local conservationist. \"It has given the government time to realise the tourist potential of the French colonial architecture and to start preserving the streets of the old town.\" It has also strengthened the arguments within the ruling elite of the Vietnamese Communist party against a headlong rush into the world market. The semi-official Vietnam Economic Review this month refers openly to a \"lack of consensus in public opinion\". Even World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials now say that Vietnam is right to take its time implementing the market reforms which they pressed upon Hanoi a few years ago. \"We now understand that poverty must come first in a country where 80% still live on the land,\" said an aid programme manager. \"Foreign investors may be agitated by the slow pace of reform, but Vietnam is one of the best performers at poverty reduction in the developing world.\" A recent assessment by the World Bank and the British Department for International Development claimed a \"striking change for the better\".

The last time these greying men sat down at the Rendezvous cafe's white plastic tables they were carrying rifles in the service of their country. Some had been stationed near the small town of Hue, the ancient capital that sits midway on Vietnam's long coastline. Now they were back as part of a project to exorcise the ghosts that have haunted them since the war, and to build better relations between the two countries. Horrific flashbacks and addictions to alcohol and cigarettes have left Mike Farquhar looking older than his 49 years. A few years ago he could not have made this trip but, with his wife's encouragement, he boarded the plane in Idaho. \"Coming here this time was a whole heap better than the first time I landed in Vietnam.

He makes two visits a year with about 17 veterans who each pay $1,675 (\u00a31,000) to cover the costs of the trip. He tries to keep the veterans occupied from dawn every morning so that they don't have a chance to become depressed. \"I try to get them to face their own dragons,\" he said. He has had problems with a few who have begun drinking heavily immediately on arrival, but all have ended up benefiting from the trip. The next day the latest group of veterans was to take part in an exercise Mr Bacak learned from Native American tribes. Each veteran would be asked to write a letter to anyone he chose, alive or dead, reflecting on his feelings about the war. At night on a hillside near Duc Pho, south of Hue, the men were to be led one by one to a bonfire and left alone to read their letters aloud, weep, and then watch them disintegrate in the flames. An even bigger test for the veterans would be the face-to-face encounter on the hillside with a group of their North Vietnamese and Viet Cong counterparts. \"This is the part that has been tearing my guts out,\" Mike Farquhar said. \"I just don't know if I can go through with it.

Through Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, there are plans for 15 dams along the Mekong that could disrupt several million. </p> <p>Most staggering of all is China's Three Gorges dam across the Yangtse River. Due for completion in 2009, the dam will stretch for 2.3 kilometres, stand more than 180 metres high and, with its 26 turbines, generate the energy of nearly 20 nuclear power stations.

In northwest India, the Sardar Sarovar dam will displace hundreds of thousands from their homes in the Narmada river valley. Through Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, there are plans for 15 dams along the Mekong that could disrupt several million. Most staggering of all is China's Three Gorges dam across the Yangtse River. Due for completion in 2009, the dam will stretch for 2.3 kilometres, stand more than 180 metres high and, with its 26 turbines, generate the energy of nearly 20 nuclear power stations. It will be the world's largest dam and will hold back a reservoir 600km long and more than a kilometre wide.

You are more likely to win the national lottery every week for a year than come up with the same strand of DNA as Cypher. </p> <p>A second piece of sophisticated software then identifies two areas about 20 molecules long at either end of the DNA strand that can act as primers or \"locks\".

Sometimes phosphorescent beads, only two microns in size, are attached to the DNA strands, which if viewed through a UV microscope announce the tag's presence. Only a very small amount of the tag is needed. A thimble full can mark 1,000 tonnes of oil. Only a trace amount of DNA has to be collected when Cypher comes to test an item. Just as in our bodies DNA can copy itself over and over to make new cells, that same enzymatic process can generate thousands of copies of Cypher's DNA - if you have the right key to start the process. </p> <p>When the locks and keys bind, a dye is released, signalling that the process is working. There's usually no need to sequence the DNA molecule by molecule. Looking up the key sequence in the database will find out what the rest should be and to whom the item it was taken from belongs. </p> <p>DNA tags provide a powerful tool to combat parallel trading - when a distributor in a country where goods are cheap imports more than he needs, then passes the goods on to a more expensive country, to sell at a slightly higher price and pocket the difference. </p> <p>\"It's not illegal,\" says a spokesperson for UK Fashion Exports, \"but it's a huge headache for brand manufacturers.\" For example, in Portugal a CD costs about \u00a39, but in the UK \u00a315. There's nothing to stop a Portuguese distributor selling CDs in the UK for \u00a312. </p> <p>Cypher Science has a run ning contract with a big perfumery in France. The company has 250 distributors, each allocated its own unique tag. </p> <p>\"When they get a box of perfumes they think is in the wrong market, they send us that box and we interpret the DNA to tell them which distributor it should have been,\" explains Alan Costain, chief executive at Cypher. The perfumery can then stop doing business with that distributor and find one more trustworthy. </p> <p>Due to the covert nature of tagging, companies are reluctant to admit using such a system and Cypher usually can't divulge its clients' names. \"DNA is not the only tagging system,\" says Costain, \"but in general an awful lot of goods have got security tags on. Your Barclaycard does, your bank notes do, even share certificates.\" </p> <p>Counterfeiting and the theft of personal goods are each very lucrative areas for black marketeers. \"The market for stolen antiques is second only to arms dealing and drugs running. You are talking millions and millions of pounds a year,\" says Costain. </p> <p>Another important line of work is tracking ships that dump waste oil at sea. In the recent oil spill off Brittany there were reports that other ships were surreptitiously adding to the slick, but no way of proving it. At the moment oil-tagging is done on a voluntary basis. If it were made mandatory, such polluters could be brought to justice. </p> <p>Probably the most unusual item that Cypher has been asked to mark are Beanie Babies. \"An internet auction house was concerned that with bids of up to $15,000 for one toy, people would return the Beanie Baby and tell them it was a fake,\" says Costain producing an innocent looking Beanie dog. \"We've marked this one on the right eye and the front left paw.\"</p>",

DNA tags provide a powerful tool to combat parallel trading - when a distributor in a country where goods are cheap imports more than he needs, then passes the goods on to a more expensive country, to sell at a slightly higher price and pocket the difference. \"It's not illegal,\" says a spokesperson for UK Fashion Exports, \"but it's a huge headache for brand manufacturers.\" For example, in Portugal a CD costs about \u00a39, but in the UK \u00a315. There's nothing to stop a Portuguese distributor selling CDs in the UK for \u00a312. Cypher Science has a run ning contract with a big perfumery in France. The company has 250 distributors, each allocated its own unique tag. \"When they get a box of perfumes they think is in the wrong market, they send us that box and we interpret the DNA to tell them which distributor it should have been,\" explains Alan Costain, chief executive at Cypher. The perfumery can then stop doing business with that distributor and find one more trustworthy. Due to the covert nature of tagging, companies are reluctant to admit using such a system and Cypher usually can't divulge its clients' names. \"DNA is not the only tagging system,\" says Costain, \"but in general an awful lot of goods have got security tags on. Your Barclaycard does, your bank notes do, even share certificates.\" Counterfeiting and the theft of personal goods are each very lucrative areas for black marketeers. \"The market for stolen antiques is second only to arms dealing and drugs running. You are talking millions and millions of pounds a year,\" says Costain. Another important line of work is tracking ships that dump waste oil at sea. In the recent oil spill off Brittany there were reports that other ships were surreptitiously adding to the slick, but no way of proving it. At the moment oil-tagging is done on a voluntary basis. If it were made mandatory, such polluters could be brought to justice. Probably the most unusual item that Cypher has been asked to mark are Beanie Babies. \"An internet auction house was concerned that with bids of up to $15,000 for one toy, people would return the Beanie Baby and tell them it was a fake,\" says Costain producing an innocent looking Beanie dog. \"We've marked this one on the right eye and the front left paw.\"",

It's a game, it's an integrated art installation, and it's a candidate for the Guinness Book of World Records. See http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org",

Her supermodel looks have already caught the eye of Vogue magazine which has booked her for a forthcoming issue. In many ways T-Babe looks like a typical pop star. But she is fundamentally different to the likes of Geri Halliwell and Britney Spears: she's computer-generated. T-Babe is the creation of Scotland-based Glasgow Records, which also has two real bands on its books. The company is building her a dedicated website, and is working on a pop video and her first single, scheduled to be released this summer. Before then MP3 teasers will be released to stoke up interest among the teen market. Glasgow Records' managing director Tessa Hartmann, has worked on advertising campaigns for Burger King and Diet Coke.

T-Babe is as real as any other 18 year old. She dyes her hair blonde.

Over the last few months, the site at <a href=\"http://www.glasgowrecords.com\" target=\"_new\">www.glasgowrecords.com</a> has had more than 130,000 hits.

There are plans for E-Cyas to launch a UK single at the end of this month with the slightly tongue-in-cheek title, Are You Real? It went to number 78 in the German charts but has been remixed for the UK with more of a dance feel. E-Cyas has been described as a cross between Keanu Reeves, George Michael and Ricky Martin. I-D Media is hoping to organise E-Cyas gigs in the UK where his image will be projected on to screens. If his popularity continues to grow, the company thinks he could tour Europe and eventually get his own TV show. In Germany, teenage girls have gone wild about E-Cyas (which stands for electronic cybernetic artificial superstar). \"He gets hundreds of emails a day, asking him what he eats and if it's cold in cyberspace,\" says I-D Media.

      "body": "<p><strong> Incredibly gory graphics</strong><br> <strong> Soldier of Fortune</strong><br> PC \u00a339.99 Raven/Activision **** <br> It uses a modified version of the Quake 2 graphics \"engine\" and sets you as a lone hero against the bad guys. Yes, it's another first person shooter for the PC, but Soldier of Fortune offers authenticity above and beyond the call of duty. </p> <p>For a start the plot has had more than the customary three minutes' work, mixing Kosovo, nuclear weapons and Hollywood action. Nevertheless it's the incredibly gory graphics that stand out. </p> <p>As you'd expect of a game licensed from a US gun mag there are heaps of authentic weaponry, but it's the accuracy of the onscreen damage that will bolster any anti-video game cause. You can hit someone in the arm, leg or nether regions with increasing graphic detail and the blood-spattered action rarely lets up. Crucially, though, this realism extends both ways, so taking a shot to the head means game over. </p> <p>Add this to the lack of save points, health packs and other reminders that you're only playing a game, and you can pretty much justify most of the wilder excesses. That's not to say that one less crotch wound wouldn't have been welcomed but the real-life feel is the key to this. Rather than running around blasting in a Quake style, you tend to take a more measured approach, and before long the game becomes compelling. </p> <p>Some of the levels are unimaginatively designed and the graphic violence won't be to everyone's taste (although you can tone down the visuals) but the challenge and genuine tension will appeal to Rambo fans everywhere. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Lost in the labyrinth</strong><br> <strong> Red Dog</strong><br> Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Argonaut **** <br> Trade magazine MCV has classed this as a driving game and it would make a great one: imagine up to four wheeled buggies careering through underground caverns and other 3D scenarios. </p> <p>Actually it's a sort of motorised first person shooter, which Argonaut Software's founder Jez San, referring to the company's old Nintendo hit, has called Star Fox in a Tank, according to <a href=\"http://www.segaweb.com/Previews/Dreamcast/redog.html\">Segaweb</a>. </p> <p> The action is fast, the graphics are terrific, the sound effects are great, and the techno-style music is pretty good too. But it's not for the faint-hearted. The missions last too long and the end of level bosses are vicious: the one-player mode is too hard for me unless someone finds an \"infinite lives\" cheat. </p> <p>Still, at least the programmers have foregone the bits of physics that would have your cross between a tank and a beach-buggy turned upside down most of the time. </p> <p>As well as 15 single-player missons, the game has lots of multi-player arenas with a variety of options including bomb tag, king of the hill, flag runner and death match modes. Argonaut is promising more arenas and more weapons that can be downloaded into the Dreamcast's VMU. </p> <p>But if you have nightmares about being trapped in a maze of twisty tunnels and attacked by a plague of scorpion-like aliens, this is not the game for you. (JS)</p> <p><strong> Things that go clunk in the night</strong><br> <strong> Thief II</strong><br> PC \u00a333.43 Looking Glass Studios/ Eidos Interactive *** <br> The original Thief was a deserved hit, but a flawed one. It was a first-person action adventure, but the idea was not to blast everything that moved; instead, as cheeky tea leaf Garrett, you snuck around the various levels lining your pockets and doing your best to steer clear of trouble. It was a neat twist on a dying genre, with an involving storyline and immaculately designed missions. It also had graphics not seen since Pam Ayres was last on TV. </p> <p>Thief hit the shelves only 18 months ago, so it's no surprise that the follow-up comes with broadly the same pros and cons as its progenitor. </p> <p>So, for example, it's still teeth-grindingly tough. With a total of 71 controls to commit to memory, it's a devil to get your head round in the first place and, once you have, the merest slip of coordination will bring your half-inching days to a messy end. </p> <p> What's more, given the precariousness of your trade, load times are still frustratingly long. And despite Looking Glass's claims that the visuals have been substantially improved, the character models are again deeply ropey. The first time you attract attention, you'll be choking on your own blood before you realise the hideous triangle monster that just attacked you is in fact a poorly rendered human guard. </p> <p>But as before, the point of the exercise is largely to avoid all other characters, so the low-resolution opponents don't spoil the fun too much. </p> <p>Also, the low demands on processing power mean that gameplay is extremely smooth, and the sound and lighting create a suitably suspenseful mood. Most importantly, the engaging plot and ingenious level design are every bit as good as before. There's hardly a point in the game when you feel remotely safe; even when tucked away in a shadowy corner, you worry that a -passing guard will hear your pounding heart all the way from the real world. There are also some useful new toys and dastardly new enemies, offering a genuinely different challenge to veteran players. </p> <p>Like its predecessor, then, Thief II is an interesting idea, put together with real loving care. But not an awful lot of expertise. (AB)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Incredibly gory graphics Soldier of Fortune PC \u00a339.99 Raven/Activision **** It uses a modified version of the Quake 2 graphics \"engine\" and sets you as a lone hero against the bad guys. Yes, it's another first person shooter for the PC, but Soldier of Fortune offers authenticity above and beyond the call of duty. For a start the plot has had more than the customary three minutes' work, mixing Kosovo, nuclear weapons and Hollywood action. Nevertheless it's the incredibly gory graphics that stand out. As you'd expect of a game licensed from a US gun mag there are heaps of authentic weaponry, but it's the accuracy of the onscreen damage that will bolster any anti-video game cause. You can hit someone in the arm, leg or nether regions with increasing graphic detail and the blood-spattered action rarely lets up. Crucially, though, this realism extends both ways, so taking a shot to the head means game over. Add this to the lack of save points, health packs and other reminders that you're only playing a game, and you can pretty much justify most of the wilder excesses. That's not to say that one less crotch wound wouldn't have been welcomed but the real-life feel is the key to this. Rather than running around blasting in a Quake style, you tend to take a more measured approach, and before long the game becomes compelling. Some of the levels are unimaginatively designed and the graphic violence won't be to everyone's taste (although you can tone down the visuals) but the challenge and genuine tension will appeal to Rambo fans everywhere. (GH) Lost in the labyrinth Red Dog Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Argonaut **** Trade magazine MCV has classed this as a driving game and it would make a great one: imagine up to four wheeled buggies careering through underground caverns and other 3D scenarios. Actually it's a sort of motorised first person shooter, which Argonaut Software's founder Jez San, referring to the company's old Nintendo hit, has called Star Fox in a Tank, according to Segaweb. The action is fast, the graphics are terrific, the sound effects are great, and the techno-style music is pretty good too. But it's not for the faint-hearted. The missions last too long and the end of level bosses are vicious: the one-player mode is too hard for me unless someone finds an \"infinite lives\" cheat. Still, at least the programmers have foregone the bits of physics that would have your cross between a tank and a beach-buggy turned upside down most of the time. As well as 15 single-player missons, the game has lots of multi-player arenas with a variety of options including bomb tag, king of the hill, flag runner and death match modes. Argonaut is promising more arenas and more weapons that can be downloaded into the Dreamcast's VMU. But if you have nightmares about being trapped in a maze of twisty tunnels and attacked by a plague of scorpion-like aliens, this is not the game for you. (JS) Things that go clunk in the night Thief II PC \u00a333.43 Looking Glass Studios/ Eidos Interactive *** The original Thief was a deserved hit, but a flawed one. It was a first-person action adventure, but the idea was not to blast everything that moved; instead, as cheeky tea leaf Garrett, you snuck around the various levels lining your pockets and doing your best to steer clear of trouble. It was a neat twist on a dying genre, with an involving storyline and immaculately designed missions. It also had graphics not seen since Pam Ayres was last on TV. Thief hit the shelves only 18 months ago, so it's no surprise that the follow-up comes with broadly the same pros and cons as its progenitor. So, for example, it's still teeth-grindingly tough. With a total of 71 controls to commit to memory, it's a devil to get your head round in the first place and, once you have, the merest slip of coordination will bring your half-inching days to a messy end. What's more, given the precariousness of your trade, load times are still frustratingly long. And despite Looking Glass's claims that the visuals have been substantially improved, the character models are again deeply ropey. The first time you attract attention, you'll be choking on your own blood before you realise the hideous triangle monster that just attacked you is in fact a poorly rendered human guard. But as before, the point of the exercise is largely to avoid all other characters, so the low-resolution opponents don't spoil the fun too much. Also, the low demands on processing power mean that gameplay is extremely smooth, and the sound and lighting create a suitably suspenseful mood. Most importantly, the engaging plot and ingenious level design are every bit as good as before. There's hardly a point in the game when you feel remotely safe; even when tucked away in a shadowy corner, you worry that a -passing guard will hear your pounding heart all the way from the real world. There are also some useful new toys and dastardly new enemies, offering a genuinely different challenge to veteran players. Like its predecessor, then, Thief II is an interesting idea, put together with real loving care. But not an awful lot of expertise. (AB)",

      "body": "<p>Hewlett-Packard is about to launch the sleekest, most stylish and most powerful range of palmtop computers on the market, the Jornada 540 series, running Microsoft's latest Pocket PC software. Compaq and Casio are also using the new operating system, and have new Pocket PCs on the way. The systems, announced last week, are almost certain to make a dent in Palm's dominant share of the palmtop computer market. </p> <p>However, not everyone needs the power and versatility Pocket PCs offer. Most people won't care how much more they can do, as long as the Palm does what they want. </p> <p>But it's hard to see Palm's colour machine, the IIIc, surviving the Jornada's onslaught. The Palm IIIc's screen is smaller both physically and in terms of its resolution, offering only 160 x 160 pixels compared with the Jornada's 240 x 320. Worse, the IIIc shows only 256 colours instead of the Jornada's 65,536, so images - including web pages - look crude by comparison. </p> <p>Nor does the Palm IIIc have any advantages in size or battery life, which are virtually the same, or even price. </p> <p>The main differences are that the Jornada provides more facilities (web browser, MP3 player etc), more memory (16MB or 32MB instead of 8MB), much more built-in software (16MB compared with 2MB), and much more expandability. However, the IIIc is noticeably lighter at 192g against the Jornada's 260g. </p> <p>If the HP Jornada is bad news for Palm's prospects of selling colour machines, it's not going to make life easy for its rivals, Casio and Compaq. Both plan to offer the new Pocket PC software - aka Windows CE 3.0 - in what are basically lastgeneration machines pending the arrival of new designs. Casio, for example, has announced the Cassiopeia E-115 to replace the E-105, but it's basically the same boxy-looking machine. </p> <p>Compaq has simply installed the new software in its superthin Aero systems, which have monochrome screens but display 16 shades of grey. (And if you bought an Aero 1520 or 2100 after February 24, Compaq will upgrade it free.) </p> <p>Compaq is also bringing out a new range of iPaq Pocket PC devices (pictured right) in the summer. These are remarkably quick - they have 206MHz Intel StrongARM processors - and the basic design can be expanded by fitting one of a series of Jackets. The first two will provide standard CompactFlash and PC Card slots, but later versions could provide, for example, pager or mobile phone functions. A \"boom box\" Jacket with built-in speakers could convert the iPaq into an MP3 music player thatdoesn't need headphones. </p> <p>Most Windows CE/Pocket PC computers already have a standard CompactFlash or PC/PCMCIA Card slot built in, and this highlights the Palm's greatest weakness: its poor expandability. The HP Jornada's CompactFlash comptibility meant I could use existing peripherals such as Pretec's 56K modem and Socket's $139 LP-E Ethernet card. </p> <p>Both Socket and Xircom have already demonstrated a CompactFlash Bluetooth card for \"personal area networking\" (Bluetooth replaces wires for connecting devices up to about 10m apart). You can even get CompactFlash hard drives - IBM's 170MB and 340MB Microdrives - which is a great way to exploit the Pocket PCs built-in stereo MP3 music player software. </p> <p>The original designers of the Palm Pilot tried to remedy the problem by leaving to set up a new company, Handspring, and by launching a new machine, the Visor, pictured left. This has the same easy-to-use Palm software, but different hardware. In particular, the Visor has its own Springboard expansion slot on the back. </p> <p>Handspring says a range of cartridges could be available: a pager, a modem, an MP3 music player, memory cards and game packs. Unfortunately it's not an industry standard like the CompactFlash slot used by the Pocket PC. The Handspring system - which will be launched in the UK on May 4 - means you can't simply plug in CompactFlash memory cards from your digital camera and other devices. </p> <p>Which is not to say that the Pocket PC arena is without its own compatibility problems. For example, Casio has designed a camera that fits into a CompactFlash slot but - like Sharp's earlier PC Card camera - it is expected to work only with its own systems. </p> <p>HP plans to launch the Stowaway fold-up keyboard, which is already available for Palm systems, for the Jornada range, but it won't work with rival hardware. And while Compaq says its iPaq Jackets are \"based on a new open standard technology\", the Jackets will only fit Compaq's machines. </p> <p>Further, unlike the Palm, the Pocket PC may also have software compatibility problems. Windows CE isn't just a palmtop operating system, it's used in more than 350 products including games consoles, gambling machines, vibration detectors, petrol pumps and videophones (Orange is due to release one in the UK this year). </p> <p>CE also runs on 21 different processor families including Mips, Intel x86, StrongARM and Hitachi SH chips. Indeed, the three manufacturers making Pocket PCs for retail sale use different processors, so the same executable programs won't run on more than one. While few Palm owners have any idea which chip their machine uses, Pocket PC buyers will have to know which version of each program - Mips, StrongARM or Hitachi SH3 - to download. </p> <p>This problem will eventually be solved by the release of a Common Executable Format (CEF) that will enable software houses to create one version of a program for different machines - but Microsoft hasn't announced it yet. </p> <p>Whether the Pocket PC will ultimately triumph over the Palm and its clones remains to be seen, but they are based on different views of the world. Microsoft is betting that users will want to do more and more things with their Pocket PCs: they already work as electronic organisers, MP3 players, electronic book readers, picture viewers and games machines. Soon they'll work as pagers, mobile phones, and wireless terminals, too. </p> <p>If that's what people want, Microsoft wins - though the result is a complex device, even given the vastly simplified Pocket PC user interface. </p> <p>Palm systems are much simpler, and while they don't do as much, they are very easy to use: you can be up and running within five minutes. If they do all you want to do, Palm wins - unless you want a colour screen as well, because the Palm IIIc simply isn't good enough. Putting a IIIc next to a Jornada 540 is like putting a Ford Fiesta next to an Aston Martin.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's Wednesday evening and 22 young women are piling in to the brightly-lit basement of the Cyberia Cafe in Camden, London. They gather in a red wine-warmed atmosphere to hear insights and advice from a highly successful woman internet entrepreneur, Sonia Lo. </p> <p>Their backgrounds are not necessarily technical, ranging from anthropology, set design, funds management and publishing to information technology. Yet all are part of a networking group keen to conquer - either by learning or teaching - the overwhelming fear of technology that keeps the lure and appeal of the internet at arm's length from many women. </p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.webgrrls.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Webgrrls</a>, as they are known, are in for a shock. Their male-exclusive networking meeting is about to be hijacked by an intelligent and eager young man called David (not his real name) who had wandered past the cafe and saw the sign advertising Sonia Lo's talk. He dominates the question time allowed after the talk, ignoring the glares from the women, most of whom had become silent and unwilling to ask questions in his presence. </p> <p>Was he brave? Certainly. Confident? Definitely. Asked why he did not limit his questions, David said: \"I asked interesting questions, all the women wanted to hear the answers.\" A fair response but a reason why more groups like Webgrrls are springing up across the globe. They make themselves exclusive because they desire a forum which is non-competitive and that allows ignorant questions to be asked without embarrassment. </p> <p>The common complaint is that the nurturing of ideas and learning does not happen when those of the XY chromosome are present, as women feel intimidated and inadequate. It's a reason some women have scratched First Tuesday, the most popular and successful mixed networking technology group in London, from their contact books. </p> <p>The argument for sex segregation is more commonly found in school education. However, the net has brought about a new learning age. The statistics support such a need. Only 40% of the UK's 7.8 million estimated internet users are women and one in three of the hundreds of internet firms founded each month across Britain have a female behind them. The number of women working in the top echelons of internet companies is also too few. </p> <p>May Chong, who founded the London chapter of Webgrrls last October and now has 150 members, explains the importance of women networks. \"A lot of women are hesitant to network when there are lots of men. Our mission is to support women who are interested in new media or want to support new media. We want to bring the internet to more women, including grandmothers.\" </p> <p>Webgrrls started five years ago in New York and has grown globally to 30,000 members providing courses, mentoring, lectures and job placement. There are splinter operations in Bristol, Yorkshire and Cambridge. However, it is still dwarfed by mixed groups such as First Tuesday which claims 30,000 members in the UK alone and 60,000 worldwide, with a ratio of about 80% men to 20% women. </p> <p>Chong notes a frustrating curiosity of London Webgrrls is that 90% of members are not British born - a phenomenon she can't explain except that women's networking groups often are mistaken as being about \"bra burning or being run by bunch of feminists\". </p> <p>She adds with a smile that \"quite of a lot of men are interested in coming along because it is all women\". E-women, which has a more corporate membership and title than Webgrrls, targets women already working in new media. It started in January and its membership has grown to 500. </p> <p>Lopa Patel, one of the four co-founders of e-women explains the need for \"geek girls\" clubs. \"There are fewer of us in new media in comparison to men,\" she says. \"Members of e-women voted for the forum to remain women only as they value the openness of our sessions and the different way women communicate with each other. The focus of e-women is not just about female entrepreneurs but a broad range of issues relating to new media. It's more about learning and knowledge exchange.\" </p> <p> Of clubs like First Tuesday, Patel said her experience was \"intimidation\". \"If you don't have business-to-business or Wap [wireless application protocol] in your start-up strategy then they don't want to know you.\" </p> <p>Sonia Lo, who has been a telecommunications consultant and venture capitalist, started her own business, <a href=\"http://www.eZoka.com\" target=\"_new\">eZoka.com</a>, last September. This business-to-business internet company helps reduce the fixed costs of the \"little guys\" by using its buying power to get their services and products cheaper from major suppliers. Lo believes if a woman can balance a cheque book then she is more than capable of running an internet company. </p> <p>\"Women traditionally haven't been seen to be good at numbers and they end up in marketing or human resources,\" Lo said. \"Or if a woman is chief executive, she's at the creative interface rather than operating interface.\" However, the blame is not entirely laid at a male-dominated tech industry. Lo said one of the frustrating aspects of women is they are \"self-selective\", often ruling themselves out of a job or challenge because they do not think they have the skills or competence. </p> <p>She has started a series of monthly dinners for women internet entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to exchange ideas and keep in touch with the daily changes that occur in the fast paced online world. Lo is also planning to establish a fund that invests in new media ventures run by women. </p> <p>The immediate criticism of all-women networking groups is the limitation it puts on contact with men who may provide internet start-ups with finance, important advice or contracts in the new media. If men are also sitting at the top of the employment structures in technology companies then women may also be missing career opportunities. </p> <p>Another obvious point about \"women.com\" groups is that females have to work side-by-side with men eventually, even in the new information society where virtual offices can exist. </p> <p>Julie Meyer, co-founder of First Tuesday, agrees that a male internet environment is competitive. But she adds: \"I have just as many male role models in my life as women.\" Nor is she convinced that competition is a bad thing. \"The way men and women communicate is dominated by men and they like that communication to be in a way that's meaningful to them.\" </p> <p>One of Meyer's role models is Sonia Lo. \"She's particularly impressive to me. There are a lot of women out there who can be very persuasive and so far she beats them. She out-reasons, out-logics people and she doesn't suffer fools gladly.\" </p> <p>One criticism Meyer makes about women finding it difficult to communicate at a business level with men is cosmetic. \"You tell people how seriously you take yourself by what you wear. I see a lot of women wearing very inappropriate things.\" </p> <p>However, even successful women like Lo do not find it an easy road to hoe. Lo recalls explaining eZoka's business model to a male venture capitalist who was a potential investor. One aspect of eZoka's business model, interestingly enough, is networking. \"He said to me: 'Isn't networking what bored housewives do to earn a little pin money?'\" The remark still grates. \"You have to be really thick skinned, super thick skinned.\" </p> <p>Women's networking groups are constantly addressing the difficulty in obtaining funding. At the Webgrrls meeting on Wednesday night, Sally Meecham, a former set designer, talked of the need to find investors for her business, <a href=\"http://www.traveldonkey.com\" target=\"_new\">traveldonkey.com</a>, a website that provides independent travel advice on thousands of destinations (as highlighted in Online last week). </p> <p>Meecham's story is told by thousands of internet start- ups. She borrowed \u00a315,000 from the bank and her family, and with business model in place, she now needs further capital to take the business to the next stage. The need for venture capital is not all about funding as it is also about getting on board a reputable shareholder who will give your business credibility. </p> <p>In addition to financing, another common question mulled over at women's networking meetings is balancing family life with the demands of the high tech industry that requires long hours, late nights and travel. The need for more role models in the technology field; pay inequality; questions on how to build a brand for internet businesses and also learning about new technologies such as wireless application protocol, are also issues that are discussed. </p> <p>The argument for more women to become involved in new technologies and the internet also spreads to the design and offering of women's portals. Caroline Sceats of <a href=\"http://www.fletch.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Fletcher Research</a> argues that women's websites, such as <a href=\"http://www.handbag.com\" target=\"_new\">handbag.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.charlottestreet.com\" target=\"_new\">charlottestreet.com</a>, are not that popular with women because they don't like being singled out by gender as a niche market and because the sites are generally run by men. </p> <p>Instead such sites need to offer much more compelling personalised services if they are to differentiate themselves from other glossy magazine sites like Vogue, says Sceats. \"Otherwise,\" she warns, \"women's portals will lose out to non-gender specific sites with content that individuals of both sexes want to use.\" </p> <p>Lo adds: \"I'm not a big fan of women portals. Being a Korean-American, I don't like segregation on race or gender.\" </p> <p> The anti-women's portal argument is interestingly at odds with the need for gender specific networking groups. The merits that all-women networking groups would argue for their existence is that they are helping pioneer the way for women to put their own stamp on the internet; become more visible and level the playing field. Some women's portals, it may be said, also aspire to achieve those goals. </p> <p>Despite these reasons, Meyer maintains that mixed networking groups can work for women. \"The reason networking is important is it puts people as much a possible on a level playing field. There are real opportunities for women to get out there and compete with the best.\" </p> <p><strong> Addresses</strong><br> </p> <p> Webgrrls meets at the Cyberia Cafe 39 Whitfield Street, London W1P 5RE, on the third Wednesday of the month.

Chong notes a frustrating curiosity of London Webgrrls is that 90% of members are not British born - a phenomenon she can't explain except that women's networking groups often are mistaken as being about \"bra burning or being run by bunch of feminists\". She adds with a smile that \"quite of a lot of men are interested in coming along because it is all women\". E-women, which has a more corporate membership and title than Webgrrls, targets women already working in new media. It started in January and its membership has grown to 500. Lopa Patel, one of the four co-founders of e-women explains the need for \"geek girls\" clubs. \"There are fewer of us in new media in comparison to men,\" she says. \"Members of e-women voted for the forum to remain women only as they value the openness of our sessions and the different way women communicate with each other. The focus of e-women is not just about female entrepreneurs but a broad range of issues relating to new media. It's more about learning and knowledge exchange.\" Of clubs like First Tuesday, Patel said her experience was \"intimidation\". \"If you don't have business-to-business or Wap [wireless application protocol] in your start-up strategy then they don't want to know you.\" Sonia Lo, who has been a telecommunications consultant and venture capitalist, started her own business, eZoka.com, last September. This business-to-business internet company helps reduce the fixed costs of the \"little guys\" by using its buying power to get their services and products cheaper from major suppliers. Lo believes if a woman can balance a cheque book then she is more than capable of running an internet company. \"Women traditionally haven't been seen to be good at numbers and they end up in marketing or human resources,\" Lo said. \"Or if a woman is chief executive, she's at the creative interface rather than operating interface.\" However, the blame is not entirely laid at a male-dominated tech industry. Lo said one of the frustrating aspects of women is they are \"self-selective\", often ruling themselves out of a job or challenge because they do not think they have the skills or competence. She has started a series of monthly dinners for women internet entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to exchange ideas and keep in touch with the daily changes that occur in the fast paced online world. Lo is also planning to establish a fund that invests in new media ventures run by women. The immediate criticism of all-women networking groups is the limitation it puts on contact with men who may provide internet start-ups with finance, important advice or contracts in the new media. If men are also sitting at the top of the employment structures in technology companies then women may also be missing career opportunities. Another obvious point about \"women.com\" groups is that females have to work side-by-side with men eventually, even in the new information society where virtual offices can exist. Julie Meyer, co-founder of First Tuesday, agrees that a male internet environment is competitive. But she adds: \"I have just as many male role models in my life as women.\" Nor is she convinced that competition is a bad thing. \"The way men and women communicate is dominated by men and they like that communication to be in a way that's meaningful to them.\" One of Meyer's role models is Sonia Lo. \"She's particularly impressive to me. There are a lot of women out there who can be very persuasive and so far she beats them. She out-reasons, out-logics people and she doesn't suffer fools gladly.\" One criticism Meyer makes about women finding it difficult to communicate at a business level with men is cosmetic. \"You tell people how seriously you take yourself by what you wear. I see a lot of women wearing very inappropriate things.\" However, even successful women like Lo do not find it an easy road to hoe. Lo recalls explaining eZoka's business model to a male venture capitalist who was a potential investor. One aspect of eZoka's business model, interestingly enough, is networking. \"He said to me: 'Isn't networking what bored housewives do to earn a little pin money?'\" The remark still grates. \"You have to be really thick skinned, super thick skinned.\" Women's networking groups are constantly addressing the difficulty in obtaining funding. At the Webgrrls meeting on Wednesday night, Sally Meecham, a former set designer, talked of the need to find investors for her business, traveldonkey.com, a website that provides independent travel advice on thousands of destinations (as highlighted in Online last week). Meecham's story is told by thousands of internet start- ups. She borrowed \u00a315,000 from the bank and her family, and with business model in place, she now needs further capital to take the business to the next stage. The need for venture capital is not all about funding as it is also about getting on board a reputable shareholder who will give your business credibility. In addition to financing, another common question mulled over at women's networking meetings is balancing family life with the demands of the high tech industry that requires long hours, late nights and travel. The need for more role models in the technology field; pay inequality; questions on how to build a brand for internet businesses and also learning about new technologies such as wireless application protocol, are also issues that are discussed. The argument for more women to become involved in new technologies and the internet also spreads to the design and offering of women's portals. Caroline Sceats of Fletcher Research argues that women's websites, such as handbag.com and charlottestreet.com, are not that popular with women because they don't like being singled out by gender as a niche market and because the sites are generally run by men. Instead such sites need to offer much more compelling personalised services if they are to differentiate themselves from other glossy magazine sites like Vogue, says Sceats. \"Otherwise,\" she warns, \"women's portals will lose out to non-gender specific sites with content that individuals of both sexes want to use.\" Lo adds: \"I'm not a big fan of women portals. Being a Korean-American, I don't like segregation on race or gender.\" The anti-women's portal argument is interestingly at odds with the need for gender specific networking groups. The merits that all-women networking groups would argue for their existence is that they are helping pioneer the way for women to put their own stamp on the internet; become more visible and level the playing field. Some women's portals, it may be said, also aspire to achieve those goals. Despite these reasons, Meyer maintains that mixed networking groups can work for women. \"The reason networking is important is it puts people as much a possible on a level playing field. There are real opportunities for women to get out there and compete with the best.\" Addresses Webgrrls meets at the Cyberia Cafe 39 Whitfield Street, London W1P 5RE, on the third Wednesday of the month.
