But as Manchester United prepared to take on the world, their chairman made it clear he hoped this January jaunt was a one-off.</p> <p>It is not that he regards the World Club Championship as a waste of time. Nor has he had too much sun. In 10 days United will earn millions of pounds and gain enough global exposure to sell David Beckham knickers in Riyadh.</p> <p>Yet as the treble winners limbered up for Necaxa this evening, Edwards made it clear the tournament had to find a new place in the calendar. Missing the FA Cup once, with all the accompanying flak, was more than enough.</p> <p>\"People have been saying for some time that football needs a world club championship,\" he said. \"What we need from now on is to find the right time to fit it into our calendar. If it was played again at the same time next year it would create the same problem with the FA Cup.</p> <p>\"We hope it will be played every two years as a pre-season tournament so it won't clash with international events like the World Cup and the European Championship. That would make sense.\"</p> <p>It makes sense too that Edwards believes victory here would enhance United's global reputation. He says he can feel the excitement mounting. \"It's like the heavyweight world championship unification,\" he ventured. Finally, after all the controversy, it is showtime tonight.</p> <p>Whereas Necaxa boast that they know everything about their opponents, for Sir Alex Ferguson this is more of a venture into the unknown. Such is the price of worldwide fame. What United's manager does know is that he must get off to a winning start.</p> <p>\"We watched a video last night,\" he said. \"It was difficult to tell too much but they are big and tough at the back and we saw the systems they play. This match takes a high level of importance because we need to go into the Vasco game [on Saturday] with a win. That match will be the big one.\"</p> <p>The Mexicans regard this fixture as the No1. They visited a favela yesterday to drum up local support and their constant references to the glory of Rio and the beauty of its women may earn them a few fans. \"All the Necaxa players think the women are beautiful,\" the striker Octavio Becerril said.</p> <p>Jovial and relaxed, Necaxa believe they can cause an upset. In training they have been hitting diagonal balls behind the full-backs and seem intent on playing as quickly and with as few passes as possible, on the counter-attack.</p> <p>\"The English are going to feel a lot of heat and won't be able to deal with a fast rhythm of game, which won't be a problem for us,\" explained their coach Raul Arias. \"The time is right for us and I believe we will win. We want it hot because that will help us.\"</p> <p>Ferguson has stressed the need to keep possession and conserve energy but the style will not change much. He intends to use his substitites and show the Brazilian public that even English clubs can play the beautiful game.</p> <p>\"We have become one of the most entertaining teams of the last decade,\" he said, \"and if we go out and play our normal game the people of Brazil will be impressed. We have always tried to make an impression wherever we go.\" </p> <p>United must beware Alex Aguinaga, the long-haired midfielder who makes Necaxa tick. How successfully they shackle the Ecuadorian could be decisive, particularly if Roy Keane's left knee plays up. In attack they must counter the aerial strength of Agustin Delgado.</p> <p>Arias has made it clear he fears Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole. But his players are used to triumphing against the odds. They attract only about 2,000 people to the 115,000-capacity Azteca Stadium, yet established themselves as Mexico's team of the 90s.</p> <p>Edwards intends to make United the team of 21st century, starting now. \"Last season will never be repeated,\" he said. \"To win here would be the next stage. I think this will grow into a very big tournament in years to come.\"</p>",

Yet as the treble winners limbered up for Necaxa this evening, Edwards made it clear the tournament had to find a new place in the calendar. Missing the FA Cup once, with all the accompanying flak, was more than enough. \"People have been saying for some time that football needs a world club championship,\" he said. \"What we need from now on is to find the right time to fit it into our calendar. If it was played again at the same time next year it would create the same problem with the FA Cup. \"We hope it will be played every two years as a pre-season tournament so it won't clash with international events like the World Cup and the European Championship. That would make sense.\" It makes sense too that Edwards believes victory here would enhance United's global reputation. He says he can feel the excitement mounting. \"It's like the heavyweight world championship unification,\" he ventured. Finally, after all the controversy, it is showtime tonight. Whereas Necaxa boast that they know everything about their opponents, for Sir Alex Ferguson this is more of a venture into the unknown. Such is the price of worldwide fame. What United's manager does know is that he must get off to a winning start. \"We watched a video last night,\" he said. \"It was difficult to tell too much but they are big and tough at the back and we saw the systems they play. This match takes a high level of importance because we need to go into the Vasco game [on Saturday] with a win. That match will be the big one.\" The Mexicans regard this fixture as the No1. They visited a favela yesterday to drum up local support and their constant references to the glory of Rio and the beauty of its women may earn them a few fans. \"All the Necaxa players think the women are beautiful,\" the striker Octavio Becerril said. Jovial and relaxed, Necaxa believe they can cause an upset. In training they have been hitting diagonal balls behind the full-backs and seem intent on playing as quickly and with as few passes as possible, on the counter-attack. \"The English are going to feel a lot of heat and won't be able to deal with a fast rhythm of game, which won't be a problem for us,\" explained their coach Raul Arias. \"The time is right for us and I believe we will win. We want it hot because that will help us.\" Ferguson has stressed the need to keep possession and conserve energy but the style will not change much. He intends to use his substitites and show the Brazilian public that even English clubs can play the beautiful game. \"We have become one of the most entertaining teams of the last decade,\" he said, \"and if we go out and play our normal game the people of Brazil will be impressed. We have always tried to make an impression wherever we go.\" United must beware Alex Aguinaga, the long-haired midfielder who makes Necaxa tick. How successfully they shackle the Ecuadorian could be decisive, particularly if Roy Keane's left knee plays up. In attack they must counter the aerial strength of Agustin Delgado. Arias has made it clear he fears Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole. But his players are used to triumphing against the odds. They attract only about 2,000 people to the 115,000-capacity Azteca Stadium, yet established themselves as Mexico's team of the 90s. Edwards intends to make United the team of 21st century, starting now. \"Last season will never be repeated,\" he said. \"To win here would be the next stage. I think this will grow into a very big tournament in years to come.\"",

The only consolation for England is avoiding, by one run, their lowest-ever Test match total. 1994 South Africa mark their return to the international arena by flattening England for 99 in their second innings en route to a 356-run victory at Lord's in the first Test between the countries for 29 years. 1994 England are beaten by India - and a dodgy plate of prawns that left half the team reeling with sickness - in the Madras Test, going down by an innings and 22 runs. 1995 Greg Blewett scores his second Test century in only his second Test to lead Australia to a crushing 329-run win in Perth. 1995 Shot out for a measly 89 by West Indies to lose the third Test at Edgbaston by an innings and 64 runs, with still more than half an hour to go before the scheduled lunch interval on the third day. 1996 England lose in only three days to South Africa in Cape Town, put in their place by the last-wicket pair Dave Richardson and Paul Adams in a stand of 73 in a low-scoring match. 1998 England score a massive 445 in the first innings of the one-off Test against Sri Lanka at the Oval, with Graeme Hick and John Crawley scoring centuries, but still manage to lose by 10 wickets thanks to the guile of the spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, whose 16-220 is the fifth best in Test history. 1999 New Zealand, inspired by Chris Cairns, beat England in the Oval Test by 83 runs to send England to the bottom of Wisden's world Test ratings.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For many, the mountains of West Virginia are a retreat from the pressures of metropolitan USA. Tucked away between their slopes is Hillsboro, on the surface a village barely touched by the progress of technology. A few clapboard houses are strung out alongside the general store, which sells local honey and fishing bait to the occasional visitor. Farm machinery rusts in the quiet fields.</p> <p>It seems odd, then, that the FBI should take an interest in Hillsboro. But they did after the 1995 Oklahoma bombing. The man who blew up the city federal building, Timothy McVeigh, had a fascination with The Turner Diaries, a novel about a violent Aryan uprising. It was written by the most notorious resident of Hillsboro: Dr William Pierce.</p> <p>Pierce is a former American Nazi Party officer now in his late 60s, banned from entering the UK for fear his views might incite public dis order. He lives in seclusion on a 400-acre estate on the edge of Hillsboro. From there he runs the National Alliance, regarded by many as one of the US's most dangerous far right organisations, advocating racial separatism. Its headquarters are a stark, two-storey block, covered in corrugated metal and emblazoned with an imposing runic symbol.</p> <p>Paying him a visit is an unsettling experience. On entering the building, we were left in darkness in a large hall. The door was locked behind us. After several minutes, Pierce himself appeared out of the gloom to invite us into his office. He works at his computer surrounded by a scholarly mess of books and newspapers. His burmese cat, Bradley, lounges disdainfully on the top of the monitor; Hitler's Mein Kampf sits alongside George Bernard Shaw's Man and Superman on the shelf behind.</p> <p>Pierce, a former physics professor at Oregon university, is a prolific writer. Not only is he the man behind The Turner Diaries, under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, he also writes a lengthy tract each week with his spin on the issues of the day, which he then broadcasts on shortwave radio and publishes on his website. He says he abhors multiculturalism and invariably points towards the Jewish community as being the source of America's ills, convinced they have a monopoly of power in the government and the media.</p> <p>\"They would like to be the only ones who determine what the public opinion is, and what images are presented to the public. I would like to be a little harsh with them, and they might then have some difficulty in pouring spiritual poison into our people. We are able to act as a sort of truth squad, to challenge the sort of misinformation they have been used to disseminating. I address myself to the independent thinkers, to the perceptive and intelligent public - not to the ball game fans, not to the couch potatoes. I address myself to people who are capable of entertaining an idea which did not come to them from television.\"</p> <p>He preaches a message of white separatism and the internet is playing an increasing role. It's become an invaluable tool for recruiting members to the National Alliance, now thought to number around 1,000.</p> <p>\"Probably 60% of our handling of the public is by internet, and all that has occurred within the past five years. I expect that number to grow, and anticipate that, in the next year, we will see full-screen, full-motion video on the internet. I hope we'll be able to take full advantage of that.\"</p> <p>Pierce's appearance is one of a mild-mannered ageing professor. He says he does not advocate violence and he's not vitriolic when speaking to journalists. His website is illuminating. \"Certainly, there may be bloody chaos if we resist the Jews and their collaborators,\" he writes in an essay entitled What Is a Patriot to Do? \"And we should not flinch from this. We should not focus on the fact that it will be horrible and bloody, but on the fact that it will be necessary, and because it is necessary it is good. And because it is something which should come soon, it should be looked upon as a great challenge.\" He does not consider that such words promote aggression.</p> <p>He also sells 600 different books and tapes mail order via his website. It's proved so successful that Hillsboro post office has had to be upgraded to cope with the workload. The list includes US Army manuals on the manufacture of explosives and booby traps, munitions and guerrilla warfare. But the bestseller is The Turner Diaries. Extracts from the book are published in several languages on his website.</p> <p>Although the US Government did not link it to the Oklahoma bombing, The Turner Diaries was mentioned in evidence at McVeigh's trial. He'd sent copies of the book to friends urging them to read it, and the bombing he carried out was eerily reminiscent of the fictional attack on government buildings featured in the novel.</p> <p>Pierce is unconcerned that children can easily access the book over the internet: \"It's an adventure story! Parents still have, even in this country, the right to attempt to control their children's reading habits. I suspect most parents have given up on that, though. Personally, I can't see why anything in my books should be harmful to children or to which normal healthy parents should object. I can understand those trendy, politically correct parents might object. But I believe everything I have written contains healthy ideas which should be of more benefit to children than not.\"</p> <p>America's commitment to the constitutional right to free speech means extremist material is easily available over the internet. Unless material can be proven to threaten a person directly, there are few constraints on what may be published. But with the steady rise in so-called hate crimes in the US, some civil rights organisations like the Jewish-based Anti-Defamation League are now voicing concern. Pierce, however, has nothing but scorn for them.</p> <p>\"They're very unhappy that they're unable to control the flow of ideas and information over the internet. That means that when they give ideas out which are destructive, I can point it out to the public - and when they put out false information, then I can give people the truth and a chance to check these things out for themselves.</p> <p>\"I'm a peace-loving man. I've been a teacher all my life, and I would like to continue doing things the way I'm doing them - trying to think about the really important issues which are facing us as a people today, and comment on those to help people clarify their thoughts on those matters.

      "bodyText": "For many, the mountains of West Virginia are a retreat from the pressures of metropolitan USA. Tucked away between their slopes is Hillsboro, on the surface a village barely touched by the progress of technology. A few clapboard houses are strung out alongside the general store, which sells local honey and fishing bait to the occasional visitor. Farm machinery rusts in the quiet fields. It seems odd, then, that the FBI should take an interest in Hillsboro. But they did after the 1995 Oklahoma bombing. The man who blew up the city federal building, Timothy McVeigh, had a fascination with The Turner Diaries, a novel about a violent Aryan uprising. It was written by the most notorious resident of Hillsboro: Dr William Pierce. Pierce is a former American Nazi Party officer now in his late 60s, banned from entering the UK for fear his views might incite public dis order. He lives in seclusion on a 400-acre estate on the edge of Hillsboro. From there he runs the National Alliance, regarded by many as one of the US's most dangerous far right organisations, advocating racial separatism. Its headquarters are a stark, two-storey block, covered in corrugated metal and emblazoned with an imposing runic symbol. Paying him a visit is an unsettling experience. On entering the building, we were left in darkness in a large hall. The door was locked behind us. After several minutes, Pierce himself appeared out of the gloom to invite us into his office. He works at his computer surrounded by a scholarly mess of books and newspapers. His burmese cat, Bradley, lounges disdainfully on the top of the monitor; Hitler's Mein Kampf sits alongside George Bernard Shaw's Man and Superman on the shelf behind. Pierce, a former physics professor at Oregon university, is a prolific writer. Not only is he the man behind The Turner Diaries, under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, he also writes a lengthy tract each week with his spin on the issues of the day, which he then broadcasts on shortwave radio and publishes on his website. He says he abhors multiculturalism and invariably points towards the Jewish community as being the source of America's ills, convinced they have a monopoly of power in the government and the media. \"They would like to be the only ones who determine what the public opinion is, and what images are presented to the public. I would like to be a little harsh with them, and they might then have some difficulty in pouring spiritual poison into our people. We are able to act as a sort of truth squad, to challenge the sort of misinformation they have been used to disseminating. I address myself to the independent thinkers, to the perceptive and intelligent public - not to the ball game fans, not to the couch potatoes. I address myself to people who are capable of entertaining an idea which did not come to them from television.\" He preaches a message of white separatism and the internet is playing an increasing role. It's become an invaluable tool for recruiting members to the National Alliance, now thought to number around 1,000. \"Probably 60% of our handling of the public is by internet, and all that has occurred within the past five years. I expect that number to grow, and anticipate that, in the next year, we will see full-screen, full-motion video on the internet. I hope we'll be able to take full advantage of that.\" Pierce's appearance is one of a mild-mannered ageing professor. He says he does not advocate violence and he's not vitriolic when speaking to journalists. His website is illuminating. \"Certainly, there may be bloody chaos if we resist the Jews and their collaborators,\" he writes in an essay entitled What Is a Patriot to Do? \"And we should not flinch from this. We should not focus on the fact that it will be horrible and bloody, but on the fact that it will be necessary, and because it is necessary it is good. And because it is something which should come soon, it should be looked upon as a great challenge.\" He does not consider that such words promote aggression. He also sells 600 different books and tapes mail order via his website. It's proved so successful that Hillsboro post office has had to be upgraded to cope with the workload. The list includes US Army manuals on the manufacture of explosives and booby traps, munitions and guerrilla warfare. But the bestseller is The Turner Diaries. Extracts from the book are published in several languages on his website. Although the US Government did not link it to the Oklahoma bombing, The Turner Diaries was mentioned in evidence at McVeigh's trial. He'd sent copies of the book to friends urging them to read it, and the bombing he carried out was eerily reminiscent of the fictional attack on government buildings featured in the novel. Pierce is unconcerned that children can easily access the book over the internet: \"It's an adventure story! Parents still have, even in this country, the right to attempt to control their children's reading habits. I suspect most parents have given up on that, though. Personally, I can't see why anything in my books should be harmful to children or to which normal healthy parents should object. I can understand those trendy, politically correct parents might object. But I believe everything I have written contains healthy ideas which should be of more benefit to children than not.\" America's commitment to the constitutional right to free speech means extremist material is easily available over the internet. Unless material can be proven to threaten a person directly, there are few constraints on what may be published. But with the steady rise in so-called hate crimes in the US, some civil rights organisations like the Jewish-based Anti-Defamation League are now voicing concern. Pierce, however, has nothing but scorn for them. \"They're very unhappy that they're unable to control the flow of ideas and information over the internet. That means that when they give ideas out which are destructive, I can point it out to the public - and when they put out false information, then I can give people the truth and a chance to check these things out for themselves. \"I'm a peace-loving man. I've been a teacher all my life, and I would like to continue doing things the way I'm doing them - trying to think about the really important issues which are facing us as a people today, and comment on those to help people clarify their thoughts on those matters. If the government forbids me to do this, we will address the problems we are facing by other means. And it will be a good deal less peaceful than it is now.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Helen Dunmore on her hands</strong></p> <p>From the furl and unfurl of a baby's hands to the dying person's plucking at the bedcovers, we discover the world with our hands. I wouldn't change my hands, not because they are beautiful or elegant, but because my history is packed in the cells of my hands, at least as much as it's packed into my brain. </p> <p>Like most writers, I spend a good part of each day with my hands spread over a computer keyboard. When I was about 12, I realised that, as a left-hander, I was never going to produce the model italic script demanded by my school. My handwriting was hard work and it looked it. There were always spatterings of ink and a callous on my second finger. I gave up and taught myself to type on a manual typewriter with clashing keys. Later on, a touch-typing course showed me the true pleasure of fast, automatic, rhythmic typing. While my hands flew, my mind was free to sink into thought. </p> <p>That was the first skill I really built into my fingers. I belonged to perhaps the last generation of little girls who learned to hand-stitch blouses in primary school. We cut out from cheap, vomit-coloured cotton print, provided by our teacher. We knitted ourselves jumpers, chain-stitched, blanket-stitched, feather-stitched and sewed pincushions and plimsoll bags. I was told to sew with my right hand and did so. The scissors might be the wrong way round and my progress slow, but there was something hypnotically enjoyable about it all. The needle went in and out of the grubby cotton, and I went in and out to the teacher to be shown how to finish a collar with bobble detail. </p> <p>There is an irresistible magnetism in the thought of making something with your hands, whether it's a garden, a snowman, cakes or a clay pot. I can see exactly why Virginia Woolf spent hours typesetting for The Hogarth Press. The work made a harbour after the voyages of her mind and at the end something was achieved that was simple, solid fact and didn't need reviewing. </p> <p> Women writers who have children are often asked about them as if they are nothing but an impediment, or even a shackle that prevents the writer soaring off into boundless creativity. But I think it's much more complex and fruitful than this. My hands remember the soft, kid-glove texture of a newborn baby's head as well as the chemical scour of Nappisan. They remember their struggles with heavy carrier bags and grizzling, writhing toddlers, but also the way a child's newly- washed hair brushed the fingers like feathers. My family is widely spaced, so I have been walking hand-in-hand with a child for years. Maybe theirs are the hands I'll be reaching for when my own dying hands take their turn to pluck at the bedclothes. </p> <p>Hands collaborate.

      "bodyText": "Helen Dunmore on her hands From the furl and unfurl of a baby's hands to the dying person's plucking at the bedcovers, we discover the world with our hands. I wouldn't change my hands, not because they are beautiful or elegant, but because my history is packed in the cells of my hands, at least as much as it's packed into my brain. Like most writers, I spend a good part of each day with my hands spread over a computer keyboard. When I was about 12, I realised that, as a left-hander, I was never going to produce the model italic script demanded by my school. My handwriting was hard work and it looked it. There were always spatterings of ink and a callous on my second finger. I gave up and taught myself to type on a manual typewriter with clashing keys. Later on, a touch-typing course showed me the true pleasure of fast, automatic, rhythmic typing. While my hands flew, my mind was free to sink into thought. That was the first skill I really built into my fingers. I belonged to perhaps the last generation of little girls who learned to hand-stitch blouses in primary school. We cut out from cheap, vomit-coloured cotton print, provided by our teacher. We knitted ourselves jumpers, chain-stitched, blanket-stitched, feather-stitched and sewed pincushions and plimsoll bags. I was told to sew with my right hand and did so. The scissors might be the wrong way round and my progress slow, but there was something hypnotically enjoyable about it all. The needle went in and out of the grubby cotton, and I went in and out to the teacher to be shown how to finish a collar with bobble detail. There is an irresistible magnetism in the thought of making something with your hands, whether it's a garden, a snowman, cakes or a clay pot. I can see exactly why Virginia Woolf spent hours typesetting for The Hogarth Press. The work made a harbour after the voyages of her mind and at the end something was achieved that was simple, solid fact and didn't need reviewing. Women writers who have children are often asked about them as if they are nothing but an impediment, or even a shackle that prevents the writer soaring off into boundless creativity. But I think it's much more complex and fruitful than this. My hands remember the soft, kid-glove texture of a newborn baby's head as well as the chemical scour of Nappisan. They remember their struggles with heavy carrier bags and grizzling, writhing toddlers, but also the way a child's newly- washed hair brushed the fingers like feathers. My family is widely spaced, so I have been walking hand-in-hand with a child for years. Maybe theirs are the hands I'll be reaching for when my own dying hands take their turn to pluck at the bedclothes. Hands collaborate. They work with each other, with other hands and with whatever they are given. They work with heat and cold, time and weather, oil and metal, seeds and sunlight. In spite of broken nails, I prefer to garden without gloves. Bare hands know at once whether the soil is cold and clodded and will rot anything planted today, or whether it has the warm, crumbly, receptive texture that means everything will grow.

Vladimir Putin, the prime minister and acting president who has been hand-picked by the Kremlin to succeed Mr Yeltsin, admitted that his chances of securing the highest office in Russia had been boosted immeasurably by Mr Yeltsin's dramatic New Year's Eve resignation. As details emerged yesterday of the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring in the weeks leading up to last Friday's coup de th\u00e9tre, it appeared the triumph of Mr Putin's allies in parliamentary elections a week before Christmas had been the key factor that persuaded Mr Yeltsin to go. The election has to take place within 90 days of Mr Yeltsin's resignation, meaning that March 26, the poll date set, was the last possible Sunday for the ballot, confounding speculation earlier this week that Mr Putin was determined to call the election even earlier in order to quickly capitalise on his present popularity.

Moscow newspapers with good Kremlin connections reported that Mr Yeltsin told Mr Putin of his decision to resign on December 22, two days after the magnitude of Mr Putin's allies' strong performance in the elections to the Duma, or lower house, became clear.

      "bodyText": "BBC1 recorded its lowest ever performance for the second year running in 1999, according to figures released yesterday which showed that the first year of digital broadcasting hit audiences for all the main channels. The flagship channel's poor showing comes at a crucial time for the corporation. The government is deciding the future of its funding in the light of a critical select committee report and as the new BBC director-general, Greg Dyke, takes over next month. A six-month review of the channel has already been completed after some dismal ratings last year. Of the main channels, only Channel 5 increased its overall audience last year, while Channel 4 maintained its share. But in the clearest indication yet that moving News at Ten has worked for ITV, executives claimed victory in the battle to increase audiences between 7pm and 10.30pm. They missed their targets by just 0.2%. The BBC was hardest hit. BBC1, which has an annual budget in excess of \u00a3700m, again lost more viewers than any other channel, as its share fell to 28.3% of total viewing. Added to BBC1's drop, a fall in BBC2's share from 11.3% to 10.8% meant the BBC's slice of all television viewing has dropped under the 40% barrier, considered significant to the corporation's claim on the licence fee.

The incident came about after a heated exchange in Ida's Seaside Diner over the amount of chips you get with a Spam Fritter Super Meal.\"</p> <p>c) Ferguson Rio Farce: \"Ferguson's delight [over recent Premiership results] turned to disbelief when he saw the dreadful state of the Maracana... the ground is little better than a building site... frantic rebuilding work will prevent his side training more than once at the ground... that has upset Ferguson.\"</p> <p>Congratulations if you picked a or b, because you have a very fertile imagination. However, article c - by Martin Samuel in Tuesday's Express - is in fact the one which caused Fergie's anger, as the United manager hadn't even been to the stadium at the time of the report.</p> <p>Ferguson didn't want to have to defend a gaffe he didn't make, especially as his team are said to have already made an extremely poor impression on their Brazilian hosts - United have been described as \"miserable\", \"overwrought with paranoia\", \"snobbish\" and \"arrogant\".

Once dodgy Diego has recovered (docs expect him to head home in a few days) England fans will be hoping the cops clap the handcuffs of God on him for his druggy doings.</p> <p>Local police chief Maximo Costa Rocha said that Maradona had failed a urine test upon his entry into the swanky Cantegril Hospital yesterday. \"This positive sample is due to an excessive consumption of cocaine. We will interview him when the medical authorities think it is convenient and when it suits everyone.\" The Fiver says - get him now while he's down!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I have had him around my home when things haven't been going well to give him a few words of support.\" - Deadly Doug Ellis on his close relationship with John Gregory. \"Mince pie, John?\" \"Mmm, yes please, Doug.\"</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WE ALL NEED A GOAL IN LIFE</strong></p> <p>In this new 21st Millennium, everybody has wished for something.

But would anyone give poor Lonely Nicolas Anelka a goal?</p> <p>Yes they would, and Nic's first competitive strike for Real Madrid duly arrived last night against the mighty Al-Nassr in Sao Paulo. A glorious effort it was too, the ball spooning off a defender's shin before looping over Al keeper Al Shokia (and believe us, he played a Shokia too), spinning into the net and instantly turning red with embarrassment. In fact, if it wasn't all arranged by Nic's ghostly pals, then the Fiver's a headless horseman.</p> <p>Not that the Spanish press were bothered. \"Anelka showed that he can be an important player for Real in the future,\" wrote Juan Ruiz, columnist for Madrid-based sports daily Marca. \"Anelka's luck has changed for the better. It's a new year and there's new hope for him,\" he went on, as if the words 'slight' and 'distortion' had never been invented. However the Real Madrid website remains eerily quiet regarding the event, its front page carrying just one, English phrase. \"Ready for discharge!\" it says.</p> <p>Watch Anelka's goal in glorious blurry Quicktime <a href=\"http://marca.recoletos.es/00/01/05/gol_anelka.html\">here</a>.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Chelsea are said to be interested in Roma playmaker Francesco Totti.

      "bodyText": "AND NOW, FROM RIO, IT'S THE QUIZ OF THE WEEK Which of the three following reports sent Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson into a flat spin, causing him to brand a British journalist a \"liar\" and subsequently brush past the errant hack in a testy manner as he left a stormy press conference? a) Ferguson Paris Nightmare: \"Ferguson accidentally locked the wheels of his British Leyland Maestro whilst going round a roundabout near the Champs Elysees and knocked over the Eiffel Tower.\" b) Ferguson Bognor Regis Lunacy: \"Ferguson has been arrested after upending a table in a local caff. The incident came about after a heated exchange in Ida's Seaside Diner over the amount of chips you get with a Spam Fritter Super Meal.\" c) Ferguson Rio Farce: \"Ferguson's delight [over recent Premiership results] turned to disbelief when he saw the dreadful state of the Maracana... the ground is little better than a building site... frantic rebuilding work will prevent his side training more than once at the ground... that has upset Ferguson.\" Congratulations if you picked a or b, because you have a very fertile imagination. However, article c - by Martin Samuel in Tuesday's Express - is in fact the one which caused Fergie's anger, as the United manager hadn't even been to the stadium at the time of the report. Ferguson didn't want to have to defend a gaffe he didn't make, especially as his team are said to have already made an extremely poor impression on their Brazilian hosts - United have been described as \"miserable\", \"overwrought with paranoia\", \"snobbish\" and \"arrogant\". And who tells us this? Why, Martin Samuel in today's Express, of course. * * * * * * * * * * * * * COKE IT IS Argentinian legend Diego Maradona woke up in his hospital bed to find his reputation in tatters this morning after police claimed his heart problems were the result of a cocaine overdose. Actually, hang on, this is Maradona we're talking about, let's try that again. It was just another morning for stumpy Argie cheat Diego Maradona today after an alleged cocaine binge up left him sweating for his life in a Uruguayan intensive care unit. Once dodgy Diego has recovered (docs expect him to head home in a few days) England fans will be hoping the cops clap the handcuffs of God on him for his druggy doings. Local police chief Maximo Costa Rocha said that Maradona had failed a urine test upon his entry into the swanky Cantegril Hospital yesterday. \"This positive sample is due to an excessive consumption of cocaine. We will interview him when the medical authorities think it is convenient and when it suits everyone.\" The Fiver says - get him now while he's down! * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I have had him around my home when things haven't been going well to give him a few words of support.\" - Deadly Doug Ellis on his close relationship with John Gregory. \"Mince pie, John?\" \"Mmm, yes please, Doug.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * WE ALL NEED A GOAL IN LIFE In this new 21st Millennium, everybody has wished for something. For Francis Jeffers it was an altercation in Liverpool city centre. He got it. For Darren Anderton it was an excuse to leave Spurs. He got it. For Paul Gascoigne it was a sit down. He got that too. But would anyone give poor Lonely Nicolas Anelka a goal? Yes they would, and Nic's first competitive strike for Real Madrid duly arrived last night against the mighty Al-Nassr in Sao Paulo. A glorious effort it was too, the ball spooning off a defender's shin before looping over Al keeper Al Shokia (and believe us, he played a Shokia too), spinning into the net and instantly turning red with embarrassment. In fact, if it wasn't all arranged by Nic's ghostly pals, then the Fiver's a headless horseman. Not that the Spanish press were bothered. \"Anelka showed that he can be an important player for Real in the future,\" wrote Juan Ruiz, columnist for Madrid-based sports daily Marca. \"Anelka's luck has changed for the better. It's a new year and there's new hope for him,\" he went on, as if the words 'slight' and 'distortion' had never been invented. However the Real Madrid website remains eerily quiet regarding the event, its front page carrying just one, English phrase. \"Ready for discharge!\" it says. Watch Anelka's goal in glorious blurry Quicktime here. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea are said to be interested in Roma playmaker Francesco Totti. He would cost upwards of \u00a315m. Liverpool have bid \u00a36.5m bid for Barcelona left-back Sergi. They are also likely to sign Norwegian under-21 goalkeeper Espen Johnsen for \u00a3600,000. Sunderland are to make a \u00a31m move for 21-year-old Argentinian striker Emanuel Ruiz. Sheffield Wednesday want Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Mark Crossley - they are prepared to swap Pavel Srnicek or Kevin Pressman plus cash. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Rivaldo has resolved his differences with Barcelona coach Louis van Gaal. The Brazilian had refused to play on the left side of the attack, but after being dropped for two games has decided to back down. \"I've decided to play as the coach wants me to. I've always thought I play better in the centre of midfield but I have to respect the coach's decision,\" Rivaldo said. \"I wasn't expecting this so soon,\" responded van Gaal, \"but this news leaves me very happy.\" Peter Davenport is the new manager of Macclesfield following Sammy McIlroy's appointment as boss of Northern Ireland. Jackie McNamara is ready to commit his long-term future to Celtic and will sign a four-and-a-half year deal to remain at Parkhead. Charlton defender Eddie Youds has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury. Notts County want to secure the services of on-loan Stockport striker Brett Angell for \u00a3100,000. Aberdeen midfielder Andy Dow has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract at Pittodrie. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO BBC1: Match Of The Day (8pm) Manchester United v Necaxa.

Both sides claim to be inflicting heavy losses while suffering relatively light casualties. Former president Boris Yeltsin remains confident. Speaking on a trip to Jerusalem, he said: \"Two more months and then we will plant our Russian flag in Chechnya.\" His remarks echoed earlier predictions by senior Russian generals. But the generals also said they would take Grozny itself within days, yet have made little progress against about 2,000 rebel fighters holed up in the besieged city. Russia's envoy to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said that seizing Grozny, where between 10,000 and 40,000 civilians remained trapped with little food or firewood, has turned out to be much harder than expected. He said generals were right to go slowly, to keep Russian military losses to a minimum in the face of what he called \"fierce resistance from the doomed\". Achieving a victory in Chechnya before 26 March, the date of the next presidential election, would greatly boost the chances of Mr Yeltsin's chosen heir, Vladimir Putin, of winning the vote decisively. Mr Putin's current popularity has been earned on the back of pledges to crush Chechen rebels without sacrificing too many Russian lives. Russian news agencies report that troops are slowly clawing their way towards the centre of Grozny. The Chechen rebels' kavkaz.org site dismissed these claims as \"Kremlin propaganda\", saying that Russian troops remained stuck 4.5 miles from the city centre, roughly at the same positions from where they launched their first attacks two weeks ago. It said a Russian armoured column had left Grozny for the village of Alkhan-Yurt to the west which rebels recaptured on Monday. Vladimir Shamanov, the Russian eastern front commander, said on television that the situation was further complicated by thick fog which covered the mountains and prevented effective action by aircraft, Russia's main trump card in the campaign.",

      "bodyText": "Health ministers have ordered a rapid acceleration of the NHS modernisation programme after Tony Blair admitted sharing public frustration at the lack of tangible results in the first 30 months of Labour's administration. Officials have been told to give priority to a shake-up of arrangements for out-of-hours cover for family doctors, following survey findings that one in five people taken acutely ill at night has to wait more than two hours for a home visit. Doctors will be offered the option of having all their out-of-hours calls dealt with by NHS Direct, the new and highly popular telephone advice line, where nurses will decide whether a home visit is necessary. John Denham, health minister overseeing the programme, has also instructed officials to press on with opening more walk-in centres - where people can get basic NHS care and advice without going to their GP - and to develop more schemes where demarcations between health professionals are broken down and rule books torn up. Doctors' leaders last night offered only muted criticism of the plans, indicating a growing readiness to accept the direction of government policy and a wariness of continuing to be typecast as dinosaur-like in resisting change. John Chisholm, who chairs the GPs' committee of the British Medical Association, said: \"We are going to see an increasing variety of models of care in the future and we have to defend the common values that the models have, while nonetheless accepting that people will want to access the NHS in different ways. \"We don't for a minute imagine that the traditional practice - the Dr Finlay and Dr Cameron model - will be the only way of working.\" Health ministers argue that radical change is going on apace in the health service, but that much of it is invisible to the average patient.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Mark Kermode:</strong> The films you make, even though they are live action, owe an enormous debt to animation, in the physicality of them. Do you think that there is a very specific Burton-esque manner of behaving, or is it just the critics' imagination?</p> <p><strong>Tim Burton:</strong> Spastic - that's my own personal behaviour [Laughter]. I love movement, and we considered Sleepy Hollow as a silent movie when we were thinking and talking about it and in the old monster movies as well there's something about movement that's just part of character and I think that comes from animation as well. Every aspect of the film from the look and the movement is important to the character of the piece.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> It's been said that the story of Sleepy Hollow is incredibly well known, but you describe Sleepy Hollow as a story that everyone thinks they've read but nobody has. Tell us about the relationship between the story and the film.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I think in America, which is a relatively new country, there's not the wealth of stories, folk tales and fairy tales that there are in other countries so I think we were told that story in school because it was one of the only early American folk tales and that's why I was drawn to it. I remembered the story, but I talked to a lot of people who thought they knew the story, and I think it is the power of that image and the setting. I probably remember it more from the Disney cartoon actually. They did two different shorts Sleepy Hollow which was 20 minutes and Wind in the Willows a Mr Toad cartoon which they put together as a short feature. It's sung by Bing Crosby - which we kept out of our version.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> There's also an homage to Hammer films. You grew up in Burbank overlooking the studio. What was it - as an American - that you liked about Hammer films?</p> <p>MB: It's like your first introduction to sex and the lurid beauty of the horror movie. In the early Universal films [] the look and the feel of it was very important to the mood. The dark and lurid colours, the sexiness of it and the strength of them going for it in the way a good folk tale would was always very powerful they [Hammer] brought that back which had been missing for a while. Those films where the images speak to you, I've seen Black Sunday probably 20 times and I still can't remember the story but the images stay with you forever. That's the kind of film that really speaks to me.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> You've said in Burton on Burton that you didn't understand why people got antsy about a film not being narrative because for you the primary cinematic experience was Expressionist, it was to do with remembered images, and I think you described the design as the look inside someone's head. Do you think your films are visual films not narrative films?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> In a simplistic way. It's meant as a compliment but it's a weird criticism to say the films just look good which is strange because I wouldn't know how to make a good-looking film; you don't enter into it that way. The place and the mood and the feel of it is very important, it's treated as another character in the piece and it's very nice when you're able to look at an image and goes inside as opposed to just thinking about it. Those are the films that stay with me.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> In the film it's upstate New York, but you shot Sleepy Hollow in England didn't you? I imagined like Hammer most of it was sound-stage but you built the village for outside, so how did you blend the two things together?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> We tried to make the stage look as real as possible and the stuff out in the location as fake as possible so that it would intermingle and match and we pumped smoke into everything and masked it that way. But I worked here 10 years before on Batman so I had the opportunity to work with the same artists. I really enjoy working here because working away from Hollywood you're able to focus more on the movie and there is a lot of good energy coming from the crew and the cast and the artists. People paint beautiful skies and paint the buildings with beautiful texture and make beautiful props and it's a real good energy.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Do you sketch the thing out and then go to your art designer and say, \"This is what it's going to be\"</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Not really because my sketches are really crude, it would end up looking like a Charlie Brown Special if they were literally used that way. I've been lucky to work with people who sort of get the idea. I just show a rough sketch or talk about it and it goes through several layers before coming real. I try to rely even less on storyboards because I find people sometimes take them too literally, and with these technical films with all these great actors you don't want to completely follow a drawing from shot to shot.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> The thing I remember about Batman is helicopters flying over the set to take pictures and it was this terrible media circus. You seem to have avoided that this time - you assembled your cast and got on with your work.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> That's the way it should be, to get all that other stuff out of the way and just focus on what you're doing.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> What was it about the British actors that made you choose them?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> They're just great, there's just a difference. One of the first scenes we shot is when Ichabod opens the door and there they all are in the room and it actually felt that way with all these great people, it was scary. You open up the door and it's \"Wooah, shall I shut it or go away, I don't know!\" (Laughter). There's just a sense of craft and artistry and you learn a lot from these people. It's a different vibe then in America where people get more caught up in the business side of it. Here you just feel the people really acting and it's really enjoyable to watch.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> You have this reputation of being an outsider: you don't live in Hollywood anymore do you?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Yes, sort of.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> You came up through the Hollywood system, you worked at Disney, you did Batman and people are wont to say that your films are about outsiders. In the case of Sleepy Hollow you've brought Ichabod in from outside - in the original story he's from the town itself. Do you see yourself as that outside loner, that misunderstood person, or are you part of the system?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I always felt that Hollywood has a way of making you feel outside. I don't feel a part of it although I do feel lucky to have done the things that I have done through that system. I look back on it and I can't quite figure it out myself, maybe I just confused them so much that they have just given me some money to go away - I don't know! But I've been lucky.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> What's your relationship like with Disney now?

      "bodyText": "Mark Kermode: The films you make, even though they are live action, owe an enormous debt to animation, in the physicality of them. Do you think that there is a very specific Burton-esque manner of behaving, or is it just the critics' imagination? Tim Burton: Spastic - that's my own personal behaviour [Laughter]. I love movement, and we considered Sleepy Hollow as a silent movie when we were thinking and talking about it and in the old monster movies as well there's something about movement that's just part of character and I think that comes from animation as well. Every aspect of the film from the look and the movement is important to the character of the piece. MK: It's been said that the story of Sleepy Hollow is incredibly well known, but you describe Sleepy Hollow as a story that everyone thinks they've read but nobody has. Tell us about the relationship between the story and the film. TB: I think in America, which is a relatively new country, there's not the wealth of stories, folk tales and fairy tales that there are in other countries so I think we were told that story in school because it was one of the only early American folk tales and that's why I was drawn to it. I remembered the story, but I talked to a lot of people who thought they knew the story, and I think it is the power of that image and the setting. I probably remember it more from the Disney cartoon actually. They did two different shorts Sleepy Hollow which was 20 minutes and Wind in the Willows a Mr Toad cartoon which they put together as a short feature. It's sung by Bing Crosby - which we kept out of our version. MK: There's also an homage to Hammer films. You grew up in Burbank overlooking the studio. What was it - as an American - that you liked about Hammer films? MB: It's like your first introduction to sex and the lurid beauty of the horror movie. In the early Universal films [] the look and the feel of it was very important to the mood. The dark and lurid colours, the sexiness of it and the strength of them going for it in the way a good folk tale would was always very powerful they [Hammer] brought that back which had been missing for a while. Those films where the images speak to you, I've seen Black Sunday probably 20 times and I still can't remember the story but the images stay with you forever. That's the kind of film that really speaks to me. MK: You've said in Burton on Burton that you didn't understand why people got antsy about a film not being narrative because for you the primary cinematic experience was Expressionist, it was to do with remembered images, and I think you described the design as the look inside someone's head. Do you think your films are visual films not narrative films? TB: In a simplistic way. It's meant as a compliment but it's a weird criticism to say the films just look good which is strange because I wouldn't know how to make a good-looking film; you don't enter into it that way. The place and the mood and the feel of it is very important, it's treated as another character in the piece and it's very nice when you're able to look at an image and goes inside as opposed to just thinking about it. Those are the films that stay with me. MK: In the film it's upstate New York, but you shot Sleepy Hollow in England didn't you? I imagined like Hammer most of it was sound-stage but you built the village for outside, so how did you blend the two things together? TB: We tried to make the stage look as real as possible and the stuff out in the location as fake as possible so that it would intermingle and match and we pumped smoke into everything and masked it that way. But I worked here 10 years before on Batman so I had the opportunity to work with the same artists. I really enjoy working here because working away from Hollywood you're able to focus more on the movie and there is a lot of good energy coming from the crew and the cast and the artists. People paint beautiful skies and paint the buildings with beautiful texture and make beautiful props and it's a real good energy. MK: Do you sketch the thing out and then go to your art designer and say, \"This is what it's going to be\" TB: Not really because my sketches are really crude, it would end up looking like a Charlie Brown Special if they were literally used that way. I've been lucky to work with people who sort of get the idea. I just show a rough sketch or talk about it and it goes through several layers before coming real. I try to rely even less on storyboards because I find people sometimes take them too literally, and with these technical films with all these great actors you don't want to completely follow a drawing from shot to shot. MK: The thing I remember about Batman is helicopters flying over the set to take pictures and it was this terrible media circus. You seem to have avoided that this time - you assembled your cast and got on with your work. TB: That's the way it should be, to get all that other stuff out of the way and just focus on what you're doing. MK: What was it about the British actors that made you choose them? TB: They're just great, there's just a difference. One of the first scenes we shot is when Ichabod opens the door and there they all are in the room and it actually felt that way with all these great people, it was scary. You open up the door and it's \"Wooah, shall I shut it or go away, I don't know!\" (Laughter). There's just a sense of craft and artistry and you learn a lot from these people. It's a different vibe then in America where people get more caught up in the business side of it. Here you just feel the people really acting and it's really enjoyable to watch. MK: You have this reputation of being an outsider: you don't live in Hollywood anymore do you? TB: Yes, sort of. MK: You came up through the Hollywood system, you worked at Disney, you did Batman and people are wont to say that your films are about outsiders. In the case of Sleepy Hollow you've brought Ichabod in from outside - in the original story he's from the town itself. Do you see yourself as that outside loner, that misunderstood person, or are you part of the system? TB: I always felt that Hollywood has a way of making you feel outside. I don't feel a part of it although I do feel lucky to have done the things that I have done through that system. I look back on it and I can't quite figure it out myself, maybe I just confused them so much that they have just given me some money to go away - I don't know! But I've been lucky. MK: What's your relationship like with Disney now? You worked on Fox and the Hounds TB: They were real happy I stopped working on Fox and the Hounds My foxes looked like road kills They were bad. I was not cut out for that style. MK: Are they now \"Yes, Tim Burton the great son of Disney\"? TB: The problem with studios is that there's such a quick turnover it's hard to know who's at what studio. They all become much more corporatised so it's hard to know who's where anymore. MK: I think your films occupy a space somewhere between animation and real life, with animated characters you treat them as real characters, and with real actors you seem to move them the same way as you would animation.

Gen de Chastelain is expected to release his report on progress towards decommissioning at the end of this month. It is due to be completed by May. \"As we move into a new century there exists an unprecedented opportunity to leave behind the failures of the past,\" the statement added. \"The [IRA] leadership will continue to play a positive role in a genuine effort to realise a just and lasting peace.\" The statement said that the Ulster Unionist party's \"attempt to set preconditions\" was not part of a political understanding of the Mitchell review of the Good Friday agreement. Appearing in this week's issue of An Phoblacht, the newspaper of Sinn Fein, the statement also referred to the controversy over the bugging of a car used by the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, and the new education minister, Martin McGuinness. It pointed to \"recent revelations surrounding British intelligence covert surveillance operations\", which, allied to al leged Royal Ulster Constabulary efforts to recruit informers, amounted to \"clear evidence\" of a continuation of the war against republicans. The IRA said: \"These activities are part of an ongoing attempt to defeat republicans and subvert the existing opportunity for the achievement of a durable peace. \"There can be no excuse for further delay in the implemen tation of those aspects of the Good Friday agreement which are the responsibility of the British government. \"Any failure on their part to rapidly implement a programme of demilitarisation can only have a negative impact on the potential for political progress and, therefore, serve the same agenda as those who continue covert surveillance operations.\"",

What was Chris Tavare's final Test average? </strong> asks Stuart MacNeill</p> <p> Tavare finished with 1755 runs in his 31 Tests, at an average of 32.50. He made two centuries - 149 v India at Delhi in 1981-82 (a draw, and the match in which Geoff Boycott became Test cricket's leading runscorer) and 109 in the victory over New Zealand at The Oval in 1983. But \"Tav\" is probably best remembered for his slow-scoring double at Old Trafford in 1981 - a match England won by 103 runs, chiefly thanks to Ian Botham's rollicking 118. Tavare followed his 69 in 287 minutes in the first innings with 78 in 423 minutes in the second. It was the slowest half-century in English first-class cricket at the time. He's probably a bit unlucky to be remembered as a slowcoach - he was under orders to be the sheet anchor in Tests, and was quite a free scorer in county cricket.</p> <p> <strong>How many cases are there of a player making his first-class debut in a Test match? When was the last example, and have any England players ever fallen into this category?</strong> asks Richard Graveling</p> <p>This happened a few times in the last century, when privately raised sides toured with some makeweight players. Three England players - CJ Coventry, BAF Grieve and JEP McMaster - thus made their first-class debuts in what later became recognised as Test matches in South Africa in 1888-89. The expansion of the Test-playing ranks to include Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe - neither of which had a widespread domestic first-class competition - means that some players have recently played Test cricket after very few first-class outings. But I believe the only player this century to make his first-class debut in a Test match was Graham Vivian, for New Zealand v India at Calcutta in 1964-65. A 19-year-old legspinner, he seems to have been selected for the tour after some impressive net performances! He continued in first-class cricket until 1979, and played five Tests in all.</p> <p> When Ben Hollioake made his Test debut against Australia in 1997, it was only his 12th first-class match, a postwar record for England. Two others came close: Lancashire's Ken Cranston made his Test debut in 1947: it was his 14th first-class match, and came less than two months after his debut. And Brian Close, in 1949, was chosen for England after less than three months and 17 matches for Yorkshire.</p> <p> <strong>Who was the last right-hander to score a Test double-century against England?</strong> asks Janet Lapin of Woking</p> <p> This questioner has probably spotted that the last eight double-centuries against England in Tests have been scored by left-handers - by Gary Kirsten (275 in 1999-2000, 210 in 1998), Sanath Jayasuriya (213 in 1998), Brian Lara (375 in 1993-94), Allan Border (200* in 1993), Vinod Kambli (224 in 1992-93), Aamir Sohail (205 in 1992) and Mark Taylor (219 in 1989). The last right-hander to reach 200 against England was Javed Miandad, who made 260 at The Oval in 1987.</p> <p><strong>When did Hansie Cronje of South Africa last score a Test century? </strong> asks Duncan Pringle</p> <p> The most recent of his six centuries came in July 1998 at Trent Bridge, when he hit 126 against England. That was his first hundred in over three years, since he made 101 against New Zealand at Auckland in March 1995. </p> <p> <strong>What was the result of the Test between England and Australia at Headingley in 1981 when Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh bet against Australia? </strong> asks Paul Dobson</p> <p> England managed to win that famous Test, by 18 runs. Lillee and Marsh laid their infamous bets when England were quoted at odds of 500-1. At the time they were 135-7 in their second innings, after following on 227 behind. All the England players had booked out of their hotel. But Ian Botham's amazing 149 not out, helped by 56 from Graham Dilley and 29 from Chris Old, took England to 356 - a lead of 129. And then Bob Willis, with 8-43, skittled Australia for 111. England were the only team to win a Test in the 20th century after following on (they also won after following on at Adelaide in 1894-95).</p> <p><strong>In the second innings of the Indians' tour match at Hobart, all 11 of Tasmania's players (including the wicketkeeper) bowled at least one over.

First, at The Oval, in 1884, when all 11 Englishmen tried their luck as Australia ran up a total of 551. England's wicketkeeper, the Hon. Alfred Lyttelton, had the best bowling figures - 4-19 with underarm lobs. It happened again in a boring draw at Faisalabad in 1979-80, as Pakistan made 382-2 in reply to Australia's 617. All 11 Aussies bowled: Greg Chappell, their captain, kept wicket while Rod Marsh bowled for the first time in Tests.

Only top-class spin, perhaps, on slow turning surfaces that would blunt the South Africans' pace attack and expose some rigid batting techniques might consistently dismiss them twice. Their forthcoming series in India should make for fascinating, and instructive, viewing. </p> <p>Yesterday's 126 is the fifth lowest total, albeit for the loss of only nine wickets, that England have ever made in this country. As they were 115 without loss after 42 overs of the first day, it means that this team lost 19 wickets for 269 runs, including the last 16 for 171, on a pitch on which South Africa, for the ninth time in 11 Tests, exceeded 400. </p> <p>Under Cronje South Africa have now gone 14 matches without defeat, winning 10 times, since England won twice in a row at home the summer before last. For an unexceptional captain Cronje is a hugely successful one, winning half and losing only 10 of his 50 Tests in charge. </p> <p>England may have lost the plot competely yesterday with an abject display of batting but, as Nasser Hussain confessed afterwards, the game was lost when the opening partnership on the first day between Mike Atherton and Mark Butcher was not converted into a challenging total. </p> <p>The captain was not prepared to point an accusing finger at any players but he was clearly upset by the way senior batsmen, most culpably Alec Stewart, had failed to carry into the match the lessons of the previous Tests. </p> <p>Indeed Stewart's ill-judged hook shot on the first evening, when England should have consolidated and carried a good day into the next, can with hindsight be seen as the cause of the collapse. </p> <p>\"It is possible we got carried away with the overcharged atmosphere,\" Hussain confessed: in other words, adrenalin from the intensity of the competition, the bowling and the crowd, and a macho response to on-field jibes. Old hands, he knows, ought to respond better than that. </p> <p>Yesterday all sense of opti mism had left Hussain's side, as if the pressure of hanging on to South Africa's coat tails had finally got too much after the disappointment of Durban. The tourists played for the most part like men who wanted it over and done with, and wickets were gifted to Lance Klusener, a man who cannot bowl a hoop down the high street at this level, to Adams and to Shaun Pollock. </p> <p>The tone was set when Butcher decided - quite why, only he knows - to drive at Pollock's third ball of the morning as it passed by at least 18in outside his off stump, to be caught at the wicket. Neither Hussain nor the coach Duncan Fletcher will countenance this sort of batting beyond this series. Unless redemption appears in the last match, which starts tomorrow week at Centurion, next summer's series may well start with a new opener. </p> <p>Hussain counterpunched by hooking Donald thrillingly for six but then, on 16, suffered a bizarre lbw decision from the Sri Lankan umpire B C Cooray when he edged a ball of full length from Klusener along the ground through the slips without a hint of pad. Under the circumstances his response was a model of restraint. </p> <p>It was not a good day for Cooray, England benefiting when Hussain might have been lbw to Pollock and both Atherton and later Chris Adams given not out when they hit bat-pad catches to silly point. </p> <p>Atherton indulged in a heated exchange with Daryll Cullinan and went on to top- score with 35, sticking it out until after lunch before he was caught at slip off Pollock's lifter. By then Michael Vaughan had slashed at Klusener to be caught behind. </p> <p>Stewart was tied up in knots by the spin of Adams and eventually played all round a low full toss to be bowled leg stump. </p> <p>Chris Adams had already embarked on a typical block-bash innings, taking hits to the body from Allan Donald but pummelling anything full or wide through the off. He and Andy Caddick added 39 for the sixth wicket, the highest stand of the innings, before Caddick drove Donald to square cover. Adams then dismissed Adams for 31, pretty much as he had Stewart, and he and Kallis then cleared up. Simple.</p>",

This arrived in June, demanding payment of \u00a3626.88. </p> <p>Lakeman rang to query this extravagant sum but no one seemed able to enlighten her. Then her husband wrote, pointing out that no meter readings were quoted on the paperwork, unlike the April bill which had quoted the correct number of units. The following month Lakeman wrote to ask why this letter had not been replied to. The result, four days later, was a disconnection notice. Once again Lakeman rang and was assured a hold would be put on the account while the queries were resolved. </p> <p>Nothing more happened until September when a new bill for \u00a3681 arrived. Lakeman was advised to ignore it because her account was still on hold, pending an investigation. Only someone had forgotten to tell the British Gas billing department because two weeks later she was rung to be told she was in the process of being disconnected and no \"hold\" had ever been agreed. The couple are mystified as to how a \u00a3355 credit can turn into a \u00a3626 deficit in less than two months. </p> <p>\u0095 According to British Gas, it's all Transco's fault for installing a new meter at the house and passing on incorrect details. \"The replacement meter was imperial and the information on our database was metric,\" says a spokeswoman.

Alas, by the time he returned to London Stansted, he was to find himself \u00a3470 poorer. His train to Rome airport arrived 20 minutes late. He hastily checked in and was told to go straight to the departure gate but, he says, at this stage he was not given back his flight coupon with the rest of the documents. When he reached the departure lounge he was told he could not board the plane without this document, so raced back to the check-in desk with his luggage to retrieve it. </p> <p>Check-in staff claimed they had no idea where it was, so it was back to the gate where he was again refused entry and advised to book himself on to an Alitalia flight to London which was leaving shortly. In desperation he hared back to check-in and spent nearly \u00a3400 on a new ticket. By the time he reached the departure gate for the Alitalia flight an announcement was made on the tannoy, saying the KLM coupon had been found and advising him to return to the KLM gate. But after four different dashes across the airport with his bags, he was exhausted and Alitalia staff retrieved it on his behalf. \"I should have taken the coupon with me in the first place,\" he admits, \"but when I returned, with time to spare, they said it wasn't there when it was.\" </p> <p>Murray received a letter from KLM saying the airline was unable to provide a full explanation, but admitting: \"It does appear that in one way or another we have let you down and failed to provide the standard of service you would normally expect from a responsible scheduled airline.\" He was offered a free return ticket valid on any scheduled flights, minus the cost of airport tax. Murray, however, would prefer to get back the \u00a3400. </p> <p> \u0095Consumer's efforts failed to move the airline which appears to have forgotten its admission of irresponsible service. \"Once issued with a coupon it's the passenger's responsibility to produce it on demand,\" says a spokeswoman.</p> <p><strong> Rude mechanicals</strong><br> Over the last year we have received a number of complaints from readers whose washing machines are insured by National Homecare Ltd but have had wait months for attention.

Hughes won in 1999 with Birthday Letters and 1998 with Tales From Ovid, while Heaney won the year before that with The Spirit Level. </p> <p>Tremain, whose absence from the Booker Prize shortlist last year raised eyebrows, took the Whitbread Novel Award for her book Music And Silence, beating 104 other entries. </p> <p>The First Novel Award went to Lott's White City Blue - a look at end-of-the-Millennium laddishness. </p> <p>Cairns' book Berlioz Volume II: Servitude And Greatness, his work on the great 19th-century composer, took the Biography Award. </p> <p>There will be a fifth entrant for the overall title when the winner of the Whitbread Children's Book Of The Year prize is awarded later this month. </p> <p>Each of today's successful authors wins \u00a32,000, with the chance of a further \u00a321,000 for the eventual winner of the main prize. </p> <p>The Book Of The Year winner will be chosen by a panel of nine judges - including model Jerry Hall and chaired by Dr Eric Anderson - and announced on January 25 at a dinner in Whitbread's London headquarters. </p> <p>The children's prize will be awarded the same night. </p> <p>The Whitbread awards are now in their 29th year, although the Book Of The Year category was not introduced until 1985. </p> <p>Tremain could chalk up a family first if she takes the Book Of The Year title later this month; her partner, the biographer Richard Holmes, won the 1986 Whitbread Book Of The Year.</p> <p>The winners were as follows: </p> <p><strong>Whitbread Poetry Award<br> Beowulf, by Seamus Heaney</strong><br> (Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a314.99) </p> <p>Heaney's reworking of the Anglo-Saxon poem tells of the eponymous mighty warrior who comes to the aid of a Danish king, Hrothgar. He defeats two monsters to rule a kingdom before finally facing a dragon which terrorises the country. <br> Heaney, who lives in Dublin, went to Queen's University, Belfast, where as an undergraduate he studied Beowulf. His first book, Death of a Naturalist, appeared in 1966, and he has since published poetry, criticism and translations. He was first commissioned to translate Beowulf in the mid-80s but put the project on hold. Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995. </p> <p>The Whitbread judges said: \"In a year notable for many strong works, including three brilliant translations, Heaney's recovery of Beowulf for a contemporary readership stands out. He brings an extraordinary sensitivity and breadth of language to this Anglo-Saxon warrior epic. In a translation that brilliantly combines the faithful with the original, Seamus Heaney has reclaimed the first classic of the English language for a contemporary readership.\" </p> <p><strong>Whitbread Novel Award<br> Music and Silence, by Rose Tremain</strong><br> (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a316.99)</p> <p>Set in 1629, it revolves around Englishman Peter Claire, who arrives at the palace of the Danish King Christian IV to join his court orchestra, and the complicated friendships and love affairs which develop. The king seeks harmony and order through the music created by his orchestra whilst Kirsten, his adulterous wife, detests music and craves silence. </p> <p>Music and Silence is the eighth novel by Rose Tremain, who lives in Norwich, Norfolk. A best-selling author in Britain, America and France, her work has been translated into 14 languages. </p> <p>Tremain's Booker Prize-nominated Restoration was made into a film starring Hugh Grant, Meg Ryan and Sir Ian McKellen. The Whitbread judges said: \"All the books had strengths but this stood above the others. She writes about both men and women with huge imaginative sympathy - all the characters are lit from the inside.\" </p> <p><strong>Whitbread First Novel Award<br> White City Blue, by Tim Lott </strong><br>(Viking, \u00a39.99)</p> <p>A tragi-comic novel about male friendships, narrated by Frank, an estate agent in Shepherd's Bush. In a series of flashbacks he describes how his group of mates became friends and how they developed through their adult lives with a shared passion for QPR football club and a series of mad escapades. </p> <p>Tim Lott, who lives in Notting Hill, west London, has been a television producer, editor of the listings magazine, City Limits, and a rock journalist. </p> <p>In 1996 he wrote the award-winning memoir, The Scent of Dried Roses, an exploration of his own depression and his mother's suicide. </p> <p>He is currently working on the screenplay of White City Blue and writing his second novel. The Whitbread judges said: \"We all passionately agreed on the winner. Heartbreaking about the reality of growing up, and a novel that we all felt that we wanted to carry on reading. </p> <p>\"An intense and revealing look at male friendships. Technically assured and funny.\"</p> <p><strong>Whitbread Biography Award<br> Berlioz, Volume II: Servitude And Greatness, by David Cairns</strong><br> (Allen Lane The Penguin Press, \u00a325)</p> <p>Hector Berlioz was one of the great composers of the nineteenth century and one of the most significant conductors of his day. A friend of Liszt and Wagner, he was feted in Germany and Russia but rejected by his native Paris and struggled for money most of his life, relying on journalism to make a living. His struggles for artistic recognition and financial security form two of the book's themes.</p> <p>David Cairns, who lives in Putney, south London, has worked as music critic at The Sunday Times and arts editor at the Spectator. He has also had an academic career at the Getty Centre in Santa Monica; Merton College, Oxford; and the University of California, where he is a visiting professor. </p> <p>The Whitbread judges said: \"The judges had a long and agonised debate between Hilary Spurling's Matisse and David Cairn's Berlioz. Both captured the eras in which their subjects lived and worked, as well as elegantly relating the technicalities of their respective crafts. </p> <p>\"David Cairns' Berlioz wins this year's Whitbread Biography Award for his masterly evocation of the inner man as well the outer world in which he lived and worked. </p> <p>\"The judges felt that this biography is a work of art in itself which will still be enjoyed and admired in centuries to come.\" </p>",

Each of today's successful authors wins \u00a32,000, with the chance of a further \u00a321,000 for the eventual winner of the main prize. The Book Of The Year winner will be chosen by a panel of nine judges - including model Jerry Hall and chaired by Dr Eric Anderson - and announced on January 25 at a dinner in Whitbread's London headquarters. The children's prize will be awarded the same night. The Whitbread awards are now in their 29th year, although the Book Of The Year category was not introduced until 1985. Tremain could chalk up a family first if she takes the Book Of The Year title later this month; her partner, the biographer Richard Holmes, won the 1986 Whitbread Book Of The Year. The winners were as follows: Whitbread Poetry Award Beowulf, by Seamus Heaney (Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a314.99) Heaney's reworking of the Anglo-Saxon poem tells of the eponymous mighty warrior who comes to the aid of a Danish king, Hrothgar. He defeats two monsters to rule a kingdom before finally facing a dragon which terrorises the country. Heaney, who lives in Dublin, went to Queen's University, Belfast, where as an undergraduate he studied Beowulf. His first book, Death of a Naturalist, appeared in 1966, and he has since published poetry, criticism and translations. He was first commissioned to translate Beowulf in the mid-80s but put the project on hold. Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995. The Whitbread judges said: \"In a year notable for many strong works, including three brilliant translations, Heaney's recovery of Beowulf for a contemporary readership stands out. He brings an extraordinary sensitivity and breadth of language to this Anglo-Saxon warrior epic. In a translation that brilliantly combines the faithful with the original, Seamus Heaney has reclaimed the first classic of the English language for a contemporary readership.\" Whitbread Novel Award Music and Silence, by Rose Tremain (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a316.99) Set in 1629, it revolves around Englishman Peter Claire, who arrives at the palace of the Danish King Christian IV to join his court orchestra, and the complicated friendships and love affairs which develop. The king seeks harmony and order through the music created by his orchestra whilst Kirsten, his adulterous wife, detests music and craves silence. Music and Silence is the eighth novel by Rose Tremain, who lives in Norwich, Norfolk. A best-selling author in Britain, America and France, her work has been translated into 14 languages. Tremain's Booker Prize-nominated Restoration was made into a film starring Hugh Grant, Meg Ryan and Sir Ian McKellen. The Whitbread judges said: \"All the books had strengths but this stood above the others. She writes about both men and women with huge imaginative sympathy - all the characters are lit from the inside.\" Whitbread First Novel Award White City Blue, by Tim Lott (Viking, \u00a39.99) A tragi-comic novel about male friendships, narrated by Frank, an estate agent in Shepherd's Bush. In a series of flashbacks he describes how his group of mates became friends and how they developed through their adult lives with a shared passion for QPR football club and a series of mad escapades. Tim Lott, who lives in Notting Hill, west London, has been a television producer, editor of the listings magazine, City Limits, and a rock journalist. In 1996 he wrote the award-winning memoir, The Scent of Dried Roses, an exploration of his own depression and his mother's suicide. He is currently working on the screenplay of White City Blue and writing his second novel. The Whitbread judges said: \"We all passionately agreed on the winner. Heartbreaking about the reality of growing up, and a novel that we all felt that we wanted to carry on reading. \"An intense and revealing look at male friendships. Technically assured and funny.\" Whitbread Biography Award Berlioz, Volume II: Servitude And Greatness, by David Cairns (Allen Lane The Penguin Press, \u00a325) Hector Berlioz was one of the great composers of the nineteenth century and one of the most significant conductors of his day. A friend of Liszt and Wagner, he was feted in Germany and Russia but rejected by his native Paris and struggled for money most of his life, relying on journalism to make a living. His struggles for artistic recognition and financial security form two of the book's themes. David Cairns, who lives in Putney, south London, has worked as music critic at The Sunday Times and arts editor at the Spectator. He has also had an academic career at the Getty Centre in Santa Monica; Merton College, Oxford; and the University of California, where he is a visiting professor. The Whitbread judges said: \"The judges had a long and agonised debate between Hilary Spurling's Matisse and David Cairn's Berlioz. Both captured the eras in which their subjects lived and worked, as well as elegantly relating the technicalities of their respective crafts. \"David Cairns' Berlioz wins this year's Whitbread Biography Award for his masterly evocation of the inner man as well the outer world in which he lived and worked. \"The judges felt that this biography is a work of art in itself which will still be enjoyed and admired in centuries to come.\"",

The ambitious \u00a32.7bn project would involve the construction of the longest tunnel of its kind in the world, containing two 46km-long carriageways, one on top of the other, which would allow motorists to complete the journey in about 30 minutes. The feasibility study submitted to the department of transport by Eurotunnel also outlines the potential for a second rail link which would be used by Eurostar and international freight trains, leaving the existing tunnel to be used by freight and car shuttle services. The proposals, especially the road link, are certain to be highly controversial and will reignite concerns about passenger safety and the environmental impact of both car use and large-scale undersea construction. But Eurotunnel yesterday emphasised that the plans were \"illustrative only at this stage\" as neither project would become a reality until demand for the existing tunnel reached full capacity - something that is not forecast to happen until 2025. Patrick Ponsolle, the executive chairman, said: \"The option of adding a second fixed link is a long term issue. Eurotunnel would only embark on such a venture if it would enhance the profitability of the company and was in the interest of its shareholders.\" The study was carried out only because the company was obliged under the terms of its original tunnel concession to submit proposals for a road link to the government by the end of 1999. In 2010 the British and French governments must decide whether to go ahead with one of the options. If plans for a second tunnel are given the green light, Eurotunnel will have first refusal on building and running it. As with the original tunnel proposals, the study, carried out by British and French consultants, rejects the options of a bridge or a submerged structure because of technical difficulties. Instead, the link would be contained within a single bore tunnel which would probably following the same line as the existing one, although the start and end points have yet to be identified. The road option would involve two dual-lane carriageways with a hard shoulder and would be closed to lorries and coaches to reduce the risk of accidents and fires. It would also include such features as \"information to customers, knowledge that help is at hand, a comfortably dimensioned carriageway, good visibility especially at curves and high quality lighting, tunnel marking and ventilation.\" The study concludes: \"The sense that the driver is being 'shepherded' through the tunnel helps to allay fatigue and drowsiness, improves concentration and relieves claustrophobia.\" Approving this option would leave the government open to criticism that it was encouraging car use, but Eurotunnel said it would take passengers off the existing shuttles and create space for up to 51m tonnes of freight a year, 13 times the expected amount for this year.

The \u00a323million summer capture from Arsenal recorded the first-ever goal in the World Club Championships with a freak block that looped in from 20 yards to put the Spanish giants ahead.

      "body": "<p>All children are to be taught thinking skills in their first three years at secondary school under a programme to develop imagination and creativity announced yesterday by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary. </p> <p>He said teachers would be trained in techniques developed at King's College, London, and Newcastle university for stretching pupils' problem-solving capabilities. </p> <p>The programme will be launched on an experimental basis at volunteer schools this autumn, but last night Mr Blunkett said he envisaged extending it throughout England over the next few years. </p> <p>In the King's College experiment pupils taught to use thinking skills performed substantially better in GCSE science. But Mr Blunkett said the benefits could extend beyond academic attainment. </p> <p>\"I want children to be able to think creatively and problem solve to address the issues of tomorrow - not just about work, but contributing to the debate about genetic engineering, the future of the planet and issues of global citizenship.\" </p> <p>At the north of England education conference in Wigan Mr Blunkett will today set out a blueprint for overhauling the teaching of 11 to 14-year-olds to tackle a dip in pupils' performance in the first three years at secondary school. It is ex pected to include guidance on teaching literacy and numeracy along similar lines to the programmes already in force in primaries. </p> <p>Last night he said: \"I'm very impressed by the growing evidence of the impact on standards of systematic teaching of thinking skills. This is not about some loosely defined or woolly approach to study skills. It is about the ability to analyse and make connections, to use knowledge effectively, to solve problems and to think creatively. It is about developing mental strategies to take on both academic and wider challenges.\" </p> <p>Last year Mr Blunkett rejected suggestions that creativity should be taught as a separate subject in the curriculum. Under the new programme teachers will be trained to teach thinking skills within their own subject areas. </p> <p>He said pupils should get lessons in thinking and creativity tailored to their interests and levels of attainment. This could range from \"problem solving to develop life skills\" to thinking about social and political issues. </p> <p>Guidance on teaching thinking skills will be included in handbooks on the revised national curriculum to be published later this term. \"The aim is to demonstrate that thinking skills are embedded in programmes of study,\" said Michael Barber, head of the department for education and employment standards unit. </p> <p>Citizenship classes would give opportunities for debates on moral, social, political and environmental issues. These would be ideal contexts for using inquiry, information processing, reasoning, problem-solving and evaluation, Professor Barber said. </p> <p>But there were signs last night that Mr Blunkett's plans to tell secondary schools how to improve teaching in literacy and numeracy may be resisted by the unions. </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers said: \"The government must be careful not to overload secondary schools. I do not believe that secondary school teachers will blithely tolerate the unrelenting impositions heaped upon their primary colleagues in recent years.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett is expected to announce national tests for 12 and 13-year-olds that schools could introduce on a voluntary basis. \"The many pressures placed upon schools, backed up by the Ofsted inspection police, make a mockery of the term 'voluntary'. The government will have to find external markers for these tests which will cost money. </p> <p>\"The government will also have to accept that more and more teachers will teach to the test and that other areas of the curriculum might suffer as a consequence,\" Mr de Gruchy said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "All children are to be taught thinking skills in their first three years at secondary school under a programme to develop imagination and creativity announced yesterday by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary. He said teachers would be trained in techniques developed at King's College, London, and Newcastle university for stretching pupils' problem-solving capabilities. The programme will be launched on an experimental basis at volunteer schools this autumn, but last night Mr Blunkett said he envisaged extending it throughout England over the next few years. In the King's College experiment pupils taught to use thinking skills performed substantially better in GCSE science. But Mr Blunkett said the benefits could extend beyond academic attainment. \"I want children to be able to think creatively and problem solve to address the issues of tomorrow - not just about work, but contributing to the debate about genetic engineering, the future of the planet and issues of global citizenship.\" At the north of England education conference in Wigan Mr Blunkett will today set out a blueprint for overhauling the teaching of 11 to 14-year-olds to tackle a dip in pupils' performance in the first three years at secondary school. It is ex pected to include guidance on teaching literacy and numeracy along similar lines to the programmes already in force in primaries. Last night he said: \"I'm very impressed by the growing evidence of the impact on standards of systematic teaching of thinking skills. This is not about some loosely defined or woolly approach to study skills. It is about the ability to analyse and make connections, to use knowledge effectively, to solve problems and to think creatively. It is about developing mental strategies to take on both academic and wider challenges.\" Last year Mr Blunkett rejected suggestions that creativity should be taught as a separate subject in the curriculum. Under the new programme teachers will be trained to teach thinking skills within their own subject areas. He said pupils should get lessons in thinking and creativity tailored to their interests and levels of attainment. This could range from \"problem solving to develop life skills\" to thinking about social and political issues. Guidance on teaching thinking skills will be included in handbooks on the revised national curriculum to be published later this term. \"The aim is to demonstrate that thinking skills are embedded in programmes of study,\" said Michael Barber, head of the department for education and employment standards unit. Citizenship classes would give opportunities for debates on moral, social, political and environmental issues. These would be ideal contexts for using inquiry, information processing, reasoning, problem-solving and evaluation, Professor Barber said. But there were signs last night that Mr Blunkett's plans to tell secondary schools how to improve teaching in literacy and numeracy may be resisted by the unions. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers said: \"The government must be careful not to overload secondary schools. I do not believe that secondary school teachers will blithely tolerate the unrelenting impositions heaped upon their primary colleagues in recent years.\" Mr Blunkett is expected to announce national tests for 12 and 13-year-olds that schools could introduce on a voluntary basis. \"The many pressures placed upon schools, backed up by the Ofsted inspection police, make a mockery of the term 'voluntary'. The government will have to find external markers for these tests which will cost money. \"The government will also have to accept that more and more teachers will teach to the test and that other areas of the curriculum might suffer as a consequence,\" Mr de Gruchy said.",

      "body": "<p>You work for the Labour party and on your first day back after the winter break, you return to a desk groaning under the weight of 1,500 responses to a consultation document on voting systems which were due in by December 31 and are still coming in. What is the first thing you do? For at least one person at Millbank Tower, the answer was apparently to grab a phone and spin a line to the media that the supporters of our present first-past-the-post voting system outnumbered the supporters of electoral reform by at least two to one.</p> <p>This wasn't difficult to work out, since 1,000 of the replies were in the form of identical postcards which were supplied by the first-past-the-post campaign to anyone prepared to sign their name. They weren't even posted. They were brought into Millbank in a cardboard box.</p> <p>The remaining 500 replies are more detailed and give considered responses to the 10 questions in the Labour party's consultation paper on the Report of the Independent Commission on the Voting System. They haven't all been opened yet, let alone read or analysed.</p> <p>When the party does analyse them, it will of course pay far more attention to the replies from local policy forums or constituency Labour parties which are the result of debate, than postcards signed by one individual. And the results will be far more evenly balanced than yesterday's headlines suggested.</p> <p>But what concerns me right from the start of what promises to be a bare-knuckle fight for the soul of this Labour government is that Millbank should stay right out of it. It is not the business of any party official to spin lines to the media in an internal consultation, any more than it would be in an internal election.</p> <p>I once worked for the Labour party in the days when it was based at Transport House and there was a clear understanding in those days that party headquarters remained scrupulously impartial on internal party affairs. Most party officials will, I am sure, observe strict neutrality on an issue which divides the Labour party at every level, but clearly the first-past-the-posters already have a friend at the heart of the party machine who is prepared to leak information when it is to their advantage.</p> <p>The party leadership would do well to stamp on this from the start. They can't have failed to notice from their experience in Wales and in London that partisanship can be entirely counter- productive when it comes from within the party machine. Our subscriptions pay their wages and we are entitled to neutrality.</p> <p>The same could be said to trade unions such as the AEEU who have thrown their weight - and their money - behind the first-past-the-post campaign. Unlike Millbank, they have a perfect right to be partial if that is what their members want, but they too may find that involvement proves counter-productive. The AEEU believes in the same vision of new trade unionism as Tony Blair. That vision, as the prime minister said in Unions Today magazine, should be \"far more focused on the individual needs of union members and far less on what used to be the playing out of political roles, which often did a lot of damage\". The fact is that ordinary Labour party members do not want to be bounced into taking a premature decision on what everyone recognises is a very complex issue and a very important one for the future of this Labour government.</p> <p>It is absolutely staggering to hear it suggested - as one of the pro-first-past-the-post MPs did yesterday morning - that the Labour party should go back on its solemn promise to hold a referendum on electoral reform because of the response to an internal consultation document.</p> <p>It will be some time before we learn the results of the consultation process, but even if there is a two-to-one majority in favour of the present voting system, as the leaks claim, that is absolutely no excuse for ratting on an election pledge.</p> <p>John Smith gave his word when he was leader of the Labour party that the issue of changing the voting system would be put to the electorate in a referendum. That pledge was taken up by Tony Blair and it led to a clear commitment in the Labour party's election manifesto.

      "bodyText": "You work for the Labour party and on your first day back after the winter break, you return to a desk groaning under the weight of 1,500 responses to a consultation document on voting systems which were due in by December 31 and are still coming in. What is the first thing you do? For at least one person at Millbank Tower, the answer was apparently to grab a phone and spin a line to the media that the supporters of our present first-past-the-post voting system outnumbered the supporters of electoral reform by at least two to one. This wasn't difficult to work out, since 1,000 of the replies were in the form of identical postcards which were supplied by the first-past-the-post campaign to anyone prepared to sign their name. They weren't even posted. They were brought into Millbank in a cardboard box. The remaining 500 replies are more detailed and give considered responses to the 10 questions in the Labour party's consultation paper on the Report of the Independent Commission on the Voting System. They haven't all been opened yet, let alone read or analysed. When the party does analyse them, it will of course pay far more attention to the replies from local policy forums or constituency Labour parties which are the result of debate, than postcards signed by one individual. And the results will be far more evenly balanced than yesterday's headlines suggested. But what concerns me right from the start of what promises to be a bare-knuckle fight for the soul of this Labour government is that Millbank should stay right out of it. It is not the business of any party official to spin lines to the media in an internal consultation, any more than it would be in an internal election. I once worked for the Labour party in the days when it was based at Transport House and there was a clear understanding in those days that party headquarters remained scrupulously impartial on internal party affairs. Most party officials will, I am sure, observe strict neutrality on an issue which divides the Labour party at every level, but clearly the first-past-the-posters already have a friend at the heart of the party machine who is prepared to leak information when it is to their advantage. The party leadership would do well to stamp on this from the start. They can't have failed to notice from their experience in Wales and in London that partisanship can be entirely counter- productive when it comes from within the party machine. Our subscriptions pay their wages and we are entitled to neutrality. The same could be said to trade unions such as the AEEU who have thrown their weight - and their money - behind the first-past-the-post campaign. Unlike Millbank, they have a perfect right to be partial if that is what their members want, but they too may find that involvement proves counter-productive. The AEEU believes in the same vision of new trade unionism as Tony Blair. That vision, as the prime minister said in Unions Today magazine, should be \"far more focused on the individual needs of union members and far less on what used to be the playing out of political roles, which often did a lot of damage\". The fact is that ordinary Labour party members do not want to be bounced into taking a premature decision on what everyone recognises is a very complex issue and a very important one for the future of this Labour government. It is absolutely staggering to hear it suggested - as one of the pro-first-past-the-post MPs did yesterday morning - that the Labour party should go back on its solemn promise to hold a referendum on electoral reform because of the response to an internal consultation document. It will be some time before we learn the results of the consultation process, but even if there is a two-to-one majority in favour of the present voting system, as the leaks claim, that is absolutely no excuse for ratting on an election pledge. John Smith gave his word when he was leader of the Labour party that the issue of changing the voting system would be put to the electorate in a referendum. That pledge was taken up by Tony Blair and it led to a clear commitment in the Labour party's election manifesto. Neither an internal consultation nor even a party conference vote can justify reneging on that commitment. T he consultation wasn't even about whether we should stick to our pledge to hold a referendum. That was taken for granted. The only question it asked on the referendum was whether the Labour party should take a formal position for or against. Personally I think there is a strong argument that the Labour party should not. John Smith said the voting system should be decided in a referendum precisely because it is too important to be left to politicians. Voting systems are the process by which politicians are elected and should not therefore be decided upon by politicians or parties who have a vested interest in the outcome. The New Zealand parties lost sight of this fact. The leaders of all the parties urged the electorate to vote against a change in the voting system. Smelling a rat, the voters replied by voting 80% in favour. Despite reports to the contrary, they have no intention of returning to the old system. The same thing may happen here. Almost every opinion poll on electoral reform has shown a majority in favour of reform. And whatever the consultation may show, the most recent survey of grassroots Labour party members, conducted by professors Patrick Seyd and Paul Whiteley in the summer of 1997, showed that 52% believed that the electoral system should be replaced by a system of proportional representation' with only 27% against. Among Labour MPs there is a huge majority against reform. But MPs have a vested interest in a voting system that elected them. They overlook its most obvious faults. And they tend to judge public opinion by talking to their own supporters in their own constituencies. This method of sampling public opinion may work on other issues, but it does not work on voting systems. MPs' own supporters in their own constituencies are, by definition, people who are happy with the voting system. They voted Labour, they got a Labour MP, they have no problem with it. If MPs want a truer picture, they should also speak to Labour supporters in the 223 seats that do not have Labour MPs.

Scandals - particularly that over the Bristol Royal Infirmary where low standards led to babies un necessarily dying in complex heart operations - have exposed the shortcomings in an area where doctors used to be unchallenged kings of their craft. What we are seeing now is a race between government and the doctors' organisations to put structures into place that will ensure doctors are appraised and their work audited. At issue is who controls the medical profession: is its 140-year-old tradition of self-regulation to be replaced by rule from Richmond House, the DoH headquarters? </p> <p>The doctors' disciplinary body, the General Medical Council (GMC), knows that the government is fully prepared to impose change. The public inquiry now under way is not just looking at what happened at Bristol but at every aspect of the hospital system in England and Wales that might have a bearing on practice and procedure there. From the GMC to the royal colleges to the DoH itself, the top tier of the medical profession has been grilled on what went wrong. Eventually, it is expected that Ian Kennedy, the QC chairing the inquiry, will produce a far-reaching reform plan. </p> <p>Meanwhile the GMC and royal colleges are frantically trying to get their own system of revalidating doctors up and running as soon as possible. Yesterday the Royal College of GPs, together with the BMA GPs committee, published the first consultation document, suggesting a wide range of tests to determine whether a GP is working correctly and effectively. Each of the other colleges - covering all specialities from surgery to paediatrics - will produce its own blueprint for best practice. This will be the profession's answer to the problem of doctors not keeping up with medical advances. </p> <p>There is general agreement that every five years doctors will have to submit evidence of their competence, such as internal assessments by their peers, satisfaction ratings from patients, and even video evidence from consultations. </p> <p>From the profession's point of view, this is going to be a fair and thorough system, which will link in, if a doctor is failing badly, with the GMC's performance procedures. These are themselves new. Only a few years ago, a doctor could only be disciplined for \"serious professional misconduct\" such as a crime or a sexual liaison with a patient. The performance procedures were introduced to enable the GMC to strike a doctor off the medical register for being simply a bad doctor - after attempts to re-train him or her had failed. </p> <p>But to make all this thorough and fair will take time, because a host of different specialities, each with their own royal college, are involved. You cannot require the same proofs of competence from a GP and a heart surgeon. So each college is painstakingly producing its own blueprint. </p> <p>While ministers make pleasant noises about revalidation, however, there are signs that they have not got the patience to wait for the profession to sort itself out. That is where the document produced last year (Supporting Doctors, Protecting Patients) by the chief medical officer (CMO) for England and Wales comes in. Health secretary Alan Milburn and the CMO, Liam Donaldson, see this as the answer to poor performance. But while the royal colleges and the GMC have been scrupulously polite about it, there is dismay in some quarters. The NHS, as the employer, must have ways of dealing with complaints about doctors and systems of care, they feel, but clinical performance is the profession's own territory. </p> <p>At least it has been in the past. Professor Donaldson's document proposes \"appraisal\" for all doctors. It asserts that the NHS has a responsibility to ensure its doctors are up to standard. </p> <p>Basically, here is a plan to test doctors, send them off to new assessment and support centres for retraining if necessary, and suspend or dismiss them at managers' discretion. It is a complete package. While revalidation and professional self-regulation are frequently mentioned, doctors could be forgiven for thinking those are secondary to the task of satisfying the employer - the NHS - that the doctor is fit for the job. </p> <p>The medical establishment has been almost as anxious about the way the document was produced as its content. (It was almost exclusively Professor Donaldson's work.) One source said professional bodies were given 12 hours to read a draft, two weeks before publication. It is a consultation document, but they wonder how much scope there is for change. </p> <p>Medical practice has already been streamlined. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), unkindly dubbed the government's rationing body, is to appraise new medicines and treatments. For the first time, Nice will compare one licensed drug with another and advise doctors. The Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) will take an interest in doctors who ignore Nice. This is the government's new inspectorate. Shortly after Bristol, the Royal College of Surgeons began work on a scheme to send in troubleshooters should there be any suggestion of a serious problem. But again, the government has made the territory its own. </p> <p>Does it matter who sets these bodies up? Whoever takes the lead, the same people will sit on them: only certain people are qualified and they are all members of the profession. Everybody agrees that standards need to be set, but it is control of the agenda that matters - to a government which wants radical modernisation of the NHS and to doctors who want to preserve their professional freedom. As the saying goes, he who pays the piper calls the tune. </p> <p> Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health correspondent</p>",

Everybody agrees that standards need to be set, but it is control of the agenda that matters - to a government which wants radical modernisation of the NHS and to doctors who want to preserve their professional freedom. As the saying goes, he who pays the piper calls the tune. Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health correspondent",

The profession's disciplinary body, the General Medical Council, and the Royal Colleges which govern all the different specialties in medicine have agreed to work towards revalidation every five years on average for all doctors. The GMC wants the process to begin next year, but the Royal College of GPs is the first to produce its proposals and the other colleges are some way behind. </p> <p>The two reports, Revalidation for Clinical General Practice and Good Medical Practice for General Practitioners, spell out to GPs what will be required of them. They will then have to demonstrate to their peers that their practice more often than not meets the standard set for excellence. GPs who are considered to be failing will be assessed in their surgeries by local revalidation groups including other doctors, health professionals and also lay people. The panel could ask them to undergo some re-training. If the GP fails or refuses to improve, the last resort is to the GMC, which could remove him or her from the medical register. </p> <p>Dr John Chisholm, chairman of the BMA's GPs Committee, said: \"A poor GP consistently or frequently provides care described by the unacceptable GP criteria. An excellent GP meets the excellent criteria all or nearly all of the time. A good GP meets most of the excellent GP criteria most of the time. </p> <p>\"We do not believe that any GP can be expected to provide care described by the excellent GP all the time - though he or she will aspire to that. Likewise we recognise that good GPs will, on occasion, provide care that appears to be unacceptable by these standards. Sometimes this may be due to lack of resources; where standards are not met, it may not always be the fault of the doctor.\" </p> <p>He pointed out that the revalidation exercise, while necessary, will be expensive. \"Although for revalidation most GPs should be able to submit evidence already collected for other purposes, there will be a cost involved. Local revalidation groups, for example, will have to be set up to visit GPs when questions arise. One of the crucial questions is who will pay. Revalidation cannot go ahead in the absence of adequate resources. We will negotiate resources and the further development of revalidation will depend on the outcome of those negotiations.\" </p> <p>Professor Mike Pringle, chairman of the Council of the RCGP, said it was important that the public as well as doctors understood what was required. \"We are applying explicit criteria to our revalidation proposals. They must be understood by and be credible with the public. They must identify unacceptable performance and identify good performance.

Professor Donaldson proposes that failing doctors should be sent off to assessment centres - the Royal College wants to see local teams go in to help doctors in their surgeries. \"The sort of appraisal in the CMO's report is managerial and punitive\", he added. \"We want something informative and constructive so people can analyse their own performance in terms of where they are doing well and where they are not.\" But he says he believes the two approaches can be reconciled.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The leading Kashmiri militant released by India to end a bloody airline hijack vowed last night to fight to liberate the majority Muslim state from Indian rule. In a speech that is bound to heighten tension between India and Pakistan, Maulana Masood Azhar told some 10,000 followers in a park in central Karachi that he would not rest until Kashmir had been \"liberated\". Mr Azhar told the throng, many of whom were members of his militant group, the Marakat-ul-Mojahedin: \"I have come here because this is my duty to tell you that Muslims should not rest in peace until we have destroyed America and India.\" He said the five hijackers of the Indian Airlines jet, who he said were all Indian Kashmiris, had returned to Kashmir and were \"preparing for their next assault\". Earlier yesterday, Islamic Jihad Council, an umbrella group for a dozen Muslim groups fighting Indian forces in Kashmir, insisted the freed hijackers were still in Afghanistan. The ruling Taliban said that the hijackers, Mr Azhar and two other militants freed in the deal to release 155 hostages, Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, an Indian Kashmiri, and Ahmed Umar Saeed Sheikh, a Pakistani-born British citizen, had all left the country. The men took control of the Indian Airlines plane in the skies over India on December 24. One hostage was killed. The hijackers have not been seen since they left Kandahar airport in southern Afghanistan. They were given 10 hours by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban to leave the country. The conflicting claims over the whereabouts of the hijackers have fuelled Delhi's claims that Pakistan was involved in the incident, and have led to bitter exchanges which have plunged India's relations with Pakistan's new military ruler to a new low. The ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, on Tuesday said India was launching a propaganda campaign against his country to deflect criticism over how New Delhi handled negotiations with the hostage-takers. India's home minister, L K Advani, said India had \"irrefutable evidence of Pakistan's involvement in cross-border terrorism and in this particular hijacking.\" But he did not offer details, and he said India has not yet offered the proof to other countries. Pakistan has condemned the hijacking and denied involvement. Pakistan said after the hijacking that its border security was put on alert and the hijackers would be arrested if found. On Wednesday, Pakistani officials demanded that India make public information it claims to have on the hijackers' identities. \"Fabrication of allegations without a shred of evidence is reprehensible,\" a Pakistani foreign ministry statement said. Mr Azhar's speech in Karachi will further confirm India's suspicions, although Pakistan said Mr Azhar, whose father is a retired school teacher from Bawahalpur in eastern Punjab province, would be allowed to return to his homeland because he did not face any charges at home. A fiery speaker and charismatic leader, the Pakistani-born cleric conducted a tour of British mosques shortly before his arrest in Febuary 1994. Faisal Bodi, news editor of Q-News, a Muslim magazine, wrote in the Guardian that it was a measure of Mr Azhar's importance that his supporters have mounted two attempts to free him. A previous attempt ended in the killing of at least one of six western captives. Another four are missing, presumed dead. Mr Bodi said that Mr Azhar is intensely popular among British Muslims: \"In particular Azhar's recommendations that young men undergo military training in Afghanistan has found many a receptive ear - to the alarm of governments who fear it could swell the ranks of the indomitable international mojahedin. Naturally in a Muslim world which sees all that is western as irredeemably hostile, Azhar's reputation has grown since the US state department included on its list of terrorist organisations the Harkat-ul- Ansar, a group of which he was a leading ideologue.\"",

Your leader (January 4) adds: \"Their two male parents are rich, and have already engaged a leading law firm ... to fight officialdom.\" Children starting life as a \"gleam in the lawyer's eye\" seems an apt comment.</p> <p>But the twins start life with three recognised fathers, so even if the worst comes to the worst, they will end up with at least one. Not so the case for one in four UK children. Around 800 children a week lose their father. Your own figures indicate that 50% of divorced fathers lose all contact with their children within two years. As more than a third of the children born in the UK are by unmarried parents, and separations in that category are much higher, the estimate of around 3m children without fathers might well be an underestimate. Put another way, one in four men who become fathers will never see their children grow up. It will be one in two within 10 years.</p> <p>When the home office has sorted out the situation of the gay men, it might turn its mind to the incompetent family court welfare service, which does more to break up families than any other single cause due to its lack of training, money and time. Gay couples should of course be allowed to have families. Let's hope the best legal minds in the country can also turn their thoughts to what to do about parents who break court orders for contact with impunity.</p> <p>The UK has the highest number of single-parent families in Europe, around 11%. By this time next year it will be about 12% and another 40,000-plus children will be fatherless. <br> <b>Stan Hayward</b> <br> London <a href=\"mailto:stan@hccat.demon.co.uk  \">stan@hccat.demon.co.uk </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The two gay men who have made legal history by registering as parents of twins born to a surrogate mother in the US raises many questions. Legally it appears the mother's husband is the father, though he had not fathered them. As the mother is American, it may appear that the CSA cannot sue the father in the US and, as the children are officially Americans, it seems that they will require the granting of UK citizenship before the gay fathers can adopt them. Your leader (January 4) adds: \"Their two male parents are rich, and have already engaged a leading law firm ... to fight officialdom.\" Children starting life as a \"gleam in the lawyer's eye\" seems an apt comment. But the twins start life with three recognised fathers, so even if the worst comes to the worst, they will end up with at least one. Not so the case for one in four UK children. Around 800 children a week lose their father. Your own figures indicate that 50% of divorced fathers lose all contact with their children within two years. As more than a third of the children born in the UK are by unmarried parents, and separations in that category are much higher, the estimate of around 3m children without fathers might well be an underestimate. Put another way, one in four men who become fathers will never see their children grow up. It will be one in two within 10 years. When the home office has sorted out the situation of the gay men, it might turn its mind to the incompetent family court welfare service, which does more to break up families than any other single cause due to its lack of training, money and time. Gay couples should of course be allowed to have families. Let's hope the best legal minds in the country can also turn their thoughts to what to do about parents who break court orders for contact with impunity. The UK has the highest number of single-parent families in Europe, around 11%. By this time next year it will be about 12% and another 40,000-plus children will be fatherless.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The markets melted yesterday, knocking $26bn off UK shares, following a record fall the previous day. That sounds like trouble. And yet the world's economy has seldom looked healthier. The US, accounting for 35% of the wealth of the 29-nation OECD, has embarked on a record ninth successive year of positive growth. In the past four years its internet-driven economy has averaged a gravity-defying 4% a year without, so far, any worrying resurgence of inflation. Asia, the basket case of 1998, is recovering much faster than expected. The 11 countries of Euroland are at last poised to raise growth from 2% to 3%. The UK has confounded critics by expanding by almost 2% in 1999, instead of no growth at all as some feared. Even Russia managed to grow by between 1% and 2% last year after a contraction of 5% in 1998.</p> <p>In these circumstances yesterday's meltdown was a necessary correction which could give the overheated markets the slow puncture they need to bring them back to reality. Stock markets cannot keep on rising by 20% a year as they have done in the US (and far more for the hi-tech stocks) without running into serious turbulence.</p> <p>A \"soft landing\" for the world's overinflated stock markets is needed everywhere, but particularly in the US, where it could be critical in preventing an eventual implosion of the economy. Private consumption expanded by 5% a year in 1998 and 1999 as consumers went into debt to finance a spending spree, safe in the knowledge that their financial wealth (measured in exploding share prices) was still growing. But if a sudden slump in share prices turns this process into reverse and US consumers (whose imports have kept the rest of the world's industry in business in recent years) stop spending, then the world's exports could catch a severe cold.</p> <p>In present circumstances, with synchronised expansion taking place all over the globe, central banks are probably right to think about a rise in interest rates, if only as a warning shot across the bows about the dangers of inflation. The only surprise is that the financial markets have taken such a long time to realise that a rise is probably imminent. Yet any rise should be modest - particularly outside America. Euroland is barely at the start of a recovery. It has lots of underutilised capacity and a current ac count surplus. It does not need a rise in interest rates either to check inflation or to prevent overheating. One of the reasons for US success (apart from the dynamism of its hi-tech sector) is the fact that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve - whom President Clinton backed this week for a fourth term - was prepared to risk not raising interest rates to test whether the world was entering a new era of low inflation thanks to globalisation and the deflationary forces of the internet. This is a theory that Europe's central bank should now also test over a long period.</p> <p>In Britain, the situation is complicated by the fact that while two-thirds of the economy (most of the service sector) may need a rise in rates, the remainder - especially manufacturing, farming and tourism - definitely does not. The south of England needs checking, but most of the north needs a drop in interest rates. Manufacturers are still suffering from the debilitating effects of the overvalued pound (notwithstanding the recent rise in activity caused by the rise in world trade).

      "bodyText": "The markets melted yesterday, knocking $26bn off UK shares, following a record fall the previous day. That sounds like trouble. And yet the world's economy has seldom looked healthier. The US, accounting for 35% of the wealth of the 29-nation OECD, has embarked on a record ninth successive year of positive growth. In the past four years its internet-driven economy has averaged a gravity-defying 4% a year without, so far, any worrying resurgence of inflation. Asia, the basket case of 1998, is recovering much faster than expected. The 11 countries of Euroland are at last poised to raise growth from 2% to 3%. The UK has confounded critics by expanding by almost 2% in 1999, instead of no growth at all as some feared. Even Russia managed to grow by between 1% and 2% last year after a contraction of 5% in 1998. In these circumstances yesterday's meltdown was a necessary correction which could give the overheated markets the slow puncture they need to bring them back to reality. Stock markets cannot keep on rising by 20% a year as they have done in the US (and far more for the hi-tech stocks) without running into serious turbulence. A \"soft landing\" for the world's overinflated stock markets is needed everywhere, but particularly in the US, where it could be critical in preventing an eventual implosion of the economy. Private consumption expanded by 5% a year in 1998 and 1999 as consumers went into debt to finance a spending spree, safe in the knowledge that their financial wealth (measured in exploding share prices) was still growing. But if a sudden slump in share prices turns this process into reverse and US consumers (whose imports have kept the rest of the world's industry in business in recent years) stop spending, then the world's exports could catch a severe cold. In present circumstances, with synchronised expansion taking place all over the globe, central banks are probably right to think about a rise in interest rates, if only as a warning shot across the bows about the dangers of inflation. The only surprise is that the financial markets have taken such a long time to realise that a rise is probably imminent. Yet any rise should be modest - particularly outside America. Euroland is barely at the start of a recovery. It has lots of underutilised capacity and a current ac count surplus. It does not need a rise in interest rates either to check inflation or to prevent overheating. One of the reasons for US success (apart from the dynamism of its hi-tech sector) is the fact that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve - whom President Clinton backed this week for a fourth term - was prepared to risk not raising interest rates to test whether the world was entering a new era of low inflation thanks to globalisation and the deflationary forces of the internet. This is a theory that Europe's central bank should now also test over a long period. In Britain, the situation is complicated by the fact that while two-thirds of the economy (most of the service sector) may need a rise in rates, the remainder - especially manufacturing, farming and tourism - definitely does not. The south of England needs checking, but most of the north needs a drop in interest rates. Manufacturers are still suffering from the debilitating effects of the overvalued pound (notwithstanding the recent rise in activity caused by the rise in world trade). Higher interest rates would make it even more difficult to bring the pound down to a realistic level. Instead they would reinforce the doomsday scenario that has been forced on most manufacturers - that the strong pound is here to stay and they will have to live with it or die with it. They are following the only escape route open - firing workers and importing components instead of buying them from UK companies. That is why the latest figures show a 1.6% increase in service employment in the past year, but falls of 4.3% in manufacturing and 5.6% in agriculture and fishing. The governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, tries to wash his hands of the matter by claiming that no one could seriously suggest that \"we should put the whole of the economy at risk to protect certain parts\".

      "body": "<p>I have never been very interested in the body. I do not watch those TV programmes that explain where everything is and what it's for. I've scarcely seen a doctor in a professional capacity for 25 years and if I were constrained to visit one, I would not want him to give me any details about whatever condition was afflicting whichever organ or limb I was concerned about. I should request him simply to do what he had to do and let me go with the minimum of fuss.</p> <p>I feel distant from my insides - which might as well be situated in Ulan Bator - while naturally trying not to abuse them, and hope they will continue to function adequately until the whole lot wear out in the course of time. Nor do I indulge in strenuous dieting or exercise, eating when hungry and drinking when dry, and finding running up and down stairs in search of things I've forgotten or mislaid quite sufficient to keep the blood coursing. Chasing and weight-lifting grandchildren takes care of the muscle tone and since none of the doors or windows fits too well, there is plenty of fresh air.</p> <p>Besides, I was brought up during the war when there wasn't any junk food to interfere with or unbalance the vital processes. So, on the whole, apart from the exigencies of child-birth, I've never really needed to dwell much on the physical form, for which I'm properly grateful.</p> <p>The aspects of it to which I am most indebted are, on reflection, my feet which have, as it were, stood by me through thick and thin. I do appreciate the utility of the other parts, eyes, ears etc, but there is something about the unselfconscious humility of feet that is particularly affecting. So much so that I once wrote a poem to my feet - with which I will not burden you. We were going for a walk and I suddenly noticed them going plod, plod through the mud and the fallen leaves, self-effacing and uncomplaining, while my hands, since I was carrying nothing at the time, just hung there, along for the ride, like distant aristocratic relations, too grand to acknowledge the workers bearing them forward.</p> <p>Hands, of course, are indispensable, but they get far more attention than feet: people praise their dexterity and wave them about at times of emotion.

      "bodyText": "I have never been very interested in the body. I do not watch those TV programmes that explain where everything is and what it's for. I've scarcely seen a doctor in a professional capacity for 25 years and if I were constrained to visit one, I would not want him to give me any details about whatever condition was afflicting whichever organ or limb I was concerned about. I should request him simply to do what he had to do and let me go with the minimum of fuss. I feel distant from my insides - which might as well be situated in Ulan Bator - while naturally trying not to abuse them, and hope they will continue to function adequately until the whole lot wear out in the course of time. Nor do I indulge in strenuous dieting or exercise, eating when hungry and drinking when dry, and finding running up and down stairs in search of things I've forgotten or mislaid quite sufficient to keep the blood coursing. Chasing and weight-lifting grandchildren takes care of the muscle tone and since none of the doors or windows fits too well, there is plenty of fresh air. Besides, I was brought up during the war when there wasn't any junk food to interfere with or unbalance the vital processes. So, on the whole, apart from the exigencies of child-birth, I've never really needed to dwell much on the physical form, for which I'm properly grateful. The aspects of it to which I am most indebted are, on reflection, my feet which have, as it were, stood by me through thick and thin. I do appreciate the utility of the other parts, eyes, ears etc, but there is something about the unselfconscious humility of feet that is particularly affecting. So much so that I once wrote a poem to my feet - with which I will not burden you. We were going for a walk and I suddenly noticed them going plod, plod through the mud and the fallen leaves, self-effacing and uncomplaining, while my hands, since I was carrying nothing at the time, just hung there, along for the ride, like distant aristocratic relations, too grand to acknowledge the workers bearing them forward. Hands, of course, are indispensable, but they get far more attention than feet: people praise their dexterity and wave them about at times of emotion. Hands are almost always on stage and frequently the focus of the gaze, whereas feet generally go unremarked unless in exceptional circumstances - if you've fallen head first down a hole, for instance. There are those who make a fetish of them but that seems uncalled for and vaguely insulting. Like all misplaced adulation, it loses sight of their true purpose and diminishes their value. I once knew a Freudian who held that foot fetishists got that way because her feet were the first bit of its mother a baby noticed when it woke, crying, in the night. It only takes a moment's thought to reject this explanation, unless the baby had fallen out of its cot and was lying on the floor - not, surely, a common occurrence, not one to initiate a life-long perversion. I treat my feet kindly and with respect, never forcing them into unsuitable shoes, but giving them sandals or capacious boots to wear, depending on the season. Only once did I mistreat a foot. I dearly wanted to kick my spouse but thought it inadvisable, kicking the sofa instead. Unfortunately I hit on a wooden part and split a toe wide open. Even then I did not trouble the doctor nor look at it myself, but swathed it in a cloth and left it alone. After a few weeks it healed without trace of injury.

      "bodyText": "Vice-president Al Gore's uphill struggle to prevent his Democratic rival Bill Bradley from winning the crucial New Hampshire primary next month received a huge boost yesterday when Senator Edward Kennedy gave his personal endorsement to Mr Gore as the Democratic party's White House choice. The much-coveted Kennedy endorsement was carefully timed to take place only hours before the latest Gore-Bradley televised debate in New Hampshire last night, and came as the latest poll showed the two contenders in a statistical dead-heat in New Hampshire, where the first presidential primary takes place in less than four weeks' time, on February 1. Mr Kennedy may be a political lion in winter these days, but his icon-like status within the party, his huge local influence in New England, his deep knowledge of the two rivals from their senate years, and his standing as the Democrats' most unrepentant liberal, give his backing for Mr Gore enormous weight. With Mr Gore at his side, Mr Kennedy told reporters in his home town of Boston that the vice-president spoke for \"our Democratic priorities\" such as health care, education, good jobs and a clean environment. Mr Gore had \"the ability, the vision and the experience to lead this nation wisely and well in the coming years, and I'll be proud to stand with [him] in the great battles that lie ahead\", Mr Kennedy said. The latest poll, by the American Research Group (ARG), shows Mr Bradley commanding 42% of support among the state's Democratic voters, with Mr Gore on 39%. Allowing for the poll's margin of statistical error, it puts the two men in a dead heat, and suggests that Mr Gore is narrowing the gap on Mr Bradley, who led by 12 points in a similar survey a month ago. The closeness of the Democratic contest in New Hampshire lent fresh significance to last night's debate, for which both camps had promised a more combative approach, reflecting the more intense language of their campaigning since the new year. Mr Bradley, who in every sense is the loftier candidate of the two and who has performed well in earlier match-ups with his rival, yesterday accused Mr Gore of campaigning in \"desperation\" and warned Democrats that the vice-president would be a weaker presidential nominee because of his questionable 1996 fund-raising tactics. \"The Republicans think it's a problem and I think they will use it in the fall campaign [if Mr Gore is the nominee],\" Mr Bradley said. Since campaigning resumed following the Christmas-new year break, both Mr Gore and Mr Bradley have sharpened their language in what had previously been a remarkably civil contest. But with Mr Gore now using a much more aggressive campaigning style, repeatedly trying to raise doubts about Mr Bradley's policy pledges, both men now appear readier to resort to tried and tested political black arts. With few major issues or ideas to divide them, Mr Gore has finally focused his assault on the charge that Mr Bradley's ambitious universal health care plan is unrealistic and too costly. While Mr Bradley hit back this week with a counter-claim that the vice-president's supposedly more \"responsible\" health plan, which focuses on medicare plans for the poor and the elderly, would overspend federal balanced budget forecasts by $350bn over 10 years. This week, choosing another new tack, Mr Gore said that Mr Bradley had given education reform a \"short shrift\" by comparison with his own plans for pre-school entitlements and said the Bradley plans were badly costed. A Bradley administration would \"blunder into another recession\", Mr Gore charged. Mr Bradley said yesterday that he was \"not going to stand by when people misrepresent my views\", adding that Mr Gore's charges sounded \"a bit to me like desperation\".",

The Danes claimed the struggling British industry's complaints over animal welfare and food safety abroad would undermine consumer confidence in pork throughout Europe and do nothing to help the \u00a35.3bn a year trade in Britain. Pig industry leaders blame a combination of the strong pound, measures to prevent any possibility of a BSE-like disease in pigs, and tougher welfare and food standards for threatening up to 25,000 jobs.

Anne Birgitt Lundholt, managing director of Danske Slagterier, the Danish pig farmers' body, said: \"We have so far resisted the temptation to enter into a war of words, but our patience is not inexhaustible.\" Hinting at a massive new marketing campaign, she warned a farming conference in Oxford: \"You must expect us to defend our corner if our integrity is being challenged.\" Commenting on calls by some defenders of the British pig industry for modern day Danes to be repulsed, she said the latest \"Viking invaders\" had a resolve to succeed that was as strong as ever. The meat and livestock commission in Britain apparently accepts that Danish export contracts meet all British standards but say around a third of its national pig herd is still raised to lower standards. Meryl Ward, a Lincolnshire pig farmer and member of the pig industry support group, said: \"We had costs that made us uncompetitive with the rest of Europe and we had to make a noise to make sure the public understood there was a difference.\" The Danish reaction suggested the campaign had been worthwhile, she added.

Procter &amp; Gamble's Bounty kitchen towels and their jingle \"the stronger soaker upper\" topped the chart of most hated advert of 1999 in a survey commissioned by Marketing magazine. The advert, created by Leo Burnett Frankfurt, irritated 44% of the 1,000 people surveyed for Marketing by NOP. Respondents criticised the German TV commercial for the \"grating jingle\", \"dubious acting\" and \"spurious product demonstration\", the magazine said. However, J Walter Thompson's Chicken Tonight adverts came a close second in the annoyance stakes, with 43%. Footballer Ian Wright's star appearances in the campaign to launch the Sizzle and Stir varieties proved to be a bit of a turkey. Running in third place was the Renault Scenic advert, a Sound of Music-themed offering featuring a car rolling off an idyllic green mountainside. Other well-known commercials which made the most hated top 10 included the Benecol adverts featuring Carol Vorderman at five, Iceland's special offer adverts in eighth place and in the ninth spot, the Citroen Xsara adverts featuring Claudia Schiffer. Despite being named in the advertising rogue's gallery, it is believed many of the products probably benefit from being so annoying.

Despite popular belief, \"debriefing\" - in which victims are encourage to relive their experiences immediately after the event by talking about them - may not help those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. And, in certain circumstances the treatment, used after the Paddington rail disaster, the bombing of Manchester city centre and the Soho pub bombing, may even make their symptoms worse. The warning was given at the British Psychological Association conference in Brighton, following research commissioned by the health and safety executive. After analysing the results of seven random controlled trials, the researchers - from Birkbeck college, London, and the university of Sussex - found there was no evidence that debriefing helped victims in the long term but there was evidence that it had harmed them. \"At best its efficacy is neutral and at worst it can be damaging,\" said Jo Ricks, principal research fellow at the institute of employment studies at the University of Sussex. \"In one study of victims of road traffic accidents, those suffering from severe post- traumatic stress had worse symptoms a year after the accident if they underwent debriefing than those who did not.\" Such symptoms included flashbacks, emotional numbness and a heightened sense of fear.

The same discovery could also be used to help some males father children. \"Malfunction of this receptor could explain some cases of male subfertility,\" Dr Pritchard said. \"That would obviously be something we could look into.\" The mice without the gene are apparently surviving normally. The receptor is also important in the muscle that lines the blood vessels. \"We thought that may result in differences in blood pressure. We've not found a significant difference yet,\" she said. \"They don't seem to have any behavioural abnormalities. It doesn't affect testosterone levels or anything like that. So men could be reassured they would be quite normal.\"",

Even more importantly, she can also remember a sequence of up to five numbers at a time. This puts her at the same level as many pre-school children in Britain. Two Japanese researchers at Kyoto university trained Ai to use a touch sensitive screen and to recognise Arabic numerals. They then worked out a way of testing her memory. Adults can easily memorise phone numbers and post codes if they are up to seven items long. The \"magic number seven\" effect, as it is known, represents a limit to the number of items that can be handled simultaneously by the brain. The scientists, who were led by Nobuyuki Kawai and Tetsuro Matsuzawa, tested Ai to determine the equivalent \"magic number\" in a chimpanzee. They gave her a set of five numbers on the screen and asked her to choose them in ascending order - something she could already do with perfect accuracy. But once she had selected the first number, they masked the others with white squares. This meant that Ai also had to remember the numbers' positions. With tests involving four numbers, she scored 90% success. With five, she got things right 65% of the time. It was the second such demonstration of primate perceptiveness in 15 months. In 1998, a team at Columbia university in New York showed that rhesus monkeys could master mental arithmetic at least as well as a two-year-old child. Ai demonstrated not only that she understood the concept of numbers, she could also concentrate better than a two-year-old. \"In one testing session, after Ai had chosen the correct number and all the remaining items were masked by white squares, a fight broke out among a group of chimpanzees outside the room, accompanied by loud screaming,\" say the scientists. \"Ai abandoned her task and paid attention to the fight for about 20 seconds, after which she returned to the screen and completed the trial without error.\"",

      "bodyText": "Foreign office officials and Scotland Yard forensic experts were last night attempting to confirm reports that DNA tests carried out by Indian authorities proved that an exhumed body was that of the British backpacker Paul Wells, kidnapped by Kashmiri rebels five years ago. New tests on a body exhumed in the north of the region three and a half years ago appear to confirm it was that of the photography student from Blackburn, Lancashire, but they contradict earlier findings by the Metropolitan police who examined DNA and dental evidence in 1997 and 1998. Now the foreign office and police are considering a possible third round of DNA testing and forensic officers are on stand-by to fly out. Mr Wells was 24 when he was abducted along with six other tourists on a mountain trekking trip in July 1995 by members of Al-Faran, a previously unknown Islamic militant organisation and one of many groups fighting to separate the Himalayan region from India. One of their demands was the release of Maulana Masood Azhar - the man finally freed as a result of the Indian Airlines hi-jacking a week ago. Last night Mr Wells's mother, Diane, said while she was convinced Paul was dead the family was still upset by the confusion surrounding his disappearance. His father, Bob, said his son's memory had been \"betrayed\" by the release of Azhar. One of the hostages kidnapped with Mr Wells, an American, escaped and the body of another, from Norway, was found beheaded. The other hostages were last sighted in southern Kashmir in December 1995. Detectives investigating the case said Al-Faran was a front name for the Harkat-ul-Ansar group, one of the most prominent among groups fighting in Kashmir. The body Indian authorities now believe was Mr Wells was exhumed from Akingam, a village in southern Kashmir, in July 1997. Initial tests could not conclusively prove that the body was that of Mr Wells and it was flown to several cities in India before the central forensic science laboratory confirmed that the DNA of the body matched the blood samples of Wells's parents. The Harkat-ul-Ansar was renamed the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen after it was put on a list of terrorist organisations by the United States. The group is based in Pakistan.",

Christians continued - or so they believe - the narrative in the New Testament. Islam had its own prophet and its own stories about what God expected of us. But who is to say when the story ends? Dogma, a film now probably at a cinema near you, has Alanis Morissette playing God, since She is female, and a black actor (Chris Rock) playing Rufus, Jesus's 13th Disciple who was written out of history because he was black. Eat your heart out Salman Rushdie, the world is full of people who want to continue the story as if it belonged to them. </p> <p> The X Files (BBC1) - yes, I'm afraid it is back again, for the sixth time - is another neverending story and shows no signs of tiring of its debate between Faith and Doubt, personified respectively by Agents Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson). Will Mulder ever get it into his pretty little head that aliens don't exist? Will Scully, the Doubting Thomas of our age, ever accept that Mulder is right - aliens are in our midst and who knows what conspiracies have been woven around their existence? </p> <p>One of the strange things about The X Files is that its story of Faith and Doubt is not only played out between Mulder and Scully - the series itself has become a matter of faith. Do we believe in its creator Chris Carter, and his team of writers, or have we lost faith in the whole, long-winded project? Are we thrilled to be told that that the production of the series has moved to California? Can we give a damn? </p> <p>Last night's episode, The Beginning, is intended to bring us up to speed, to remind us where we've got to, what with Scully having been infected by an alien virus, and Mulder and Scully having seen (didn't you see the movie?) an alien spaceship pull itself out of a polar icecap and fly off into the skies. It is all very confusing. Even Mulder and Scully probably need time to warm up after the polar shenanigans. </p> <p>The Beginning turned out to be almost a parody of The X Files. Write me a letter (I've had a few rude ones lately) if I miss anything out, but here are some of the components: Scully lets Mulder down in front of an FBI board; the boy who can read other people's minds (and can therefore be used to find an alien who has hatched out of some poor human being) has been kid napped; meanwhile bad stuff is going down at a nuclear installation where the alien is hiding; Mulder and Scully have been taken off the X Files, the Cigarette Smoking Man (not to mention the Elders) are conspiring on overtime; and most of this episode seems to have been filmed in the dark (either that or aliens are interfering with my televi sion set). The truth is still out there but many a fan may be about to recant the faith. Hang on in there, friends tell me, it is going to get better. But how do I know my friends aren't aliens? </p> <p>Meanwhile, ITV has been telling us that \"Anyone can be a bomber. Anything can be a bomb.\" Bomber, as Nicholas Barber told us in G2 yesterday, had \"everything an audience could possibly want: sex, suspense and house-levelling explosions\". This, alas, was part of the problem - Rob Heyland's very professional script seemed too anxious to deliver everything the thriller genre demands. He also seemed to be short of a convincing bomber. The bomber in our midst might have been rented from a Stephen King novel. The first explosion was terrible; the last one laughable. </p> <p> My Mate Charlie (C4) was as appreciative of cocaine as Sherlock Homes was, but it didn't neglect the downside, all those rotting noses, ruined lives and bouts of paranoia. Regular users never know when they might be out in the garden looking in the bushes for the person who is out to get them. Maybe Agent Mulder is a sniffer and all those aliens are just a consequence of what has gone up his nose. The FBI should give him a blood test.</p>",

Write me a letter (I've had a few rude ones lately) if I miss anything out, but here are some of the components: Scully lets Mulder down in front of an FBI board; the boy who can read other people's minds (and can therefore be used to find an alien who has hatched out of some poor human being) has been kid napped; meanwhile bad stuff is going down at a nuclear installation where the alien is hiding; Mulder and Scully have been taken off the X Files, the Cigarette Smoking Man (not to mention the Elders) are conspiring on overtime; and most of this episode seems to have been filmed in the dark (either that or aliens are interfering with my televi sion set). The truth is still out there but many a fan may be about to recant the faith. Hang on in there, friends tell me, it is going to get better. But how do I know my friends aren't aliens? Meanwhile, ITV has been telling us that \"Anyone can be a bomber. Anything can be a bomb.\" Bomber, as Nicholas Barber told us in G2 yesterday, had \"everything an audience could possibly want: sex, suspense and house-levelling explosions\". This, alas, was part of the problem - Rob Heyland's very professional script seemed too anxious to deliver everything the thriller genre demands. He also seemed to be short of a convincing bomber. The bomber in our midst might have been rented from a Stephen King novel. The first explosion was terrible; the last one laughable. My Mate Charlie (C4) was as appreciative of cocaine as Sherlock Homes was, but it didn't neglect the downside, all those rotting noses, ruined lives and bouts of paranoia. Regular users never know when they might be out in the garden looking in the bushes for the person who is out to get them. Maybe Agent Mulder is a sniffer and all those aliens are just a consequence of what has gone up his nose. The FBI should give him a blood test.",

Her intervention, behind the scenes, prevented a lasting rift between Don Juan de Borbon, the rightful heir to the Spanish throne, and their son, Juan Carlos, chosen as successor by the victor in the 1936-39 civil war, General Franco.</p> <p>She proved decisive in consolidating the monarchy, and Spanish democracy, after the dictator's death, by persuading her husband to renounce all claim to the throne. \"Even though Juan never became King, and even though he was the rightful heir, to have our son become King meant continuity, which is the essential ingredient in a monarchy,\" Do\u00f1a Mercedes told a biographer.</p> <p>Her lack of pomp, and love of bullfighting and football, made her a popular figure in later years. She was born in Madrid, the daughter of Don Carlos de Borbon and his second wife, Luisa of France. She became a particular favourite of her father's cousin, King Alfonso XIII, who nicknamed her \"La Brava\" (Feisty) and gave her the title of Infanta, putting her on a par with his own children.</p> <p>When she was eight, the family moved to Seville and she developed a great love of Andalucia, becoming a keen horsewoman. But when Spain became a republic, in 1931, she was forced to go into exile, with the rest of the royal family.</p> <p>At a dance in Rome, she and her second cousin, Juan, who had become heir to the Spanish throne and was serving with the British Royal Navy, met again. He was taken with the tall, blonde, handsome woman he remembered as a child, and they married in 1935. After the second world war, they settled in Estoril, on the Portuguese coast near Lisbon, but temporary exile turned into decades of lonely isolation as Franco, who claimed he would restore the monarchy, played a nasty game of cat and mouse. The royal family were often short of money and relied on monarchist sympathisers for support.</p> <p>Do\u00f1a Mercedes comforted her husband and brought up four children, two boys and two girls, in a modest villa. Her strength of will ensured her daughter, Margarita, born blind, led as normal a life as possible. She later said one of the happiest days in her life was when Margarita married. The saddest was when her younger son died, accidentally, while playing with a shotgun with his brother.</p> <p>Don Juan's offer to fight with the nationalist side during the civil war had been rebuffed. So, too, was his intention, declared in 1945, to become \"King of all Spaniards\" and heal the rifts of war. Instead, Franco offered to take the couple's elder son, Juan Carlos, and educate him in Spain. Do\u00f1a Mercedes said she missed him so much that talking on the telephone became unbearable and they decided to write instead.</p> <p>In summer 1969, Juan Carlos telephoned his father to say Franco had appointed him future king.

      "bodyText": "Maria de las Mercedes de Borbon, who has died aged 90, was wife to a man who should have become king of Spain and mother to a son who, eventually, did. Her intervention, behind the scenes, prevented a lasting rift between Don Juan de Borbon, the rightful heir to the Spanish throne, and their son, Juan Carlos, chosen as successor by the victor in the 1936-39 civil war, General Franco. She proved decisive in consolidating the monarchy, and Spanish democracy, after the dictator's death, by persuading her husband to renounce all claim to the throne. \"Even though Juan never became King, and even though he was the rightful heir, to have our son become King meant continuity, which is the essential ingredient in a monarchy,\" Do\u00f1a Mercedes told a biographer. Her lack of pomp, and love of bullfighting and football, made her a popular figure in later years. She was born in Madrid, the daughter of Don Carlos de Borbon and his second wife, Luisa of France. She became a particular favourite of her father's cousin, King Alfonso XIII, who nicknamed her \"La Brava\" (Feisty) and gave her the title of Infanta, putting her on a par with his own children. When she was eight, the family moved to Seville and she developed a great love of Andalucia, becoming a keen horsewoman. But when Spain became a republic, in 1931, she was forced to go into exile, with the rest of the royal family. At a dance in Rome, she and her second cousin, Juan, who had become heir to the Spanish throne and was serving with the British Royal Navy, met again. He was taken with the tall, blonde, handsome woman he remembered as a child, and they married in 1935. After the second world war, they settled in Estoril, on the Portuguese coast near Lisbon, but temporary exile turned into decades of lonely isolation as Franco, who claimed he would restore the monarchy, played a nasty game of cat and mouse. The royal family were often short of money and relied on monarchist sympathisers for support. Do\u00f1a Mercedes comforted her husband and brought up four children, two boys and two girls, in a modest villa. Her strength of will ensured her daughter, Margarita, born blind, led as normal a life as possible. She later said one of the happiest days in her life was when Margarita married. The saddest was when her younger son died, accidentally, while playing with a shotgun with his brother. Don Juan's offer to fight with the nationalist side during the civil war had been rebuffed. So, too, was his intention, declared in 1945, to become \"King of all Spaniards\" and heal the rifts of war. Instead, Franco offered to take the couple's elder son, Juan Carlos, and educate him in Spain. Do\u00f1a Mercedes said she missed him so much that talking on the telephone became unbearable and they decided to write instead. In summer 1969, Juan Carlos telephoned his father to say Franco had appointed him future king. Don Juan considered that, in accepting without consultation, his son had betrayed him. Do\u00f1a Mercedes felt Franco had left her son no option and struggled to reunite the family. She and her husband watched Juan Carlos confirmed as king, by the Spanish parliament in 1975, on television in Paris, while they ate lunch. \"It was very moving,\" she said. Her discreet diplomacy continued and, in 1977, at a low-key ceremony in the King's private residence, Don Juan renounced all claim to the throne, bowing to his son and saying: \"For Spain, always for Spain, everything for Spain.

      "bodyText": "Rail managers tried to avert the head-on train crash in central Norway in which 20 people are feared to have died, but were unable to contact the drivers because their mobile telephone numbers had been lost, it was claimed yesterday. The state railway network confirmed that it was investigating reports that duty managers had been unable to warn the trains that they were speeding towards each other on the same track. \"Whether there was a lack of clarity about [mobile phone] usage, and whether this had any significance for the accident is among the issues that will be investigated,\" it said. The TV2 television station said controllers in the town of Hamar had realised the trains were on a collision course and tried to call the drivers. But, quoting anonymous sources, it said the list of mobile phone numbers was wrong. The section of track north of the capital Oslo where the accident occurred did not have a system that would automatically stop trains running into danger, but was due to be upgraded next year. Rescue workers yesterday found nine more bodies in the charred remains of the passenger trains but were unable to remove four of them as darkness slowed their efforts. Seven bodies were recovered on Tuesday, and police said four people were still missing - a total of 20 possible deaths. Twelve of the 30 injured remained in hospital, one in intensive care. Most of the rest were treated for broken bones. Flags flew at half mast at railway stations throughout the country yesterday. But Vidar Pedersen, the head of police operations on the scene, said the death toll looked like being much lower than the 35 estimated earlier. The police were working all-out to find the correct number of people on board the trains. \"We've said all along that the numbers were very uncertain,\" he said. One problem was that one train was a local shuttle, without a passenger list or count. Another problem was that some people with tickets for the other train had turned out not to have been on board. The two diesel trains crashed head-on on Tuesday near Rena, 110 miles north of Oslo. Each train was travelling at up to 55mph around a curve when they collided. Rescue workers said it could take days to recover all the bodies, many of which were badly burned. \"We are prying loose bodies. It is very hard work because they are so stuck in the wreckage,\" said Trond Simarud. \"We have to work millimetre by millimetre.\" After the accident fire engulfed both trains, burning for almost six hours and blocking rescue efforts. \"The worst thing to experience is to stand there and watch people burn _ going through that train and seeing people who were conscious who we couldn't help,\" said Ola Sunderaal, who was one of the first there. Military tents were set up at the site for search crews yesterday and the smell of smoke lingered in the crisp air. Three busloads of friends and relatives of the dead and missing arrived to place flowers and seek solace. Others gathered in nearby churches. Eight Britons and a Dutch couple were on board the train but all survived without serious injuries, a police spokesman, Per Ravnkleven, said. Britt Haugen Toth, of the Hedmark central hospital, said one British couple had been treated and released. AP",

So do many relationships in which couples live together without ever making it official. With so many break-ups, and few rules to follow about what to do when a relationship ends, it could be that announcing a trial separation is part of a new etiquette - a way of softening the blow for couples who do not want to hurt each other any further.

But marriage guidance counsellors, divorce lawyers and the few statistics which exist about trial separations agree that the odds are against it. The evidence is that, whatever couples say at the time, a trial separation is the beginning of the end - sometimes for the best of motives, such as wanting to avoid pain, and sometimes not. Relate, the counselling organisation for couples in trouble, carried out a study with the University of Newcastle some years ago which appears to bear this out: only a quarter of the couples in the study who came for help after embarking on a trial separation were still together six months after the counselling ended.</p> <p>So the omens are not good for a Fonda-Turner reconciliation. Vanessa Lloyd Platt, one of London's best-known divorce lawyers, would go even further. \"It's the American way of saying goodbye,\" she declares, shrieking with laughter. \"When celebrities say they're having a trial separation, they mean that lawyers are already on to it.\"</p> <p>According to Lloyd Platt, who deals with separating and divorcing couples every day of her working life, there is a crude gender divide here. \"When a woman says she needs a trial separation, she usually means a trial separation,\" she says. \"When a man says it, he usually means goodbye.\" It may be, though, that both partners really do mean the same thing, and what they are expressing is a reluctance to make the final break. Although no statistics are available on how many couples take this route as an eventual way out of a marriage or relationship that is not working, organisations such as Relate encounter it pretty frequently.</p> <p>\"I think that lots of people do opt for what they describe as separations,\" says Julia Cole, a Relate-trained couple counsellor and psychosexual therapist. \"Very often it's linked to a feeling that somehow they can't make the final decision to say the marriage is over. It's a bridging exercise to making the final emotional leap into divorce proceedings.\" Judy Cunnington, director of London Marriage Guidance, offers a slightly different perspective. \"As a rule of thumb,\" she says, \"once you've separated, it makes it more difficult to come back together.\"</p> <p>Separation, even if it is supposedly temporary, makes all the problems in the relationship public, she points out. \"Friends and relatives tend to take sides. Everybody gets very shaken up by it.\" If one partner spends the trial separation talking about what is wrong with the marriage, friends are likely to react with astonishment - \"What are you doing?\" - if the couple eventually decide to get back together. But she agrees with Cole that the most likely outcome is a permanent split: \"For probably the majority of people, it's a way to begin to make the separation.\"</p> <p>The experts' opinions are worth bearing in mind this month, because it is the time of year when thousands of people think seriously of bailing out of long-term relationships. \"This is our busiest time of year,\" says the irrepressible Lloyd Platt. \"We're competing with the first day of the Harrods sale.\" Cole says that Relate, too, always get an increase in the number of couples approaching them at the beginning of January. This year, because of the new millennium, they are anticipating more than ever.</p> <p>This means it is no accident that celebrities such as Turner and Fonda or the Gulzars have made their announcements this week. Lloyd Platt calls it \"matrimonial millennial madness - people seem to be desperate to make a new start, get rid of the old relationship and start again\". Depressingly, she blames the upsurge on the inability of men to handle women's success at work. The Turner-Fonda separation, she says, is a classic example of the problem: \"She's a political activist. He wanted a little wife at home. It doesn't work.\"</p> <p>The method they have chosen to try and resolve their difficulties may be fashionable, but the experts remain sceptical. \"There's a role for saying we need to cool down,\" says Cole, \"but there are ways of doing it which don't involve moving out, such as spending more time apart.\" She also urges couples who have children to exercise caution. \"All children hope, when their parents divorce, that they will get back together,\" she points out. A trial separation can be confusing and distressing if a parent does not return home after all.</p> <p>The motive for choosing a trial separation is no longer to do with the stigma of divorce but \"something much deeper\", believes Cunnington. It is about a sense of failure, of not wanting to admit that the relationship is completely finished. Yet she also points out that, for some couples, living separately actually helps the relationship work - and even allows them to be better parents. \"It's not always a bad thing,\" she says. While this is almost certainly true for a minority of couples, the majority view of trial separations is sobering. You may think you're being mature and sensible, but what you are really doing is embarking on the long goodbye.</p>",

HSBC lifts US presence HSBC boosted its presence in the United States yesterday by announcing that it has formed a relationship with the investment banking partnership Brown Brothers Harriman. The relationship involves HSBC using the research by Brown Brothers Harriman's equity analysts in the US and allows Brown Brothers, one of the last partnerships on Wall Street, to retain its independence. HSBC closed its own research operation in the US last year. New car prices fall by 1.9% New car prices fell 1.9% in November, compared with the same month in 1998 according to new figures. Alliance &amp; Leicester's monthly car price index, calculated in conjunction with What Car?, showed a 13.5% drop for one-year-old cars and a decline of 9.3% for cars more than three years old. Trevor Hilliard, managing director of retail financial services at A&amp;L, said: \"It would seem that manufacturers are now responding to mounting pressure from consumers, who, dissatisfied that prices are not falling fast enough, are holding back from making a car purchase.\" The pressure on retailers is expected to increase later this month when the competition commission publishes its report into industry pricing practices. Esat urges rejection of bid Esat, the Irish telecommunications group, yesterday urged shareholders to reject a $1.9bn (\u00a31.16bn) from Norway's Telenor. The Norwegian group, which had bid $1.6bn initially, raised its offer last week, but yesterday Esat said the new bid did not reflect Esat's true value. The Irish group said talks with other possible suitors were continuing though it declined to say how many companies it was talking to. Telenor first launched the Esat bid in conjunction with Sweden's Telia but was forced to go it alone when the planned merger between the two Nordic groups collapsed at the end of last year. Hyder accepts \u00a370m hit Hyder, the debt-ridden Welsh utility, yesterday bowed to pressure from shareholders and accepted tough price controls from water and electricity regulators that will knock \u00a370m off profits this year. The group, which last month cut its dividend by 60%, had been seen as one of the most likely to appeal against the 10% cut in water bills ordered by Ofwat chief, Ian Byatt. Hyder has to fund a \u00a31.3bn investment programme when its debts are \u00a31.7bn. The Hyder board was worried that it could face an even stiffer investment demand from the new Welsh assembly and environment agency. It is already shedding 1,000 jobs, nearly a fifth of its workforce.",

      "bodyText": "Two leading shareholders in Britain's Channel 5 said yesterday that they would seek to buy parts of an 18% stake in the television channel offered by US venture capital group Warburg Pincus. Britain's United News &amp; Media and European broadcaster CLT-Ufa - both 29% stakeholders in the two-year-old station - said they would apply to buy part of the stake, reported to be worth \u00a3171m. A spokesman for British media group Pearson, which owns a 24% stake in the channel, declined to comment. Channel 5 had asked for the groups to submit intentions by the end of business yesterday, and said that it would make a further announcement in a few days. United said it would apply to buy the stake despite concerns about breaching a cap on audience share if its planned \u00a37.8bn merger with Carlton Communications goes ahead. The combined United-Carlton group, according to recent figures, would have just below the 15% audience share allowed by British law. Channel 5's 5% viewing share would push the group over the limit, however a spokesman for United said it would leave that decision to a later date. \"We have to exercise our right today. We'll have the discussion with the regulator about whether we can continue to hold [the additional stake],\" the spokesman said. \"We think Channel 5 is a good thing and a good investment and we want to continue to hold that.\" The spokesman said that United would apply to buy just over a third of the Warburg stake, worth around \u00a3170m and valuing Channel 5 at \u00a3950m. CLT-Ufa, owned by Luxembourg-based holding company Audiofina and Germany's Bertelsmann , said that it had put in a bid to raise its stake in Channel 5. CLT-Ufa's interest in the British media market is well-known. The chairman of Audiofina said in December that CLT-Ufa still had to develop its British business and did not rule out further moves here. Last night the company put out a statement confirming that it had bid \u00a3170m for the full 18% holding. \"The final stake CLT-Ufa obtains ... depends on the extent to which other shareholders exercise their pre-emption rights,\" Audiofina said, adding that the move confirmed its intended strategy to become a \"major player\" in the British television market. Reports suggested the purchases would likely leave CLT-Ufa and United with 35% stakes, and Pearson with the remaining 30% if it bought the rest of the stake. The Warburg Pincus stake in Channel 5 had also attracted some other suitors. British pay-television company Flextech is said to have made an offer and pay-TV company BSkyB is also said to have looked at the stake but declined to make an offer. \u0095Pearson has appointed David Wan, previously chief executive at Penguin, as the new president of the publishing group.

      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola has persuaded its most senior black executive to stay with the beleaguered drinks company and help improve its battered public image after a series of public relations disasters. In his first significant move since being appointed as chief executive of the multinational company last month, Douglas Daft has appointed Carl Ware to head a new global public affairs and administration department. Mr Ware, the only non-white senior executive at the Atlanta-based group, announced his retirement two months ago after being passed over during a round of promotions. The move pointed to a reportedly strained relationship with the former chairman and chief executive, Douglas Ivester. Mr Ware's decision to return came as eight former and current employees launched a race discrimination lawsuit against the company. It also followed a series of public relations crises which included tussles with European regulators and the mishandling of a contamination scare on the continent. The crises prompted last month's departure of Mr Ivester, whose handling of the various issues had been judged to have appeared arrogant and out of touch. Mr Ware said yesterday that he was keen to focus on building better government relations, particularly in Europe where Coke has come under scrutiny over its competitive as well as social behaviour. The 26-year company veteran said he wanted to bring a \"fresh approach\" to all the areas he is now responsible for. The move by Coca-Cola was welcomed by the powerful African-American political lobby in Atlanta. Mr Daft said: \"Carl's principal role is to ensure that the Coca-Cola company continues to be welcome around the world, and that we apply 'community' and 'neighbour' equally to those who live next door or on the next continent.\" Mr Daft is also expected to make other organisational and management changes in an effort to turn around the ailing company.",

      "body": "<p>It is now almost 70 years since a gifted youngster from Chicago had a mysterious revelation about how to perform the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. A week before her 17th birthday she lost consciousness while sitting at the piano preparing to learn a new Bach prelude and fugue. When she came to, her approach to the composer's music had changed utterly. </p> <p>That teenager is now 85 years old and busies herself playing, teaching, writing and running a <a href=\"http://metrotel.co.uk/tbrf/\" target=\"_new\">Bach Research Foundation</a> from her Oxford home. Although long celebrated as one of the most notable Bach interpreters of her generation, Rosalyn Tureck does not consider herself a performer. \"That was never my goal,\" she says. \"I don't go out on stage to earn an ovation. My aim has always been to capture an inner world.\" She ponders momentarily. \"I can remember thinking along those lines even as an 11-year-old, contemplating a special world where others might join me. When I succeed, the audience knows immediately. I have walked off the stage at the Royal Festival Hall drunk with communication. In a sense, I haven't been 'playing' at all.\" </p> <p>Tureck has always taken an unconventional approach to music. At the age of 10 she was taken backstage at a concert by Lev Terman, the electronic-instrument inventor. She studied with him, and at 17 she made her Carnegie Hall debut playing his Theremin, the instrument that later gave the Beach Boys' Good Vibrations its eerie wailing sound. But during her teens she also flexed her muscles as a pianist, grappling with Brahms's massive Second Piano Concerto and experimenting with playing two Chopin studies simultaneously, one with each hand. </p> <p>Tureck's repertoire subsequently expanded to incorporate Alb\u00e9niz, Debussy and Stravinsky, but Bach would soon conquer all. Yet she was not alone in championing him. In 1955 Columbia/CBS (now Sony) launched a blockbuster - its now historic recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations by the Canadian-born pianist Glenn Gould. Suddenly, Tureck had a major rival. And if you hear the two pianists side by side (Gould recorded the Goldbergs twice, Tureck at least four times), you recognise certain similarities. \"He did notice some things that I did,\" Tureck concedes, \"but he had no idea of my reasons for doing them.\" </p> <p>As for the differences, she cites Gould's well-known penchant for detached notes, those crisp, clipped gestures that help make his playing so distinctive. Tureck would tell you that each Bach composition demands its own roster of colours and nuances, that detached notes should be subtly varied - which was definitely not Gould's style. </p> <p>Tureck continued to experiment with electronic instruments.

      "bodyText": "It is now almost 70 years since a gifted youngster from Chicago had a mysterious revelation about how to perform the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. A week before her 17th birthday she lost consciousness while sitting at the piano preparing to learn a new Bach prelude and fugue. When she came to, her approach to the composer's music had changed utterly. That teenager is now 85 years old and busies herself playing, teaching, writing and running a Bach Research Foundation from her Oxford home. Although long celebrated as one of the most notable Bach interpreters of her generation, Rosalyn Tureck does not consider herself a performer. \"That was never my goal,\" she says. \"I don't go out on stage to earn an ovation. My aim has always been to capture an inner world.\" She ponders momentarily. \"I can remember thinking along those lines even as an 11-year-old, contemplating a special world where others might join me. When I succeed, the audience knows immediately. I have walked off the stage at the Royal Festival Hall drunk with communication. In a sense, I haven't been 'playing' at all.\" Tureck has always taken an unconventional approach to music. At the age of 10 she was taken backstage at a concert by Lev Terman, the electronic-instrument inventor. She studied with him, and at 17 she made her Carnegie Hall debut playing his Theremin, the instrument that later gave the Beach Boys' Good Vibrations its eerie wailing sound. But during her teens she also flexed her muscles as a pianist, grappling with Brahms's massive Second Piano Concerto and experimenting with playing two Chopin studies simultaneously, one with each hand. Tureck's repertoire subsequently expanded to incorporate Alb\u00e9niz, Debussy and Stravinsky, but Bach would soon conquer all. Yet she was not alone in championing him. In 1955 Columbia/CBS (now Sony) launched a blockbuster - its now historic recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations by the Canadian-born pianist Glenn Gould. Suddenly, Tureck had a major rival. And if you hear the two pianists side by side (Gould recorded the Goldbergs twice, Tureck at least four times), you recognise certain similarities. \"He did notice some things that I did,\" Tureck concedes, \"but he had no idea of my reasons for doing them.\" As for the differences, she cites Gould's well-known penchant for detached notes, those crisp, clipped gestures that help make his playing so distinctive. Tureck would tell you that each Bach composition demands its own roster of colours and nuances, that detached notes should be subtly varied - which was definitely not Gould's style. Tureck continued to experiment with electronic instruments. She collaborated with Robert Moog, who gave her one of the eponymous synthesisers he first marketed in 1964. She in turn lectured on it at her New York Bach Institute, performing the same Bach sinfonia on, successively, a harpsichord, a clavichord, a piano and the Moog. On other occasions, she worked with Walter (later Wendy) Carlos, whose synthesiser recordings of Bach wowed an impressionable public back in the 70s and 80s. \"I knew him when he was 'him',\" she says, guardedly. \"He was very ingenious, and very clever.

One of them, made in the late 50s, is Vertigo, the strangest, most perverse movie he ever created. It was never really popular except with the critics. But for once one can confidently say they were right. </p> <p>The story has James Stewart as Scotty, a private eye cursed with a pathological fear of heights since being held responsible for the fatal fall of a fellow officer in the days when he was in the police. Hired to protect a threatened woman (Kim Novak), his \"weakness\", as the coroner puts it, stops him saving her from a suicidal leap. We know he was also in love with her. </p> <p>When he comes out of the institution in which he is undergoing treatment, he meets another woman who reminds him of his dead love (actually it is the same one, since her death was fabricated as cover for a murder). Obsessively he tries to make the woman resemble her previous incarnation. \"Couldn't you like me, just me, the way I am?\" she says after an uncomfortable shopping expedition. </p> <p>What he wants seems to be what Hitch himself always wanted - a blonde ice goddess. And the film seems to fit perfectly into its director's own view of sexuality, which seldom reaches beyond an unrequited obsession that virtually deranges those in thrall to it. But the film isn't just about that. Scotty and his woman are caught up in more than their slightly lunatic affair. The plot twists and turns around the original murder with almost Gothic abandon until its famous, and superbly shot and edited, climax in the belltower. </p> <p>You could call Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho an unequalled trilogy about voyeurism or, if you want to be more orthodox, a set of films forcing ordinary audiences to admit their unordinary fears. Hitchcock's great films, as the critic David Thomson says, are only partly his. They also belong to the minds of those who interpret them. </p> <p>However you look at them, they do at least prove that Hitch was a director whose art consisted of considerably more than a vast knowledge of the tricks of his trade and a consuming ambition to play with the susceptibilities of his audiences. There is a coldness alongside his calculations, it is true. But the essential greatness remains. You can see it as well as anywhere in Vertigo, made all the more noteworthy by Bernard Herrmann's ghost-ridden score, Robert Burks's sharp-etched cinematography and, above all, the scaled-down eloquence of James Stewart's central performance. </p> <p>Vertigo is a great film.

And the elegant joy with which she lived her life came to her so naturally - in the delight she took in the highest forms of culture, especially music, in her house in Italy surrounded even in the hottest summer by its cool green lawn, in her always beautifully styled appearance, but above all in producing at Thames and Hudson books that attested to her great respect for high culture - one might have imagined nothing had happened to her to cause anything but total delight in the world. </p> <p>In fact, Eva, who has died aged 91, survived world horrors. She spoke about these horrors both with gravity and - not a contradiction - almost a lightness of tone, sometimes with a delicate snort of laughter. She would never, she said, have become what she became if it hadn't been for that chap in Germany, meaning Hitler. For it was because of the Nazis that she, her second husband Wilhelm Feuchtwang and their baby son Stephan left Berlin, where she was born and brought up, to come to England. </p> <p>Feuchtwang had in fact been arrested as a Jew by the Gestapo, but because he was Austrian and Hitler had not yet taken over Austria, he, technically a foreigner, was released; but he and his family left the day of the Anschluss, and later he learned that some hours later the Gestapo had come again to arrest him. </p> <p>In London, Eva and her son Stephan lived in dim rooms, and she worked as a domestic; her husband was interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man at the outbreak of war. In the camp he became friendly with a German Jewish inmate, Walter Neurath, who had been living in England for some time. Working for the book \"packager\" Adprint, Neurath had been responsible for a series, Britain In Pictures, which was seen as proof of his loyalty to Britain, and he was released. He was asked by Feuchtwang, who remained interned, to help his wife and son, and Walter Neurath not only found Eva a job at Adprint, but started, in 1949, the publishing house Thames and Hudson with her. They married, and on the death of Walter Neurath in 1967 Eva became chairman, a term she insisted on using for herself. </p> <p>She was the first exponent of the \"integrated spread\" - the integration of text and illustrations. Her great expertise was in quality colour reproduction of works of art. She would often go far out of her way to oversee the printing of a book expressly to adjust the colour of the reproductions. One of the last great efforts she made was, over three sleepless nights, to approve every sheet of the catalogue of the 1985 Francis Bacon Tate Gallery retrospective. </p> <p>Often interrupting her talk with a nasal \"Hum?\" which, it seemed, was a way of making sure one was keeping up with her, Eva was vivid in recounting stories from her life. If one were having a meal with her in her home, her stories could include her asking one to go to the wine cellar for another bottle of wine which might for a moment be seen not as a sudden request but yet another turn in the story. When the story all came together, it was very impressive, not only for Eva's constant, finely controlling awareness of all the elements that would, finally, make a whole, rich narrative, but for the evocative details: from her childhood in Berlin, the detail of being accidentally stuck in the eye with the nib of a pen, the detail of listening to her older sister play the piano in another room, the detail of her mother coming into her room to say goodnight before going off for the evening. </p> <p>And if Eva was, by nature, open with one, she expected one to be open with her. She might ask someone she had just met about his relationship with a lover, and, on seeing the expression of amazement, reassure the person \"I don't mean your sexual relationship. I mean your night-time relationship.\" This might cause more amazement unless one knew that Eva was very attracted to Jungian analysis and notions. </p> <p>Having left school aged 14, identifying with the Jewish students who were being expelled, Eva was largely an autodidact. In her home, among her beautiful Biedermeier furniture, one would almost always find her reading a book by, say, Heine, in German of course. And when interviewing a prospective editor for a position at Thames and Hudson, she might talk with him, not about publishing, but the late quartets of Beethoven. </p> <p>She was an intelligent woman with a strong will, a will backed by equally strong loyalty. She did not indulge sentimentality, but her loyalty found expression in passionate enthusiasm and great affection. One might be standing before her, talking about an opera performance one had been to with her, when, suddenly, she would, with a quick, elegant movement of her wrist, grasp one's chin and, smiling, kiss one on the lips. </p> <p>On her death bed, she said, \"I know that I'm dying, but my mind won't let me.\" She was still living in the present and still fighting for life. </p> <p>Her son Stephan Feuchtwang is an eminent anthropologist of China at London university. Thomas Neurath, the son of Walter Neurath from his previous marriage is Thames and Hudson's managing director, and Connie Kaine, Walter Neurath's daughter, is director of design in the publishing house.

I can't remember any dreams in my life. There's so much strange in real life that it often seems like a dream.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> There's a strong theme of mentors in your work, for example Vincent Price. What is it about those actors which gives you such inspiration?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> It's people who you've seen that have given you a lot. In some ways I felt they helped me psychologically because you see these people up on the screen going through torment and being on the outside and somehow you relate to them and it helps you get through life. It's a real honour and pleasure to then meet these people. I've found that the people who play villains are the nicest people in the world and people who play heroes are jerks. It's like people who play villains work out all their problems on screen and then they're just really wonderful people. I think Michael Gough thought I was always laughing at him because of the costume but I was just looking at him thinking, \"He was in Horrors of the Black Museum and Konga - these are my favourite films!\" It just makes me really happy.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> The thing you said you liked most about Ed Wood was that he was enthusiastic about everything. I'm probably going to paraphrase you but you said that \"The lovely thing about Ed Wood movies was he didn't let bad acting, bad sets or even bad takes get in the way of telling the story\". Do you think the enthusiasm he and you have is rare in Hollywood directors?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I would think it was common because with all the stuff you go through that's the only bit of positive energy you can get. If someone had said you going to do a movie where people are dressed like George Washington with all these wigs, [I'd never have believed it], but you see all these great people dressed in these weird costumes and you can't help but get a weird energy from that.</p> <p> <strong>MK:</strong> How does your relationship with Danny Elfman [composer] work? Do you go and sing the thing to him?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I don't sing to anybody. We've gone through it all together. The first movie he scored was the first movie I did and he adds another character to it, he helps to set the tone.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Sleepy Hollow has a very particular look, it's somewhere between black and white and colour. What have you and the cinematographer [Emmanuel Lubezki] done to get that semi-sepia bleached look?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> He's a Mexican we had the luxury of using Mexican horror wrestling films as our inspiration. In fact we often thought we were making a Mexican wrestling movie - the most expensive Mexican wrestling movie ever! We did a lot of testing before we shot to get the right feeling and tone so we tested colours and fabrics and make-up a lot.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> But what is that colour, because it's not Hammer colour, it's something else.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> We did a slight bleaching process to the film which is being done a lot now but we tried to find the right tone of it and then it was just down to the fabrics and the tone and the lighting schemes and the compositions. We didn't really know what we were getting until we did enough tests and thought \"Let's go for this zone right here\" but each day it would change, anyway. </p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Do the financiers always understand what you're doing and take it on the assumption that because it's you it's going to be good?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> It helps being 10,000 miles away! And I don't answer my phone too often so that also helps. But they were really supportive on this. There were times that I go through when it's not always that way, but all the way up through the rating they were right there and I appreciated that because they could have easily have said, \"Cut this, do that, put a head on the headless horseman all the time, take out all the head shots\" - which was the only way we could have gotten a lesser rating. </p> <p><strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton1.RA\">Sleepy Hollow's rating and prescriptive censors</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burtons.RA\">'Do you dream like a German expressionist director?'</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton3.RA\">How Burton directs</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton4.RA\">Getting his own back on high-school jocks</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton5.RA\">Watching his own movies</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton6.RA\">The internet</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton7.RA\">Working with Johnny Depp</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton8.RA\">'How much of what we see on screen is that vision in your head?'</a></p>",

MK: How does your relationship with Danny Elfman [composer] work? Do you go and sing the thing to him? TB: I don't sing to anybody. We've gone through it all together. The first movie he scored was the first movie I did and he adds another character to it, he helps to set the tone. MK: Sleepy Hollow has a very particular look, it's somewhere between black and white and colour. What have you and the cinematographer [Emmanuel Lubezki] done to get that semi-sepia bleached look? TB: He's a Mexican we had the luxury of using Mexican horror wrestling films as our inspiration. In fact we often thought we were making a Mexican wrestling movie - the most expensive Mexican wrestling movie ever! We did a lot of testing before we shot to get the right feeling and tone so we tested colours and fabrics and make-up a lot. MK: But what is that colour, because it's not Hammer colour, it's something else. TB: We did a slight bleaching process to the film which is being done a lot now but we tried to find the right tone of it and then it was just down to the fabrics and the tone and the lighting schemes and the compositions. We didn't really know what we were getting until we did enough tests and thought \"Let's go for this zone right here\" but each day it would change, anyway. MK: Do the financiers always understand what you're doing and take it on the assumption that because it's you it's going to be good? TB: It helps being 10,000 miles away! And I don't answer my phone too often so that also helps. But they were really supportive on this. There were times that I go through when it's not always that way, but all the way up through the rating they were right there and I appreciated that because they could have easily have said, \"Cut this, do that, put a head on the headless horseman all the time, take out all the head shots\" - which was the only way we could have gotten a lesser rating.

      "body": "<p><strong>MK:</strong> Do you feel proud of your work as a whole? The film that never clicked for me was Batman because it doesn't feel as if it is specifically your film. On the other hand I love Mars Attacks. In Europe you can go \"Ak, Ak\" [Mars Attacks alien noise!] and everyone knows what it is, but in America that's not the case. Are your films all equal children?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Yeah, they're all as you say, bodies. I feel close to all of them. It's hard to look at them for a while because you just experience how cold it was that day or how that horse wasn't there at that point. It takes a while to watch it and feel it more objectively.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> After Beetlejuice there was a huge outcry when you wanted to cast Michael Keaton for Batman, but you said you knew he could act the part. Do you think you have a particularly close affinity with your actors?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I've liked everybody I've worked with because I'm not really very verbal and up until recently I just sat and didn't really speak much so when you see these great actors bringing things to life that's where I get a lot of positive energy and I've been very lucky to work with people that surprise you and when you deal with the technicalities of these films it's really the thing that keeps the sun shining. You do four takes and all of the people on Sleepy Hollow give it four different levels of things. I wish we could play all of the takes of some of these people because they are so interesting.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> What's going to happen to Conversations with Vincent - the documentary you shot with Vincent Price? </p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I had trouble with the rights with some of the clips and it's been so long now that I want to revisit it and maybe think of it in another context. But it's some of the last footage of him so I would like to get it up sometime.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Your films have such a specific style that I imagined that you would get up and say to an actor \"I want this and I want that\", but that's not what you do?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I don't think so. I sort of leave my body so I don't know what I do exactly. When I'm talking to people I see them trying to follow something that I've tried to say and then they usually go [shrugs shoulders] and say \"Yeah\" [ in vague voice] and go off and do something great! I'm not quite sure what I do, I wave my arms around a lot but I'm not sure if any of it's meaningful in any way.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> We read all the time that a Tim Burton film is the world seen through a child's eyes, and in Sleepy Hollow you're not particularly reverential about children.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> That one scene in the film where the little one gets it (Laughter). We used to have endless conversations in our neighbourhood and in my school we wouldn't go and see movies with kids in them because we hated the way kids were portrayed - they were always given a break, they were always treated cuter. We always loved it when kids were treated like everybody else and so that's what we did here - he gets the same treatment as everyone else. People forget that kids are intelligent and they like to be treated with - well this [Sleepy Hollow] isn't necessarily intelligent - but not given the cutesy treatment.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Do you think you putting on screen a genuine version of that child's eye view because another thing you said was that you hated being referred to as a child because it sounds like a retard.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> [Laughs]Yeah, it's kind of a dismissal but the thing about that time of life is that things are new and interesting and you're not aware of things on an intellectual level yet, you're reacting to things more emotionally which I think is an interesting thing. As you get older you go through experiences and it gets the same and usual, so it is nice to try to keep that sense of things where everything seems a little strange and weird and unusual from that time which it does.</p> <p>TK: There is a quality of non-judgmentalism in your films which is child-like, you present something strange and people just accept it. You said once in the case of Ed Wood that your favourite scene was when he meets his wife and he says, \"I'm a transvestite\" and she says, \"Okay\".</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> That's a really quiet moment, but it's one of my favourites. From very early on there was this constant desire for people to categorise people, and I always thought that was something of a dismissal, it doesn't allow people to be who they are and show different sides of their personality. So when people are open and not judgmental I just find that really beautiful and great and somewhat rare.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> There's also an element of wish-fulfilment in for example Edward Scissorhands where the jock gets it. It's like the outsider now watching those people now failing.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> YEAH! Well, you talk to a lot of film-makers and you realise that they're all the people who couldn't get dates in high school and there is a lot of pent-up \"I knew those people would peak in high school\". I just think it's part of the creative spirit.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Has Superman fallen by the wayside? What happened?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I worked on that for a year and I'm sure they'll do it at some point - once they get all their fast food things lined up. That's the problem with these things. In the first Batman you didn't hear the word 'franchise' and these movies are hard to make but they make it harder when they come at it the other way round. It was something that had never happened to me before. When you work hard on something and it doesn't happen it's hard to go back.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Is Sleepy Hollow a reaction to your experiences on Superman?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Yes, all those heads are studio executives [Laughter]. Well you know the poster: 'Heads will roll' that's our motto!</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> What is your next project?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I'm still on this really. You spend so much time on a film you want to take a deep breath and have a feeling inside that you can sustain for a couple of years. </p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> When you see the film now is it the film you wanted to make?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I can't watch it right now. I'll watch it in three years and really enjoy it. But I feel really good about it, I enjoyed this, I enjoyed the people, it was the first time to specifically deal with this kind of imagery and it was a great team of artists and that always makes you remember why you love doing it. </p> <p><strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton1.RA\">Sleepy Hollow's rating and prescriptive censors</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burtons.RA\">'Do you dream like a German expressionist director?'</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton3.RA\">How Burton directs</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton4.RA\">Getting his own back on high-school jocks</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton5.RA\">Watching his own movies</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton6.RA\">The internet</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton7.RA\">Working with Johnny Depp</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burton/Burton8.RA\">'How much of what we see on screen is that vision in your head?'</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "MK: Do you feel proud of your work as a whole? The film that never clicked for me was Batman because it doesn't feel as if it is specifically your film. On the other hand I love Mars Attacks. In Europe you can go \"Ak, Ak\" [Mars Attacks alien noise!] and everyone knows what it is, but in America that's not the case. Are your films all equal children? TB: Yeah, they're all as you say, bodies. I feel close to all of them. It's hard to look at them for a while because you just experience how cold it was that day or how that horse wasn't there at that point. It takes a while to watch it and feel it more objectively. MK: After Beetlejuice there was a huge outcry when you wanted to cast Michael Keaton for Batman, but you said you knew he could act the part. Do you think you have a particularly close affinity with your actors? TB: I've liked everybody I've worked with because I'm not really very verbal and up until recently I just sat and didn't really speak much so when you see these great actors bringing things to life that's where I get a lot of positive energy and I've been very lucky to work with people that surprise you and when you deal with the technicalities of these films it's really the thing that keeps the sun shining. You do four takes and all of the people on Sleepy Hollow give it four different levels of things. I wish we could play all of the takes of some of these people because they are so interesting. MK: What's going to happen to Conversations with Vincent - the documentary you shot with Vincent Price? TB: I had trouble with the rights with some of the clips and it's been so long now that I want to revisit it and maybe think of it in another context. But it's some of the last footage of him so I would like to get it up sometime. MK: Your films have such a specific style that I imagined that you would get up and say to an actor \"I want this and I want that\", but that's not what you do? TB: I don't think so. I sort of leave my body so I don't know what I do exactly. When I'm talking to people I see them trying to follow something that I've tried to say and then they usually go [shrugs shoulders] and say \"Yeah\" [ in vague voice] and go off and do something great! I'm not quite sure what I do, I wave my arms around a lot but I'm not sure if any of it's meaningful in any way. MK: We read all the time that a Tim Burton film is the world seen through a child's eyes, and in Sleepy Hollow you're not particularly reverential about children. TB: That one scene in the film where the little one gets it (Laughter). We used to have endless conversations in our neighbourhood and in my school we wouldn't go and see movies with kids in them because we hated the way kids were portrayed - they were always given a break, they were always treated cuter. We always loved it when kids were treated like everybody else and so that's what we did here - he gets the same treatment as everyone else. People forget that kids are intelligent and they like to be treated with - well this [Sleepy Hollow] isn't necessarily intelligent - but not given the cutesy treatment. MK: Do you think you putting on screen a genuine version of that child's eye view because another thing you said was that you hated being referred to as a child because it sounds like a retard. TB: [Laughs]Yeah, it's kind of a dismissal but the thing about that time of life is that things are new and interesting and you're not aware of things on an intellectual level yet, you're reacting to things more emotionally which I think is an interesting thing. As you get older you go through experiences and it gets the same and usual, so it is nice to try to keep that sense of things where everything seems a little strange and weird and unusual from that time which it does. TK: There is a quality of non-judgmentalism in your films which is child-like, you present something strange and people just accept it. You said once in the case of Ed Wood that your favourite scene was when he meets his wife and he says, \"I'm a transvestite\" and she says, \"Okay\". TB: That's a really quiet moment, but it's one of my favourites. From very early on there was this constant desire for people to categorise people, and I always thought that was something of a dismissal, it doesn't allow people to be who they are and show different sides of their personality. So when people are open and not judgmental I just find that really beautiful and great and somewhat rare. MK: There's also an element of wish-fulfilment in for example Edward Scissorhands where the jock gets it. It's like the outsider now watching those people now failing. TB: YEAH! Well, you talk to a lot of film-makers and you realise that they're all the people who couldn't get dates in high school and there is a lot of pent-up \"I knew those people would peak in high school\". I just think it's part of the creative spirit. MK: Has Superman fallen by the wayside? What happened? TB: I worked on that for a year and I'm sure they'll do it at some point - once they get all their fast food things lined up. That's the problem with these things. In the first Batman you didn't hear the word 'franchise' and these movies are hard to make but they make it harder when they come at it the other way round. It was something that had never happened to me before. When you work hard on something and it doesn't happen it's hard to go back. MK: Is Sleepy Hollow a reaction to your experiences on Superman? TB: Yes, all those heads are studio executives [Laughter]. Well you know the poster: 'Heads will roll' that's our motto! MK: What is your next project? TB: I'm still on this really. You spend so much time on a film you want to take a deep breath and have a feeling inside that you can sustain for a couple of years. MK: When you see the film now is it the film you wanted to make? TB: I can't watch it right now. I'll watch it in three years and really enjoy it. But I feel really good about it, I enjoyed this, I enjoyed the people, it was the first time to specifically deal with this kind of imagery and it was a great team of artists and that always makes you remember why you love doing it.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Was the windmill scene in Sleepy Hollow a homage to Brides of Frankenstein?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Yes, and to Frankenstein. The great thing about those visual horror films is there's real potential for strong, beautiful imagery. It's the one genre that really lends itself to creating strong images. And I've always loved that idea of windmills - your mind aimlessly spinning. I don't know what the symbolism of it is but it's beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Do you feel that the extensive coverage that Sleepy Hollow has received on the internet is be a good thing?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> All technology can be used for good and evil and I think it's got its positives and its negatives. I always long for the days when I used to go and see films and you didn't know anything about them. There is something amazing and beautiful to experience something without knowing the budget and everything about it. People are interested so you have to go along with it, but I do miss that seeing something and being surprised and not knowing anything about it.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Is it intrusive?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> It's strange because I've read on the internet all these projects I'm meant to be doing I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like I have a psychotic or evil twin doing things on my behalf and I don't know about it. </p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Yes you're meant to be doing The Naked Civil Servant.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Yeah, I read that and it's like \"Jesus, What the Urghh! What's going on?\". And there's something about the printed word, whether it's gossip or not somehow it has a reality to it which sometimes a little bit frightening.</p> <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> How important is humour in grotesque films?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Humour was important to us and it's a difficult balance because when you're trying to make something funny and it's also grotesque and you're also trying to keep a dramatic thrust and it's also slightly heightened you're never sure what you're getting. That's why I never like to say whether something is a drama or a comedy - just to keep yourself covered just in case it's not funny you can always say it was a drama. But when you see these great people dressed this way there's a certain absurdity. I just thought it would come across as so ludicrous if [Sleepy Hollow] tried to be completely, completely serious but they all found the right balance and the right tone of it and it's always interesting to mix those things together.</p> <p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What modern Hollywood films do you enjoy?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> When you're working on a film it's hard to go and see films. You don't get out of an 18 hour day and go: \"I wanna go and see a movie!\". But it does seem like it's a good time, it seems like a positive time, there's low-budget films and there's more of a wealth of different types of things that are happening so I haven't much lately. I hope to go out now and catch up on things.</p> <p><strong>Question 5:</strong> How did you first get to work with Johnny Depp, and what's he like to work with?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> First of all there was Edward Scissorhands, and he's got these eyes which a silent actor would have and it's nice to work with people who can convey things that way and that character [Edward Scissorhands] really needed that. Johnny was doing this TV show where he's perceived as this teenage heartthrob and he's not that type of a person, so he really understood the dynamics of the character. He didn't speak in that, and in Ed Wood he wouldn't shut up! And he doesn't care how he looks and there's a freedom to that. I remember in Ed Wood his inspiration was Ronald Reagan and I was thinking of a ventriloquist's dummy! And you put those together and he's really good about picking up on that stuff. In [Sleepy Hollow] we were quite excited about the first male action adventure hero as portrayed by a 13-year-old girl, so he gets all those of weird elements in there together and it's quite fun to watch from film to film. </p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Didn't Scott Rudin [producer] say that in every film Johnny Depp is in with you that he is you? </p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I don't think that, because I like to see these characters for who they are and I think I would get uncomfortable if I ever felt that way I would turn in another direction. I like to relate to the characters and feel them to a degree.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> In the press notes to Sleepy Hollow it says, \"in the mould of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro\" so that's the thing you're in now.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> All I know is that I love working with him and he's great, and each time it gets better because you see something new and that's what I love about film. </p> <p><strong>Question 6:</strong> What's with the pumpkin heads in all your movies?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Well, you know when you come from Southern California you try to create what you don't have and we didn't have weather, we didn't have texture, it was always sunny - no seasons. I think it is desire to create the things that are missing in your life.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> The pumpkin thing is an American thing rather than an European thing isn't it?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> It's a symbol of the Fall which is one of my favourite times of year. It's the shortest time but it's also somehow magical and exciting.</p> <p><strong>Question 7:</strong> What else do you enjoy in life apart from movies?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I like drawing, I like to travel. I find there's just not enough time to space out and I think that's where you end up doing your best work when you're not having to think about something and you're able sit back and look at things because things move so fast it seems now that the time of doing that and thinking and looking at things in a strange way is quite helpful and enjoyable.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Haven't you just written a book?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> A year ago I did a mental patient poetry book.</p> <p><strong>Question 8:</strong> You said that making a movie is the most out of control things you can do. Apart from the actors is there anyone else you particularly like working with?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> The problem with film is you never know when you're going to be able to make a film so you can't have people waiting around for you. Sometimes it's fun to work with the same people and work with new people and mix it up, and I really enjoyed this [Sleepy Hollow] because it really was an international cast and crew and you really feel close to the people you're working with and it's great to mix it up now and then and sometimes you have to. Working with the same people is fun because you get to see them try different things as well and that be as exciting as working with somebody new who is surprising you for the first time.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> And you've developed relationships with people you worked with at Disney, these relationships go back 20 years.</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Yes, and it's really nice to work with people who understand and really love the artistry of building sets, it's great.</p> <p><strong>Question 9:</strong> How long is it before you view films back, and are they what you imagined before?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Three years, and the further away they get the more I like them. I don't know exactly what that dynamic is but it ends up coming full circle to how I felt about it at the beginning. But working on a film you just see so much of it all of the time and it becomes like Chinese water torture you feel this drip on your forehead endlessly and it takes a while to get over that.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> And how much of what we see on the screen is that vision in your head?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> It is out of control and I think the best thing you can do is hope for is something closely in the zone of it but that's what I love about the B films, it's great when you see the inconsistencies because it somehow makes it more human in a way. I find those films very appealing, they feel much more human to me.</p> <p><strong>Question 10:</strong> Do you think there will be an end to the mindless blockbuster?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> This one feeds into that a little bit but somehow it feels like an interesting time. I think there will always be those types of films, but I think there might be more different types of films to go along with it so there is more of a choice. You can maybe just avoid those ones and go and see some of the others which I think there'll be more of.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> How out of step are you with mainstream Hollywood?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> You have meetings with executives and they all talk about blockbusters, but the absurd thing is that if anyone knew exactly what that was they'd all be like that. They pretend they know what they're talking about but the thing is to be passionate about it and try and do something that you want to do but that's always a problem, that weird pretending and thinking, like Ichabod pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't.</p> <p><strong>Question 11:</strong> Are you going to publish any more of your artwork or photography?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Yeah, it's great doing it and not be chained to an animation table and have the opportunity to do it when I can and I do love it. It's a sort of therapy, helping me to think and I hope I'll always do it. If it's not too bad I guess some of it will get published. Right now I just use it as a great form of thinking and enjoyment, and as long as I don't have to draw those foxes I'm fine!</p> <p><strong>Question 12:</strong> Who are the people who inspire you now?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I always consider my prime film-going experience early on because I think those are the times when things remain with you for your whole life. People from the monster movies and people with whom you can identify when you see their film that they're able to have a feeling that's theirs and anyone who can get that across in film. Luckily there's too many to mention.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Is there anyone you particularly admire that you've never had the chance to work with or meet?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Meeting the people is sometimes scary because you don't know what it's going to be like sometimes it's best just to have that memory and the feeling of the work that they done.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Had you met Christopher Lee before Sleepy Hollow?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> No, that was amazing because two hours went by and I realised I had been hypnotised by Dracula (Laughter)</p> <p><strong>Question 13:</strong> If you weren't a film-maker what would you be doing?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> Be in jail probably! I don't know, I'd probably still have my restaurant job.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> Were you any good at school?</p> <p><strong>TB:</strong> I was part of a weird group of kids who got our energy from trying to get through school without doing anything. That's what directing is like in a way, this kind of hovering about! We tried to fake the report I did okay but it was kind of sociopathic.

      "bodyText": "Question 1: Was the windmill scene in Sleepy Hollow a homage to Brides of Frankenstein? TB: Yes, and to Frankenstein. The great thing about those visual horror films is there's real potential for strong, beautiful imagery. It's the one genre that really lends itself to creating strong images. And I've always loved that idea of windmills - your mind aimlessly spinning. I don't know what the symbolism of it is but it's beautiful. Question 2: Do you feel that the extensive coverage that Sleepy Hollow has received on the internet is be a good thing? TB: All technology can be used for good and evil and I think it's got its positives and its negatives. I always long for the days when I used to go and see films and you didn't know anything about them. There is something amazing and beautiful to experience something without knowing the budget and everything about it. People are interested so you have to go along with it, but I do miss that seeing something and being surprised and not knowing anything about it. MK: Is it intrusive? TB: It's strange because I've read on the internet all these projects I'm meant to be doing I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like I have a psychotic or evil twin doing things on my behalf and I don't know about it. MK: Yes you're meant to be doing The Naked Civil Servant. TB: Yeah, I read that and it's like \"Jesus, What the Urghh! What's going on?\". And there's something about the printed word, whether it's gossip or not somehow it has a reality to it which sometimes a little bit frightening. Question 3: How important is humour in grotesque films? TB: Humour was important to us and it's a difficult balance because when you're trying to make something funny and it's also grotesque and you're also trying to keep a dramatic thrust and it's also slightly heightened you're never sure what you're getting. That's why I never like to say whether something is a drama or a comedy - just to keep yourself covered just in case it's not funny you can always say it was a drama. But when you see these great people dressed this way there's a certain absurdity. I just thought it would come across as so ludicrous if [Sleepy Hollow] tried to be completely, completely serious but they all found the right balance and the right tone of it and it's always interesting to mix those things together. Question 4: What modern Hollywood films do you enjoy? TB: When you're working on a film it's hard to go and see films. You don't get out of an 18 hour day and go: \"I wanna go and see a movie!\". But it does seem like it's a good time, it seems like a positive time, there's low-budget films and there's more of a wealth of different types of things that are happening so I haven't much lately. I hope to go out now and catch up on things. Question 5: How did you first get to work with Johnny Depp, and what's he like to work with? TB: First of all there was Edward Scissorhands, and he's got these eyes which a silent actor would have and it's nice to work with people who can convey things that way and that character [Edward Scissorhands] really needed that. Johnny was doing this TV show where he's perceived as this teenage heartthrob and he's not that type of a person, so he really understood the dynamics of the character. He didn't speak in that, and in Ed Wood he wouldn't shut up! And he doesn't care how he looks and there's a freedom to that. I remember in Ed Wood his inspiration was Ronald Reagan and I was thinking of a ventriloquist's dummy! And you put those together and he's really good about picking up on that stuff. In [Sleepy Hollow] we were quite excited about the first male action adventure hero as portrayed by a 13-year-old girl, so he gets all those of weird elements in there together and it's quite fun to watch from film to film. MK: Didn't Scott Rudin [producer] say that in every film Johnny Depp is in with you that he is you? TB: I don't think that, because I like to see these characters for who they are and I think I would get uncomfortable if I ever felt that way I would turn in another direction. I like to relate to the characters and feel them to a degree. MK: In the press notes to Sleepy Hollow it says, \"in the mould of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro\" so that's the thing you're in now. TB: All I know is that I love working with him and he's great, and each time it gets better because you see something new and that's what I love about film. Question 6: What's with the pumpkin heads in all your movies? TB: Well, you know when you come from Southern California you try to create what you don't have and we didn't have weather, we didn't have texture, it was always sunny - no seasons. I think it is desire to create the things that are missing in your life. MK: The pumpkin thing is an American thing rather than an European thing isn't it? TB: It's a symbol of the Fall which is one of my favourite times of year. It's the shortest time but it's also somehow magical and exciting. Question 7: What else do you enjoy in life apart from movies? TB: I like drawing, I like to travel. I find there's just not enough time to space out and I think that's where you end up doing your best work when you're not having to think about something and you're able sit back and look at things because things move so fast it seems now that the time of doing that and thinking and looking at things in a strange way is quite helpful and enjoyable. MK: Haven't you just written a book? TB: A year ago I did a mental patient poetry book. Question 8: You said that making a movie is the most out of control things you can do. Apart from the actors is there anyone else you particularly like working with? TB: The problem with film is you never know when you're going to be able to make a film so you can't have people waiting around for you. Sometimes it's fun to work with the same people and work with new people and mix it up, and I really enjoyed this [Sleepy Hollow] because it really was an international cast and crew and you really feel close to the people you're working with and it's great to mix it up now and then and sometimes you have to. Working with the same people is fun because you get to see them try different things as well and that be as exciting as working with somebody new who is surprising you for the first time. MK: And you've developed relationships with people you worked with at Disney, these relationships go back 20 years. TB: Yes, and it's really nice to work with people who understand and really love the artistry of building sets, it's great. Question 9: How long is it before you view films back, and are they what you imagined before? TB: Three years, and the further away they get the more I like them. I don't know exactly what that dynamic is but it ends up coming full circle to how I felt about it at the beginning. But working on a film you just see so much of it all of the time and it becomes like Chinese water torture you feel this drip on your forehead endlessly and it takes a while to get over that. MK: And how much of what we see on the screen is that vision in your head? TB: It is out of control and I think the best thing you can do is hope for is something closely in the zone of it but that's what I love about the B films, it's great when you see the inconsistencies because it somehow makes it more human in a way. I find those films very appealing, they feel much more human to me. Question 10: Do you think there will be an end to the mindless blockbuster? TB: This one feeds into that a little bit but somehow it feels like an interesting time. I think there will always be those types of films, but I think there might be more different types of films to go along with it so there is more of a choice. You can maybe just avoid those ones and go and see some of the others which I think there'll be more of. MK: How out of step are you with mainstream Hollywood? TB: You have meetings with executives and they all talk about blockbusters, but the absurd thing is that if anyone knew exactly what that was they'd all be like that. They pretend they know what they're talking about but the thing is to be passionate about it and try and do something that you want to do but that's always a problem, that weird pretending and thinking, like Ichabod pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't. Question 11: Are you going to publish any more of your artwork or photography? TB: Yeah, it's great doing it and not be chained to an animation table and have the opportunity to do it when I can and I do love it. It's a sort of therapy, helping me to think and I hope I'll always do it. If it's not too bad I guess some of it will get published. Right now I just use it as a great form of thinking and enjoyment, and as long as I don't have to draw those foxes I'm fine! Question 12: Who are the people who inspire you now? TB: I always consider my prime film-going experience early on because I think those are the times when things remain with you for your whole life. People from the monster movies and people with whom you can identify when you see their film that they're able to have a feeling that's theirs and anyone who can get that across in film. Luckily there's too many to mention. MK: Is there anyone you particularly admire that you've never had the chance to work with or meet? TB: Meeting the people is sometimes scary because you don't know what it's going to be like sometimes it's best just to have that memory and the feeling of the work that they done. MK: Had you met Christopher Lee before Sleepy Hollow? TB: No, that was amazing because two hours went by and I realised I had been hypnotised by Dracula (Laughter) Question 13: If you weren't a film-maker what would you be doing? TB: Be in jail probably! I don't know, I'd probably still have my restaurant job. MK: Were you any good at school? TB: I was part of a weird group of kids who got our energy from trying to get through school without doing anything. That's what directing is like in a way, this kind of hovering about! We tried to fake the report I did okay but it was kind of sociopathic. I was lucky the last year of school I broke my right hand and I didn't have to do anything, it was amazing, I thought, \"I should have broken my hand earlier - starting in first grade maybe\". Question 14: What about violence in the world around you - how do you go about addressing those issues? TB: I was never scared by monster movies, more by real life. Coming from LA I prefer anywhere else in the world because there there was a dynamic of people acting a certain way but not really being that way. The mythology of people friendly and smiling, masking something else which always me feel uneasy and disturbed. Question 15: What were you doing at 23? TB: I was chained to my animation desk, sleeping half of the day. I learned to sleep with my pencil in my hand sitting up at my desk so when the bosses came in I'd just boink [blinks awake and sits upright]. Those were the years of catching up on sleep. MK: Gags aside, it must have been a good grounding? TB: Actually it was more interesting at CalArts.

      "body": "<p>Unlike many of the bop-based jazz guitarists who preceded him, Tony Remy, a lean, relaxed black Briton of the Courtney Pine generation, hasn't made his phrasing mimic the ducking and diving intricacies of a sax. More often than not he has resembled a Philly session player, infectiously chopping chords save for the odd brief foray into single-line solos infused with soul and blues, and tied inexorably to the groove. Early in his career, Remy proved he could do this as well as anybody in the business. </p> <p>Remy is at Ronnie Scott's in London this week. The upsides of his show are his own succinctly fluid playing, some inventive variations on the George Benson unison singing-and-soloing technique with the help of a voice- bending synth, and a sharp band. The downsides in a jazz context are that the preponderance of funky mid-tempo dance shuffles in this sit-down venue tends to make them blur together, and the tight rhythmic prescriptions of funk make it hard to force the fingers away from hot-licks playing to a phrasing of unexpected turns. </p> <p>The vibraharpist Roger Beaujolais is one of the primary colours of this ensemble, and at times his ringing sound, harmonic subtlety and elegant phrasing against Remy's spare chordal hipness gave the group its jazziest aspect, recalling the early Gary Burton jazz-funk bands of the 70s. Their partnership was at its most sympathetic on a version of Goodbye Pork Pie Hat that began as a slow groover and cranked up into a churning and soulful funk exercise, with extra impetus coming from Joe Bashorun's inventive keyboard support. The smooth Stevie Wonderish vocals that followed were elegantly unremarkable, but Remy's blend of Phil Upchurch's hungry drive and Wes Montgomery's quiet caress were compelling qualities of the subsquent instrumental. So was the excellent Frank Tontoh's drumming, a mix of crackling boldness and secure backbeat-playing that is typical of him. </p> <p>Until Saturday. Box office: 0171-439 0747</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unlike many of the bop-based jazz guitarists who preceded him, Tony Remy, a lean, relaxed black Briton of the Courtney Pine generation, hasn't made his phrasing mimic the ducking and diving intricacies of a sax. More often than not he has resembled a Philly session player, infectiously chopping chords save for the odd brief foray into single-line solos infused with soul and blues, and tied inexorably to the groove. Early in his career, Remy proved he could do this as well as anybody in the business. Remy is at Ronnie Scott's in London this week. The upsides of his show are his own succinctly fluid playing, some inventive variations on the George Benson unison singing-and-soloing technique with the help of a voice- bending synth, and a sharp band. The downsides in a jazz context are that the preponderance of funky mid-tempo dance shuffles in this sit-down venue tends to make them blur together, and the tight rhythmic prescriptions of funk make it hard to force the fingers away from hot-licks playing to a phrasing of unexpected turns. The vibraharpist Roger Beaujolais is one of the primary colours of this ensemble, and at times his ringing sound, harmonic subtlety and elegant phrasing against Remy's spare chordal hipness gave the group its jazziest aspect, recalling the early Gary Burton jazz-funk bands of the 70s. Their partnership was at its most sympathetic on a version of Goodbye Pork Pie Hat that began as a slow groover and cranked up into a churning and soulful funk exercise, with extra impetus coming from Joe Bashorun's inventive keyboard support. The smooth Stevie Wonderish vocals that followed were elegantly unremarkable, but Remy's blend of Phil Upchurch's hungry drive and Wes Montgomery's quiet caress were compelling qualities of the subsquent instrumental. So was the excellent Frank Tontoh's drumming, a mix of crackling boldness and secure backbeat-playing that is typical of him. Until Saturday. Box office: 0171-439 0747",
