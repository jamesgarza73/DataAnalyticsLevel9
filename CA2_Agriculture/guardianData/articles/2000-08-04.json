Near the end of a hectic week of Edinburgh Jazz Festival concerts, and ahead of the approaching frenzy of the Fringe juggernaut, this set was a pause for breath. </p> <p>Redbone is out of time and out of place, strolling on stage to the Third Man theme music like Groucho Marx's chilled-out brother. With his white hat, waistcoat and cane, he cuts a dapper, old-fashioned figure, and the thick moustache and dark glasses enhance the Marx resemblance. </p> <p>Redbone emerged in America in the early 70s, but is best-known in this country for the soft-shoe strum of the Kick Off Your Shoes song for the British Rail ad campaign. He sings this number with a voice like soft gravel - the easy delivery disguising the complexity of his exceptional ragtime picking on a battered acoustic guitar. Then he leans into the microphone: \"I hear the company went out of business after that.\" </p> <p>His bone-dry humour and ironic asides reveal a sharp, vaudevillian timing. He hasn't released an album since 1994 and picks most of his material from pre-war American songs - mainly blues but also long-forgotten tangos. Yet he packed the Queen's Hall with an audience that was instantly enveloped in his banter and tunes that were previously confined to dusty 78s and minstrel-show sheet music. All the while he produces curiosities from his jacket pockets, like a conjurer: a camera to take pictures of the audience, sheets of music that are carefully unfolded then discarded, and a bell-horn reminiscent of - this time - Harpo. Then he plays a ringing, hard-picking Robert Johnson blues that I doubt will be equalled in its intensity and sensitivity at any point of this festival. And that is his secret: beneath all the melancholic irony and deadpan banter is a masterly command of ragtime and swing and a genuine love of the American songs of the Depression era - all delivered in a unique, slurred, strangulated voice. </p> <p>It's no surprise that Gary Larson made him a feature of the Far Side cartoons. To keep an audience enraptured by blowing bubbles to the zither version of A Night in Vienna (he's obviously got a thing about the Third Man) before sliding into a fabulous tempo-shifting version of Travellin' Man is some kind of multifunctional performance art in itself.

The chancellor, Gordon Brown - who approved the measures before leaving for his holidays - has set new standards for credit cards, required the publication of league tables of all financial products and sparked a surprise review of the voluntary banking code to which the banks and other financial firms comply. But he took a more conciliatory tone than the banks had first feared, by promising to consult with them before creating a new regulatory body - to be known as Paycom - which will oversee the way payments between banks take place behind the scenes. The banks had felt more vulnerable after the latest six-monthly reports to shareholders revealed, in many cases, record profits. The \"big four\" alone - Lloyds TSB, Barclays, NatWest (now owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland) and HSBC - at which the report is primarily aimed, made \u00a38bn in profit between them. In yesterday's announcement the government also repeated its determination to set up a universal bank in post offices to provide services to the \"financially excluded\" and help generate business for the ailing post office network. The banks, however, are refusing to back the scheme. The series of measures follows the controversial investigation into competition in the financial services industry conducted by Don Cruickshank, who concluded that banks were overcharging customers by up to \u00a35bn a year. In 1998, Mr Cruickshank - who is now the chairman of the London stock exchange - embarked on the year-long investigation, which often met resistance from some of the major banks, at the behest of Mr Brown. Earlier this year, he made 55 recommendations to the chancellor designed to loosen the strangle hold of the big four clearing banks on the provision of current accounts and small business banking. Yesterday, the chancellor backed the majority of those proposals. \"Too often banks and other financial services providers have been slow to give consumers the information they need to make informed choices and make the most of developing competitions, new technologies and new products,\" Mr Brown said. Yesterday's long-awaited measures received an enthusiastic response from the Consumers' Association, along with a call for prompt action. Mick McAteer, a senior policy officer at the association, said: \"This is certainly a step in the right direction and a good result for the consumer association's long battle for a fairer banking system - as long as Gordon Brown's plans really do break up the banks' stranglehold over the banking system.\" The chancellor also announced a review of the services to small business, in addition to a separate investigation into the issue by the competition commission. The financial services authority, the regulator which will be responsible for introducing many of the proposals, said it was happy with the government's response to the Cruickshank review. \"Too often banks and other financial services providers have been slow to give consumers the information they need to make informed choices and make the most of developing competitions, new technologies and new products,\" Mr Brown added. Tim Sweeney, the director general of the British Bankers Association, admitted he was \"mildly disappointed\" about the review to the banking code but said it contained little that was unexpected.",

      "body": "<p>Individuals are abandoning private medical insurance amid spiralling premiums in favour of cheaper health cash plans, according to new figures from analysts Laing &amp; Buisson. But people should make sure they fully understand the difference before switching, say health insurance advisers. </p> <p>The number of people with private medical insurance (PMI) cover in the UK fell by 4.5% last year to 6,366,000 at December 31 1999, with the fall in demand concentrated solely in individual paid business, say Laing &amp; Buisson. Company-paid subscribers grew by 1.2% while individual subscribers were down by 5%. </p> <p>\"High individual price increases and the absence of tax concessions have dampened individual demand for PMI in the last three years,\" says economist Philip Blackburn, author of the report. Individual PMI premium increases have typically been in excess of 10% - around four times inflation. </p> <p>At the same time, the number of people covered by health cash plans (HCP) by the end of 1999 was estimated at 7,400,000, up 2.5% on the previous year. </p> <p>PMI and HCP offer very different benefits and cover and suit very different needs, says specialist independent financial adviser Penny O'Nions. </p> <p>Standard PMI policies are designed to pay for out-patient and in-patient private medical treatment and diagnositic procedures. \"A PMI policy will get you a private bed regardless of cost and get you in and out of hospital quickly,\" she says. \"They are ideally suited to the self-employed and anyone with a reason to get back to work quickly.\" </p> <p>Health cash plans are a very different animal, designed to pay the subscriber tax-free cash benefits towards a wide range of health care treatment including a stay in hospital, optical and dental care, and certain \"alternative\" medical treatments such as homeopathy and acupuncture. Payments cover a fixed percentage of your costs up to a certain amount per year and you can use the money as you wish. </p> <p>The advantage HCPs have over PMI policies is that they pay out whether you use the NHS or opt for private treatment and cover types of health care not usually covered by PMI. </p> <p>\"Cash plans suit the very young who can't afford high PMI premiums and people such as the elderly who are likely to make use of the additional benefits such as contributions towards hearing aids and glasses. But subscribers should be aware of their limitations,\" Ms O'Nions says. \"They are not intended to provide private medical cover. People should understand that, if you elect to take 100% of your diagnostics and treatment on a private basis, the cash benefit levels are unlikely to cover the full cost.\" </p> <p> The Hospital Saving Association (HSA), a non-profit making charitable trust, is the market leader in the HCP field with nearly three million people under cover and is the benchmark against which the proliferation of newer providers compete. </p> <p>Under HSA's SuperPlan, a single weekly contribution entitles each member of the family - the subscriber, their partner and all children under 18 - to 21 health care benefits. Membership is open to most people under the age of 70, providing they are in good health at the time of joining, with no medical examination required. </p> <p>Unlike many competitors, the HSA does not increase contributions as members get older. The qualifying period after taking out cover and claiming is six months (10 months for maternity) though there is immediate cover for accident casualty admission. </p> <p>The choice of six weekly cover levels varies from \u00a31.60 to \u00a312.80 and you can change your subscription level at any time, though the normal six-month qualifying period will apply if you increase your option. As examples, at the lowest and highest levels of cover, every year each family member can claim up to \u00a333 (\u00a3264) each towards dental care, \u00a331 (\u00a3248) optical, \u00a3104 (\u00a3832) physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture and homeopathy, \u00a332 (\u00a3256) chiropody and \u00a368 (\u00a3544) towards medical consultations. </p> <p>Hospital benefits include weekly benefits of \u00a370 (\u00a3560) as a hospital in patient for the member and their partner and \u00a317.50 (\u00a3140) for each child, and the same weekly cash sums are paid for accident casualty admissions and worldwide emergency cover. Extra benefits include payments towards mental health/psychiatric treatment, time spent in a convalescent home or recuperating at home, a home help and care for the elderly. </p> <p>Ms O'Nions says she is seeing a huge rise in the number of clients who are stopping their PMI premiums, preferring to self-insure by saving up towards paying for their own beds in private hospitals should they need treatment. Many are then taking out HCPs as a fallback. And, given the waiting time for some initial consultations on the NHS, \"A lot of people see cash plans as a help towards getting initial diagnosis on a private basis,\" she says. </p> <p>HCPs are generally much cheaper than PMI policies, bearing in mind they have no age-related or regional premium differences and one premium can cover a whole family. </p> <p>Ms O'Nions compares the \u00a36.93 monthly premium for HSA's lowest cash benefits and \u00a355.46 for its highest benefits with a monthly premium of \u00a332.83 for the cheapest full PMI policy covering both inpatient and outpatient private care (but no optical and other alternative care) for an 18-29-year-old. </p> <p>Nearly all PMI providers now also offer HCPs, and new cash plans are rapidly coming on stream.

      "body": "<p>First guerrilla gardeners reclaimed the streets: now vigilante consumers are taking direct action against companies they see as providing poor service. </p> <p>A new breed of websites is naming and shaming companies which have failed their customers. One, <a href=\"http://www.badcustomerservice.co.uk\">www.badcustomerservice.co.uk</a> was posted by David Butland, whose Daewoo caught fire. Another was set up by a man who had complained several times that his kitchen had been badly installed, but received no response. </p> <p>Sheila McKechnie, managing director of the Consumers' Association, says she has been waiting for this kind of consumer power to erupt in the UK. \"We first saw this in the States. A woman whose Ford had caught fire put a page on the internet signposted Flaming Ford. She was contacted by hundreds of other Ford customers who had had similar problems and the company had to pull the model. </p> <p>\"In the past the only option open to the dissatisfied customer, short of taking a case to court, was to go to their local paper. Now people can write about what happened to them on the internet, and can tell other people about it. And in the future, if enough people contact them, they could think about taking out class legal action, once new laws have come into force,\" she says. </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading earlier this year admitted that consumers are not fighting back. The number of complaints made to trading standards departments - currently running at around one million a year - is mere surface scratching. It estimates there are 85 million instances of customer dissatisfaction a year. Top of the list are food and drink, landline and mobile phone services, clothes, shoes and jewellery. Almost half are concerned with defective goods or substandard service. </p> <p>Director general of Fair Trading John Bridgeman says: \"This gives some indication of the huge problem which confronts consumer protection authorities like the OFT and trading standards. It also supports the current review of consumer protection laws to ensure people get a better deal.\" </p> <p>Mr Butland took the step to act as his own personal ombudsman after his Daewoo caught fire just three weeks after he bought it. He was unhappy with the responses from the company (the UK customer relations manager did not reply and when a letter to the managing director did elicit a response, he was told it was for him to prove the cause of the fire) and wrote the site in a couple of hours. </p> <p>A friend posted it on the net. The process cost him around \u00a3150, although people who already have their own site would pay nothing. </p> <p>Both Mr Butland and the kitchen customer - who does not wish to be named - were asked by the company concerned not to post the site. \"In the absence of conclusive technical evidence it may be unwise to publish anything on the internet,\" wrote Daewoo. The kitchen company offered \u00a3700 compensation to the customer - provided the site were taken down. </p> <p>But there are legal implications in posting vigilante websites. The libel laws apply to the net as they do to all printed matter, so anyone who decides to take on Goliath must ensure the stones are slung accurately. The Consumers' Association says only a personal experience should be used.

      "bodyText": "First guerrilla gardeners reclaimed the streets: now vigilante consumers are taking direct action against companies they see as providing poor service. A new breed of websites is naming and shaming companies which have failed their customers. One, www.badcustomerservice.co.uk was posted by David Butland, whose Daewoo caught fire. Another was set up by a man who had complained several times that his kitchen had been badly installed, but received no response. Sheila McKechnie, managing director of the Consumers' Association, says she has been waiting for this kind of consumer power to erupt in the UK. \"We first saw this in the States. A woman whose Ford had caught fire put a page on the internet signposted Flaming Ford. She was contacted by hundreds of other Ford customers who had had similar problems and the company had to pull the model. \"In the past the only option open to the dissatisfied customer, short of taking a case to court, was to go to their local paper. Now people can write about what happened to them on the internet, and can tell other people about it. And in the future, if enough people contact them, they could think about taking out class legal action, once new laws have come into force,\" she says. The Office of Fair Trading earlier this year admitted that consumers are not fighting back. The number of complaints made to trading standards departments - currently running at around one million a year - is mere surface scratching. It estimates there are 85 million instances of customer dissatisfaction a year. Top of the list are food and drink, landline and mobile phone services, clothes, shoes and jewellery. Almost half are concerned with defective goods or substandard service. Director general of Fair Trading John Bridgeman says: \"This gives some indication of the huge problem which confronts consumer protection authorities like the OFT and trading standards. It also supports the current review of consumer protection laws to ensure people get a better deal.\" Mr Butland took the step to act as his own personal ombudsman after his Daewoo caught fire just three weeks after he bought it. He was unhappy with the responses from the company (the UK customer relations manager did not reply and when a letter to the managing director did elicit a response, he was told it was for him to prove the cause of the fire) and wrote the site in a couple of hours. A friend posted it on the net. The process cost him around \u00a3150, although people who already have their own site would pay nothing. Both Mr Butland and the kitchen customer - who does not wish to be named - were asked by the company concerned not to post the site. \"In the absence of conclusive technical evidence it may be unwise to publish anything on the internet,\" wrote Daewoo. The kitchen company offered \u00a3700 compensation to the customer - provided the site were taken down. But there are legal implications in posting vigilante websites. The libel laws apply to the net as they do to all printed matter, so anyone who decides to take on Goliath must ensure the stones are slung accurately. The Consumers' Association says only a personal experience should be used. Emotive language and accusations which cannot be backed by fact should be avoided. Companies will find this kind of direct action particularly wounding if they have no website of their own - www.badcustomerservice.co.uk has already received more than 20,000 hits. When a browser types the keyword into a search engine, the negative site will be brought up and some people may even initially mistake the vigilante sites for the official one. \"The company may well want to teach the person a lesson and there are plenty of instances of companies who know the law using it to frighten people,\" says Ms McKechnie.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's the ultimate nightmare scenario for many internet users - someone else being able to access your bank account details without your knowledge and then raiding your finances and embarking on a fraudulent spending spree. </p> <p>The nightmare became a reality this week - at least the first part of it - when Barclays was forced to shut down its online banking service for several hours on Monday after customers were confronted with details of other people's accounts when they logged on. </p> <p>Barclays, which claims to be the UK's largest online bank with 1.25m users, says only seven people were able to see other customers' details and insists it would not have been possible for them to actually carry out transactions on these accounts. </p> <p>Barclays described the security flaw as \"unacceptable\". Ironically, the problems seem to have stemmed from an upgrade to its service carried out last weekend which included the introduction of a new layer of security, adding an extra stage to the log-in process. As a result of the problems Barclays ripped out the new software and reinstated the old system. </p> <p>This week's incident is the latest in a series of internet security scares. Last month gas and electricity supplier PowerGen agreed to pay \u00a350 compensation to up to 7,000 online customers after an error allowed their names, addresses and credit card details to be accessed by an unauthorised person. </p> <p>And just a few months ago the Halifax was forced to temporarily close its online share-dealing service after a technical fault led to worries that some customers had been able to access other people's accounts. It also comes hard on the heels of technical problems that blighted the launch of two new online banks, Intelligent Finance (IF) and Cahoot. </p> <p>Some internet experts say incidents like this could seriously hinder the growth of online banking and other net services. Unless these glitches are ironed out and security is tightened up, some of us will never have the confidence to explore the opportunities offered by online banks and retailers be cause we will be too worried about things going wrong. </p> <p>The National Consumer Council, which has been campaigning for better internet security, says this week's events will have undoubtedly further dented consumer confidence. \"Until providers such as Barclays address the problems of security, privacy and customer service, e-commerce will not take off,\" warns its director Anna Bradley. </p> <p>Hammering home this message was a survey carried out this week by personal finance website Interactive Investor International, which found that 58% of internet users are not confident about the security of online banking services. One respondent said that he knows of one bank that allowed a friend to not only view another account-holder's details but also to transfer money out of it. </p> <p>Another recent poll looking at the wider issue of online customer service, carried out for First Direct by the Future Foundation think-tank, makes for even bleaker reading. It asked people about their experiences of using online retailers, and found that almost six out of 10 web users claim to have suffered poor service, with gripes ranging from difficulty logging on to sites to email inquiries going unanswered. </p> <p>One of the most disconcerting aspects of some of the recent episodes is that, rather than problems occurring in the transmission of data, it's the software that runs companies' \"back office\" systems that seems to be failing. The worry has to be that in the scramble to bring internet services to the market, companies may be cutting corners - not testing their software thoroughly and rushing new features in. </p> <p>Alarm bells about internet banking security were sounded two months ago by Howard Davies, chairman of investor watchdog the Financial Services Authority. He said that while banks' outer defences tend to be pretty strong, it had found evidence of \"poor internal security\" at some banks - once you are inside, the barriers between different systems are not as robust as they should be. </p> <p>This suggests they could be more vulnerable to attacks from within, such as from a disgruntled member of staff, than from a teenage hacker in his bedroom. However, it also indicates that if too much strain is put on these systems - for example, because a company has massively underestimated demand, as has happened with some of the net banks that have launched - security may be put at risk. </p> <p>Banks and other online businesses would do well to heed the experiences of their counterparts in the US, which is some way further down the online cyberhighway than the UK. There, people are becoming increasingly intolerant of poor internet service - it is estimated that one-third of those who have opened an online bank account have closed it within months because of problems they have experienced. </p> <p>It would be all too easy for the less technically minded among us to use incidents such as this week's fiasco as an excuse to turn our backs on internet banks and retailers on the grounds that we simply don't trust them. But that would be the wrong approach to take, says Ian Kirby at Arnold &amp; Porter, a law firm that specialises in regulatory and IT issues. </p> <p>\"It would be a shame if something like this was to develop into such a situation that we all start behaving like Luddites. The internet is inevitably going to be one of the main mediums through which people do business in the future, and the things it can offer are extremely good - convenience and the ability to have much more control over your finances,\" he adds. </p> <p>There are also the table-topping rates on offer to savers and credit card customers, in particular, who are willing to take the online plunge. Many of the very best savings rates are offered by internet banks or to the online customers of high street institutions. </p> <p>In an attempt to improve the situation, the National Consumer Council is calling for a number of improvements including more secure payment systems which provide a decent safety net when problems occur; beefing up the existing protection for credit card transactions that go wrong; higher standards of customer service; and a government-backed publicity campaign to promote greater awareness of your rights and how to get redress. </p> <p>The banks say it is important for people not to get the problems out of perspective. Barclays says that just seven out of 1.25m customers were affected by the glitch. And when it comes to credit card fraud, you're more likely to encounter problems with waiters or petrol station staff copying your card details and passing them on to counterfeiting gangs than you are with crooks using fraudulently obtained card details to make purchases over the net. </p> <p>This currently accounts for just 2% of all UK card fraud losses, and is a crime that's about to be made a lot more difficult to commit. From October a new system will be in place allowing retailers to check the billing address of someone using a card to pay for goods online. Retailers will also start asking for the three extra digits that are printed on the signature areas of cards but which are not embossed on the front and don't appear on the magnetic stripe. This new system should help foil crooks who have stolen credit card slips, rather than the card itself, and who, in most cases, won't know the victim's address. </p> <p>So what is the advice for online banking users concerned about the safety of their money and personal details? </p> <p>The Consumers' Association recommends sticking with a UK-based bank which has signed up to the UK's banking code of practice and belongs to our banking ombudsman scheme. It also says that if you come across anything odd or suspicious, take a print-off of the screen so you've got some proof in case the bank denies there is a problem. </p> <p>The CA advises people to check your bank's small print carefully to see what your liability is in the event of an unauthorised transaction being made on your account. Egg's rules state that until you inform them that something has gone wrong, you remain potentially liable for any transactions that occur. Other online banks take a less tough line, limiting your liability to \u00a350 or nothing. </p> <p>Industry body the British Bankers' Association adds the following tips: </p> <p>\u0095 Keep your password confidential </p> <p>\u0095 Make sure other people aren't able to observe your PC screen when you log on </p> <p>\u0095 If you do your banking on a computer which is shared with other people, never store your password on its hard disk. Consider disabling your browser's ability to remember passwords and user names. </p>",

Barclays, which claims to be the UK's largest online bank with 1.25m users, says only seven people were able to see other customers' details and insists it would not have been possible for them to actually carry out transactions on these accounts. Barclays described the security flaw as \"unacceptable\". Ironically, the problems seem to have stemmed from an upgrade to its service carried out last weekend which included the introduction of a new layer of security, adding an extra stage to the log-in process. As a result of the problems Barclays ripped out the new software and reinstated the old system. This week's incident is the latest in a series of internet security scares. Last month gas and electricity supplier PowerGen agreed to pay \u00a350 compensation to up to 7,000 online customers after an error allowed their names, addresses and credit card details to be accessed by an unauthorised person. And just a few months ago the Halifax was forced to temporarily close its online share-dealing service after a technical fault led to worries that some customers had been able to access other people's accounts. It also comes hard on the heels of technical problems that blighted the launch of two new online banks, Intelligent Finance (IF) and Cahoot. Some internet experts say incidents like this could seriously hinder the growth of online banking and other net services. Unless these glitches are ironed out and security is tightened up, some of us will never have the confidence to explore the opportunities offered by online banks and retailers be cause we will be too worried about things going wrong. The National Consumer Council, which has been campaigning for better internet security, says this week's events will have undoubtedly further dented consumer confidence. \"Until providers such as Barclays address the problems of security, privacy and customer service, e-commerce will not take off,\" warns its director Anna Bradley. Hammering home this message was a survey carried out this week by personal finance website Interactive Investor International, which found that 58% of internet users are not confident about the security of online banking services. One respondent said that he knows of one bank that allowed a friend to not only view another account-holder's details but also to transfer money out of it. Another recent poll looking at the wider issue of online customer service, carried out for First Direct by the Future Foundation think-tank, makes for even bleaker reading. It asked people about their experiences of using online retailers, and found that almost six out of 10 web users claim to have suffered poor service, with gripes ranging from difficulty logging on to sites to email inquiries going unanswered. One of the most disconcerting aspects of some of the recent episodes is that, rather than problems occurring in the transmission of data, it's the software that runs companies' \"back office\" systems that seems to be failing. The worry has to be that in the scramble to bring internet services to the market, companies may be cutting corners - not testing their software thoroughly and rushing new features in. Alarm bells about internet banking security were sounded two months ago by Howard Davies, chairman of investor watchdog the Financial Services Authority. He said that while banks' outer defences tend to be pretty strong, it had found evidence of \"poor internal security\" at some banks - once you are inside, the barriers between different systems are not as robust as they should be. This suggests they could be more vulnerable to attacks from within, such as from a disgruntled member of staff, than from a teenage hacker in his bedroom. However, it also indicates that if too much strain is put on these systems - for example, because a company has massively underestimated demand, as has happened with some of the net banks that have launched - security may be put at risk. Banks and other online businesses would do well to heed the experiences of their counterparts in the US, which is some way further down the online cyberhighway than the UK. There, people are becoming increasingly intolerant of poor internet service - it is estimated that one-third of those who have opened an online bank account have closed it within months because of problems they have experienced. It would be all too easy for the less technically minded among us to use incidents such as this week's fiasco as an excuse to turn our backs on internet banks and retailers on the grounds that we simply don't trust them. But that would be the wrong approach to take, says Ian Kirby at Arnold &amp; Porter, a law firm that specialises in regulatory and IT issues. \"It would be a shame if something like this was to develop into such a situation that we all start behaving like Luddites. The internet is inevitably going to be one of the main mediums through which people do business in the future, and the things it can offer are extremely good - convenience and the ability to have much more control over your finances,\" he adds. There are also the table-topping rates on offer to savers and credit card customers, in particular, who are willing to take the online plunge. Many of the very best savings rates are offered by internet banks or to the online customers of high street institutions. In an attempt to improve the situation, the National Consumer Council is calling for a number of improvements including more secure payment systems which provide a decent safety net when problems occur; beefing up the existing protection for credit card transactions that go wrong; higher standards of customer service; and a government-backed publicity campaign to promote greater awareness of your rights and how to get redress. The banks say it is important for people not to get the problems out of perspective. Barclays says that just seven out of 1.25m customers were affected by the glitch. And when it comes to credit card fraud, you're more likely to encounter problems with waiters or petrol station staff copying your card details and passing them on to counterfeiting gangs than you are with crooks using fraudulently obtained card details to make purchases over the net. This currently accounts for just 2% of all UK card fraud losses, and is a crime that's about to be made a lot more difficult to commit. From October a new system will be in place allowing retailers to check the billing address of someone using a card to pay for goods online. Retailers will also start asking for the three extra digits that are printed on the signature areas of cards but which are not embossed on the front and don't appear on the magnetic stripe. This new system should help foil crooks who have stolen credit card slips, rather than the card itself, and who, in most cases, won't know the victim's address. So what is the advice for online banking users concerned about the safety of their money and personal details? The Consumers' Association recommends sticking with a UK-based bank which has signed up to the UK's banking code of practice and belongs to our banking ombudsman scheme. It also says that if you come across anything odd or suspicious, take a print-off of the screen so you've got some proof in case the bank denies there is a problem. The CA advises people to check your bank's small print carefully to see what your liability is in the event of an unauthorised transaction being made on your account. Egg's rules state that until you inform them that something has gone wrong, you remain potentially liable for any transactions that occur. Other online banks take a less tough line, limiting your liability to \u00a350 or nothing. Industry body the British Bankers' Association adds the following tips: \u0095 Keep your password confidential \u0095 Make sure other people aren't able to observe your PC screen when you log on \u0095 If you do your banking on a computer which is shared with other people, never store your password on its hard disk. Consider disabling your browser's ability to remember passwords and user names.",

      "body": "<p>A summer spending spree is forecast for later this month fuelled by the billions of pounds of Scottish Widows windfall cash that will be dropping into the laps of 1.6m lucky policyholders. </p> <p>In all, close to \u00a36bn is being dished out by the insurer, with the windfalls varying in size dramatically - from \u00a3500 to \u00a3100,000-plus. The average handout will be just over \u00a36,000. </p> <p>A survey from CGU Insurance out this week predicted that the giant giveaway will help lift consumer spending this month to \u00a349.4bn - a new high for this year. Home improvements, holidays and cars look set to top the shopping lists for those planning to spend, spend, spend, but many of those sharing in the bonanza will be keen to invest some or all of the cash, perhaps for a rainy day or to supplement their retirement income. </p> <p>Some will have originally invested in a fairly low-risk Scottish Widows product such as a with-profits bond, and so will be keen to put their windfall cash into something similar. Others will view this as unexpected money and will be willing to take a bit of a gamble with it. Here we look at how you'll be getting your money and canvass the views of independent financial advisers as to possible investment options. </p> <p>A total of \u00a37.3bn is being awarded to policyholders, but \u00a31.5bn of this will be paid out over time in the form of enhanced terminal bonuses to with-profits policyholders. </p> <p>All of the 1.6m people will receive a fixed payout of \u00a3500. However, 900,000 of them are with-profits policyholders and will also receive a variable payment based on the type of policy, its size and how long it has been held for. </p> <p>If you requested to receive your windfall in the form of a cheque, these are being mailed out from August 17 onwards. If you asked for it to be paid into a Scottish Widows Bank VIP Premier Account, it will be paid in at the same time. Assuming rates don't change between now and then, the account will pay interest of 6.25% though this includes a 0.5% interest bonus for the first six months. </p> <p>If you requested your windfall in the form of loan notes (a sort of IOU), you'll receive a loan note certificate plus a letter highlighting the value of your windfall. Interest will be paid on the loan notes and the rate is likely to be around 5.9%. </p> <p>So what are some of your investment options? </p> <p>James Dalby, at Leeds-based IFA Bates Investment Services, says that for some policyholders, the handout will provide a much-needed boost to their flagging finances. \"For them, it may be that the best course of action is to repay any small short-term debt.\" </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, some people may be willing to plunge into somewhat riskier waters and might consider a technology fund \"for a bit of excitement and long-term growth potential\".

      "bodyText": "A summer spending spree is forecast for later this month fuelled by the billions of pounds of Scottish Widows windfall cash that will be dropping into the laps of 1.6m lucky policyholders. In all, close to \u00a36bn is being dished out by the insurer, with the windfalls varying in size dramatically - from \u00a3500 to \u00a3100,000-plus. The average handout will be just over \u00a36,000. A survey from CGU Insurance out this week predicted that the giant giveaway will help lift consumer spending this month to \u00a349.4bn - a new high for this year. Home improvements, holidays and cars look set to top the shopping lists for those planning to spend, spend, spend, but many of those sharing in the bonanza will be keen to invest some or all of the cash, perhaps for a rainy day or to supplement their retirement income. Some will have originally invested in a fairly low-risk Scottish Widows product such as a with-profits bond, and so will be keen to put their windfall cash into something similar. Others will view this as unexpected money and will be willing to take a bit of a gamble with it. Here we look at how you'll be getting your money and canvass the views of independent financial advisers as to possible investment options. A total of \u00a37.3bn is being awarded to policyholders, but \u00a31.5bn of this will be paid out over time in the form of enhanced terminal bonuses to with-profits policyholders. All of the 1.6m people will receive a fixed payout of \u00a3500. However, 900,000 of them are with-profits policyholders and will also receive a variable payment based on the type of policy, its size and how long it has been held for. If you requested to receive your windfall in the form of a cheque, these are being mailed out from August 17 onwards. If you asked for it to be paid into a Scottish Widows Bank VIP Premier Account, it will be paid in at the same time. Assuming rates don't change between now and then, the account will pay interest of 6.25% though this includes a 0.5% interest bonus for the first six months. If you requested your windfall in the form of loan notes (a sort of IOU), you'll receive a loan note certificate plus a letter highlighting the value of your windfall. Interest will be paid on the loan notes and the rate is likely to be around 5.9%. So what are some of your investment options? James Dalby, at Leeds-based IFA Bates Investment Services, says that for some policyholders, the handout will provide a much-needed boost to their flagging finances. \"For them, it may be that the best course of action is to repay any small short-term debt.\" At the other end of the spectrum, some people may be willing to plunge into somewhat riskier waters and might consider a technology fund \"for a bit of excitement and long-term growth potential\". One fund he particularly likes is Henderson Global Technology, which has notched up an impressive performance over the medium to long-term - it is the top fund in its sector over three and five years. Mr Dalby also flags up Aberdeen Technology, which has been in the top quartile of funds in its sector for the past 10 years, and the Framlington NetNet Fund, which involves a slightly higher level of risk because it only invests in internet and internet-related companies. Bates Investment Services has an A5 guide called Investing Your Windfall which is available free to Guardian readers - call 0800-0134-135. Michael Aaron at the David Aaron Partnership, a Milton-Keynes-based IFA, says there will be a huge variation in the amounts people will receive. For those prepared to take a bit of risk, and who are prepared to commit their cash for the long term, he highlights some of the technology funds. Many of these have fallen quite heavily from their highs earlier this year, and so there is some good value out there, he adds. Mr Aaron quite likes Aberdeen Technology, and also Aberdeen European Technology, which invests in Continental European technology-related companies. Away from technology, he is a fan of ABN AMRO's UK Growth fund, which he says is \"more aggressive than the typical UK growth fund\" and has been a very strong performer - it is the number two fund in its sector out of well over 200 funds over both one and three years. Others will take a more cautious approach and, for them, something like a with-profits bond may be well worth considering as these involve a lot less risk and volatility than many other share-based investments. \"Companies we like include Prudential and Liverpool Victoria,\" says Mr Aaron. Scottish Widows is keen to hang on to some of the cash it is paying out and will be offering people various reinvestment options, including the opportunity to put their money into its European Isa. This fund is aimed at those seeking capital growth through investment in Continental companies. Chartwell Investment Management, a Bath-based IFA, says the Scottish Widows European Isa has \"an excellent long-term track record\" but points out that the fund manager largely responsible for this, Albert Morillo, left to join another company last year, taking two members of his team with him. Jason Hollands, at Best Investment Brokers, says that as a result, people who put their money into the fund are backing \"a fairly unknown quantity\". Mr Morillo's replacement is Fiona Macrie, who was part of the European team but has not run a fund herself before. \"I see no reason why you should want to go into that fund over other well-established, strong European funds run by companies such as Gartmore, Invesco and Threadneedle,\" he says.

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

Laconic and genial, if a firm adherent to the minimalist school of post-match comment, Mullally's contribution to the Opinions section of the Cricketers' Who's Who extends to a positively verbose \"good fun\". Which presumably sums up the <strong> Hampshire</strong> southpaw's reaction to the pre-lunch exploits that saw him whip out the last four <strong> Derbyshire</strong> batsmen to finish with a lifetime-best nine for 93. </p> <p>His national heir could well be Dean, who missed almost the whole of last summer but is far from alone among his breed when it comes to serious spinal ailments. Mark Ilott, Paul Hutchison, Jason Lewry and, this season, Matt Bulbeck have all been likewise afflicted, ditto New Zealand's Geoff Allott. Within the past decade, indeed, South Africa's Brett Schulz and Australia's Bruce Reid have been forced to retire.

      "bodyText": "While several of its own (alleged) members are reluctant to credit the Fast Bowlers' Union with anything more than mythic status - Devon Malcolm, when facing Courtney Walsh, springs unerringly to mind - the notion of a Left Arm Union - quick to quickish only - sounds far more plausible. Bonded by adversity, a pair of card-carriers, Alan Mullally and Kevin Dean, tussled for supremacy at Derby yesterday. Laconic and genial, if a firm adherent to the minimalist school of post-match comment, Mullally's contribution to the Opinions section of the Cricketers' Who's Who extends to a positively verbose \"good fun\". Which presumably sums up the Hampshire southpaw's reaction to the pre-lunch exploits that saw him whip out the last four Derbyshire batsmen to finish with a lifetime-best nine for 93. His national heir could well be Dean, who missed almost the whole of last summer but is far from alone among his breed when it comes to serious spinal ailments. Mark Ilott, Paul Hutchison, Jason Lewry and, this season, Matt Bulbeck have all been likewise afflicted, ditto New Zealand's Geoff Allott. Within the past decade, indeed, South Africa's Brett Schulz and Australia's Bruce Reid have been forced to retire. Hah, clever-clogs Latin scholars will titter, that'll teach 'em to be so sinister. Dean, though, is making a spirited comeback. Fresh from a career-best eight for 52 against Kent, he took three of the first four wickets before Robin Smith's second 50 of the term helped the visitors close 169 behind. An impressive season's strike rate now stands at a victim every 37 balls.

It has also ruled that Rothmans should not be allowed to have information on clubs such as directors' names, ground information and lists of personnel. The Football League has recently signed a \u00a365m internet deal with NTL that will contain websites for all its 72 clubs. </p> <p>Since first being published 31 years ago Rothmans has been used by those within the game as the main reference book, particularly because of the personal information it contains on players. Fortunately for the publishers, they had managed to gather most of the information on players for this season's edition by the time the Football League intervened but there are fears that next year's book could be severely affected by the ban. </p> <p>The book's editor Jack Rollin said last night: \"There are going to be massive problems for next year. The only way we can get personal details of players is from the clubs themselves. I don't know how we are going to proceed but we are going to have to get around the problem. The tragedy is that people within the game rely on this book and the Footbal League is being very unfair.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Football League said: \"It's a real shame because the yearbook is the bible of the game. But we want to make sure that the information our clubs are providing is only used for the book and not sold to other internet sites. The publishers could not give us a guarantee that they will not sell information. We have an internet agreement with NTL that we have to honour.\" </p> <p>The Professional Footballers' Association added to the proliferation of websites when, at Old Trafford yesterday, it launched its own site containing details of its members. </p> <p>Givemefootball.com will be backed by the American media giant Sports Network and is promising to give the inside story on the game, including interviews with players and coverage of all the PFA's work. The Sports Network chief executive Mickey Charles said he is confident the new site will deliver results and information \"quicker and better\" than any of its rivals. </p> <p>The Premier League is investigating a potential claim of up to \u00a32.5m in wages by the injured striker Pierluigi Casiraghi against Chelsea following the club's move to end his contract after receiving a \u00a34m insurance payout. Chelsea have received the payout from their insurers after medical tests were carried out on the serious knee injury which the Italian suffered against West Ham in November 1998 and on which he has since had 10 operations. </p> <p>The club, who have been paying Casiraghi his estimated \u00a325,000-a-week wages since the injury, gave him six months' notice to end his contract which expires on August 17. From then on Casiraghi would no longer be a Chelsea player and therefore not entitled to receive any wages for the two years remaining on the deal he signed when he arrived from Lazio for \u00a35.4m in 1998. </p> <p>However, Casiraghi disputes the view of Chelsea and their insurers that his top-level career has come to an end. And his advisors have contacted London solicitors with a view to making an appeal to the Premier League or taking possible civil action in the courts.</p>",

But we want to make sure that the information our clubs are providing is only used for the book and not sold to other internet sites. The publishers could not give us a guarantee that they will not sell information. We have an internet agreement with NTL that we have to honour.\" The Professional Footballers' Association added to the proliferation of websites when, at Old Trafford yesterday, it launched its own site containing details of its members. Givemefootball.com will be backed by the American media giant Sports Network and is promising to give the inside story on the game, including interviews with players and coverage of all the PFA's work. The Sports Network chief executive Mickey Charles said he is confident the new site will deliver results and information \"quicker and better\" than any of its rivals. The Premier League is investigating a potential claim of up to \u00a32.5m in wages by the injured striker Pierluigi Casiraghi against Chelsea following the club's move to end his contract after receiving a \u00a34m insurance payout. Chelsea have received the payout from their insurers after medical tests were carried out on the serious knee injury which the Italian suffered against West Ham in November 1998 and on which he has since had 10 operations. The club, who have been paying Casiraghi his estimated \u00a325,000-a-week wages since the injury, gave him six months' notice to end his contract which expires on August 17. From then on Casiraghi would no longer be a Chelsea player and therefore not entitled to receive any wages for the two years remaining on the deal he signed when he arrived from Lazio for \u00a35.4m in 1998. However, Casiraghi disputes the view of Chelsea and their insurers that his top-level career has come to an end. And his advisors have contacted London solicitors with a view to making an appeal to the Premier League or taking possible civil action in the courts.",

      "byline": "John Patterson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Paul Verhoeven once said that in every new movie he liked to give audiences at least one thing they'd never seen before, one image that would really \"blow them away\". If he had lacked this one urge, we might never have heard of the Dutch expatriate director of RoboCop, Basic Instinct and Showgirls. </p> <p>Where to start with these images? With Peter Weller's arm being blown off by Kurtwood Smith in RoboCop? Or the moment when Smith himself, covered in toxic waste, is hit by a car and literally explodes, his head bursting on the windshield in a riot of scarlet brain tissue? Arnie using a corpse as a bullet-proof shield in Total Recall? Or Recall's villain, the redoubtable Michael Ironside, having both his arms severed by an out-of-control elevator? Or the ultraviolent bug attacks of Starship Troopers, to say nothing of pneumatic ingenue Denise Richards blowing chunks all over the camera? </p> <p>And that's just the violence and the vomit. Sex has given Verhoeven a whole other theatre in his 30-years war with propriety. He gave us the most notorious non-porn beaver-shot in movie history in Basic Instinct, three-breasted mutants in Total Recall, and the ghastly spectacle of Showgirls - a movie quite capable of making heterosexual men never, ever want to see another naked female breast. </p> <p>And that's just the American movies. Verhoeven's Dutch career in the 70s was another long catalogue of offences against public decency - at least in the eyes of the stolid burghers who ran the committee subsidising Dutch film production, who later, according to the director himself, ran Verhoeven right out of the country. There was the shadow of a gigantic erection (Rutger Hauer's) in his 1975 historical drama Cathy Tippel; Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 being tortured by the Nazis, with a hosepipe pumping gallons of water up his arse, in the Dutch resistance thriller Soldier of Orange; a homosexual gang rape in the biker movie Spetters (one rapist spits on the victim's rectum for increased lubrication); and an onscreen castration (Krabb\u00e9 again) in The Fourth Man. </p> <p>Steven Spielberg admired Soldier of Orange and suggested to George Lucas that Verhoeven might make a good director for The Return of the Jedi. Then he saw Spetters. The idea was quickly dropped. \"I suppose he was scared,\" laughs Verhoeven, \"that the Jedi would immediately start fucking each other.\" And Basic Instinct's scriptwriter, Joe Eszterhas, claims the first time he met Verhoeven the director's first words were: \"How can we get more tits and cunts into this movie?\" </p> <p>His first English-language project, Flesh + Blood, a medieval epic and possibly his most enjoyable movie, is so filled with rapes and beheadings that it pitched Verhoeven into the first of his many wars with the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board. But with Hollow Man, his variation on the themes of HG Wells's The Invisible Man, Verhoeven again gives us things we've never seen before - a rat bloodily devoured by an invisible gorilla, an invisible dog killed by Kevin Bacon (we see a thermal image), and silliest of all, a woman's breasts being kneaded by invisible hands. But this time we're in R-rated territory - a \"restricted\" rating midway between a British \"15\" and \"18\". </p> <p>\"To my amazement,\" says Verhoeven, \"when I cut the movie and gave it to the MPAA, they gave me an 'R'. This is the first time in the United States they didn't give me an 'X' - or an 'NC-17' as it's called now.\" Lest we forget, the NC-17 was created especially for Basic Instinct. Another first. </p> <p>Unlike his movies, the 62-year-old Paul Verhoeven is not in the least bit vulgar, violent or stupid. In fact, he radiates intelligence as he talks rapidly in his near-perfect English. What makes him such a compelling speaker is that his articulacy and conversational brio come overlaid with a heavy Dutch accent that teems with pleasingly odd constructions (\"more fastly\"), quasi-Geordie vowel sounds, and profitably garbled meanings (actors \"interfere\" with each other, rather than \"interact\"). And oddly enough, given his most notorious and successful movie, the word he uses most often is \"basically.\" As he talks about politics, the second world war, history and movies, it's clear that one is in the presence of someone who, in intellectual terms at least, could eat most of his fellow Hollywood directors for breakfast. </p> <p>After all, he holds a PhD in mathematics and physics from the venerable and prestigious university of Leiden. At one point I can't resist addressing him as \"Dr Verhoeven\". What at first looks like a flicker of mild annoyance ripens finally into a broad grin and a self-deprecating chuckle. Does his proficiency come in useful with the effects boffins? I ask. \"Oh yes, but it's hardly a necessity. And you rarely need mathematical formulae to achieve your goals as a director, which is just as well, because I've forgotten most of them.\" </p> <p>Although Hollow Man deals with the nature of evil, and though Verhoeven is given to quoting Plato's Republic while discussing it, you can't fail to recognise it as the work of its author. Kevin Bacon plays the leader of a Pentagon-sponsored programme to develop invisibility for military applications. He and his team (Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin) have pioneered invisibility in laboratory rats and apes, but haven't yet restored any of them to full visibility. Bacon, an arrogant genius, decides that in order to preserve funding and maintain independence from the generals, he will use himself as the first human guinea pig. For the last two-thirds of the movie, we see him only when someone coats him with water, steam, paint, latex and, increasingly as the film continues, with other people's blood. </p> <p>Apart from David McCallum in the 70s American TV series The Invisible Man, no one invisible has ever been an agent for order and goodness, and Bacon is no exception. \"He's not a bad guy to start with,\" says Verhoeven. \"We portrayed him in the early stages of the story with enough little nasty elements [he's a voyeur and doesn't much like his lab rats or staff] that you wouldn't be too amazed.\" </p> <p>\"Plato, when he discusses invisibility in The Republic, says that when a man becomes invisible, that he would start to behave in an evil way. He feels that the constraints of society make us behave in a decent way because we are afraid to get in jail or be punished in whatever way. But if we knew we would get away with everything, we would not behave so well, I think.\" </p> <p>Does the same apply to Verhoeven? \"Oh yes, but as far as I know, not to the degree of being criminal. At least I've never explored that or tried to explore it, although in my movies I do. I proposed once - it's not come to much yet - to do a movie about Adolf Hitler, which would clearly be about something that goes beyond evil. My interest in evil is self-evident, and as Alec Guinness once said, 'If you play Hitler' - as he once did - 'that doesn't make you evil yourself.' Everything we do about Hitler is a projection of our own vision on to him, but that doesn't make us into a person like Adolf Hitler. Artistry is different from real fact.\" </p> <p>Hitler featured heavily in Verhoeven's childhood in the Hague, the administrative capital of Nazi-occupied Holland, site of the V1 launchpads and target of massive Allied bombing raids. \"I cannot separate myself from what I saw during the second world war,\" he once said. He was two when the Wehrmacht swept into Holland in 1940, and his earliest memories included summary executions and the sight of his neighbours \"picking up pieces of pilots\". </p> <p>But Verhoeven had another angle on the experience. \"Living in an occupied country is something that's close to me,\" he says, and certainly the subject turns up again and again in his work, either in disguised form, with Starship Troopers, or directly, as in Soldier of Orange. \"But I loved it,\" he recalls. \"I thought war was great - bombing and planes and shooting and people being killed. Really wonderful. Being a child of the war, my tolerance for violence is higher than normal. Kids love violence. As an adult, you realise that violence is real. So my work is anchored in reality, it's hyper-realistic. Hence the need to show everything so explicitly: the fucking and the pricks and the shit and the drugs and the violence.\" </p> <p>All of which earned him the opprobrium of the Dutch bourgeoisie, culminating in the bitter controversy over Spetters in 1980. \"When I did Spetters, I got in big problems with Dutch society and they created this committee called the National Anti-Spetters Committee because they thought the movie was so disgusting that I should be banned from ever making any more movies. There's a lot of harsh things in Spetters, much harsher than in any American movie I've made. There was a lot of resistance. The reaction was even worse than the reactions I got here in the United States for Showgirls. One of the reasons I left the country was that the government subsidy board wasn't willing to give me any money because they thought that I was an indecent, perverted, decadent person. Which is probably true, but they shouldn't have held it against me.\" </p> <p>Thirteen years after RoboCop, Verhoeven is no longer a Dutch emigre with a suspiciously arty-looking back catalogue. He is now a major American director, a figure of - but simultaneously not of - the Hollywood establishment, a maverick within the mainstream plotting a course of outrage and scandal into the new century. And if Hollow Man finds him in something of a creative holding-pattern that unites his two favourite genres - effects-based sci-fi and the suspense thriller - then we should remember that he has other interests, other kinds of movies he'd like to see made. </p> <p>He has long wanted to make a movie about the Crusades, perhaps to make up for the budgetary restraints he chafed under on Flesh + Blood. His interest in a Hitler biopic may be purely theoretical (\"I can't see anyone financing it in the US, and certainly not in Germany\") but he has consulted biographer Ian Kershaw. \"If you touch that subject,\" he says, \"you're dead, basically.\" </p> <p>\"But,\" he says, touching on another biopic he's been researching, \"the same thing applies to Jesus, strangely enough. If you touch Jesus, everybody gets upset.\" </p> <p>Verhoeven, a lapsed Catholic, is a member of the Jesus Seminar, a group of mainly American academics who gather to discuss the historical Jesus. \"What did he really do? What did he really say? I've studied it for nearly 15 years to help me conceive an outline that's nearly done now,\" he says. \"I'm sure it will be controversial. I see the story more from a political point of view. For me it has a lot to do with Roman politics and how the high priests and the top aristocracy of Israel collaborated with the Romans. So you get the collaborating government in an occupied country where the people underneath are suppressed and try to find ways to deal with reality.\" </p> <p>It's encouraging to see Verhoeven cast about for new and profitable subjects with which to offend large sections of the movie-going audience. First he did sex, then violence, then he came to America and did extreme violence, then even more explicit sex, all over again. Hollow Man offers cruelty to (digitally animated) animals, full-frontal male nudity and an invisible rapist. Politics is where he should head next. Think of the protests. </p> <p>So is he mellowing? \"Perhaps when you get older you want to be a little bit more... playful,\" he says. \"For a long time, I had a completely cynical outlook on society. It's still there and it still runs in and out of the movies. But perhaps these days I'm a bit... I won't say wiser...just a bit more normal.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Hollow Man will be screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival on August 25, preceded by a Reel Life discussion with Paul Verhoeven (tickets: 0131-623 8030).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Paul Verhoeven once said that in every new movie he liked to give audiences at least one thing they'd never seen before, one image that would really \"blow them away\". If he had lacked this one urge, we might never have heard of the Dutch expatriate director of RoboCop, Basic Instinct and Showgirls. Where to start with these images? With Peter Weller's arm being blown off by Kurtwood Smith in RoboCop? Or the moment when Smith himself, covered in toxic waste, is hit by a car and literally explodes, his head bursting on the windshield in a riot of scarlet brain tissue? Arnie using a corpse as a bullet-proof shield in Total Recall? Or Recall's villain, the redoubtable Michael Ironside, having both his arms severed by an out-of-control elevator? Or the ultraviolent bug attacks of Starship Troopers, to say nothing of pneumatic ingenue Denise Richards blowing chunks all over the camera? And that's just the violence and the vomit. Sex has given Verhoeven a whole other theatre in his 30-years war with propriety. He gave us the most notorious non-porn beaver-shot in movie history in Basic Instinct, three-breasted mutants in Total Recall, and the ghastly spectacle of Showgirls - a movie quite capable of making heterosexual men never, ever want to see another naked female breast. And that's just the American movies. Verhoeven's Dutch career in the 70s was another long catalogue of offences against public decency - at least in the eyes of the stolid burghers who ran the committee subsidising Dutch film production, who later, according to the director himself, ran Verhoeven right out of the country. There was the shadow of a gigantic erection (Rutger Hauer's) in his 1975 historical drama Cathy Tippel; Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 being tortured by the Nazis, with a hosepipe pumping gallons of water up his arse, in the Dutch resistance thriller Soldier of Orange; a homosexual gang rape in the biker movie Spetters (one rapist spits on the victim's rectum for increased lubrication); and an onscreen castration (Krabb\u00e9 again) in The Fourth Man. Steven Spielberg admired Soldier of Orange and suggested to George Lucas that Verhoeven might make a good director for The Return of the Jedi. Then he saw Spetters. The idea was quickly dropped. \"I suppose he was scared,\" laughs Verhoeven, \"that the Jedi would immediately start fucking each other.\" And Basic Instinct's scriptwriter, Joe Eszterhas, claims the first time he met Verhoeven the director's first words were: \"How can we get more tits and cunts into this movie?\" His first English-language project, Flesh + Blood, a medieval epic and possibly his most enjoyable movie, is so filled with rapes and beheadings that it pitched Verhoeven into the first of his many wars with the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board. But with Hollow Man, his variation on the themes of HG Wells's The Invisible Man, Verhoeven again gives us things we've never seen before - a rat bloodily devoured by an invisible gorilla, an invisible dog killed by Kevin Bacon (we see a thermal image), and silliest of all, a woman's breasts being kneaded by invisible hands. But this time we're in R-rated territory - a \"restricted\" rating midway between a British \"15\" and \"18\". \"To my amazement,\" says Verhoeven, \"when I cut the movie and gave it to the MPAA, they gave me an 'R'. This is the first time in the United States they didn't give me an 'X' - or an 'NC-17' as it's called now.\" Lest we forget, the NC-17 was created especially for Basic Instinct. Another first. Unlike his movies, the 62-year-old Paul Verhoeven is not in the least bit vulgar, violent or stupid. In fact, he radiates intelligence as he talks rapidly in his near-perfect English. What makes him such a compelling speaker is that his articulacy and conversational brio come overlaid with a heavy Dutch accent that teems with pleasingly odd constructions (\"more fastly\"), quasi-Geordie vowel sounds, and profitably garbled meanings (actors \"interfere\" with each other, rather than \"interact\"). And oddly enough, given his most notorious and successful movie, the word he uses most often is \"basically.\" As he talks about politics, the second world war, history and movies, it's clear that one is in the presence of someone who, in intellectual terms at least, could eat most of his fellow Hollywood directors for breakfast. After all, he holds a PhD in mathematics and physics from the venerable and prestigious university of Leiden. At one point I can't resist addressing him as \"Dr Verhoeven\". What at first looks like a flicker of mild annoyance ripens finally into a broad grin and a self-deprecating chuckle. Does his proficiency come in useful with the effects boffins? I ask. \"Oh yes, but it's hardly a necessity. And you rarely need mathematical formulae to achieve your goals as a director, which is just as well, because I've forgotten most of them.\" Although Hollow Man deals with the nature of evil, and though Verhoeven is given to quoting Plato's Republic while discussing it, you can't fail to recognise it as the work of its author. Kevin Bacon plays the leader of a Pentagon-sponsored programme to develop invisibility for military applications. He and his team (Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin) have pioneered invisibility in laboratory rats and apes, but haven't yet restored any of them to full visibility. Bacon, an arrogant genius, decides that in order to preserve funding and maintain independence from the generals, he will use himself as the first human guinea pig. For the last two-thirds of the movie, we see him only when someone coats him with water, steam, paint, latex and, increasingly as the film continues, with other people's blood. Apart from David McCallum in the 70s American TV series The Invisible Man, no one invisible has ever been an agent for order and goodness, and Bacon is no exception. \"He's not a bad guy to start with,\" says Verhoeven. \"We portrayed him in the early stages of the story with enough little nasty elements [he's a voyeur and doesn't much like his lab rats or staff] that you wouldn't be too amazed.\" \"Plato, when he discusses invisibility in The Republic, says that when a man becomes invisible, that he would start to behave in an evil way. He feels that the constraints of society make us behave in a decent way because we are afraid to get in jail or be punished in whatever way. But if we knew we would get away with everything, we would not behave so well, I think.\" Does the same apply to Verhoeven? \"Oh yes, but as far as I know, not to the degree of being criminal. At least I've never explored that or tried to explore it, although in my movies I do. I proposed once - it's not come to much yet - to do a movie about Adolf Hitler, which would clearly be about something that goes beyond evil. My interest in evil is self-evident, and as Alec Guinness once said, 'If you play Hitler' - as he once did - 'that doesn't make you evil yourself.' Everything we do about Hitler is a projection of our own vision on to him, but that doesn't make us into a person like Adolf Hitler. Artistry is different from real fact.\" Hitler featured heavily in Verhoeven's childhood in the Hague, the administrative capital of Nazi-occupied Holland, site of the V1 launchpads and target of massive Allied bombing raids. \"I cannot separate myself from what I saw during the second world war,\" he once said. He was two when the Wehrmacht swept into Holland in 1940, and his earliest memories included summary executions and the sight of his neighbours \"picking up pieces of pilots\". But Verhoeven had another angle on the experience. \"Living in an occupied country is something that's close to me,\" he says, and certainly the subject turns up again and again in his work, either in disguised form, with Starship Troopers, or directly, as in Soldier of Orange. \"But I loved it,\" he recalls. \"I thought war was great - bombing and planes and shooting and people being killed. Really wonderful. Being a child of the war, my tolerance for violence is higher than normal. Kids love violence. As an adult, you realise that violence is real. So my work is anchored in reality, it's hyper-realistic. Hence the need to show everything so explicitly: the fucking and the pricks and the shit and the drugs and the violence.\" All of which earned him the opprobrium of the Dutch bourgeoisie, culminating in the bitter controversy over Spetters in 1980. \"When I did Spetters, I got in big problems with Dutch society and they created this committee called the National Anti-Spetters Committee because they thought the movie was so disgusting that I should be banned from ever making any more movies. There's a lot of harsh things in Spetters, much harsher than in any American movie I've made. There was a lot of resistance. The reaction was even worse than the reactions I got here in the United States for Showgirls. One of the reasons I left the country was that the government subsidy board wasn't willing to give me any money because they thought that I was an indecent, perverted, decadent person. Which is probably true, but they shouldn't have held it against me.\" Thirteen years after RoboCop, Verhoeven is no longer a Dutch emigre with a suspiciously arty-looking back catalogue. He is now a major American director, a figure of - but simultaneously not of - the Hollywood establishment, a maverick within the mainstream plotting a course of outrage and scandal into the new century. And if Hollow Man finds him in something of a creative holding-pattern that unites his two favourite genres - effects-based sci-fi and the suspense thriller - then we should remember that he has other interests, other kinds of movies he'd like to see made. He has long wanted to make a movie about the Crusades, perhaps to make up for the budgetary restraints he chafed under on Flesh + Blood. His interest in a Hitler biopic may be purely theoretical (\"I can't see anyone financing it in the US, and certainly not in Germany\") but he has consulted biographer Ian Kershaw. \"If you touch that subject,\" he says, \"you're dead, basically.\" \"But,\" he says, touching on another biopic he's been researching, \"the same thing applies to Jesus, strangely enough. If you touch Jesus, everybody gets upset.\" Verhoeven, a lapsed Catholic, is a member of the Jesus Seminar, a group of mainly American academics who gather to discuss the historical Jesus. \"What did he really do? What did he really say? I've studied it for nearly 15 years to help me conceive an outline that's nearly done now,\" he says. \"I'm sure it will be controversial. I see the story more from a political point of view. For me it has a lot to do with Roman politics and how the high priests and the top aristocracy of Israel collaborated with the Romans. So you get the collaborating government in an occupied country where the people underneath are suppressed and try to find ways to deal with reality.\" It's encouraging to see Verhoeven cast about for new and profitable subjects with which to offend large sections of the movie-going audience. First he did sex, then violence, then he came to America and did extreme violence, then even more explicit sex, all over again. Hollow Man offers cruelty to (digitally animated) animals, full-frontal male nudity and an invisible rapist. Politics is where he should head next. Think of the protests. So is he mellowing? \"Perhaps when you get older you want to be a little bit more... playful,\" he says. \"For a long time, I had a completely cynical outlook on society. It's still there and it still runs in and out of the movies. But perhaps these days I'm a bit... I won't say wiser...just a bit more normal.\" \u0095 Hollow Man will be screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival on August 25, preceded by a Reel Life discussion with Paul Verhoeven (tickets: 0131-623 8030).",

Five hundred houses close to the home of Michael Horgan, 55, in Lewisham, south-east London, received letters on Wednesday from an organisation calling itself Antimatter. It gave his name and address, and warned he was a twice convicted child molester. An offender with the same surname and first name, living in south London, was identified on Sunday by the paper. Mr Horgan has been given protection overnight and check-up calls every half-hour, and police are investigating the source of the letters. He said yesterday: \"At first I thought it was a hoax, but my mother brought a letter in and she was in a state of shock.\" In the letter Antimatter said it provided \"a service to the community by investigating and identifying anti-social behaviour\". A police spokesman said officers had leafleted the 500 addresses to point out the named resident was wrongly identified, and also said the real man was known to them and being monitored as a matter of routine. Mr Horgan said there had been no incidents so far. Asked about the News of the World's campaign, he said: \"They should take advice from the people that know what they are doing.\" In a statement, the paper said it had repeatedly stressed unlawful vigilante action was wholly unacceptable. On July 23, the Sunday that the paper published its first list, a mob attacked the Manchester home of a man resembling one offender named. Yesterday Cleveland police again criticised the paper for having put in jeopardy an undercover operation to arrest and extradite a sex offender. Stephen Featherstone, 33, was arrested on an unnamed Spanish island, the police said, having quit his bar job on Monday on being named, with a photograph, by the paper on Sunday.

A police constable needed stitches after he was hit by a stone-throwing mob of up to 150 people who gathered outside the Portsmouth home of a man named in the newspaper. Concern was also growing last night after a new organisation claiming to champion the rights of parents wrongly accused two men of being convicted paedophiles as a consequence of the campaign, Scotland Yard said last night. The group, Antimatter, has leafleted hundreds of homes in south London incorrectly describing two men as sex offenders because they share names with two people identified in the paper last Sunday. The victims have been given police protection. Police have conducted a leaflet campaign to persuade neighbours the men had been wrongly targeted. In the latest incident last night, the mob smashed win dows of a council office and innocent home owners after it emerged the man they were targeting had moved out. The attacks came after RAC patrol driver Michael Horgan, 55, of Lewisham, south east London, spoke out against the campaign when he was incorrectly identified as a paedophile. Antimatter sent leaflets to neighbours after a man with the same name was identified in the paper. The leaflet said: \"Thanks to the News of the World we can now target this man as a known paedophile.\" Detective Inspector Steve Lamb of Lewisham CID said: \"This malicious letter has caused Mr Horgan and his family considerable distress.

A week later it published a second set of pictures, and, the paper says, will continue to publish further pictures until it has outed everyone on the register. The paper called its campaign 'For Sarah' and claimed her murder proved police monitoring of paedophiles was not enough. Every parent had a right to know who the paedophiles were, it said. <p><b>What is the sex offenders register? </b><br> There are 12,000 people on the sex offenders register, which came into force in 1997; it includes all sexual crimes. Convicted sex offenders must register their names and addresses with the police, and inform them within 14 days if they move. Any offender failing to register can be jailed for up to six months and fined. The register is not retro-active and so does not include anyone convicted before 1997.

Tony Butler, spokesman on sexual offenders for the association of chief police officers, said anonymity was an essential element of the register and the campaign would only endanger children's lives by driving the paedophiles underground. Police officers and representatives have met with the paper and Sarah Payne's parents in the hope of persuading it to call off the campaign. The police say all the publicity will drive offenders into hiding, perhaps making them more likely to re-offend.</p> <p><b>Is there a precedent for the News of the World's actions?</b><br> Yes. In the outrage that accompanied the release of predatory paedophile Sidney Cooke, and before the introduction of the sex offenders register, the Sunday Express ran a similar campaign along the lines of: 'Could these evil men be living next door to you?' </p> <p><b>What has been the result of the News of the World's actions? </b><br> Public fury has led to cases of 'lynch law' in which people suspected of being sex offenders have had their houses attacked by mobs. In south London, an organisation called Antimatter targeted Victor Terry, 78, an innocent man which it had confused with someone else of the same name. Another innocent man in Beswick, Manchester, was also besieged by vigilantes who mistook him for one of the paedophiles named in the News of the World. The paper says it has made it clear it does not want the public to resort to such actions.</p> <p><b>Who gets told about the movements of sex offenders? </b><br>Head teachers, doctors, youth leaders, sports club managers and others, including landlords, are notified on a confidential basis of the existence of a local sex offender. But a system of general disclosure is unlikely to happen in Britain. In a recent legal ruling, it was declared that it was in society's interests for the offenders to be allowed to live normal, lawful lives.</p> <p><b>What do other countries do? </b><br> In America, parents have access to pictures and details of all registered paedophiles. This right is known as 'Megan's Law' after seven-year-old Megan Kanka, who was found strangled near her New Jersey home six years ago.

      "body": "<p><strong>GIN SWIZZ</strong></p> <p>It is a well-known meteorological fact that if you put half-a-dozen Spurs fans together in a public place, their negative ions will increase the likelihood of rain by 50%. That's why so many keen gardeners live close to White Hart Lane. So it's not surprising to find that the world's most miserable supporters were at it again today, moaning about a \"pathetic\" offer by the club to refund season tickets for those mortally wounded at the sale of 33-year-old winger David Ginola.</p> <p>The offer, announced this morning on the official Spurs website, will run until August 15. But it won't fool the Tottenham Action Group. \"Clearly this publicity stunt has been orchestrated as an attempt to deflect criticism from the club following the sale of Ginola and the lack of a replacement,\" said Mark Jacob, spokesman for TAG (membership: 700). \"Just when the mouth-watering prospect of Sergei Rebrov teaming up with Ginola had whetted our appetite for the forthcoming season, yet again the club have kicked loyal supporters in the teeth.\"</p> <p>The swines. In fact, that \u00a311m they spent on one of the best strikers in Europe over recent seasons was probably just to lull the fans into a false sense of happiness in the first place. And the decision to offer refunds on season tickets because a player had been sold only goes to show how rocky relations are between fans and club (in particular a certain Mr Sugar). It does not bode well for the new season, and neither does the situation look likely to change in the near future. Unless the board bows to fans' demands and re-signs Ginola, plays five up front, and resuscitates Danny Blanchflower, that is.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>HAPPY SIGNING TO YOU</strong></p> <p>The Fiver today stumbled upon a scene of great celebration and merriment. Brightly-coloured flags and bunting lit up the streets. Bands played joyous odes. Thousands of well-wishers lined the streets, cheering, singing and waving. Had the Fiver taken a walk down the Mall to wish the Queen Mum a happy birthday? Sadly no - as the sniper's rifle we'd ordered hadn't turned up. In fact, the party we chanced upon was in Middlesbrough, and was being held to commemorate Bryan Robson finally landing a big-name player - well, these things only happen once in a hundred years.</p> <p>Of course we're joking, because Robson has already bought Christian Karembeu and (ahem) Paul Okon. But there's no question that today's signing of Alen Boksic - who has finally agreed a \u00a32.5m transfer from Lazio - is his most important of the summer. \"I'm delighted Alen wants to join Middlesbrough,\" said Robson today, as he picked silly string out of his hair. \"At his best, I rate him one of the best strikers in Europe.\" Boksic must wait on a work permit before the deal is rubber-stamped, but it would be a major shock if there are any problems - although the injury-prone striker hasn't played much international football of late, his reputation should see him through. What a lovely time everyone is having!</p> <p>Unfortunately, things always seem to turn sour at parties the Fiver goes to. And sure enough, the atmosphere had an added twist of lime when rumours circulated that Christian Ziege will join Liverpool this weekend. And in a double whammy, lawyers have pored over the German's contract and found out that Middlesbrough will be forced to accept Gerard Houllier's \u00a35.5m bid, well under their \u00a38m valuation. Ah well, it's Robbo's party and he'll cry if he wants to.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Two seasons ago we finished seventh, last season it was fourth, so guess what our target is now!\" - Gerard Houllier gives his best Rolf Harris impression ahead of the new season. Either that, or he's testing Steven Gerrard's arithmetic.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUACK QUACK</strong></p> <p>It's not often you see Arsene's Arsenal Wenger looking flustered. But today those famous facial lines seemed to grow into canyons, while his favourite suit appeared just that little bit more dishevelled. And the Fiver - finally taking the opportunity to use the Dr Hillary Jones' Doctor in the House CD-ROM we got for Christmas - was quick to diagnose the appearance of stress. Stress at seeing Overmars and Petit go to Barca. Stress at seeing David Seaman flapping away last night like a particularly happy seagull. And - most importantly of all - stress at the lack of cover for Thierry Henry.</p> <p>It all made perfect sense. Particularly when Wenger started moaning about the lack of cover for Thierry Henry. \"Of course we have Dennis Bergkamp and Kanu who are brilliant second strikers, but we still need more quality of the Thierry Henry type,\" the grim-faced manager admitted, as the Fiver debated whether to move to Harley Street and set up an expensive practice for sloaney types. \"Ideally we must have a second guy who can take the same role as Thierry because we cannot expect him to play all the games next season.\" Pity you gave Davor Suker away for free then.</p> <p>But it could just be that we've fallen victim to a classic Wenger mind game. Because, apparently, Arsenal have just made a \u00a313m take-it-or-leave-it offer to Bordeaux for striker Sylvain Wiltord. And they've given the French club until Monday to respond or Wenger will \"end his interest in the player indefinitely\". (No we don't understand it either, but we're sure it's something very clever.) When Bordeaux coach Elie Baup was asked about Wiltord - who is refusing to train at the moment - he quipped: \"Sylvain who? I don't have a player of that name in my squad!\" He's joking, of course. And come Monday night Arsenal Wenger might be joining him in a stress-relieving smile too.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Bradford are continuing their hunt for a striker. Middlesbrough's Brian Deane is believed to be in talks with the Bantams, and the Yorkshire club is also believed to be willing to match any offer from Manchester City for Paolo Wanchope.</p> <p>Coventry may sign Norwegian striker Thorstein Helstad as replacement for \u00a313m Robbie Keane. The Brann Bergen striker, is represented by notorious agent Rune Hauge, who said: \"It's true that they are interested in Helstad, but we don't expect anything to happen in the near future.\"</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Wolves have signed Temuri Ketsbaia for \u00a3900,000. The Georgian international has put his name to a two-year contract at Molineux, subject to a medical and the granting of a work permit.</p> <p>Geoffrey Richmond fears the name of Bradford City will not be big enough to attract West Ham striker Paulo Wanchope to Valley Parade. The Bantams have matched Manchester City's \u00a34m bid for the 24-year-old and have also agreed personal terms with the Costa Rica international. But Richmond said: \"My gut feeling is that our chances are something less than 50-50. The reason being that there is every possibility he will decide to join what is perceived to be a bigger club. We have been told he will make his mind up on Monday.\"</p> <p>Marc Overmars signed for Barcelona three months ago, according to former Barcelona coach Louis van Gaal. \"Overmars and Gerard are my signings,\" van Gaal told Sport newspaper. \"As for Overmars, we had him tied up three months ago, and Gerard was on my high-priority list of targets.\"</p> <p>Niall Quinn has signed a two-year extension to his current deal that will keep him at Sunderland until 2003.</p> <p>Scotland U-21 international Scott Severin has agreed a new deal with Hearts which will keep him at Tynecastle until 2004.</p> <p>Birmingham midfielder Martin Grainger has agreed a new six-year contract with the club.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (5.30pm, 9pm SS3)</p> <p>Big men toying with balls.</p> <p>International Football (1.30am) </p> <p>Learn to love Chris Waddle again with the official Fifa film of Italia 90.</p> <p>British Eurosport: Women's Football - Live (5pm) </p> <p>Bigots - don't bother.</p>",

But it won't fool the Tottenham Action Group. \"Clearly this publicity stunt has been orchestrated as an attempt to deflect criticism from the club following the sale of Ginola and the lack of a replacement,\" said Mark Jacob, spokesman for TAG (membership: 700). \"Just when the mouth-watering prospect of Sergei Rebrov teaming up with Ginola had whetted our appetite for the forthcoming season, yet again the club have kicked loyal supporters in the teeth.\" The swines. In fact, that \u00a311m they spent on one of the best strikers in Europe over recent seasons was probably just to lull the fans into a false sense of happiness in the first place. And the decision to offer refunds on season tickets because a player had been sold only goes to show how rocky relations are between fans and club (in particular a certain Mr Sugar). It does not bode well for the new season, and neither does the situation look likely to change in the near future. Unless the board bows to fans' demands and re-signs Ginola, plays five up front, and resuscitates Danny Blanchflower, that is. * * * * * * * * * * * * * HAPPY SIGNING TO YOU The Fiver today stumbled upon a scene of great celebration and merriment. Brightly-coloured flags and bunting lit up the streets. Bands played joyous odes. Thousands of well-wishers lined the streets, cheering, singing and waving. Had the Fiver taken a walk down the Mall to wish the Queen Mum a happy birthday? Sadly no - as the sniper's rifle we'd ordered hadn't turned up. In fact, the party we chanced upon was in Middlesbrough, and was being held to commemorate Bryan Robson finally landing a big-name player - well, these things only happen once in a hundred years. Of course we're joking, because Robson has already bought Christian Karembeu and (ahem) Paul Okon. But there's no question that today's signing of Alen Boksic - who has finally agreed a \u00a32.5m transfer from Lazio - is his most important of the summer. \"I'm delighted Alen wants to join Middlesbrough,\" said Robson today, as he picked silly string out of his hair. \"At his best, I rate him one of the best strikers in Europe.\" Boksic must wait on a work permit before the deal is rubber-stamped, but it would be a major shock if there are any problems - although the injury-prone striker hasn't played much international football of late, his reputation should see him through. What a lovely time everyone is having! Unfortunately, things always seem to turn sour at parties the Fiver goes to. And sure enough, the atmosphere had an added twist of lime when rumours circulated that Christian Ziege will join Liverpool this weekend. And in a double whammy, lawyers have pored over the German's contract and found out that Middlesbrough will be forced to accept Gerard Houllier's \u00a35.5m bid, well under their \u00a38m valuation. Ah well, it's Robbo's party and he'll cry if he wants to. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Two seasons ago we finished seventh, last season it was fourth, so guess what our target is now!\" - Gerard Houllier gives his best Rolf Harris impression ahead of the new season. Either that, or he's testing Steven Gerrard's arithmetic. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUACK QUACK It's not often you see Arsene's Arsenal Wenger looking flustered. But today those famous facial lines seemed to grow into canyons, while his favourite suit appeared just that little bit more dishevelled. And the Fiver - finally taking the opportunity to use the Dr Hillary Jones' Doctor in the House CD-ROM we got for Christmas - was quick to diagnose the appearance of stress. Stress at seeing Overmars and Petit go to Barca. Stress at seeing David Seaman flapping away last night like a particularly happy seagull. And - most importantly of all - stress at the lack of cover for Thierry Henry. It all made perfect sense. Particularly when Wenger started moaning about the lack of cover for Thierry Henry. \"Of course we have Dennis Bergkamp and Kanu who are brilliant second strikers, but we still need more quality of the Thierry Henry type,\" the grim-faced manager admitted, as the Fiver debated whether to move to Harley Street and set up an expensive practice for sloaney types. \"Ideally we must have a second guy who can take the same role as Thierry because we cannot expect him to play all the games next season.\" Pity you gave Davor Suker away for free then. But it could just be that we've fallen victim to a classic Wenger mind game. Because, apparently, Arsenal have just made a \u00a313m take-it-or-leave-it offer to Bordeaux for striker Sylvain Wiltord. And they've given the French club until Monday to respond or Wenger will \"end his interest in the player indefinitely\". (No we don't understand it either, but we're sure it's something very clever.) When Bordeaux coach Elie Baup was asked about Wiltord - who is refusing to train at the moment - he quipped: \"Sylvain who? I don't have a player of that name in my squad!\" He's joking, of course. And come Monday night Arsenal Wenger might be joining him in a stress-relieving smile too. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Bradford are continuing their hunt for a striker. Middlesbrough's Brian Deane is believed to be in talks with the Bantams, and the Yorkshire club is also believed to be willing to match any offer from Manchester City for Paolo Wanchope. Coventry may sign Norwegian striker Thorstein Helstad as replacement for \u00a313m Robbie Keane. The Brann Bergen striker, is represented by notorious agent Rune Hauge, who said: \"It's true that they are interested in Helstad, but we don't expect anything to happen in the near future.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Wolves have signed Temuri Ketsbaia for \u00a3900,000. The Georgian international has put his name to a two-year contract at Molineux, subject to a medical and the granting of a work permit. Geoffrey Richmond fears the name of Bradford City will not be big enough to attract West Ham striker Paulo Wanchope to Valley Parade. The Bantams have matched Manchester City's \u00a34m bid for the 24-year-old and have also agreed personal terms with the Costa Rica international. But Richmond said: \"My gut feeling is that our chances are something less than 50-50. The reason being that there is every possibility he will decide to join what is perceived to be a bigger club. We have been told he will make his mind up on Monday.\" Marc Overmars signed for Barcelona three months ago, according to former Barcelona coach Louis van Gaal. \"Overmars and Gerard are my signings,\" van Gaal told Sport newspaper. \"As for Overmars, we had him tied up three months ago, and Gerard was on my high-priority list of targets.\" Niall Quinn has signed a two-year extension to his current deal that will keep him at Sunderland until 2003. Scotland U-21 international Scott Severin has agreed a new deal with Hearts which will keep him at Tynecastle until 2004. Birmingham midfielder Martin Grainger has agreed a new six-year contract with the club. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (5.30pm, 9pm SS3) Big men toying with balls.

      "body": "<p>Only three years ago, the trainer was proclaimed to be on its last legs. A quiet retirement back to the tennis court seemed to be beckoning as Nike's profits slumped by half, Reebok's by 83%, and the buying public seemed more interested in the so-called \"brown shoe\", Birkenstocks et al. </p> <p>Now it's a different story. The first \u00a35,000 pair of trainers is rumoured just to have been sold (a pair of boxfresh Nike Air Jordan 1s, to a Japanese buyer), there is a major sports shoe exhibition, Design Afoot, starting tomorrow at the SanFrancisco Museum of Modern Art (due, according to the show's curator, to the \"immense amount of creativity in the area\"), Sky magazine is bringing out a bumper trainer supplement and the biggest trainer shop in the world, Footlocker, will open on London's Oxford Street next month. </p> <p>The trainer industry's salvation came, ironically, from the fashion world that had ignored it for so long. DKNY's take on the trainer began to fly out of stores, Herm\u00e8s' ludicrously priced trainer sold ludicrously well and Prada produced the ultimate minimal-chic sneaker. Pretty soon the sports companies began to realise it was a case of either acknowledging that nearly 90% of their trainers never even saw a track or field, or face the prospect of a sales drought. Unsurprisingly they took the former option, which takes us up to today. </p> <p>Times are such that trainer shopping today rarely takes place in sports stores. It is increasingly likely to happen in more style-centred boutiques, department stores or in the new breed of trainer shops such as Offspring, Poste, Size? or Frontier that only have passing pretensions of being sports oriented. The new Puma Platinum \"sports couture\" range, for instance (which includes a Christy Turlington-designed yoga shoe that could well become the shoe of the summer), is currently available only in Harvey Nicks and Harrods, and the Adidas Micropacer, a reissue of a 1984 shoe, was only sold in very limited numbers (600 pairs per country) in very limited stores. </p> <p>There is a Nike initiative under way, internally known as the Probe project, which will see small numbers of radically designed shoes leaked into select stores \"when the wider market isn't quite ready\", according to Offspring buyer Ghassan Hodieb, to \"build up interest\". \"It's like the Nike Rift [a cloven, neoprene sandal, now worn by virtually every wannabe trendy the nation over]. That shoe was picked up by a few people years ago [pat yourself on the back if that was you] but now it's been adopted by the mainstream.\" </p> <p>According to Hodeib, the Probe project trainers will look \"like nothing you have ever seen before\". Scheduled for imminent release, one is almost certain to be the Nike Ovidian, a shoe that is completely reversible. Another might (or might not) be the much muttered-about shoe designed by Nike in collaboration with Comme des Gar\u00e7ons' Junya Watanabe. Only sighted so far in Japan and on the web (<a href=\"http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~motonike/\">www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~motonike/</a>), it is as fashion-forward a statement as any major sports company has ever made. </p> <p> Nike's head of design, Tinker Hatfield, says the future of Nike footwear is \"smarter materials and more minimalist design.

      "bodyText": "Only three years ago, the trainer was proclaimed to be on its last legs. A quiet retirement back to the tennis court seemed to be beckoning as Nike's profits slumped by half, Reebok's by 83%, and the buying public seemed more interested in the so-called \"brown shoe\", Birkenstocks et al. Now it's a different story. The first \u00a35,000 pair of trainers is rumoured just to have been sold (a pair of boxfresh Nike Air Jordan 1s, to a Japanese buyer), there is a major sports shoe exhibition, Design Afoot, starting tomorrow at the SanFrancisco Museum of Modern Art (due, according to the show's curator, to the \"immense amount of creativity in the area\"), Sky magazine is bringing out a bumper trainer supplement and the biggest trainer shop in the world, Footlocker, will open on London's Oxford Street next month. The trainer industry's salvation came, ironically, from the fashion world that had ignored it for so long. DKNY's take on the trainer began to fly out of stores, Herm\u00e8s' ludicrously priced trainer sold ludicrously well and Prada produced the ultimate minimal-chic sneaker. Pretty soon the sports companies began to realise it was a case of either acknowledging that nearly 90% of their trainers never even saw a track or field, or face the prospect of a sales drought. Unsurprisingly they took the former option, which takes us up to today. Times are such that trainer shopping today rarely takes place in sports stores. It is increasingly likely to happen in more style-centred boutiques, department stores or in the new breed of trainer shops such as Offspring, Poste, Size? or Frontier that only have passing pretensions of being sports oriented. The new Puma Platinum \"sports couture\" range, for instance (which includes a Christy Turlington-designed yoga shoe that could well become the shoe of the summer), is currently available only in Harvey Nicks and Harrods, and the Adidas Micropacer, a reissue of a 1984 shoe, was only sold in very limited numbers (600 pairs per country) in very limited stores. There is a Nike initiative under way, internally known as the Probe project, which will see small numbers of radically designed shoes leaked into select stores \"when the wider market isn't quite ready\", according to Offspring buyer Ghassan Hodieb, to \"build up interest\". \"It's like the Nike Rift [a cloven, neoprene sandal, now worn by virtually every wannabe trendy the nation over]. That shoe was picked up by a few people years ago [pat yourself on the back if that was you] but now it's been adopted by the mainstream.\" According to Hodeib, the Probe project trainers will look \"like nothing you have ever seen before\". Scheduled for imminent release, one is almost certain to be the Nike Ovidian, a shoe that is completely reversible. Another might (or might not) be the much muttered-about shoe designed by Nike in collaboration with Comme des Gar\u00e7ons' Junya Watanabe. Only sighted so far in Japan and on the web (www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~motonike/), it is as fashion-forward a statement as any major sports company has ever made. Nike's head of design, Tinker Hatfield, says the future of Nike footwear is \"smarter materials and more minimalist design. Somewhere shoes have gotten to the point where a lot of them are overdesigned.\" Hatfield is no doubt aware of the fashion crowd's recent predilection for the super-simple Adidas Stan Smith and Converse Jack Purcell. (And if it's Purcells you're after, try the new laceless jack slip-ons or chuck toggles.) But technologies still play a major part in the cold war between sports shoe companies, especially with the Sydney Olympics almost upon us. Adidas have their Torsion technology, the Japanese company Asics uses a gel system, while Converse, in a rather crude case of oneupmanship with Nike, fill their shoes with \"lighter than air\" helium molecules. Meanwhile Reebok, after their gloriously gimmicky Pump innovation (the idea being you pump up the shoes), have turned to a system called DMX which incorporates pockets of moving air.

      "body": "<b>Dear Caroline,</b> <br> Let's be honest, life without supermarkets would be hell. Thanks to their existence, what used to take all day now takes a couple of hours. Thirty years ago, by the time you had walked up and down the high street, visited a host of stores, queued at counters and checkouts and then trekked back home with as many bags as you could carry, the day was more or less over. And stores only opened nine to five. Now, responding to consumer demand, supermarkets operate extended opening hours and trade on Sundays. The number of lines stocked has also increased out of all recognition. Supermarkets now offer the choice of up to 40,000 lines - everything from economy to niche products at very competitive prices; they provide free car-parking and a number of other facilities such as financial services. They also sell a superb range of own labels, and offer home deliveries and internet shopping. Generally, none of us has to drive too far to get to the supermarket: we find them out-of-town or on the high street. A number of retailers are looking at even more convenient outlets in railway stations. Thirty years ago, customers would have given their right hand to shop in these sort of outlets, which we now take for granted. Yours sincerely, <br> William Moyes <br> Director general The British Retail Consortium <br> <br> <p><b>Dear William,</b><br><br> I agree. Most people who can, choose to shop in supermarkets for all the reasons you describe. Society now depends on them. They are here to stay. The global economy itself is vulnerable: to political instability, to unsustainable reliance on finite fossil fuels and to climate change produced by global warming.<br><br> But the argument has to move on. The country is saturated with superstores. Now is the time to count the cost of this convenience. The forces driving the supermarkets to ever-fiercer competition and increasing vertical concentration can also increase social deprivation and destroy the enabling structure of our local food economies which sustain our market towns and villages, the food producers who supply them and the people who depend on them.<br><br> Please remember that there are consumers who exist beyond the rosy glow of the supermarket - those who have no car, who are not on the internet, who live in a cash economy, whose shopping budgets are too small to qualify for home deliveries, who need their local shop for social contact and conversation. And don't forget the local food producers. Virtually all food production starts small-scale and depends on small retail outlets. <br><br>In east Suffolk, following the threat of a superstore, I surveyed 81 food shops and discovered they were sourcing food from 295 local producers. When superstores open, small shops close. Small shops, farms and food businesses are interdependent, providing employment and consumer choice. They are the basis of the rural economy. The way forward is to ensure we have the framework in place that enables the supermarkets to co-exist with the parallel integrated local economy, rather then compete with it until it is destroyed.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> (Lady) Caroline Cranbrook Campaigner<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Caroline,</b><br><br> The perception that suprmarkets operate out of \"sheds\" is not true. It is also worth emphasising that supermarkets have since 1996 been moving away from the larger format and are exploring a number of smaller, city-centre options.<br><br> I also disagree with you that competition is increasing social deprivation. The supermarkets are either testing or already running a number of initiatives to ensure that shoppers who live on estates can get to stores easily. There are bus schemes; a number of outlets offer taxi services; and some are investigating outlets on estates. But before stores can be sited on estates, crime needs to be addressed. It is also worth pointing out that supermarkets have been cutting prices for years. BRC's Shop Price Index, which is compiled independently, shows prices falling for the last 15 months in a row.<br><br> On suppliers, this week the industry has put together a code of practice to monitor the relationship between retailers and suppliers - a code welcomed by the NFU. All supermarkets, where they can, will use local suppliers. But it is paramount that these suppliers comply with appropriate legislation; that the quality of their products is first class and that production is adequate for the stores' needs.<br><br> Finally, I feel you forget a crucial ingredient: the consumer, who chooses where to shop. And if the supermarket is being chosen over and above the local shop, that is the nature of competition. It is important to remember that supermarkets are taking part in a number of initiatives to help local shops trade and in many instances survive. On job creation, here are the latest figures - the grocery sector employs 790,000 and has created 170,000 new jobs.<br><br> William Moyes<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear William,</b><br><br> You have not addressed the fundamental problem I identified in my last letter: the need to ensure that the global economy of the supermarkets does not extinguish local food economies. <br><br>Size is fundamental to the whole problem. Supermarkets that are inappropriately large for their catchment area undoubtedly result in the closure of independent retailers. Thanks to government planning guidelines, few edge-of-town and out-of-town superstores are now being built. Government is now encouraging appropriately sized supermarkets in towns. But despite a number of small-scale initiatives, supermarkets have still not taken this policy on board.<br><br> The minister for local government has said that we are continuing to get \"proposals for inappropriately sized supermarkets - even superstores - trying to piggy-back on designated local centres, or claiming to regenerate large out-of-centre sites\". It is because of the growth of supermarkets that local shops have closed, leading to the creation of \"food deserts\". Solving the problem is certainly the responsibility of a number of stake-holders, including government and the police, not just the retailers. I hope you in turn will support the briefing paper published last week by The Centre for Food Policy. We need a multi-departmental strategy to solve the problem, and probably a Better Shops Task Force and Retailing Regulator as well.<br><br> Thirdly, there is local sourcing. Supermarkets have started identifying local products in their stores, which is good news. But these are usually from their mainline suppliers who happen to be local. I am concerned with providing a market for small producers. This summer, it was sad to see some of our local supermarkets stocking asparagus from abroad when British fields were filled with a much tastier home product.<br><br> Caroline Cranbrook<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Caroline,</b><br><br> Your approach to the issue of large v small is simplistic. And you fail to take into consideration the business case. But, I think it is important to point out at this stage that BRC represents the interest of the large, medium and small retailers and has a vested interest in seeing them all prosper and flourish. Diversity is a strength.<br><br> Supermarkets are not in the business of \"extinguishing\" smaller operators. It is a fact that many smaller operators fail because of a whole series of underlying costs and burdens which can impact on them more severely than on the large - such as upward only rent reviews; rates; the cost of crime and the burden of regulation, to name a few. Secondly, many smaller operators take the supermarkets head-on instead of seeking out innovative/niche ways of tackling the competition.<br><br> As to the criticism that supermarkets have still not taken on board the planning policies - that is rubbish! Supermarkets adhere rigidly to PPG 6 and 13 as interpreted through local development plans. The bottom line is that they are sticking to the guidance and local planning policies. We have the toughest planning regime in the European Union and it has been toughened twice since the introduction of PPG 6.<br><br> Equally untrue is the criticism that supermarkets have created food deserts. In most of these areas the problems of exclusion pre-date the growth in the expansion of supermarkets in the 80s and early 90s. Many estates were built without access to services into consideration, whether that be a doctor's surgery, dentist or retailer.<br><br> Retailers are not the cause of social exclusion, but can be part of the solution. Supermarkets do, where they can, work with small local suppliers. But these suppliers need to adhere to all legislation; the quality has to be first-class and production has to be adequate for the stores' needs. In many parts of the country, supermarkets provide shelf space for products supplied by regional food groups.<br><br> Finally, consumers can shop locally - but they also have the option of shopping by car, especially when doing the weekly shop. The growth of large supermarkets is not going unchecked. But the bottom line is: consumers are in control. They are demanding a wider range of products and services than ever before. If that is what they want that is what they will get!<br><br> William Moyes<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear William,</b><br><br> I am not arguing that we should try to reverse the growth of supermarkets. Like many others I want to ensure that this continued growth is not to the irreversible detriment of the local community. Current retailing policy is driven largely by the multiples. We have no overall strategy for agriculture and retailing, though the two are interdependent.<br><br> Despite the abundance, choice and convenience of the supermarket, local food marketing is one of the fastest growing movements in retailing, as we see from the rapid expansion of farmers markets (0 to 250 in three years). Retailing in the 21st century must provide the consumer with the choice to shop outside the supermarket. The local food economy is sustainable, it reduces food miles, lessens car use and it underpins neighbourhood renewal in both urban and rural areas. We need to support local communities by ensuring the survival of local retailing but without depriving consumers of the benefits of out-of-town shopping.<br><br> It is not about one or the other but a third way, and we must address it together - government, consumers, producers and retailers, large and small.<br><br> Caroline Cranbrook</p> <p><b>Links</b> <br><br> <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/\">British Retail Consortium</a><br> <a href=\"http://http://www.cpre.org.uk/\">Council for the protection of Rural England </a><br></p>",

But it is paramount that these suppliers comply with appropriate legislation; that the quality of their products is first class and that production is adequate for the stores' needs. Finally, I feel you forget a crucial ingredient: the consumer, who chooses where to shop. And if the supermarket is being chosen over and above the local shop, that is the nature of competition. It is important to remember that supermarkets are taking part in a number of initiatives to help local shops trade and in many instances survive. On job creation, here are the latest figures - the grocery sector employs 790,000 and has created 170,000 new jobs. William Moyes Dear William, You have not addressed the fundamental problem I identified in my last letter: the need to ensure that the global economy of the supermarkets does not extinguish local food economies. Size is fundamental to the whole problem. Supermarkets that are inappropriately large for their catchment area undoubtedly result in the closure of independent retailers. Thanks to government planning guidelines, few edge-of-town and out-of-town superstores are now being built. Government is now encouraging appropriately sized supermarkets in towns. But despite a number of small-scale initiatives, supermarkets have still not taken this policy on board. The minister for local government has said that we are continuing to get \"proposals for inappropriately sized supermarkets - even superstores - trying to piggy-back on designated local centres, or claiming to regenerate large out-of-centre sites\". It is because of the growth of supermarkets that local shops have closed, leading to the creation of \"food deserts\". Solving the problem is certainly the responsibility of a number of stake-holders, including government and the police, not just the retailers. I hope you in turn will support the briefing paper published last week by The Centre for Food Policy. We need a multi-departmental strategy to solve the problem, and probably a Better Shops Task Force and Retailing Regulator as well. Thirdly, there is local sourcing. Supermarkets have started identifying local products in their stores, which is good news. But these are usually from their mainline suppliers who happen to be local. I am concerned with providing a market for small producers. This summer, it was sad to see some of our local supermarkets stocking asparagus from abroad when British fields were filled with a much tastier home product. Caroline Cranbrook Dear Caroline, Your approach to the issue of large v small is simplistic. And you fail to take into consideration the business case. But, I think it is important to point out at this stage that BRC represents the interest of the large, medium and small retailers and has a vested interest in seeing them all prosper and flourish. Diversity is a strength. Supermarkets are not in the business of \"extinguishing\" smaller operators. It is a fact that many smaller operators fail because of a whole series of underlying costs and burdens which can impact on them more severely than on the large - such as upward only rent reviews; rates; the cost of crime and the burden of regulation, to name a few. Secondly, many smaller operators take the supermarkets head-on instead of seeking out innovative/niche ways of tackling the competition. As to the criticism that supermarkets have still not taken on board the planning policies - that is rubbish! Supermarkets adhere rigidly to PPG 6 and 13 as interpreted through local development plans. The bottom line is that they are sticking to the guidance and local planning policies. We have the toughest planning regime in the European Union and it has been toughened twice since the introduction of PPG 6. Equally untrue is the criticism that supermarkets have created food deserts. In most of these areas the problems of exclusion pre-date the growth in the expansion of supermarkets in the 80s and early 90s. Many estates were built without access to services into consideration, whether that be a doctor's surgery, dentist or retailer. Retailers are not the cause of social exclusion, but can be part of the solution. Supermarkets do, where they can, work with small local suppliers. But these suppliers need to adhere to all legislation; the quality has to be first-class and production has to be adequate for the stores' needs. In many parts of the country, supermarkets provide shelf space for products supplied by regional food groups. Finally, consumers can shop locally - but they also have the option of shopping by car, especially when doing the weekly shop. The growth of large supermarkets is not going unchecked. But the bottom line is: consumers are in control. They are demanding a wider range of products and services than ever before. If that is what they want that is what they will get! William Moyes Dear William, I am not arguing that we should try to reverse the growth of supermarkets. Like many others I want to ensure that this continued growth is not to the irreversible detriment of the local community. Current retailing policy is driven largely by the multiples. We have no overall strategy for agriculture and retailing, though the two are interdependent. Despite the abundance, choice and convenience of the supermarket, local food marketing is one of the fastest growing movements in retailing, as we see from the rapid expansion of farmers markets (0 to 250 in three years). Retailing in the 21st century must provide the consumer with the choice to shop outside the supermarket. The local food economy is sustainable, it reduces food miles, lessens car use and it underpins neighbourhood renewal in both urban and rural areas. We need to support local communities by ensuring the survival of local retailing but without depriving consumers of the benefits of out-of-town shopping. It is not about one or the other but a third way, and we must address it together - government, consumers, producers and retailers, large and small.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of well-wishers cheered the Queen Mother today as she celebrated her 100th birthday today with other members of the royal family. With a wave and a familiar smile, the royal family's first centenarian took the nation's salute from the famous balcony of Buckingham Palace. Earlier, she received a birthday card from her daughter the Queen, who signed the personal greeting \"Lilibet\" - her childhood name. The Queen Mother asked her equerry, Irish Guards Captain William de Rouet, to open the envelope with his sword. An estimated 40,000 well-wishers packed The Mall from Clarence House, the Queen Mother's London residence, to Buckingham Palace, to see the royal centenarian ride in an open carriage with her eldest grandson, the Prince of Wales. She rode in an Ascot landau, decorated in her racing colours with garlands of gold and blue flowers, and pulled by four greys. A 41-gun royal salute was fired from nearby Green Park, earlier than expected, as the horse-drawn carriage entered the palace forecourt. People sang Happy Birthday To You, cheered, and waved flags and banners as the Queen Mother stepped out on to the palace balcony. The band of the Coldstream Guards played Happy Birthday To You and then one of the Queen Mother's favourite songs, Congratulations. The Queen Mother moved her hands and arms to the rhythm of the music as the band struck up the 60s Cliff Richard hit. She took the nation's salute - every wave met by a loud cheer - with her two daughters, the Queen and Princess Margaret, who were soon joined by the rest of the royal family. Prince William, 18, and stood chatting to his father, the Prince of Wales, with his younger brother, Prince Harry, 15, nearby. All senior royals celebrated with the Queen Mother at a private family lunch amid the splendour of the Bow Room at the palace. Tonight, the Queen Mother was expected to go to the ballet with the Queen and Princess Margaret at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, central London. Along the Mall there was a visible police presence after fears that renegade republican terrorists may disrupt the day, but most well-wishers were oblivious to the security arrangements as they strained for a glimpse of the royal carriage. Among the crowd was Connie Missinger, a 47-year-old librarian from St Louis, Missouri. She said: \"I came here especially for the birthday.

As a matter of fact, now that I get an eyeful of you, I actually feel pretty fucking good that you didn't like it.\" \u0095 Despite charges of illegality, and an investigation by the Californian Labor Commission (see our news story), the site that allows you to bid for movie roles Whowantstobeamoviestar.com is having the last laugh. With the auctions coming to a close this week (only the lead actor role remains to be bought), the site has already raised more than $200,000, and has had more than 1,500 bids. The film has yet to have a title, let alone a script.",

Gruau, one of the last great fashion magazine illustrators before fashion photographers stepped in to dominate the field, used strong outlines to emphasise a woman's shape.

We are at last fed up with that unisex look - all baggy combats and hooded tops - and delicate luxury (think Fendi and Prada) is again a desirable look. </p> <p>At this year's autumn/winter 2000 collections, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs, Galliano and Prada all paid their respects to the past with belted jackets, slim-fitting skirt suits, tweeds, tailored coats and fur collars, all accessorised with either ladylike hand-held structured bags, or demure peep-hole pumps. Kors even threw some fedora hats and large pearls into the mix, for heaven's sake! </p> <p>Yes, the 40s are very much in fashion and, thanks to their emphasis on grown-up elegance, this is one trend that allows you to look both fashionable and stylish. And unlike the other current fashion favourite decade, the 80s, the 40s look can be done subtly - a clutchbag here, a curvy pump there, and you've got the look without looking too much of a blast from the past. </p> <p>But it is, aptly, Dior's designer Galliano who most clearly utilises the lessons from the 40s. Unlike other designers, Galliano does not simply mimic the exact items of clothing from the past but rather expands on the experimentations of his predecessors. Besides their notoriously outr\u00e9 elements, Galliano's clothes for Dior employ deconstructed corsets and pleated trains, which both emphasise and distort the female figure, creating a modernised, exciting version of the New Look for a new generation.</p>",

The Londoners' 2-1 defeat merely reinforced that the loss of those two players to the Catalan club could be the difference between success and failure at Highbury this season. </p> <p>To add to Arsenal's discomfort, Barcelona chose to play Overmars against his former employers. Petit was left on the bench rubbing shoulders with the likes of Rivaldo before replacing the Dutchman early in the second half to catcalls from the smattering of English fans. </p> <p>Perhaps Arsenal were concentrating too much on giving Overmars an old-fashioned English welcome as Barcelona went ahead through Josep Guardiola's third-minute penalty before the Dutch winger had touched the ball. When he finally did, he teased Lee Dixon, above, before shooting at David Seaman. </p> <p>The Gunners' Lithuanian triallist Tomas Danilevicius equalised but Philip Cocu, who has expressed an interest in playing for Arsenal, restored the lead before half-time. </p> <p>Earlier the summer's biggest spenders Lazio, who bought around \u00a371m worth of players in the close-season, left out their major new signings Hernan Crespo, who cost \u00a336m from Parma, and Claudio Lopez, a \u00a313m buy from Valencia. </p> <p>But with a team including Dejan Stankovic, Pavel Nedved, Marcelo Salas, Sinisa Mihajlovic and Fabrizio Ravanelli, they drew 0-0 with Ajax in the opening game.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The roof remained closed at the Amsterdam Arena last night where Arsenal were given the first chance to assess whether the ceiling has already fallen in on their Premiership and Champions League ambitions, writes Neil Martin . Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side had their first taste of life without Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit in the Amsterdam Tournament against, of all teams, Barcelona. The Londoners' 2-1 defeat merely reinforced that the loss of those two players to the Catalan club could be the difference between success and failure at Highbury this season. To add to Arsenal's discomfort, Barcelona chose to play Overmars against his former employers. Petit was left on the bench rubbing shoulders with the likes of Rivaldo before replacing the Dutchman early in the second half to catcalls from the smattering of English fans. Perhaps Arsenal were concentrating too much on giving Overmars an old-fashioned English welcome as Barcelona went ahead through Josep Guardiola's third-minute penalty before the Dutch winger had touched the ball. When he finally did, he teased Lee Dixon, above, before shooting at David Seaman. The Gunners' Lithuanian triallist Tomas Danilevicius equalised but Philip Cocu, who has expressed an interest in playing for Arsenal, restored the lead before half-time. Earlier the summer's biggest spenders Lazio, who bought around \u00a371m worth of players in the close-season, left out their major new signings Hernan Crespo, who cost \u00a336m from Parma, and Claudio Lopez, a \u00a313m buy from Valencia. But with a team including Dejan Stankovic, Pavel Nedved, Marcelo Salas, Sinisa Mihajlovic and Fabrizio Ravanelli, they drew 0-0 with Ajax in the opening game.",

This is standard for most modern policies, but private pensions taken out more than 10 years ago might be 'return-of-contribution' policies, where only the amount put in less charges is handed back. In this case it may be worth switching your policy - but check to see if the life office will charge a penalty, in which case it may be cheaper to stay put. Your pension pot may automatically go to relatives unless otherwise stated. Check the plan for a nomination form, where you can specify your chosen beneficiary. Remember, you may want to change the nomination in the future - this should simply require the signing of a new form which can be dealt with via post. If the pension plan does not have a nomination form you can always put down all the details in a will. See the section on wills for further details.",

But when we've got 6,000 farmers in Lincolnshire and only a dozen or so are agreeing to do trials, you've got to ask yourself why.\" Mr Milligan-Manby expects to go to the meeting and wants to talk things over with his brother before commenting in detail, but his basic attitude is that agriculture needs progress, and progress cannot happen without tests. \"I can see where Kate O'Connell's coming from but we live in the real world, with ghastly things like famine or Aids, and science has been our friend in improving things or preventing even worse things from happening. These are tests of products which have already jumped through lots of hoops for something like 10 years.\" Matthew Bell, whose Lincolnshire Organic Producers Network has farmers on the Bain valley, said: \"The speed of these trials is threatening Lincolnshire's other great prospect: serious interest in organics, at last, from the big growers.\"",

New tests designed to catch out motorists who have been ingesting white lines rather than following them are to be introduced by police in response to a sixfold increase in drug-related road deaths in the past decade. Drivers suspected of indulging in cocaine, cannabis, ecstasy or heroin will be asked to carry out a range of roadside callisthenics intended to indicate whether their performance at the wheel has been affected by illegal drugs. As well as standing flamingo-like and touching the nose, drivers will be asked to walk in a straight line while counting their steps and to count off 30 seconds with their eyes closed without losing too much time. Finally pupil size will be compared with a card held next to a suspect's face with varying sizes of pupils imprinted on it. Small pupils indicate heroin use, large pupils are a sign of cocaine or ecstasy. The tests will be employed in the absence of a reliable drugs \"breathaliser\". Anyone who fails one of the four tests, which can be repeated up to three times each, will be arrested and will have to provide a blood or urine sample for analysis. Under a training scheme introduced by the Association of Chief Police Officers, officers will receive drug recognition training (DRT) to help them identify drug users, and instruction in field impairment testing (FIT) designed to catch out the unfit. Tell-tale signs of drug use officers will be taught to look for include poor coordination or balance, slurred speech or drowsiness and facial itching. Police expect to see a huge increase in the number of convictions for drug driving in the next 12 months and estimate they will take samples from 20,000 motorists in that time.

The government has decided to press on with the planting before deciding next month whether to change existing buffer zones designed to protect the purity of crops from most cross-pollination. </p> <p>The delay is partly because ministers are awaiting the results of a Canadian government investigation into the Advanta company's claims that its seeds were contaminated in 1998 over distances far greater than allowed for in Britain. </p> <p>The government did not go public on the mistake until a month after Advanta informed the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of the Environment. The select committee called for clearer procedures over handling such incidents, saying there was obvious confusion between the ministries. </p> <p>\"The lengthy internal debates on the incidents contrasts with the robust, rapid Swedish disclosure in like circumstances,\" the committee said. </p> <p>It was essential farmers could plant conventional rape crops over the next few weeks with confidence. \"That means this year's batch of seed must be tested and certified as free from GM content. For farmers near the field trials, it is also vital that they can be sure that their crops are protected as far as possible from inadvertent cross-pollination...\" </p> <p>That would require a rapid decision on buffer zones. The committee recognised that 100% purity was neither possible nor verifiable. But the Advanta affair had \"highlighted a gap in the regulatory framework for the control of GM organisms which has serious consequences for segregation and consumer confidence\". </p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture said the government had \"learned some important lessons\" from the episode. But Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of Harrods, said he was suing both the government and Advanta after 55 acres on his Balnagowan estate in the Highlands was unwittingly planted with contaminated rape seed. He accused the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, of showing \"utter incompetence in failing to understand the gravity of the situation\". </p> <p>Many new trial sites are on or near 48 farms already involved in the three year programme. Crops on 10 existing sites have been damaged by anti-GM activists in recent weeks, and far more will be needed in 2001 and 2002 for the research, designed to measure whether there is any damage to wildlife and any genetic transfer between GM and non-GM crops. </p> <p>No work has yet been done on measuring transfer outside the sites involved in the trials despite fears that this could happen over miles. The existing buffer zones between GM and non-GM crops are 50m for rape and maize for animal feed and 200m for sweetcorn, although distances of up to 600m are needed for some organic crops. </p> <p>Ministers appear uncertain how much contamination should be tolerated, with Michael Meacher, environment minister, apparently thinking a level as low as 0.1%, the lowest measurable amount, might be needed for consumer confidence. A study for the government written by the national institute of agricultural botany, Cambridge, suggested that at those levels buffer zones would need to double for rape and sweetcorn. But distances could be reduced if a 1% contamination level was acceptable.</p>",

They condemned delays in telling the public about the mistake involving seeds grown on the Canadian prairie and the confusion that existed between separate ministries before hundreds of farmers who had unwittingly planted the crops were advised to destroy them. The Commons agriculture select committee's report on the embarrassing affair coincided with the publication of 25 new trial sites for winter-growing GM rape, although these will not be confirmed until later this month. The government has decided to press on with the planting before deciding next month whether to change existing buffer zones designed to protect the purity of crops from most cross-pollination. The delay is partly because ministers are awaiting the results of a Canadian government investigation into the Advanta company's claims that its seeds were contaminated in 1998 over distances far greater than allowed for in Britain. The government did not go public on the mistake until a month after Advanta informed the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of the Environment. The select committee called for clearer procedures over handling such incidents, saying there was obvious confusion between the ministries. \"The lengthy internal debates on the incidents contrasts with the robust, rapid Swedish disclosure in like circumstances,\" the committee said. It was essential farmers could plant conventional rape crops over the next few weeks with confidence. \"That means this year's batch of seed must be tested and certified as free from GM content. For farmers near the field trials, it is also vital that they can be sure that their crops are protected as far as possible from inadvertent cross-pollination...\" That would require a rapid decision on buffer zones. The committee recognised that 100% purity was neither possible nor verifiable. But the Advanta affair had \"highlighted a gap in the regulatory framework for the control of GM organisms which has serious consequences for segregation and consumer confidence\". The Ministry of Agriculture said the government had \"learned some important lessons\" from the episode. But Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of Harrods, said he was suing both the government and Advanta after 55 acres on his Balnagowan estate in the Highlands was unwittingly planted with contaminated rape seed. He accused the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, of showing \"utter incompetence in failing to understand the gravity of the situation\". Many new trial sites are on or near 48 farms already involved in the three year programme. Crops on 10 existing sites have been damaged by anti-GM activists in recent weeks, and far more will be needed in 2001 and 2002 for the research, designed to measure whether there is any damage to wildlife and any genetic transfer between GM and non-GM crops. No work has yet been done on measuring transfer outside the sites involved in the trials despite fears that this could happen over miles. The existing buffer zones between GM and non-GM crops are 50m for rape and maize for animal feed and 200m for sweetcorn, although distances of up to 600m are needed for some organic crops. Ministers appear uncertain how much contamination should be tolerated, with Michael Meacher, environment minister, apparently thinking a level as low as 0.1%, the lowest measurable amount, might be needed for consumer confidence. A study for the government written by the national institute of agricultural botany, Cambridge, suggested that at those levels buffer zones would need to double for rape and sweetcorn. But distances could be reduced if a 1% contamination level was acceptable.",

Gordon Brown and his bride, Sarah Macaulay, had been within 18 hours of pulling off the private family occasion they had so carefully planned when they were hit by the matrimonial equivalent of a Budget leak.</p> <p>And this was the result. Instead of 20 or so close family, friends and assorted children gathering for a quiet nuptial at Mr Brown's redbrick home, high above the Forth bridges in North Queensferry, there was a media scrum at the gate.</p> <p>Their prey cornered, nearly 100 photographers and reporters waited for the nod from Inspector Benny Byers, then streamed up the gravel drive and walked all over the back lawn (as we'd promised not to) for the agreed photo-call.</p> <p>Prompt at 11.30am, it became another Brown promise delivered, but it was proof that a man may have nerves of steel when macro-managing a \u00a31 trillion economy and still be painfully shy about his private affairs. The chancellor's face looked happy but his hands were all awkwardness.</p> <p>\"A kiss, sir,\" cried the snappers after the newly weds came diffidently through the back door following the Church of Scotland service (no hymns, no vows of obedience). \"Is this the happiest day of your life?\" shouted the Sun, eager to strike up a conversation. No answer. You could have attacked the comprehensive spending review in detail yesterday and still not got a word out of him.</p> <p>The new Mrs Brown, whose long term investment strategy has proved every bit as clever as her husband's, wore an elegant cream silk suit by Louise Kennedy, Mr Brown looked as neat as he is ever likely to in his usual dark blue suit and white shirt. He was wearing a pink I-bought-it-for-the-wedding tie, smart enough but knotted so that it hung halfway to his knees. It is something else for Mrs B to take in hand.</p> <p>\"Another kiss please,\" they cried after Gordon, 49, and Sarah, 36, had whispered briefly (an \"informal bilateral\" in Whitehall-speak) before engaging in a tentative peck. They tried three times without getting it quite right.

      "bodyText": "It may have been his wedding day, but for once it was hard not to feel sorry for Britain's Iron Chancellor. Gordon Brown and his bride, Sarah Macaulay, had been within 18 hours of pulling off the private family occasion they had so carefully planned when they were hit by the matrimonial equivalent of a Budget leak. And this was the result. Instead of 20 or so close family, friends and assorted children gathering for a quiet nuptial at Mr Brown's redbrick home, high above the Forth bridges in North Queensferry, there was a media scrum at the gate. Their prey cornered, nearly 100 photographers and reporters waited for the nod from Inspector Benny Byers, then streamed up the gravel drive and walked all over the back lawn (as we'd promised not to) for the agreed photo-call. Prompt at 11.30am, it became another Brown promise delivered, but it was proof that a man may have nerves of steel when macro-managing a \u00a31 trillion economy and still be painfully shy about his private affairs. The chancellor's face looked happy but his hands were all awkwardness. \"A kiss, sir,\" cried the snappers after the newly weds came diffidently through the back door following the Church of Scotland service (no hymns, no vows of obedience). \"Is this the happiest day of your life?\" shouted the Sun, eager to strike up a conversation. No answer. You could have attacked the comprehensive spending review in detail yesterday and still not got a word out of him. The new Mrs Brown, whose long term investment strategy has proved every bit as clever as her husband's, wore an elegant cream silk suit by Louise Kennedy, Mr Brown looked as neat as he is ever likely to in his usual dark blue suit and white shirt. He was wearing a pink I-bought-it-for-the-wedding tie, smart enough but knotted so that it hung halfway to his knees. It is something else for Mrs B to take in hand. \"Another kiss please,\" they cried after Gordon, 49, and Sarah, 36, had whispered briefly (an \"informal bilateral\" in Whitehall-speak) before engaging in a tentative peck. They tried three times without getting it quite right. A month on Cape Cod will do wonders. Those of us who cover all the big social weddings remembered that, back in 1981, Prince Charles had responded more convincingly to the challenge - and look where that got everyone. So perhaps the Browns' reticence was a good omen. Twenty-fours hours earlier nothing of this was supposed to be happening.

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office last night was urgently seeking information from the Yugoslav authorities over the arrest of two British police officers accused of being armed with military equipment to train pro-western forces in Montenegro. Amid rising tension in the region before next month's federal elections, the Yugoslav army named the Britons as Adrian Prangnell, 41, a police detective sergeant based at Waterlooville in Hampshire, and John Yore, 31, a constable in the Cambridgeshire force. They were arrested on Mount Cakor in Montenegro, near the Kosovo border, on Tuesday night along with two Canadians, Shaun Going and his nephew, Liam Hall, who are thought to have been working as contractors. Serbian authorities have recently claimed that the SAS and special forces from other countries were training Montenegrin police in preparation for the republic's secession from Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav army said it had \"enough material to prove the true intentions and aims of the arrested\". The allegations were dismissed as \"absolutely absurd\" by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which said the two Britons had been seconded to a police training school in Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, to act as instructors. A spokesman said they had been given \"extended weekend leave\" and it was not clear where they had gone. The two Canadians are employees of Meridian Resources of Calgary, a contractor working in Kosovo. The company said they went missing after a brief holiday in Montenegro. However, a Yugoslav army spokesman Colonel Slobodan Stojanovic, described the four men as \"not tourists, but terrorists\". He added: \"Illegal material was found in their possession for which criminal charges are earmarked.\" Yugoslavia, which is stepping up anti-western propaganda ahead of the September 24 federal elections, announced on Monday that four Dutchmen were arrested in July allegedly for plotting to kill or abduct the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, or the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and bring them to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. There are fears that Mr Milosevic might attempt to topple the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, while the US is engrossed in its presidential elections this autumn and reassert his control. There are already Serb garrisons in the autonomous republic. According to western diplomats, the US and Britain are drawing up contingency plans to impose a \"no-fly zone\" over Montenegro if Slobodan Milosevic threatens to use force against the republic. But a Yugoslav foreign ministry official said any such zone would be an unprecedented provocation. Strobe Talbott, the US deputy secretary of state, and General Wesley Clark, the former Nato commander who led the campaign in Kosovo, are both convinced that the Serb leader will strike in the next few months. General Clark, in particular, urged the White House and the Pentagon to begin making preparations: putting aircraft in place and securing the backing of as many Nato allies as possible. Concern over an impending crisis is growing in Washington after Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of, state failed this week to convince Mr Djukanovic to participate in elections called by Mr Milosevic. The Montenegrin government believes the elections will be rigged and that their significance is undermined by constitutional changes forced through by Serbia. Foreign Office officials in London said yesterday that Nato governments wanted to \"keep Milosevic guessing\" over any action they may take over Montenegro.",

      "bodyText": "The 100,000 drink-drivers convicted every year face compulsory alcohol education and treatment courses under a shake-up of the motoring laws to be announced by ministers later this month. The Home Office unveiled its latest package of proposals to tackle alcohol-related crime yesterday, including the use of fixed penalty fines to deal with public drunkenness and disorder, giving the police the power to confiscate open bottles and cans from those drinking in the street, and new measures to encourage pub landlords to crack down on underage drinking. Under the drink-driving proposals, convicted motorists would be expected to attend an hour and a half class each week for between six to eight weeks in a course which would be designed to get them to face up to their problem drinking and prevent them reoffending. At present a small number of convicted drink-drivers pay to take such courses in return for a three-month deduction from their automatic 12-month driving ban. Alcohol Concern said yesterday it had been pressing for such action for some time. \"In the last three or four years the national strategy has concentrated on illicit drugs which have had most of the resources,\" its assistant director, Sue Boon, said. \"People are comfortable about seeing illegal drugs as the root of all evil; 90% of people use alcohol but are less comfortable about the fact that it causes even more problems. We want to see alcohol being given the same priority as the question of illicit drugs.\" The Automobile Association gave a cautious welcome to the move, saying it had been shown that voluntary alcohol education classes worked. However, a spokesman warned that if the classes were compulsory those attending might not have the same motivation.

The Home Office action plan also includes proposals to make the use of toughened drinking glasses, which lessen injuries from pub fights, a condition on issue of an alcohol licence. The national expansion of \"pubwatch\" schemes, under which landlords share information about troublemakers, will also be given the go-ahead. Mr Clarke was also keen to see further moves towards a voluntary identity card scheme for older teenagers so they could prove they were over 18.

Were they victims of Robert Mugabe's threat to grab even more white-owned land? Or had they been set up by a former worker bitter at his dismissal?</p> <p>It hardly mattered to the \"war veterans\" who moved on to Mayfied Farm in Mazowe, less than an hour's drive from Harare, on Wednesday. Within a day they had forced the white owners off and claimed the land as their own. But Duncan Parks did not leave before he and 17 other white farmers who went to his family's aid had been held hostage and threatened with death.</p> <p>The seizure of Mayfield Farm was the first such occupation since the government announced it would expropriate four times as much white land as originally planned, to give to poor blacks.</p> <p>Even as the Parks quit their home, Mr Mugabe dispelled any doubts that he might have been persuaded by a visit from President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa or pressure from Zimbabwe's foreign donors that his economy is facing ruin if the government hands over most of the productive land to subsistence farmers.</p> <p>He confirmed that the government plans to take 3,041 farms - about two-thirds of all white-owned land - and will expropriate more if it wants.</p> <p>\"The donors can stay with their money if their condition is that that money can only come if we give up the demand on land we are pursuing,\" he told a meeting of black farmers.</p> <p>The road to Mayfield Farm was blocked by a felled tree. The veterans hung a sign at the gate: \"Peter Hain, Robin Cook. Stop lying about Zimbabwe.\" In the yard lay thousands of corn cobs ready for packing, but no one was working.</p> <p>The invasion was led by Chinotimba Brown, a member of the war veterans' national committee, who arrived in a Land Rover with government number plates.</p> <p>\"It's time for the colonialists to push out,\" he said. \"The 804 [farms the government originally listed for expropriation] were not suitable and we are going to acquire more. If the 3,000 we are now taking are not sufficient we will go on acquiring more.

      "bodyText": "Just hours after they were driven weeping from their farm yesterday, the Parks family were trying to work out how it had gone so wrong so quickly. Were they victims of Robert Mugabe's threat to grab even more white-owned land? Or had they been set up by a former worker bitter at his dismissal? It hardly mattered to the \"war veterans\" who moved on to Mayfied Farm in Mazowe, less than an hour's drive from Harare, on Wednesday. Within a day they had forced the white owners off and claimed the land as their own. But Duncan Parks did not leave before he and 17 other white farmers who went to his family's aid had been held hostage and threatened with death. The seizure of Mayfield Farm was the first such occupation since the government announced it would expropriate four times as much white land as originally planned, to give to poor blacks. Even as the Parks quit their home, Mr Mugabe dispelled any doubts that he might have been persuaded by a visit from President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa or pressure from Zimbabwe's foreign donors that his economy is facing ruin if the government hands over most of the productive land to subsistence farmers. He confirmed that the government plans to take 3,041 farms - about two-thirds of all white-owned land - and will expropriate more if it wants. \"The donors can stay with their money if their condition is that that money can only come if we give up the demand on land we are pursuing,\" he told a meeting of black farmers. The road to Mayfield Farm was blocked by a felled tree. The veterans hung a sign at the gate: \"Peter Hain, Robin Cook. Stop lying about Zimbabwe.\" In the yard lay thousands of corn cobs ready for packing, but no one was working. The invasion was led by Chinotimba Brown, a member of the war veterans' national committee, who arrived in a Land Rover with government number plates. \"It's time for the colonialists to push out,\" he said. \"The 804 [farms the government originally listed for expropriation] were not suitable and we are going to acquire more. If the 3,000 we are now taking are not sufficient we will go on acquiring more. All the farms can be acquired if necessary.\" Mr Brown and the \"war veterans\" initially refused to allow Mr Parks to leave. Seventeen white neighbours turned up in the hope there might be safety in numbers. They too were taken hostage. Several hours into the standoff, Mr Brown said all the farmers and the Parks family could leave on foot, without taking anything with them. Duncan Parks did not want to abandon the house he has lived in all his life and the other farmers were not going to leave their vehicles. \"There was verbal abuse and death threats against all of us,\" Mr Parks said. But it was the beating of his workers that convinced the 55-year-old farmer to leave the land his family had owned since 1911. Mr Brown denied workers were beaten or the farmers held and threatened. Two hours after abandoning Mayfield Farm, Isla Parks sat between her husband and her son as the two men wept. \"Be strong, be strong,\" she whispered. Her son, Stewart, said: \"I was trying to negotiate with them on why they were picking on us and what I had done wrong to them.\" He added that a former employee, dismissed for selling drugs, was at the gate as the family left. \"They said we were rough to our labour. We are not rough. When someone steals or sells drugs they have to be dealt with. I didn't turn him in to the police. I should have and I regret that,\" he said. Shortly after Mr Parks and his family fled, the veterans' leader, Chenjerai Hunzvi, arrived, cheered by the new tenants. \"This is Zimbabwean land,\" Mr Hunzvi said. \"We need land and it is going to be resettled.

      "body": "<p>When the Metropolitan police sent a delegation to New York city to see if there were any lessons they could learn from mayor Rudolf Giuliani's zero tolerance policy, they claimed to be unimpressed by the Americans' swamp tactics to tackle the symptoms of crime rather than its root causes. What they did admire, however, was the way crime figures in New York are broken down to precinct level, allowing police in a given neighbourhood to be made directly accountable. Precinct captains responsible for sending out beat patrols can see what impact they have on crime figures. And, perhaps more importantly, so can local residents.</p> <p>British criminologists, especially those in the Home Office research, development and statistics directorate, were also impressed. This was one of the reasons ministers published a paper this week urging an overhaul of the way crime figures are collected and presented. Another reason is illustrated by the chart. The proportion of reported incidents that the system recognises as crime varies between different kinds of offence and overall is only about three quarters. The police - systems of reporting differ - apply their own tests to the public's allegations that something untoward has happened.</p> <p>The key is local data. In the US, standard American crime figures are available county by county. In Philadelphia it is even possible for residents to find out what incidents have happened in selected crime categories on their block. Although some audit commission publications and websites, such as Upmystreet.com, imply that similar figures are available for each local authority or even postcode in England and Wales, that is still some years off.</p> <p>The form in which statistics recording crime are published would be recognisable to a 19th-century civil servant.

      "bodyText": "When the Metropolitan police sent a delegation to New York city to see if there were any lessons they could learn from mayor Rudolf Giuliani's zero tolerance policy, they claimed to be unimpressed by the Americans' swamp tactics to tackle the symptoms of crime rather than its root causes. What they did admire, however, was the way crime figures in New York are broken down to precinct level, allowing police in a given neighbourhood to be made directly accountable. Precinct captains responsible for sending out beat patrols can see what impact they have on crime figures. And, perhaps more importantly, so can local residents. British criminologists, especially those in the Home Office research, development and statistics directorate, were also impressed. This was one of the reasons ministers published a paper this week urging an overhaul of the way crime figures are collected and presented. Another reason is illustrated by the chart. The proportion of reported incidents that the system recognises as crime varies between different kinds of offence and overall is only about three quarters. The police - systems of reporting differ - apply their own tests to the public's allegations that something untoward has happened. The key is local data. In the US, standard American crime figures are available county by county. In Philadelphia it is even possible for residents to find out what incidents have happened in selected crime categories on their block. Although some audit commission publications and websites, such as Upmystreet.com, imply that similar figures are available for each local authority or even postcode in England and Wales, that is still some years off. The form in which statistics recording crime are published would be recognisable to a 19th-century civil servant. Traditionally, statistics have been broken down for each of the 43 police forces so that an incumbent home secretary has a good idea about what sort of job each chief constable is doing. But increasingly ministers see value in making much more local information available - both in terms of combating crime and reducing fear of crime.

The body of a baby, thought to be about three weeks old, was hidden in an outbuilding at a house in Rossington, near Doncaster. Police said the woman had been heavily pregnant as on two previous occasions \"but with no new addition to the family\". \u00a328,000 for Peter Rabbit A privately printed first edition copy of Beatrix Potter's classic The Tale of Peter Rabbit, found in a box full of old books during a house clearance, fetched \u00a328,750 at auction yesterday. The book - one of 250 which Potter paid to have printed in December 1901 - was among the effects of a retired naval commander who died at his country home near Winchester. Stolen mower man accused A man has been charged with drink driving after he was stopped while driving a stolen sit-on lawn mower in Bristol. The unnamed 37-year-old has also been charged with damaging a police car and having no insurance. 10 held in arms base blockade Ten anti-nuclear protesters were arrested yesterday after a blockade at an entrance to the Coulport armaments depot on Loch Long. The protest was organ ised by the Trident Ploughshares group as part of two weeks of action against the Faslane submarine base on the Clyde. Smoking 'hits fewer children' The number of children exposed to passive smoking in England has halved in 10 years, due to fewer parents smoking and bans on smoking in public places, according to a report published today in the British Medical Journal. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund'found that children's exposure dramatically decreased between 1988 and 1998.

      "bodyText": "Conservative party officials tried to broker a deal to persuade a disgraced MP to stand down at the 1997 general election under pressure from a former corporate donor, a court heard yesterday. Rod Richards, who had been forced to quit as junior Welsh Office minister following allegations of an extra-marital affair which profoundly embarrassed John Major in 1996, was allegedly invited not to stand in his constituency in return for Whitbread writing off an \u00a389,900 debt. Mr Richards owed around \u00a3200,000 to Whitbread and other creditors including Barclays and Lloyds after he borrowed money to refurbish the Ynyscedwyn Arms pub, in Ystradgynlais, near Swansea Valley. It would have been to the Tories' advantage, with Labour campaigning vigorously on sleaze, to have Mr Richards stand down in one of their safest Welsh seats, Clwyd North West. The alleged deal was revealed in a witness statement from Sir Anthony Garrett, Tory campaigns manager in 1997, to a high court hearing yesterday where Mr Richards's main creditor, Whitbread, was seeking to have him declared bankrupt. Mr Richards, who lost his Commons seat in the 1997 Tory wipeout but is now a Welsh assembly member, was fighting to save his political career as bankrupts cannot hold public office. His counsel, Roxanne Ismail, told the court the suggestion that he stand down came from then party chairman Brian Mawhinney. \"There was a meeting in February 1997, Mr Richards was then an MP, to discuss the indebtedness of Mr Richards to Whitbread. The Conservative party was concerned about adverse publicity. \"Sir Anthony Garrett said that Brian Mawhinney said it had been indicated to him that Whitbread was prepared to write off the debt if Mr Richards agreed not to contest his seat at the next general election.\" She added: \"This suggests the biggest single creditor had another motive in pressing for bankruptcy.\" The bankruptcy petition was brought after Mr Richards defaulted on a voluntary agreement to repay a percentage of his debts over five years. He failed to make a \u00a37,500 payment last December as he had to fund his defence against a charge of assaulting a young woman, Cassandra Melvin. Mr Richards, 53, was cleared of that charge in June. The bankruptcy registrar William James yesterday dismissed the petition, saying Mr Richards, although late, had paid the overdue instalment. Making him bankrupt \"will certainly destroy his political career and, more importantly, will seriously impair his ability to earn a living\".

      "body": "<p>Sun, sea and sex have made Ibiza one of the summer's most popular destinations but it is the cavernous nightclubs which have defined the island as the dance capital of Europe. </p> <p>Themed nights like <strong> Manumission</strong> at the hanger-size <strong> Privilege Club</strong> have come to epitomise Ibizan clubbing. Up to 8,000 people are attracted to sweltering evenings with top-earning DJs, a pool, fire eaters, a fake rainforest and, until recently, a live sex show. </p> <p>If it is a Sunday, hardened clubbers head to <strong> Space</strong> , which opens at 8am and closes at six the following morning. </p> <p>A night out is not cheap. Getting into the <strong> Ministry of Sound</strong> night at the <strong> Pacha</strong> costs \u00a336; one spirit and mixer will set you back \u00a38; a 250ml bottle of water costs \u00a34. To sit down at a VIP table in a roped-off area overlooking the dance floor costs \u00a3500. </p> <p>The club has a 4,000-person capacity but over the course of the evening 5,000 will come through the door. Around 75% will pay an entrance free; the rest will be VIPs or business associates. A unspecified chunk of the takings goes to a promoter such as Ministry. </p> <p>But Ministry will make a small loss on its activities out in Ibiza this summer, according to the local club owners. The promoter declined to be interviewed but it is understood that the pay-off comes in future sales of Ministry-branded Ibiza compilation CDs. </p> <p>It sells around 1m Ibiza albums a year, making around \u00a35 a disc, so turning a 12-week stay in Ibiza into \u00a35m in profit. </p> <p>\"Nightclubs are increasingly becoming living billboards for their brands,\" says Danny Whittel, operations manager for Pacha and a Falklands war veteran from Stoke-on-Trent. \"We are looking to move into new business areas and have dozens of dot.coms and drinks brands asking to sponsor our events.\" </p> <p>Pacha, like all the major club venues in Ibiza, is Spanish-owned. The group was established in Barcelona by the <strong> Urgell</strong> family and there are now 32 Pachas in the world, many franchised outlets. </p> <p>Mr Whittel is trying to draw the venues closer together to increase their bargaining power with DJs by offering them block bookings at several events and to get the Pacha brand into new areas. </p> <p>A record label, Pacha Recordings, was launched at the beginning of the summer and sold 30,000 CDs in three weeks. It has three merchandising shops in Ibiza and a beach bar. <strong> Worldpop</strong> , the cross-media company, is a corporate sponsor. </p> <p>In October an 800-capacity Pacha club opens in the <strong> West End of London</strong> , and Mr Whittel plans a Pacha travel agency offering city breaks and entry to local clubs. Talks are under way with the cable television company <strong> Telewest</strong> about a weekly TV programme based on \"clubbing lifestyle\", and fashion designer <strong> Jean-Paul Gaultier</strong> has expressed interest in designing a range of Pacha-branded clothing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sun, sea and sex have made Ibiza one of the summer's most popular destinations but it is the cavernous nightclubs which have defined the island as the dance capital of Europe. Themed nights like Manumission at the hanger-size Privilege Club have come to epitomise Ibizan clubbing. Up to 8,000 people are attracted to sweltering evenings with top-earning DJs, a pool, fire eaters, a fake rainforest and, until recently, a live sex show. If it is a Sunday, hardened clubbers head to Space , which opens at 8am and closes at six the following morning. A night out is not cheap. Getting into the Ministry of Sound night at the Pacha costs \u00a336; one spirit and mixer will set you back \u00a38; a 250ml bottle of water costs \u00a34. To sit down at a VIP table in a roped-off area overlooking the dance floor costs \u00a3500. The club has a 4,000-person capacity but over the course of the evening 5,000 will come through the door. Around 75% will pay an entrance free; the rest will be VIPs or business associates. A unspecified chunk of the takings goes to a promoter such as Ministry. But Ministry will make a small loss on its activities out in Ibiza this summer, according to the local club owners. The promoter declined to be interviewed but it is understood that the pay-off comes in future sales of Ministry-branded Ibiza compilation CDs. It sells around 1m Ibiza albums a year, making around \u00a35 a disc, so turning a 12-week stay in Ibiza into \u00a35m in profit. \"Nightclubs are increasingly becoming living billboards for their brands,\" says Danny Whittel, operations manager for Pacha and a Falklands war veteran from Stoke-on-Trent. \"We are looking to move into new business areas and have dozens of dot.coms and drinks brands asking to sponsor our events.\" Pacha, like all the major club venues in Ibiza, is Spanish-owned. The group was established in Barcelona by the Urgell family and there are now 32 Pachas in the world, many franchised outlets. Mr Whittel is trying to draw the venues closer together to increase their bargaining power with DJs by offering them block bookings at several events and to get the Pacha brand into new areas. A record label, Pacha Recordings, was launched at the beginning of the summer and sold 30,000 CDs in three weeks. It has three merchandising shops in Ibiza and a beach bar. Worldpop , the cross-media company, is a corporate sponsor. In October an 800-capacity Pacha club opens in the West End of London , and Mr Whittel plans a Pacha travel agency offering city breaks and entry to local clubs. Talks are under way with the cable television company Telewest about a weekly TV programme based on \"clubbing lifestyle\", and fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier has expressed interest in designing a range of Pacha-branded clothing.",

Six teenage girls in tiny skirts and lots of make-up totter behind them giggling. On the beach a more mellow bunch has gathered in front of the Cafe del Mar to join in the nightly Ibizan ritual of watching the sun set. </p> <p>The mood is relaxed, the music chilled, the people fashion conscious. As soon as the sun disappears the atmosphere of calm is punctured by a succession of electronic beeping tones. The sounds signal the arrival en masse of a series of text messages on mobile phones. </p> <p>They might contain news of which DJs are playing where on the island, a message from an advertiser, like Durex, reminding revellers to take their condoms with them, an offer of cheap flights from budget airline Go or, most importantly, the chance to gain free entry to one of the island's superclubs. </p> <p>This is marketing Ibiza 2000 style, aimed direct at the hundreds of thousands of British clubbers who visit the island each summer to \"large it\". </p> <p>Up to a million British tourists will travel to the island (which has a permanent population of 80,000) this summer.

Ibiza is not just a single weekend, it is a 12-week event, and millions of people migrate towards it. The young people who travel here are very valuable to advertisers, and text messaging is a very efficient way of targeting them.\" </p> <p>British club operators such as Cream in Liverpool and London's Ministry of Sound take up \"residence\" in Ibiza each summer, running lavish club nights hosted by top DJs and attracting up to 10,000 revellers a time. </p> <p>This weekend is Radio One's Ibiza 2000 weekend, when its DJs will broadcast live from the island. Chrysalis Group is spending \u00a3250,000 promoting its Galaxy Radio brand on the island. Rival dance radio station Kiss also has a presence, while media group Emap has set up its own radio station for the summer. Before Worldpop set up camp on the island this summer the phrase \"e-commerce\" was more usually associated with the island's burgeoning trade in the drug ecstasy. </p> <p>The Ibiza Mobile Textmessaging Service is gathering pace as the Spanish authorities crack down on paper flyers traditionally used to advertise club nights. Residents are angry at the litter they cause. </p> <p>Around 3,000 holidaymakers have signed up to the Mobile Ibiza service by registering at one of Worldpop's three internet cafes on the island. They receive two to four text messages a day, ostensibly from top DJ Pete Tong. </p> <p>The most popular offers are free club entries. The entrance fee of \u00a320-\u00a340 prices the lager louts out of the market. But, by phoning a number at the bottom of the message, which costs around 25p per minute, the first few dozen clubbers to respond stand a good chance of getting in free that night.They only need to show the message to the club's doorman as proof. Around 50% of those who receive messages call the number, according to Simeon Berends, who creates the content for Worldpop and its technology partner, Mobile Channel Network. </p> <p>\"We were a little apprehensive when we first started the service because we weren't certain if it would catch on, but in the last few weeks it has gone ballistic,\" he said. \"There are more than 3,000 clubbers on our database now, and the messages are much more effective than flyers. You choose to take messages. And if it saves you \u00a335 getting into a club it's a service worth having.\" </p> <p>Advertisers can send messages at three different stages: before the individual goes on holiday; while they are on the island; or when they return. The charge is between 20p and 30p per message per person. So, for around \u00a3650 plus VAT a company can put a message of up to 160 characters straight into the pockets of 2,500 people. </p> <p>City institutions 3i, Amadeus Capital Partners and Chase Capital partners liked the Worldpop strategy - devised with Merrill Lynch and Spectrum Consulting - so they have become investors. </p> <p>As the next generation of mobile phones is introduced and personalisation technology improves, Worldpop will be able to send better targeted messages, reflecting users' music tastes and their whereabouts on the island, according to Mr Berends. If one club is sold out and another half-empty, a message could offer half-price entry to anyone who turns up to the quieter club within the hour. </p> <p>British software company Autonomy is even working on \"dating technology\", which will allow a user to programme his or her mobile phone with personal details (age, height, star sign, musical preferences) and their ideal partner. Autonomy software will send them a message, if someone matching that description is drinking elsewhere in the bar. </p> <p>Worldpop's existing service, although a little rudimentary, is so popular that it will be used for the UK tours of pop band Steps and former Spice Girl Mel C this autumn. </p> <p>Advertisers on the Mobile Ibiza service use electronic text messages with other more traditional marketing techniques. Condom brand Durex is capitalising on Ibiza's image as an island of sin, by having its \"Freedom with Durex\" blue double-decker bus driving around the island for three months. \"We're encouraging people to look after themselves and their partner, and take home nothing more serious than great holiday memories,\" said Durex's John Flaherty. Kodak also has billboard presence on the island and in UK airports, while MTV recently put on an open-air concert for an estimated 10,000 people on the island. </p> <p>Record store HMV and nightclub group Ministry of Sound both publish free weekly Ibiza magazines focused on the music, lifestyle and drug culture. HMV says it has around 30 different Ibiza 2000 compilation CDs on sale. </p> <p>Consumer products group Unilever believes Ibiza is such an important bellwether of youth culture and emerging consumer trends that its \"youth board\" is being dispatched to the island in September on a fact-finding trip. The team, made up of 15 of the group's \"coolest\" rising stars in their late 20s and early 30s, are sent to immerse themselves in youth culture and discover the latest on \"style leaders\". They will report back to headquarters and ensure that the companies' brands are targeted accordingly. </p> <p>Unilever executives say it is an important exercise. Patrick Cairns, brand director for Lynx deodorants, part of Unilever subsidiary Elida Faberg\u00e9, said: \"It's absolutely vital and gives us a real competitive edge. Culturally it has done a lot for the company, giving it a slightly funkier edge than you might otherwise expect from a large company like Unilever.\" </p> <p>The youth board's arrival in Ibiza coincides with Phoenix, a big Unilever funded outdoor festival to promote the new Lynx scent Phoenix. A multi-million pound pan-European promotion has been running for almost one year on the side of Lynx spray cans, and 2,500 competition winners from eight countries will be flown out to attend the event. </p> <p>\"It is a very powerful way of promoting the Lynx brand,\" Mr Cairns explained. \"It shows we understand our customers, highlights the kudos of the brand and enables us to further our understanding of youth culture.\" </p> <p>The influx of British business and revellers has not been without its problems.

Ibiza is not the laid-back idyll that it was 13 years ago, when the first wide-eyed British DJs arrived on the island.

      "body": "<p>DJs may only just be emerging from behind their decks to push for the sort of public profile usually associated with pop stars, but in earnings terms they are already catching up. </p> <p>Once merely players of the stars' records, they are fast becoming \"brands\" in their own right. Radio 1's <strong> Pete Tong</strong> , <strong> Dave Pearce</strong> and <strong> Judge Jules</strong> , along with freelance <strong> Paul Oakenfold</strong> , are among the highest earning and most powerful DJs. Mr Tong can charge an Ibizan nightclub up to \u00a310,000 for a four-hour set. Clubbers will travel huge distances to hear him play, filling up venues and boosting bar takings. </p> <p>Record labels view the DJs as a central part of their marketing strategy, and in an attempt to imitate \"white label\" releases from the US, they give the DJs new dance tracks up to three months before they are made widely available. By playing the \"unknown\" record they build up a demand among clubbers. </p> <p>Last summer in Ibiza an unknown track titled Sing It Back, by <strong> Moloko</strong> , was given to a handful of DJs to play. It became a club anthem, a Tong favourite, and earlier this year demand from clubbers was such that it topped the singles chart in the UK. </p> <p>DJs make their real killing when they sell their own compilation CDs. Mr Tong's Essential Collection series of compilation CDs has been selling hundreds of thousands of units a year at \u00a315 each - and the Ibiza version is one of the most popular.

      "bodyText": "DJs may only just be emerging from behind their decks to push for the sort of public profile usually associated with pop stars, but in earnings terms they are already catching up. Once merely players of the stars' records, they are fast becoming \"brands\" in their own right. Radio 1's Pete Tong , Dave Pearce and Judge Jules , along with freelance Paul Oakenfold , are among the highest earning and most powerful DJs. Mr Tong can charge an Ibizan nightclub up to \u00a310,000 for a four-hour set. Clubbers will travel huge distances to hear him play, filling up venues and boosting bar takings. Record labels view the DJs as a central part of their marketing strategy, and in an attempt to imitate \"white label\" releases from the US, they give the DJs new dance tracks up to three months before they are made widely available. By playing the \"unknown\" record they build up a demand among clubbers. Last summer in Ibiza an unknown track titled Sing It Back, by Moloko , was given to a handful of DJs to play. It became a club anthem, a Tong favourite, and earlier this year demand from clubbers was such that it topped the singles chart in the UK. DJs make their real killing when they sell their own compilation CDs. Mr Tong's Essential Collection series of compilation CDs has been selling hundreds of thousands of units a year at \u00a315 each - and the Ibiza version is one of the most popular. A large chunk of each unit sale goes straight back to Mr Tong. Muzik Magazine has estimated that he earns around \u00a3500,000 a year when his roles as a talent scout - he signed All Saints to London Records - A&amp;R director and Friday night slot Radio 1 DJ are taken into consideration. It is the last, part-time role that is the key to his power, and it has been the subject of some controversy.

She can't, because she's a member of cheesy/ saccharine pop combo Steps and, as such, has responsibilities. Her pre-pubescent fans would be horrified to learn of her vomit'n'lingerie shame so Faye's reverie must remain unfulfilled. She'll just have to settle for indulging in animal sacrifices privately with the rest of the band. It's far too easy to imagine them all standing round a marble altar in their long, red PVC coats and demon horns, dead goats and chickens strewn around, blood coagulating in pools as they whirl like dervishes and wail like banshees: \"Better the devil you know. Better the devil you know ...\" Or not. </p> <p>Faye's revelation came during <strong> Lamarr's Attacks</strong> (BBC2), the subject of this week's assault being celebrity. Bemoaning his knowledge of banal celebrity titbits (Shane from Boyzone's fear of horses, Charlie Dimmock's mum's favourite drink), Mark Lamarr laid into the whole notion of celebrity and how once we had Jimi Hendrix and now we have Nicky Clarke. Do we, he cried, really need to know the colour of Gloria Hunniford's bathroom? (Well, no, we don't. But since we know that she recommends those adjustable beds and that her daughter drinks that funny milk, we may as well have a fully comprehensive picture of Hunniford's home life). </p> <p>Lamarr, proving there is life after quiff and introducing some of his stand-up edge into the programme, rightly identified the most interesting questions about celebrity - why do we value fame, and why do we want to be famous? - but failed to follow through and provide adequate answers. As a comedy show (on the whole, a most amusing one) and not some epic documentary about society's spiral into a celebritocracy, all Lamarr could really do with his guests - Steps' Faye and Martin Kemp from EastEnders - was ask inane questions like \"What's the most inane question you've been asked?\" </p> <p>So, in the end, what we got were merely more celebrity titbits - like Faye's vomit ambitions - and sentences that started with \"To be honest_\" which, as everyone who's ever been lied to knows, was Pinocchio's favourite line. And Lamarr slagging off fame and the rise of the micro-celebrity may strike some as biting the hand - and taking a large chunk out of the arm - that feeds you and, well, it was. But he did it with gusto. \"What do we know about celebrity?\" he asked at the end of the show. \"Nothing.\" Which is a bit of a shame. </p> <p>What we do know about fame is that it costs (and you start paying in sweat) and we only know that because Irene Cara told us in the eponymous Alan Parker film. Many a true word was said in legwarmers, as the band Payola discovered in <strong> Ferry Tales</strong> (BBC2). A run-of-the-mill, pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap documentary, it followed the rock band from Northern Ireland to their first gig in London. \"I want to be in one of the most fabulously famous rock bands in the world,\" proclaimed lead singer Phil, forgetting the first rule of becoming famous: possessing an overwhelming desire to not want to be famous (well, so Faye and Martin said anyway). </p> <p>Undaunted by this temptation of fate, Phil and the guys had their sleeveless T-shirts, black nail varnish and tight leather trousers packed and were destined for the Big Smoke. They had high hopes (after all, no one flung them overboard the ferry when they struck up an impromptu gig in the lounge area) and the \"Man From EMI\" was coming to see them. Judging by the size of the audience, he came alone and didn't much like what he heard. The boys went back to Ireland and their day jobs. </p> <p>They should look on the bright side, however. At least they can puke in taxis and no one will care. Apart from maybe the taxi driver. Unless that taxi driver is a private detective employed by your loved one, suspicious that you're playing away from home. <strong> Caught On Tape: Cheating Spouses</strong> (C5) did exactly what it said on the tin, more's the pity. A slapdash collection of rubbishy video footage from America, its shocking discoveries included cheating partners at it in cars! In hotel rooms! Even in their marital beds! Exclamation marks hung in the air like a cloud of wasps. \"If I saw this on TV and if it wasn't me,\" one of the cheated wives wept, \"I'd be laughing.\" </p> <p>Bet you wouldn't.</p>",

A run-of-the-mill, pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap documentary, it followed the rock band from Northern Ireland to their first gig in London. \"I want to be in one of the most fabulously famous rock bands in the world,\" proclaimed lead singer Phil, forgetting the first rule of becoming famous: possessing an overwhelming desire to not want to be famous (well, so Faye and Martin said anyway). Undaunted by this temptation of fate, Phil and the guys had their sleeveless T-shirts, black nail varnish and tight leather trousers packed and were destined for the Big Smoke. They had high hopes (after all, no one flung them overboard the ferry when they struck up an impromptu gig in the lounge area) and the \"Man From EMI\" was coming to see them. Judging by the size of the audience, he came alone and didn't much like what he heard. The boys went back to Ireland and their day jobs. They should look on the bright side, however. At least they can puke in taxis and no one will care. Apart from maybe the taxi driver. Unless that taxi driver is a private detective employed by your loved one, suspicious that you're playing away from home. Caught On Tape: Cheating Spouses (C5) did exactly what it said on the tin, more's the pity. A slapdash collection of rubbishy video footage from America, its shocking discoveries included cheating partners at it in cars! In hotel rooms! Even in their marital beds! Exclamation marks hung in the air like a cloud of wasps. \"If I saw this on TV and if it wasn't me,\" one of the cheated wives wept, \"I'd be laughing.\" Bet you wouldn't.",

      "bodyText": "Predictions that the damaging turmoil in Zimbabwe would subside in the wake of June's general election have proved to be optimistic. Although the ruling Zanu-PF party fought off the most concerted challenge to its rule since independence in 1980, the manner of its victory, relying heavily on intimidation and violence, underscored well-founded doubts about its ability to give the country the fresh start it so badly needs. A new cabinet was formed, but is sadly lacking in new policy ideas. This week's devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar, for example, was a measure that the government stubbornly resisted until the crushing weight of Zimbabwe's problems finally gave it no choice. The devaluation will help exporters, but only if there is anything left to export. On present trends, this looks increasingly doubtful. Zimbabwe's deepening economic crisis, the ruling party's inertia and the failure to take on board the electorate's clearly stated desire for change can be traced to a common cause: President Robert Mugabe.

Will the Europeans be able to respond appropriately? The auguries are, at best, mixed. There was universal agreement after Kosovo that the Europeans must develop a more effective military capability, and that this probably meant spending more and certainly spending better. The UK government has given a strong lead, in its budgetary plans, its policy initiatives and its procurement decisions. But the reality is that, at present, virtually every other European government is proposing to spend less and that efforts to spend better remain unfulfilled. Institutional contortions unaccompanied by capability enhancements will infuriate the Americans and give us the worst of all worlds.</p> <p>Later this autumn we should be able to judge better whether promises will lead to deeds. But today's soldiers agree that in a 10- to 15-year time frame no single European nation has a chance of maintaining a capability for sustained military activity beyond its borders that is balanced, credible and technologically compatible with that of the US.</p> <p>The inefficiencies of trying to do so will become more absurd. A unit of defence expenditure already buys less in Europe than in the US. The absolute cost of maintaining viable armed forces will continue to soar. Electorates will become more reluctant to privilege apparently futile defence investment over more immediate domestic and civil international demands. A downward spiral will result. If European governments cannot manage a collective effort in the defence and security field, each of them will eventually find themselves facing an unpredictable international environment with inadequate military resources. Action, joint or otherwise, in such circumstances will seem pointless.</p> <p>The prerequisite for the sort of European defence identity which might make possible publicly supported and cost-effective defence expenditure is the acceptance by the main European governments of a single, binding security and defence policy. Only such a policy would permit mutual commitment, a substantial measure of interstate role prioritisation and the maintenance of a credible European defence capability.</p> <p>It may seem a fanciful idea today. Perhaps it will remain so. There is no law that compels governments and electorates to recognise where their best interests lie. Moreover a common policy, if agreed, would certainly not reflect purely British preoccupations. But if the attempt to create such an approach is not intensified, or if it fails, the inability of contemporary politicians to get ahead of their focus groups will be confirmed.</p> <p>The main west European governments share vital international interests that will be pursued in common, starting soon, or not at all. The global village is emerging and it is enormously important for Europe that the village operates in accordance with values and rules acceptable to us as well as to the Americans. However the thought is gilded, this implies an enforcing capability, preferably one that takes some account of the UN dimension.</p> <p>The only direct threat to the European homelands in the medium term is that from asymmetrical war, primarily the use of hi-tech devices or weapons of mass destruction against civilian populations by non-state groups or rogue states. Unless the main European players agree in advance as to how they will deal with such outrages together it is unlikely that the outrage itself will elicit a joint and forceful response.</p> <p>Russia will lack for many years the economic potential to support a sustained military challenge to western Europe. But, although humiliated, it remains a great nation and a major nuclear power. It is critically important that Russia, which cannot avoid being an element in the transatlantic balance, is engaged in the development of Europe's response to the new global security environment. This too requires a common approach from western Europe.</p> <p>Whatever the role of the European Union, Europe's leaders all know that the development of a single security and defence policy can only be built upon a consensus developed initially between France, Germany and the UK. It will be essential, of course, that the other European nations should be associated with such an effort in the right way and at the right time. The artificial distinction between collective defence and campaigns outside Nato countries will need to be reconsidered.</p> <p>The maintenance of the closest possible transatlantic partnership must be a defining condition of any European defence identity. Nato should continue to provide the institutional framework for that partnership even if the alliance itself is progressively enlarged and transformed - as is inevitable. European defence cooperation will remain formally intergovernmental in character for a long time to come, not least because of the nuclear dimension. But in practice it would rapidly become unthinkable for the main European governments to move militarily without the others' active support.</p> <p>No sudden crisis will result from the mere continuation of current policies. Present and planned weapons systems can run on, and run down, for a while yet. But unless these issues are resolved, Europe will be abandoning its security to fate. Having successfully surmounted the defence challenges of the last half-century, it would be a pity if Europe were to default on those of the next.</p> <p>\u0095 Sir Michael Alexander was British ambassador to Nato and is now chairman of the Royal United Services Institute</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The only direct threat to the European homelands in the medium term is that from asymmetrical war, primarily the use of hi-tech devices or weapons of mass destruction against civilian populations by non-state groups or rogue states. Unless the main European players agree in advance as to how they will deal with such outrages together it is unlikely that the outrage itself will elicit a joint and forceful response. Russia will lack for many years the economic potential to support a sustained military challenge to western Europe. But, although humiliated, it remains a great nation and a major nuclear power. It is critically important that Russia, which cannot avoid being an element in the transatlantic balance, is engaged in the development of Europe's response to the new global security environment. This too requires a common approach from western Europe. Whatever the role of the European Union, Europe's leaders all know that the development of a single security and defence policy can only be built upon a consensus developed initially between France, Germany and the UK. It will be essential, of course, that the other European nations should be associated with such an effort in the right way and at the right time. The artificial distinction between collective defence and campaigns outside Nato countries will need to be reconsidered. The maintenance of the closest possible transatlantic partnership must be a defining condition of any European defence identity. Nato should continue to provide the institutional framework for that partnership even if the alliance itself is progressively enlarged and transformed - as is inevitable. European defence cooperation will remain formally intergovernmental in character for a long time to come, not least because of the nuclear dimension. But in practice it would rapidly become unthinkable for the main European governments to move militarily without the others' active support. No sudden crisis will result from the mere continuation of current policies. Present and planned weapons systems can run on, and run down, for a while yet. But unless these issues are resolved, Europe will be abandoning its security to fate. Having successfully surmounted the defence challenges of the last half-century, it would be a pity if Europe were to default on those of the next. \u0095 Sir Michael Alexander was British ambassador to Nato and is now chairman of the Royal United Services Institute comment@theguardian.com",

And unlike their liberal opponents, rightwingers have prepared for what may be the most important battle for the country's heart and soul. Away from the bright lights of political conventioneering, conservatives have established an array of legal think-tanks centred on one institution: the Federalist Society. Founded in 1982, the society has grown exponentially in recent years and now provides a career network for about 25,000 conservative lawyers and thousands of ambitious law students. According to a forthcoming report by a New York civil rights group, the Institute for Democracy Studies (IDS), the Federalist Society will act as a staffing agency for the federal courts and justice department in the event of an election victory by the Republicans under George W Bush \"opening the way for a radical transformation of the American legal system\". The main issues in American society - abortion, guns, religion in schools, corporate accountability and the role of government - are increasingly being fought out in the courts. The IDS says that leading figures in the Federalists have more radical ideas about reshaping the US than the moderate congressmen and administrators on display at the Republicans' Philadelphia convention. Taking the original texts of the constitution as their guide, they would seek to roll back much of the state's involvement in daily life. That would entail trying to overturn supreme court decisions guaranteeing abortion rights. It could also mean a judicial assault on much of the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s: the right argues that the state has no business trying to impose racial or gender equality through restrictive laws and social engineering. The conservative wish-list includes stripping the government of many regulatory powers - emasculating or abolishing the environmental protection agency, for instance. Some Federalist Society members are already well known. Before he became President Clinton's chief inquisitor in the impeachment saga, Kenneth Starr led the Federalist charge against the American Bar Association, the lawyers' professional body regarded by the right as a nest of liberals. Several of the self-styled \"elves\" of the impeachment era were also Federalists. These conservative lawyers helped to ensure that Linda Tripp's tapes of Monica Lewinsky talking about her affair with President Clinton came to the attention of the investigation team looking into the president's conduct. The head of the Senate judiciary committee, Orrin Hatch, is also a Federalist. In 1987 he stripped the bar association of its role in vetting supreme court justices and federal judges, reducing its status to a simple legal interest group, on a level with the Federalists. There are also a number of leading Federalists in the entourage of George W Bush, bent on winning the presidency for the Republicans. One of them, Boyden Gray, is a potential attorney general. \"These are the folks who are essentially waiting in the wings to take over as a new legal establishment,\" said Lee Cokorinos, research director at the IDS and co-author of its report, The Federalist Society and the Challenge to a Democratic Jurisprudence, due out next month. The Federalists' executive director, Eugene Meyer, laughs off allegations that the society is the \"vast rightwing conspiracy\" Hillary Clinton alluded to at the height of impeachment. \"We don't lobby and we don't endorse candidates,\" he said. \"But of course a lot of people in the society are very involved in the public policy world, so a number of them will be active in government and in various institutions.\" Mr Meyer pointed out that, unlike conspirators, the Federalists meet and discuss their views in the open.",

      "bodyText": "A package containing a dangerous strain of tuberculosis bacteria, intended for the government's top security biochemical research base, was mistakenly delivered to a department store. Scientists at the centre for applied microbiology and research at Porton Down in Wiltshire were concerned when glass phials filled with the bacterial strain, did not arrive from a US laboratory. CAMR had been using the bacteria to develop a new vaccine against TB. On January 7, Porton Down researchers received just the outer packaging and asked police to trace the parcel through a private courier company. But the inner container, marked only \"bio-hazard\", had already been delivered to the curtain department of Debenhams in Plymouth. After staff alerted the city council, the phials were collected from the store by a representative from CAMR within 24 hours. CAMR and Devon and Cornwall police said there had been no risk to the public but Gary Streeter, Conservative MP for Devon South West, yesterday said the episode had been \"a lucky escape\" after details of the blunder emerged on Wednesday. A spokesman for CAMR said: \"All transport of biological material is controlled by strict international regulations and safety procedures.\" However, a spokesman for the courier firm, Securicor Omega Express, said: \"Such parcels are accepted into our system on the basis that they do not require special handling as defined by internationally recognised regulations.\"",

      "body": "<p>It was a gift to those sections of the media eager to spread panic about the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into English law.</p> <p>After agreeing this week that two Sikh militants faced the risk of being tortured if they were deported to India, the special immigration appeals commission concluded their 49-page ruling with this observation: \"We would add and emphasise this: law-abiding citizens of the United Kingdom might reasonably feel disquiet about a state of affairs which permits international terrorists proved to be a danger to the national security to remain here.\"</p> <p>The commission members - Mr Justice Humphrey Potts, Judge William Dunn and Sir Michael Weston, a former ambassador to Kuwait - continued: \"We can only say that this state of affairs follows upon article 3 of the European convention, the secretary of state's acceptance of that convention and its consequences, and the evidence we have heard in relation to the risks faced by the appellants in the event of their being returned to India.\"</p> <p>As if to drive home their reluctance to set the Sikhs free, they added: \"In future cases we would earnestly urge the secretary of state to consider whether the type of material he relied upon in these appeals is sufficient to do justice to the case.\"</p> <p>The secretary of state to whom the commission referred is Jack Straw, the cabinet minister responsible for the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the convention and comes into force on October 2. He is also the minister responsible for protecting national security and countering terrorism. The two Sikhs, Mukhtiar Singh and Paramijt Singh, entered Britain hidden in a lorry. MI5 told the commission they had helped to arrange the supply of explosives from Pakistan to the Punjab.</p> <p>Straw wanted them deported. The commission said the pair had a \"well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of political opinion\" and there were substantial grounds for believing they would face a \"real risk of being subjected to torture\" if they were sent back to India.</p> <p>Article 3 of the European convention states: \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" By the way it couched its ruling, it was almost as if the commission blamed the European convention - and Straw - for forcing them to come to the conclusion they did. The Daily Mail certainly got the message. Under the front-page headline \"Terrorists who can't be deported\", it said: \"Two Sikh terrorists must be allowed to stay in Britain despite the threat they pose to national security.\"</p> <p>The next day, the London Evening Standard devoted two pages to \"how Europe's human rights charter will affect British law\". It cited the Sikh case, the end to the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces and how those accused of traffic offences will be able to withhold information by claiming the right against self-incrimination. In fact, these rights have been there ever since Britain ratified the European convention 50 years ago. But the Human Rights Act means that from October 2 people will be able to claim them here rather than having to go through the lengthy and expensive process of appealing to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg (which is nothing to do with the EU's court of justice, by the way).</p> <p>This has not stopped judges appearing to be playing politics.

      "bodyText": "It was a gift to those sections of the media eager to spread panic about the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into English law. After agreeing this week that two Sikh militants faced the risk of being tortured if they were deported to India, the special immigration appeals commission concluded their 49-page ruling with this observation: \"We would add and emphasise this: law-abiding citizens of the United Kingdom might reasonably feel disquiet about a state of affairs which permits international terrorists proved to be a danger to the national security to remain here.\" The commission members - Mr Justice Humphrey Potts, Judge William Dunn and Sir Michael Weston, a former ambassador to Kuwait - continued: \"We can only say that this state of affairs follows upon article 3 of the European convention, the secretary of state's acceptance of that convention and its consequences, and the evidence we have heard in relation to the risks faced by the appellants in the event of their being returned to India.\" As if to drive home their reluctance to set the Sikhs free, they added: \"In future cases we would earnestly urge the secretary of state to consider whether the type of material he relied upon in these appeals is sufficient to do justice to the case.\" The secretary of state to whom the commission referred is Jack Straw, the cabinet minister responsible for the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the convention and comes into force on October 2. He is also the minister responsible for protecting national security and countering terrorism. The two Sikhs, Mukhtiar Singh and Paramijt Singh, entered Britain hidden in a lorry. MI5 told the commission they had helped to arrange the supply of explosives from Pakistan to the Punjab. Straw wanted them deported. The commission said the pair had a \"well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of political opinion\" and there were substantial grounds for believing they would face a \"real risk of being subjected to torture\" if they were sent back to India. Article 3 of the European convention states: \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" By the way it couched its ruling, it was almost as if the commission blamed the European convention - and Straw - for forcing them to come to the conclusion they did. The Daily Mail certainly got the message. Under the front-page headline \"Terrorists who can't be deported\", it said: \"Two Sikh terrorists must be allowed to stay in Britain despite the threat they pose to national security.\" The next day, the London Evening Standard devoted two pages to \"how Europe's human rights charter will affect British law\". It cited the Sikh case, the end to the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces and how those accused of traffic offences will be able to withhold information by claiming the right against self-incrimination. In fact, these rights have been there ever since Britain ratified the European convention 50 years ago. But the Human Rights Act means that from October 2 people will be able to claim them here rather than having to go through the lengthy and expensive process of appealing to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg (which is nothing to do with the EU's court of justice, by the way). This has not stopped judges appearing to be playing politics. Were the members of the special immigration appeals commission really suggesting that if it was not for the European convention, they would have sent the two Sikhs back to face torture? Why then point the finger at the convention and at Straw? The appeal court last month turned the argument on its head when it suggested that rights guaranteed by the European convention are already enshrined in English law. Lord Justice Judge dismissed an attempt by state prosecutors to seize any emails or notes the Guardian and Observer may have relating to the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. \"We surely appreciate,\" he said, \"that the principles found in article 6 [of the European convention, covering the right against self-incrimination] and article 10 [the right to freedom of expression] are bred in the bone of the common law and indeed... the folk understanding of the community as a whole.\" Straw has made it more difficult for himself by endorsing new, extraordinarily broad, definitions of Britain's \"national security\" and of \"terrorism\".

      "bodyText": "The biggest surprise about Gordon Brown's wedding (Chancellor's wedding surprise, August 3) is that he managed to say \"I do\" - we all expected his reply to be \"Only when the economic circumstances are right\". Teresa Pearce, Erith, Kent \u0095A Commons committee recommends that the minimum income guarantee should be raised to \u00a390 (MPs support pension rises, August 3). A pensioner couple in my family has just been awarded 2p a week under the current MIG. Any suggestions as to how they might spend it? Andrew Reece, London \u0095John Humphrys is a voice of reason in a demented media world (Leader, August 3) . He is curmudgeonly only with purveyors of sophistry. More power to his elbow, I say. Michael Fuller, Harpenden, Herts \u0095Do Sandra and Hugh Wilmot (Letter, July 31) know that the ideal body weight related to height for an average male can be expressed as: W/H&lt;+&gt;2 = 22.5, where W = weight in kg and H = height in metres? Thus their son's data, height 1.8m and weight 80kg, work out at 80/3.24 = 24.7. So, unless he is very heavily built, he is 7kg (1st) overweight. The formula is unique to the metric system. AK Mikkelsen, Welwyn Garden City, Herts \u0095Re the scarcity of monkey puzzle trees (Letters August 2), one factor is the root system: the house opposite me was undermined by a fairly small one. Incidentally, Kew Gardens keeps a record of older trees and collects seed pods from them. RK Williams, Redditch, Worcs \u0095According to your reports, Hove has had no weather for several weeks. Is it no longer even dull there? Tim Curran, Brighton",

As a member of the standing committee on the rent bill in the summer of 1974, he fought tenaciously, through late night sittings, to ensure that legislation became law before parliament was dissolved. </p> <p>Those same qualities marked his membership of the Shelter board of trustees for 27 years, including serving as chair from 1987 to 1993. He was committed to all Shelter's work, including the practical services - helping people with all kinds of housing problems- but for him the most important role was changing housing policy to secure long-term solutions. </p> <p>One special preoccupation was the reform of housing finance. He was deeply disappointed by Anthony Crosland's housing finance review in the mid-1970s. For more than 20 years, he argued passionately for changes to the public sector borrowing rules, which discriminate unfairly between investment by local authorities and private borrowers. </p> <p>The common threads which ran through the successful practice of his law firm, political career and his voluntary work were his integrity, consistency of ideas and a quiet, but deeply held commitment to equality and justice. </p> <p> <b> John Grant writes: </b> Bruce Douglas-Mann was one of life's awkward squad, which is perhaps why we maintained our friendship over many parliamentary years and beyond. As Edward Pearce's obituary made clear, Bruce was stubborn, but absolutely straight.

The biggest boycott was in the north-east, where incomes are below the average, suggesting the campaign attracted the support of many kinds of people who need their cars, but are finding them increasingly unaffordable. Road users should indeed suffer the environmental and social costs which their motoring causes, but fuel duty increases are not the right solution.</p> <p>Our research shows that the bulk of the social and environmental costs of road use occur in towns and at peak times. A car on a rural motorway imposes costs on others of only 0.8p per km. By contrast, the social cost of driving in a town centre at peak times is more than 50 times higher, at 43p per km. When we compared social costs against the amount motorists pay in fuel and vehicle taxes, we discovered that people in rural areas pay three times too much for the use they make of the roads. Yet urban drivers going to work or on the school run pay only one-seventh of the social costs.</p> <p>People should pay directly for the roads they use. But fuel duty is a very unfair way of doing that. Tolls in town centres, coupled with big cuts in fuel and vehicle taxes, are the only way to improve the environment and to spread the costs of motoring more fairly.</p> <p>Steve Bettison, Adam Smith Institute <a href=\"mailto:steve@adamsmith.org.uk\">steve@adamsmith.org.uk </a><br><br> \u0095The true cost of petrol has to be measured in terms of environmental, as well as, financial impact. Transport is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the UK: it is also the fastest growing source. By some forecasts, car traffic could treble over the next two decades, while van and lorry numbers could rise even more rapidly.</p> <p>Cleaner, greener and more efficient transport systems provide the real solution to sustainable living. Directing petrol taxes back into improving transport options, just as tobacco tax revenues are now ploughed back into the health service, could provide a key mechanism for achieving mobility and access for the entire population - without it costing the earth.</p> <p>Sir John Harman, Chairman, Environment Agency <br><br>\u0095John Prescott seems to have developed an unfortunate victim complex, centred for some odd reason on Friends of the Earth (Interview, August 1). We have spent the last few days defending high petrol taxes against Poujadist protesters. Despite Mr Prescott's claim that environment organisations have run away from this battle, we have in fact been far more active on the subject than any minister.</p> <p>When Labour was elected, Mr Prescott said he would have failed if at the end of its first term there were not far fewer journeys by car. Now, he admits that there will be more. This failure is not entirely his fault: he has been obstructed time and again by Mr Blair and Mr Brown. We would like to work with him to increase the political clout of his department. Moaning at environment organisations will do no good at all.</p> <p>Tony Juniper, Friends of the Earth<br><br> \u0095George Monbiot's tirade in favour of higher fuel prices (Comment, August 3) is well contradicted by Peter Hetherington's article (Analysis, August 2). Of course, people on low incomes in rural areas suffer from high fuel prices: 75% of rural parishes have no daily bus service and those on low incomes are twice as likely to own a car in rural rather than metropolitan areas. Cars are an essential lifeline in the countryside. Cutting off the blood supply by increasing fuel costs will kill off the countryside.</p> <p>Edmund King, Director, RAC Foundation</p>",

      "bodyText": "The dump the pump protest cannot be dismissed as just a gripe by rural motorists in the Tory shires (Leader, August 2). The biggest boycott was in the north-east, where incomes are below the average, suggesting the campaign attracted the support of many kinds of people who need their cars, but are finding them increasingly unaffordable. Road users should indeed suffer the environmental and social costs which their motoring causes, but fuel duty increases are not the right solution. Our research shows that the bulk of the social and environmental costs of road use occur in towns and at peak times. A car on a rural motorway imposes costs on others of only 0.8p per km. By contrast, the social cost of driving in a town centre at peak times is more than 50 times higher, at 43p per km. When we compared social costs against the amount motorists pay in fuel and vehicle taxes, we discovered that people in rural areas pay three times too much for the use they make of the roads. Yet urban drivers going to work or on the school run pay only one-seventh of the social costs. People should pay directly for the roads they use. But fuel duty is a very unfair way of doing that. Tolls in town centres, coupled with big cuts in fuel and vehicle taxes, are the only way to improve the environment and to spread the costs of motoring more fairly. Steve Bettison, Adam Smith Institute steve@adamsmith.org.uk \u0095The true cost of petrol has to be measured in terms of environmental, as well as, financial impact. Transport is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the UK: it is also the fastest growing source. By some forecasts, car traffic could treble over the next two decades, while van and lorry numbers could rise even more rapidly. Cleaner, greener and more efficient transport systems provide the real solution to sustainable living. Directing petrol taxes back into improving transport options, just as tobacco tax revenues are now ploughed back into the health service, could provide a key mechanism for achieving mobility and access for the entire population - without it costing the earth. Sir John Harman, Chairman, Environment Agency \u0095John Prescott seems to have developed an unfortunate victim complex, centred for some odd reason on Friends of the Earth (Interview, August 1). We have spent the last few days defending high petrol taxes against Poujadist protesters. Despite Mr Prescott's claim that environment organisations have run away from this battle, we have in fact been far more active on the subject than any minister. When Labour was elected, Mr Prescott said he would have failed if at the end of its first term there were not far fewer journeys by car. Now, he admits that there will be more. This failure is not entirely his fault: he has been obstructed time and again by Mr Blair and Mr Brown. We would like to work with him to increase the political clout of his department. Moaning at environment organisations will do no good at all. Tony Juniper, Friends of the Earth \u0095George Monbiot's tirade in favour of higher fuel prices (Comment, August 3) is well contradicted by Peter Hetherington's article (Analysis, August 2). Of course, people on low incomes in rural areas suffer from high fuel prices: 75% of rural parishes have no daily bus service and those on low incomes are twice as likely to own a car in rural rather than metropolitan areas. Cars are an essential lifeline in the countryside. Cutting off the blood supply by increasing fuel costs will kill off the countryside. Edmund King, Director, RAC Foundation",

How about helping each other in the way men do - not because of the old school tie, rarely as part of a male global conspiracy, just because they can.

We think it's fine for Tony to keep running the country, but wonder whether Cherie's right in going back to work so early. We forgive the sins of our fathers long before we forgive those of our mothers. One of the problems is the requirement for the successful woman to become a star everywoman. When Alan Davies appears in a new sitcom he is judged as Alan Davies, not as a representative of all men, all comedy men, or even all comedy men with curly hair. When Rhona Cameron does the same, her work is judged as a woman, then as a lesbian, finally as a comedian. Clare Short is not a politician, she's a woman politician. Anita Roddick is expected to speak for all businesswomen. By requiring every woman to succeed on behalf of all women, we make that achievement impossible. Which of us can possibly please all of us? Men help other men to success, probably without even noticing it. When a woman suggests another woman for work, isn't there always the worry that maybe she'll take the job from you? After all, The News Quiz and Have I Got News for You regularly have all-male panels; it's not a groundless fear to think that one woman touting another woman as clever and funny will do herself out of a job. Men seem to know that getting on well enough works. Why do we expect so much from ourselves and get so hurt when we don't get it? How about using each other's good fortune as a guide, rather than a barb on which to snare ourselves? How about helping each other in the way men do - not because of the old school tie, rarely as part of a male global conspiracy, just because they can. And how about building on our strengths instead of ignoring them entirely - and then complaining when the boys do exactly the same? Shane Watson is away.",

      "body": "<p>We began the last decade with a Bush in the White House, and we may continue in this one with another in the same place, a possibility that illustrates the sadly circular nature of recent history. Perhaps worse than that - for the older Bush, if a limited man of the upperclass right, did have a few virtues, while his son is a man of no apparent quality or achievements. Worse, too, in that what it seemed permissible to hope for under the father seems remote indeed should the son be elected.</p> <p>The father at least spoke of a better ordered world, and some of his policies contributed toward it. The son, by contrast, speaks only of a dangerous planet against which America must be protected, whether by radars and missiles or by hard-faced trade negotiators.</p> <p>Ten years ago it was reasonable to look forward to a degree of nuclear disarmament sufficient to keep proliferation in check, to a resolution of Middle Eastern conflicts, to progress in Africa, to democratic evolution in Russia and, more broadly, to a consensus among the better-off and more powerful states that would make all international problems easier to deal with than they had been.</p> <p>No doubt these hopes underestimated the obdurate nature of these problems and no doubt, too, that the instruments of policy, whether the choice was aid, intervention, sanction or mediation, were overestimated. There is no question that the efforts that were made, by the United States under President Clinton and by other countries, were very flawed.</p> <p>The collapse of the Camp David talks, on the one hand, and the inexorable rise of national missile defence, on the other, frame the grand failure of the last decade. If Saddam had been brought down and a democratic Iraq had emerged - not so much of a forlorn hope as the cynics say - the resulting momentum might have encompassed an early settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. If an early settlement had been achieved in any case, it might have led to changes that would have undermined Saddam.</p> <p>Neither chain developed. In part it was bad luck, in part lack of determination, in part lack of balance. Who knows whether a United States that had been consistently more even-handed, and more sustained in its application to the problem, might not have been able to pull off Camp David, by inducing the Israelis to give more and the Palestinians to take less? If so, even at this late stage, a new regional chemistry might have begun to work.</p> <p>Saddam's survival is not the only reason that the idea of invulnerability to missile attack again took root in American politics. But, together with North Korea's manoeuvres, it reinforced such tendencies. The connection between enemies who can't be bested and who may soon possess weapons of mass destruction, interventions that don't come off, mediations that fail and force-field fantasies at home is evident. It is not so much that missile defence will work, as that the entrenched American belief in the power of technology makes it potent politically, in a way it could never physically be as an actual system.</p> <p>The Republicans contributed to the failures of the two Clinton administrations but they can hardly be blamed for them. What they can be blamed for is seizing on those failures, at home and abroad, and turning them into the foundations of their policies for the future. At home, Clinton failed to reverse the American trend toward greater inequality of income. As with social democrats in other countries, his emphasis on education and opportunity, and even on health, ended up benefiting the middle class more than the truly disadvantaged.</p> <p>The Republicans would row back on what Clinton achieved. Sprinkling Latinos, blacks and single mothers around to dramatise a new rhetoric of inclusion does not alter the fact that the Republican emphasis on decentralising social policy puts power into the hands of local elites who, it has been persistently demonstrated, act largely in their own interests.</p> <p>The Republican party would be the worst party, for instance, to deal with the triangular conflict between Latinos and African-Americans in the older urban centres, starved of income and industry, and the largely white and middle-class population of the suburbs and the new \"edge cities\". Not far from the convention centre where the Republicans are meeting, in the Puerto Rican areas of north Philadelphia, two thirds of the children are growing up in households earning less than $15,500 a year, according to figures in Mike Davis's illuminating new book about Latino politics.</p> <p>Little has been heard about what the Republicans would do about that, even though protest marchers have tried to raise the issue. Because of the wall in their minds between the United States and the rest of the world, even the rest of America, Republicans would be equally ill-equipped to deal with the challenge of a future in which political choices in, for example, Mexico or Venezuela, will affect the mood and the demands of people of Latin American background in US cities. Foreign policy and domestic policy could be mingled in novel ways as such connections develop.</p> <p>But it is in foreign policy that a second Bush era is most to be feared. A Republican administration would not regard Clinton's failures abroad as a reason to try again but, in general, as a reason not to try at all. There may be exceptions to this, especially in the Middle East, and allowance must be made for the steadying influence of power and state department expertise. But America under the Republicans would be much less ready to engage, to take risks and to make sacri fices than it has been under Clinton, and since it has been very imperfectly ready to do so under the Democrats, that is saying something. Those who now recount, some of them with misguided glee, the ways in which American and western policies have gone wrong - how sanctions have killed children or how military intervention has led to more ethnic cleansing or how UN supervised elections have been subverted - might soon pine for the days when American action in international emergencies was at least a possibility.</p> <p>The Republicans may be shifting a little. But they still remain the major party most committed to low state spending, to limited social programmes, to strategies that lead to greater disparity in income and quality of life for Americans, and, abroad, to policies emphasising defence and protection over aid, cooperation and working through the United Nations. In both home and foreign policy the Republican style is the same - a camouflage of inclusionist rhetoric over the reality of vested interest. In America itself, the security of the advantaged classes over the security of the whole society, and, abroad, the security of one nation set far too high over the security of other nations. The Democrats are hardly free of such tendencies but a Republican administration might well entrench them. The awful festival of humbug just concluded in Philadelphia bodes ill for America and the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We began the last decade with a Bush in the White House, and we may continue in this one with another in the same place, a possibility that illustrates the sadly circular nature of recent history. Perhaps worse than that - for the older Bush, if a limited man of the upperclass right, did have a few virtues, while his son is a man of no apparent quality or achievements. Worse, too, in that what it seemed permissible to hope for under the father seems remote indeed should the son be elected. The father at least spoke of a better ordered world, and some of his policies contributed toward it. The son, by contrast, speaks only of a dangerous planet against which America must be protected, whether by radars and missiles or by hard-faced trade negotiators. Ten years ago it was reasonable to look forward to a degree of nuclear disarmament sufficient to keep proliferation in check, to a resolution of Middle Eastern conflicts, to progress in Africa, to democratic evolution in Russia and, more broadly, to a consensus among the better-off and more powerful states that would make all international problems easier to deal with than they had been. No doubt these hopes underestimated the obdurate nature of these problems and no doubt, too, that the instruments of policy, whether the choice was aid, intervention, sanction or mediation, were overestimated. There is no question that the efforts that were made, by the United States under President Clinton and by other countries, were very flawed. The collapse of the Camp David talks, on the one hand, and the inexorable rise of national missile defence, on the other, frame the grand failure of the last decade. If Saddam had been brought down and a democratic Iraq had emerged - not so much of a forlorn hope as the cynics say - the resulting momentum might have encompassed an early settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. If an early settlement had been achieved in any case, it might have led to changes that would have undermined Saddam. Neither chain developed. In part it was bad luck, in part lack of determination, in part lack of balance. Who knows whether a United States that had been consistently more even-handed, and more sustained in its application to the problem, might not have been able to pull off Camp David, by inducing the Israelis to give more and the Palestinians to take less? If so, even at this late stage, a new regional chemistry might have begun to work. Saddam's survival is not the only reason that the idea of invulnerability to missile attack again took root in American politics. But, together with North Korea's manoeuvres, it reinforced such tendencies. The connection between enemies who can't be bested and who may soon possess weapons of mass destruction, interventions that don't come off, mediations that fail and force-field fantasies at home is evident. It is not so much that missile defence will work, as that the entrenched American belief in the power of technology makes it potent politically, in a way it could never physically be as an actual system. The Republicans contributed to the failures of the two Clinton administrations but they can hardly be blamed for them. What they can be blamed for is seizing on those failures, at home and abroad, and turning them into the foundations of their policies for the future. At home, Clinton failed to reverse the American trend toward greater inequality of income. As with social democrats in other countries, his emphasis on education and opportunity, and even on health, ended up benefiting the middle class more than the truly disadvantaged. The Republicans would row back on what Clinton achieved. Sprinkling Latinos, blacks and single mothers around to dramatise a new rhetoric of inclusion does not alter the fact that the Republican emphasis on decentralising social policy puts power into the hands of local elites who, it has been persistently demonstrated, act largely in their own interests. The Republican party would be the worst party, for instance, to deal with the triangular conflict between Latinos and African-Americans in the older urban centres, starved of income and industry, and the largely white and middle-class population of the suburbs and the new \"edge cities\". Not far from the convention centre where the Republicans are meeting, in the Puerto Rican areas of north Philadelphia, two thirds of the children are growing up in households earning less than $15,500 a year, according to figures in Mike Davis's illuminating new book about Latino politics. Little has been heard about what the Republicans would do about that, even though protest marchers have tried to raise the issue. Because of the wall in their minds between the United States and the rest of the world, even the rest of America, Republicans would be equally ill-equipped to deal with the challenge of a future in which political choices in, for example, Mexico or Venezuela, will affect the mood and the demands of people of Latin American background in US cities. Foreign policy and domestic policy could be mingled in novel ways as such connections develop. But it is in foreign policy that a second Bush era is most to be feared. A Republican administration would not regard Clinton's failures abroad as a reason to try again but, in general, as a reason not to try at all. There may be exceptions to this, especially in the Middle East, and allowance must be made for the steadying influence of power and state department expertise. But America under the Republicans would be much less ready to engage, to take risks and to make sacri fices than it has been under Clinton, and since it has been very imperfectly ready to do so under the Democrats, that is saying something. Those who now recount, some of them with misguided glee, the ways in which American and western policies have gone wrong - how sanctions have killed children or how military intervention has led to more ethnic cleansing or how UN supervised elections have been subverted - might soon pine for the days when American action in international emergencies was at least a possibility. The Republicans may be shifting a little. But they still remain the major party most committed to low state spending, to limited social programmes, to strategies that lead to greater disparity in income and quality of life for Americans, and, abroad, to policies emphasising defence and protection over aid, cooperation and working through the United Nations. In both home and foreign policy the Republican style is the same - a camouflage of inclusionist rhetoric over the reality of vested interest. In America itself, the security of the advantaged classes over the security of the whole society, and, abroad, the security of one nation set far too high over the security of other nations. The Democrats are hardly free of such tendencies but a Republican administration might well entrench them. The awful festival of humbug just concluded in Philadelphia bodes ill for America and the world.",

Ceausescu decided to cut them down to make paper.</p> <p>Travelling down a narrow channel overgrown with weeping willows, we came across hundreds of pelicans fishing with cormorants and herons. The pelicans' technique is to form a circle and beat with their wings and feet to frighten the small fish into the centre. Other birds arrive to share the feast.</p> <p>In communist times, too, the pelican was a protected bird, but its food supply was ruined by the drainage schemes. Under Ceaucescu 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres) was drained, half for agriculture, half for fish-farming ponds.</p> <p>Dykes were raised, big areas dredged, and electricity installed to run the pumps which filled the ponds in spring and emptied them in autumn. But fish production refused to prosper.</p> <p>The biosphere reserve began breaking holes in the dykes three years ago. It says it has has already given 5,000 hectares back to the water. This summer, it plans to return another 6,000.</p> <p>\"We were astonished how quickly life reappeared,\" said Marian Tudor of the Danube Delta Institute, which is working with the biosphere reserve to restore the region.</p> <p>\"The explanation we reached was that the seeds lay dormant in the ground for more than a decade.\"</p> <p>Babina island - a former drained area on the Romanian-Ukrainian border and now the pride of the restoration project - lies at heart of what Ceausescu planned as paddy fields.</p> <p>The wind rustles gently in the reeds here. There are water lilies in the pools again and a snow of duck feathers at the water's edge.</p> <p>But the restoration work is not without its problems, and its opponents. Fourteen thousand people live in the delta region. Work on the dictator's projects gave them a steady income in the 1980s, and there were basic industries like fishing.</p> <p>But the projects are dead and the delta is fished out.</p> <p>\"My son is 14 now, soon he will finish school,\"a fisherman said, resting his oars on his way to lay nets for the evening. \"According to the law, I am not allowed to take him with me. But if I don't teach him to fish, he'll starve to death - there's no other work here.\"</p> <p>The fisherman used to work in the shipyards of Sulina, the delta's main port.</p> <p>Now the yards and canneries are closed and the last of Romania's motorised fishing fleet lies rotting in the harbour at Tulcea.</p> <p>\"The most important alternative to fishing is tourism,\" Grigore Baboianu said.</p> <p>The fisherman shook his head and raised his huge, net-caloused hands. \"What am I supposed to do with tourists?\"</p> <p>But in the Delta hotel in Tulcea, earnest groups of French and Austrian birdwatchers could be seen at breakfast.</p>",

Some drained areas - the reed islands of Babina and Cernovca in the north-west of the delta - never succeeded in pushing up a single plant of their designated product, rice. \"According to the ideology of those days,\" said Grigore Baboianu, director of the Danube delta biosphere reserve, \"the delta in its natural state was a waste ground, prey to flooding and mosquitoes, just waiting for development.\" A waste ground containing the largest area of compact reed beds in Europe, the environmentalists here say; the temporary or permanent home of more than 300 species of bird and 35 species of fish. The reeds helped filter out the human and agricultural sewage of the eight - now 11 - countries upstream. Ceausescu decided to cut them down to make paper. Travelling down a narrow channel overgrown with weeping willows, we came across hundreds of pelicans fishing with cormorants and herons. The pelicans' technique is to form a circle and beat with their wings and feet to frighten the small fish into the centre. Other birds arrive to share the feast. In communist times, too, the pelican was a protected bird, but its food supply was ruined by the drainage schemes. Under Ceaucescu 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres) was drained, half for agriculture, half for fish-farming ponds. Dykes were raised, big areas dredged, and electricity installed to run the pumps which filled the ponds in spring and emptied them in autumn. But fish production refused to prosper. The biosphere reserve began breaking holes in the dykes three years ago. It says it has has already given 5,000 hectares back to the water. This summer, it plans to return another 6,000. \"We were astonished how quickly life reappeared,\" said Marian Tudor of the Danube Delta Institute, which is working with the biosphere reserve to restore the region. \"The explanation we reached was that the seeds lay dormant in the ground for more than a decade.\" Babina island - a former drained area on the Romanian-Ukrainian border and now the pride of the restoration project - lies at heart of what Ceausescu planned as paddy fields. The wind rustles gently in the reeds here. There are water lilies in the pools again and a snow of duck feathers at the water's edge. But the restoration work is not without its problems, and its opponents. Fourteen thousand people live in the delta region. Work on the dictator's projects gave them a steady income in the 1980s, and there were basic industries like fishing. But the projects are dead and the delta is fished out. \"My son is 14 now, soon he will finish school,\"a fisherman said, resting his oars on his way to lay nets for the evening. \"According to the law, I am not allowed to take him with me. But if I don't teach him to fish, he'll starve to death - there's no other work here.\" The fisherman used to work in the shipyards of Sulina, the delta's main port. Now the yards and canneries are closed and the last of Romania's motorised fishing fleet lies rotting in the harbour at Tulcea. \"The most important alternative to fishing is tourism,\" Grigore Baboianu said. The fisherman shook his head and raised his huge, net-caloused hands. \"What am I supposed to do with tourists?\" But in the Delta hotel in Tulcea, earnest groups of French and Austrian birdwatchers could be seen at breakfast.",

Here was an intelligent, faithful comic-book movie that had not only made money but had appealed to both rabid fans of the source material and audiences who didn't know Wolverine from Wolverhampton. Suddenly the words \"comic-book movie\", a term hitherto guaranteed to strike dread into executives' heart, had a far happier, far more profitable connotation.

Thankful for the box-office bonanza were not only the anxious executives - at 20th Century Fox - who had financed the movie to the tune of $75m, but every other green-eyed studio suit with a comic-book movie in development. Here was an intelligent, faithful comic-book movie that had not only made money but had appealed to both rabid fans of the source material and audiences who didn't know Wolverine from Wolverhampton. Suddenly the words \"comic-book movie\", a term hitherto guaranteed to strike dread into executives' heart, had a far happier, far more profitable connotation. No longer did it mean Batman &amp; Robin, Spawn, Steel or The Phantom.

      "body": "<p>I believe George Lucas to be the devil. Or, at least, say, Stalin. Accumulating power and money like a despot, feigning a jejune passion for the junk he watched as a child, manufacturing movies that lock on our weakest instincts with the single-mindedness of a speared hammerhead's death grip, George Lucas is a bane on the culture, a marauding scourge, a million locusts chewing up what's left of our newest art form's withered integrity. </p> <p>However much I'd like to, I cannot say that no one has had a more pernicious, infantilising influence on modern movies than Lucas - Steven Spielberg carries at least half of the devastation on his oblivious conscience, and together they represent the most powerful sensibility in the history of mass media, a mass media that is in their time (and to some extent due to their popularity) the most pervasive and powerful ever known to man. It's a sensibility, it should be said, that is defined by condescension and \"emphasis\". The numbers, as everyone knows, are humungous, and that's reason enough to sound the alarm and storm the gates. </p> <p>Instead, Lucas is being feted with a retrospective at the Barbican. They're calling it \"the first major tribute in Britain to the work of one of the central, pivotal figures in American motion picture history\", and since those words are chosen carefully, they're not wrong, as long as you read \"central, pivotal\" in terms of Lucas's role in the new Hollywood's all-too-successful attempt to plagiarise, bastardise, digitise and deintellectualise itself into a shit-bellied coma. Certainly, he is the Pope-King of Hollywood in that sense. But a retrospective? </p> <p>The manner by which civilised man congratulates the millionaire for his millions can sour the stomach, and it is Lucas's personally-owned empire that the curators must be worshipping: the full-on salute is honouring a man who has directed only four films in 30 years. Thus, the programme has been rounded out with films he produced (such as forgotten boondoggles Willow, Labyrinth, Tucker: The Man and His Dream and Radioland Murders), and, most appallingly, with Lucas's \"influences\". </p> <p>It's difficult to imagine that any intelligent adult could look at Lucas's track record over the last quarter-century and suppose that he was influenced by anyone other than his accountant and marketing team. Saying that Lucas was marked by his viewing of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (why not include the same director's The Hidden Fortress, from which Lucas lifted plot elements for Star Wars?) is a bit like saying Stephen King can't get Proust out of his system. As for High Noon, the most simplistic of American westerns, you can imagine how little Georgie Lucas sat in the matinee and realised he could turn this sober chestnut into a real smash - by having Gary Cooper chase the villains through dangerous canyons on hover-cycles, and by having Grace Kelly replaced with a Frank Oz-voiced puppet. </p> <p>Lucas wasn't always the Antichrist; in fact, his first two films were rigorously naturalistic, inventive, deeply imagined and - my God - mature examples of the \"American new wave\", the throng of gritty, unsentimental Hollywood movies that emerged in the late 60s and continued until Lucas himself dropped the toxic bomb of Luke Skywalker on the scene in 1977. </p> <p>Lucas was one of the young movement's key figures, taking over the fort straight out of film school alongside Coppola, Scorsese, Rafelson, Hellman, Bogdanovich, and co. THX 1138 (1971), expanded from his superb student short, is a despairing dystopian portrait of a loveless society controlled by technology, living underground and policed by machinery. Austere, full of ambiguity and so masterfully visualised that the white-on-white corridors, antechambers and techno-cluttered offices suggest a working future, not a conjectured fantasy, might be the best science-fiction film of its decade; it is, inarguably, the most tough-minded. </p> <p>Lucas hit the jackpot with his second film, American Graffiti (1973), and as happens all so rarely, a marvellous film became beloved by audiences. Explodingly witty (where did Lucas's sense of humour go?), fondly realised and perfectly shot and performed, Graffiti immediately established the retro teen comedy as a bankable genre, and that genre's unattainably high bar. Exploring his personal memories about a car-crazy, rock'n'roll midwestern teenhood in the late 50s and early 60s, Lucas made a movie that just melts in your mouth - there's nothing forced or stupid or contrived about it. The characters have three full dimensions, their experiences are electrifyingly specific but blessed with a universal glow, and the free-flowing script keeps almost a dozen personas afloat without a moment of strain. Lucas made the movie feel as if it was something he was born to make, and for a few years he became one of America's promised sons. </p> <p>Lucas may have started Star Wars with the same type of innocent ardour, but it didn't last long. It's even conceivable that Lucas started his saga as he said he did - as a homage to old Flash Gordon serials. What honour could be dealt to those odious antiques remains unknown; what Lucas did instead was re-engineer the fluff of sci-fi serials until it all resembled carnival rides (a metaphor still overused by action-film-loving critics - when's the last time anyone went on a rollercoaster?). Audiences began mistaking having their stomach flipped for a thrilled response to effective moviemaking, and down the slope we slid. </p> <p>To argue against Lucas is to argue against the pre-adolescent logic, storytelling retardation, cardboard characters, video game graphics, whorish pandering and wholesale idea thefts of the Star Wars movies, and those arguments are easy to make if you are old enough to drink in public. But it's Lucas's (and Spielberg's) snake-oil-cheat ideas and relentless mechanical authority that should let the case for the prosecution rest: thanks to them, the very language of movies has been degraded into the cine-visual equivalent of grunts, hand gestures and cave paintings. </p> <p> Now, and for the last 20 years, what makes Hollywood movies is a different box of tools than when Lucas was making THX and Graffiti and Spielberg was making Duel and The Sugarland Express. Today, it's the digital-effect gotcha, the preprogrammed jet-rocket ride, the come-hell-or-high-water \"sense of wonder\" (abetted by rays of blue light), the condensation of every scene into a two-minute sketch filled with meaningful looks and single-line declarations (people used to \"talk\" in movies), the eschewal of the convincing two-shot in favour of the manipulative close-up, the everything-in-the-foreground TV compositions, the stilted sitcom rhythms, the relentless dramatic crescendos fabricated solely from drill-sergeant-like soundtrack ba-booms and pointless Steadicam movements. </p> <p>Forget the unpredictability, textured reality, visual complexity and organic narrative of Five Easy Pieces, Two-Lane Blacktop, Scarecrow, McCabe &amp; Mrs Miller, Badlands, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver, Sorcerer, The Deer Hunter, et al. </p> <p>In Lucas-dominated cinema, no dramatic scene is any more informative than the music cues that accompany it. Nothing makes its way into a film without serving an explicit and simplistic narrative purpose; texture and believability for their own sakes are forbidden. (Digital effects are indulged in, of course, subject to their own law of diminishing returns.) Every shot and cut is calibrated with cynical expertise to control the feelings of the spectator; movies have always trucked in blatant manipulation, but only today are we seeing this ambition realised so adroitly that the movies' emotional life, far from being genuine or resonant or fresh, has the merciless thrust of a sophisticated sales job. </p> <p>Thanks to Lucas, Hollywood movies lie like rugs, and in doing so display abject scorn for filmgoers' ability to tell bullshit from truism, sales job from art. The sad fact is, often their scorn isn't misplaced, and audiences show little capacity or readiness to sift their cinematic encounters for cock-and-bull. The Phantom Menace, after all, is close to bringing in a billion bucks, and for some people, wealth is all the justification Lucas needs. But the money is his, not yours or mine; we're supposed to profit from the film as an experience. The last time anyone profited from Lucas's work besides himself, Nixon was president. \"Central, vital\"? Like a worm is central and vital to the inedibility of an apple. </p> <p>\u0095 George Lucas: His Films and Inspirations is at the Barbican from August 5-27.

Lucas hit the jackpot with his second film, American Graffiti (1973), and as happens all so rarely, a marvellous film became beloved by audiences. Explodingly witty (where did Lucas's sense of humour go?), fondly realised and perfectly shot and performed, Graffiti immediately established the retro teen comedy as a bankable genre, and that genre's unattainably high bar. Exploring his personal memories about a car-crazy, rock'n'roll midwestern teenhood in the late 50s and early 60s, Lucas made a movie that just melts in your mouth - there's nothing forced or stupid or contrived about it. The characters have three full dimensions, their experiences are electrifyingly specific but blessed with a universal glow, and the free-flowing script keeps almost a dozen personas afloat without a moment of strain. Lucas made the movie feel as if it was something he was born to make, and for a few years he became one of America's promised sons. Lucas may have started Star Wars with the same type of innocent ardour, but it didn't last long. It's even conceivable that Lucas started his saga as he said he did - as a homage to old Flash Gordon serials. What honour could be dealt to those odious antiques remains unknown; what Lucas did instead was re-engineer the fluff of sci-fi serials until it all resembled carnival rides (a metaphor still overused by action-film-loving critics - when's the last time anyone went on a rollercoaster?). Audiences began mistaking having their stomach flipped for a thrilled response to effective moviemaking, and down the slope we slid. To argue against Lucas is to argue against the pre-adolescent logic, storytelling retardation, cardboard characters, video game graphics, whorish pandering and wholesale idea thefts of the Star Wars movies, and those arguments are easy to make if you are old enough to drink in public. But it's Lucas's (and Spielberg's) snake-oil-cheat ideas and relentless mechanical authority that should let the case for the prosecution rest: thanks to them, the very language of movies has been degraded into the cine-visual equivalent of grunts, hand gestures and cave paintings. Now, and for the last 20 years, what makes Hollywood movies is a different box of tools than when Lucas was making THX and Graffiti and Spielberg was making Duel and The Sugarland Express. Today, it's the digital-effect gotcha, the preprogrammed jet-rocket ride, the come-hell-or-high-water \"sense of wonder\" (abetted by rays of blue light), the condensation of every scene into a two-minute sketch filled with meaningful looks and single-line declarations (people used to \"talk\" in movies), the eschewal of the convincing two-shot in favour of the manipulative close-up, the everything-in-the-foreground TV compositions, the stilted sitcom rhythms, the relentless dramatic crescendos fabricated solely from drill-sergeant-like soundtrack ba-booms and pointless Steadicam movements. Forget the unpredictability, textured reality, visual complexity and organic narrative of Five Easy Pieces, Two-Lane Blacktop, Scarecrow, McCabe &amp; Mrs Miller, Badlands, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver, Sorcerer, The Deer Hunter, et al. In Lucas-dominated cinema, no dramatic scene is any more informative than the music cues that accompany it. Nothing makes its way into a film without serving an explicit and simplistic narrative purpose; texture and believability for their own sakes are forbidden. (Digital effects are indulged in, of course, subject to their own law of diminishing returns.) Every shot and cut is calibrated with cynical expertise to control the feelings of the spectator; movies have always trucked in blatant manipulation, but only today are we seeing this ambition realised so adroitly that the movies' emotional life, far from being genuine or resonant or fresh, has the merciless thrust of a sophisticated sales job. Thanks to Lucas, Hollywood movies lie like rugs, and in doing so display abject scorn for filmgoers' ability to tell bullshit from truism, sales job from art. The sad fact is, often their scorn isn't misplaced, and audiences show little capacity or readiness to sift their cinematic encounters for cock-and-bull. The Phantom Menace, after all, is close to bringing in a billion bucks, and for some people, wealth is all the justification Lucas needs. But the money is his, not yours or mine; we're supposed to profit from the film as an experience. The last time anyone profited from Lucas's work besides himself, Nixon was president. \"Central, vital\"? Like a worm is central and vital to the inedibility of an apple. \u0095 George Lucas: His Films and Inspirations is at the Barbican from August 5-27.

In the 1980s, when she and Jim Bakker, her then husband, headed the Praise The Lord (PTL) television ministry, spreading the gospel to 13.5m homes and generating more than $120m annually, her spidery eyelashes and crocodile tears served as fodder for countless late-night television satires. She struggled with drug addiction, a workaholic husband and the strains of raising a family on camera. Even the cushy lifestyles of her dogs were criticised. </p> <p>Then, in 1987, Jim Bakker publicly admitted using $265,000 of PTL money in an unsuccessful bid to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, a church secretary who claimed he had sex with her in a Florida hotel room. A disgraced Bakker handed control of PTL over to the rival televangelist Jerry Falwell, who put the ministry into bankruptcy and smeared him as a homosexual. Tammy watched their media empire crumble. With her husband convicted of defrauding PTL supporters of $158m and sentenced to prison, she was reduced to selling off her television wardrobe to get by. </p> <p>Her faith has been tested. Now, in the twilight of her celebrity, she is, bizarrely, being resurrected as a gay icon. \"We've always been intrigued by her,\" said Randy Barbato who, with Fenton Bailey, has produced and directed The Eyes of Tammy Faye, a documentary about Christian broadcasting's former first lady: \"Christianity and materialism, spirituality and fabulousness - somehow, she manages to wrap them up in one package. We all spend a lot of time feeling bad about ourselves, because sometimes we feel spiritual and sometimes we want to go shopping. Well, that's what she is, a fabulous mess.\" </p> <p>Organised in tidy chapters, which are introduced by hand puppets, the film charts Tammy Faye LaValley's rise from humble origins as the eldest child in a devout family of eight living in International Falls, Minnesota. At 10, she found God, falling flat on her back in an Assemblies of God church and speaking in tongues; at 16, she discovered make-up. The two have never left her. In 1961, when she was 19, she wed Jim Bakker, a fellow student at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis. They were promptly expelled for marrying, but soon began touring the Bible Belt as itinerant preachers. </p> <p>Televangelism was in its infancy in 1965, when they got their start at Pat Robertson's fledgling Christian Broadcasting Network, where they created a children's programme and founded The 700 Club, Christian television's first talk show. Seven years later, eased out by Robertson, they moved to California, where, with Jane and Paul Crouch, they founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network (now the biggest force in televangelism). But that partnership also foundered. </p> <p>At last, in 1974, they started the PTL Network in an abandoned furniture store in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mixing glitzy entertainment with down-home family values, and preaching a \"prosperity gospel\" which put a divine seal of approval on both the growing affluence of American evangelicals and the showy lifestyles of their television ministers, PTL quickly mushroomed into a vast corporate enterprise. Heritage USA, the $200m Christian retreat that Jim Bakker built with PTL money, ranked with Disney World and Disneyland as one of the nation's most popular theme parks. </p> <p>Tammy was co-host of The Jim and Tammy Show, but she also produced her own programmes, including the daily Tammy Faye's House Party, where she entertained guests, offered advice on homemaking and shopping, staged fashion shows, danced, sang and made fudge. </p> <p>Rev Mel White, a gay Christian advocate who (before coming out) worked closely with many of the major televangelists, explains her appeal: \"For the evangelical community, she was Dr Joyce Brothers, Martha Stewart and Carol Burnett, all rolled into one.\" But The Eyes of Tammy Faye also reveals a more radical Tammy, who hosted shows on controversial topics like penile implants, interviewed a gay minister with Aids in the earliest days of public debate about the illness, and reached out to drug addicts and others excluded by the broader evangelical community. </p> <p>Rev White is convinced that, for PTL's largely rural, female and older audience, Tammy provided an image of empowerment. \"Her fans were people who grew up in a very fundamentalist tradition,\" he said, \"not being able to wear make-up, or dance, or go out in public. So here comes Tammy, with her dyed hair and make-up, her ebullient spirit and outspoken ways with both men and women. She talked about sex, and flirted with Jimmy. She took on the caricature of an obedient wife, and blasted it. You have never seen Pat Robertson's wife, or Jerry Falwell's wife. They stay at home, doing what those wives do.\" </p> <p>Bailey and Barbato were introduced to Tammy's work by their friend and business associate RuPaul, the actor, performer and drag superstar, who narrates the documentary. The pair have lived and worked together since they met as students at New York University film school 17 years ago. Bailey is British and was educated at Oxford; Barbato is from New Jersey. \"I bring the low culture,\" he says, \"and Fenton brings the high.\" World of Wonder, their Los Angeles-based production company, has turned out documentaries on various subjects: male prostitutes in Los Angeles, the experience of a juror on the OJ Simpson trial, the off-screen life of Ellen DeGeneres. Currently, they're developing Party Monster, a documentary about Michael Alig (a former denizen of the downtown New York club scene, now serving time for manslaughter) into a feature with the producer Christine Vachon. </p> <p>A combination of sincerity and irreverence has frequently led them to focus on figures reviled in mainstream culture: \"A common thread in our work is our interest in people who have been marginalised, judged or excluded,\" Bailey says. \"We live in celebritocracy. We need these larger-than-life media personalities, and yet it's as if we have a moral prejudice against those who live for the camera.\" Barbato agrees: \"Somehow, having them as targets to judge makes us feel better about ourselves. In Tammy's case, after a certain point, everyone was invited to pick up a stone and throw it at her.\" </p> <p>The Eyes of Tammy Faye is also a fable about the strange afterlife of television. In the early 1990s, after divorcing Bakker and marrying Roe Messner (the developer of Heritage USA, who was himself convicted of bankruptcy fraud in 1995), Tammy found herself shut out of Christian broadcasting. In 1996 she became a co-host of a talk show on the Fox Network with Jim Bullock, an openly gay actor.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Peter Bradshaw: </strong> It's all reasonably entertaining, but it is never clear whether we should buy &#91;it&#93; as a toughly modern, tech-aware action pic - or just another episode of The Dukes of Hazzard</p>",
      "byline": "Peter Bradshaw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Gone in 60 Seconds is a glitzy, ritzy reworking of a 1974 car-jack caper originally directed by HB Halicki, here starring the unerringly horse-faced Nicolas Cage opposite a slouching and sexy Angelina Jolie. This film, produced by action-meister Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Dominic Sena, revs up the sex interest and pulls out the choke on the dewy-eyed family loyalty. But also, more startlingly, it has an unlikely cameo for our very own Vinnie Jones, who has been encouraged to believe that he has a future in the movie star business. </p> <p>Frankly, it would be kindest to put Mr Jones out of his misery now. Like a tough but compassionate gamekeeper, someone has to grasp the wounded bird that is Vinnie' s film career and snap its neck cleanly. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger - with whom Vinnie has unblushingly compared himself - he has no feeling for comedy nor knack for dialogue. Tellingly, he is mute for the entire picture except for a well-rehearsed speech at the end. And in an American context, he doesn't even look that tough. Their tough guys are tougher than our tough guys. Vinnie is Joe Bugner in a world of Muhammad Alis. </p> <p>This film attempts to bring the world of car-thievery and car-chasery into the 21st century, where cars are far slicker and more trouble-free than they were 30 years ago.

      "bodyText": "Gone in 60 Seconds is a glitzy, ritzy reworking of a 1974 car-jack caper originally directed by HB Halicki, here starring the unerringly horse-faced Nicolas Cage opposite a slouching and sexy Angelina Jolie. This film, produced by action-meister Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Dominic Sena, revs up the sex interest and pulls out the choke on the dewy-eyed family loyalty. But also, more startlingly, it has an unlikely cameo for our very own Vinnie Jones, who has been encouraged to believe that he has a future in the movie star business. Frankly, it would be kindest to put Mr Jones out of his misery now. Like a tough but compassionate gamekeeper, someone has to grasp the wounded bird that is Vinnie' s film career and snap its neck cleanly. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger - with whom Vinnie has unblushingly compared himself - he has no feeling for comedy nor knack for dialogue. Tellingly, he is mute for the entire picture except for a well-rehearsed speech at the end. And in an American context, he doesn't even look that tough. Their tough guys are tougher than our tough guys. Vinnie is Joe Bugner in a world of Muhammad Alis. This film attempts to bring the world of car-thievery and car-chasery into the 21st century, where cars are far slicker and more trouble-free than they were 30 years ago. It's a world of better suspension, hi-tech computer designs and automatic transmission systems; a world in which the duller, smaller, more bulbous and economic-to-run models from Europe and Japan have extensively invaded American streets. The business of driving - and indeed stealing - such cars was an appreciably more romantic and artisanal business then, and so there is something almost subconsciously nostalgic about a film in which a group of loveable rogues led by Memphis Raines (Cage) have to steal 50 cars or his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) gets whacked by a sinister limey villain played by Christopher Eccleston, whose utter loathsomeness is signalled to cinema audiences by having him snort at baseball, calling it \"boring\".

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of French supporters crowded the Place de la Concorde yesterday to cheer the winners of the European football championship, as politicians, the media and business started assessing the feel-good factor flowing from a unique achievement. To celebrate the first time the same national team have won the world and then the European cup , even the staid newspaper Le Monde splashed the story alongside an unprecedented colour photograph. Headlines in national papers describing the players as \"the kings of Europe\" caught the mood of a country whose self-confidence has grown by leaps and bounds in its efforts to deal with social and economic shortfalls since the Socialist government was elected in 1997 - a year before the world cup. The prime minister, Lionel Jospin, whose political popularity stands at over 60% and who was in Rotterdam to congratulate the winners, seems the most likely leader to gain from national euphoria as France heads for local, parliamentary and presidential elections in the next 22 months. He described the 2-1 victory over Italy as a timely omen for the start of the country's six-month EU presidency. Having already taken credit for a 1m reduction in unemployment, to 9.8%, and a leap in economic growth, the leftwing government can also thank its footballers for putting a brake on racism. The team, who include players of Algerian, West African, Caribbean and central European origins alongside Gallic French, were already treated as an international example of racial harmony in 1998 after defeating Brazil. The sports minister, Marie-Georges Buffet, said yesterday that the multi-ethnic side proved that France had created a harmonious society \"that could do great things together\" - a claim that has been supported by the drop in support for the anti-immigration National Front party. \"The image of ethnic mixing is at the origin of a collective spirit that meets every test,\" the leftwing daily Liberation said in its leader. \" France 's victory, its secret, is without doubt based on the winning combination of two styles - physical and technical.\" The rightwing Figaro agreed, adding: \"Zidane and his heroic teammates are more than just footballers. They represent a France which wins, a France which dreams.\" The ethnic mixture was evident in the crowd of 400,000 which filled the Champs Elysees on Sunday night and the gathering outside the Crillon Hotel on the Place de la Concorde, where the players appeared on the balcony like royalty.

I'm not sure about his blonde twins as they fidget and yawn in the celebrity box. They look kind of restless in pre-wild-oats mode. But W has strength in depth. There's nephew George P doing his podium bit already, and nephew Pierce, a 14-year-old Mekon of political jargon to shame the juvenile Hague. No, the trouble is all behind him. Proud dad George Senior can't stop taking bows and - worse - responding on camera to Clinton when the wondrously shrewd Bill portrays W as a cossetted rich kid. Proud mum Barbara is playing the Queen Mother for all she's worth. There are so many Bushes hogging attention that you don't need to see the shoulder pads to think of Dynasty. The effect is curiously choking, an everlasting Bush family Christmas of the airwaves. Back, back to the future. The gerontocracy rules curiously OK. Second world war vets, Korean vets, Vietnam vets. It may play well, but is this the real America? Maybe Prezza Hezza should up sticks and head west - this country needs him.",

      "body": "<p>Bob Long and John Plimmer, childhood friends, hadn't met for 13 years the day they bumped into each other in a street in Coventry. Long had just carried out an armed robbery of a security van delivering cash to a supermarket. Plimmer had just arrested him after a tip-off. They faced each other across the interview table of the West Midlands serious crime squad. \"Bob?\" said Plimmer. \"John?\" said Long. \"Yes,\" Plimmer concedes, looking back, \"I think I was surprised that Bob turned out to be an armed robber. But I had a job to do, he had a job to do. There were no hard feelings.\" </p> <p>\"It was nothing personal,\" concurs Long. \"We were both professionals.\" </p> <p>The two men, 53 and from Birmingham, have collaborated on a slightly fictionalised account of the way their lives were interwoven for the greater part of the 60s and 70s, Long as a high-profile \"target criminal\", Plimmer as a detective superintendent with the West Midlands police force. The Inside Track, published this month, portrays them as Steve Blade and Detective Chief Inspector Jack Priestley, a man who reads like a clich\u00e9 (\"where did that sawn-off come from? Somebody's Christmas cracker?\" and various permutations of \"all right, sunshine, you're nicked\"). </p> <p>Plimmer and Long rub along like relics from the good old days when villains had values, coppers spoke their minds and neither held a grudge over the odd knee in the groin between friends. \"It's difficult to go by the book when a bloke's pointing a sawn-off shotgun at you,\" says Plimmer, cheerfully, in a broad Birmingham accent. \"You tend to kick him and cuff him, and then read him his rights.\" </p> <p>Sitting in Plimmer's front room in Meriden, a genteel village on the outskirts of the city, the pair appear to have struck up a workable but mutually suspicious relationship. Plimmer, who actually wrote the book, is the more talkative and assured. Long, who is short and stocky, provided all the details of how it feels to ambush a postal van and do time with the Kray gang, and is the more reticent, deferring to his writing partner while getting in the occasional well- placed dig. Producing the book required them to make certain psychological adjustments, given the divergent nature of their loyalties. </p> <p>\"Initially, I was going to write it and front it and Bob was either going to be a sleeping researcher or be open about his involvement,\" says Plimmer. \"That was your dilemma, wasn't it?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" says Long. \"After 30 years on the . . . other side . . . as it were, it was a difficult line for me to cross. I did have one or two people, old-style villains, taking the attitude that all coppers are bastards, that never the two shall meet, which I respect. Some of my former associates are respectable people now and they got a bit frightened.\" </p> <p>\"But you told them it was fiction, didn't you,\" says Plimmer. </p> <p>\"Based on our lives,\" says Long. </p> <p>The two grew up in a working-class area of Birmingham, hanging out at the same dance halls and youth clubs. They weren't best friends, but were aware of each other as members of the same social circle, and had ambitions in common. Both thrived on discipline and hard, physical work. \"I can remember Bob talking about wanting to be a boy soldier,\" says Plimmer, \"and I had always wanted to join the police force. I think it's because there was a copper who lived by us and I used to knock on his door and run away - he used to catch me most of the time, but he never gave me a smack in the head. That might have persuaded me.\" </p> <p>\"I was coming up for 16 and about five of us walked past a recruiting office for the Coldstream Guards in Birmingham city centre,\" says Long. \"We had a little chat and all signed up, there and then, not really knowing what we were doing. Then, two weeks, later I had the letter to report to Purbright in Surrey. After the initial shock, it was a wonderful life.\" </p> <p>He was a good soldier and became the pride of his regiment when, after taking up boxing, he won the Imperial Services Boxing Championship by flattening the top fighters from the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. He moved to Chelsea barracks, was put on ceremonial duty outside the Tower of London and fell in love with a girl from home. He was then posted to Germany, but didn't want to leave her. He went AWOL from the army and couldn't get a job or sign on without being busted, so he took up armed robbery. </p> <p>Four years and two children later, the army caught up with him. After a court martial, he spent nine months in Colchester military prison. Such was his record that, when he came out, they offered to take him back. He refused. </p> <p>While Long is telling his story, Plimmer is sitting waiting his turn with apparent patience, although when he comes to speak he rushes at it as if he has been holding his breath. \"I was what they call a career detective,\" he says. \"I did 18 months in uniform and the rest was 30 years in CID. I was a branch commander on the regional crime squad. I worked for the security forces for a short time. Then I was in the drug squad in Morocco, and ended up getting deported for finding out more than they wanted me to. </p> <p>\"Can't go back there, unfortunately. I miss that place like a bullet in the head - pits of the earth. Anyone who goes on their holidays to bloody Tangiers wants looking at. It's just sand and bloody beggars. The king of Morocco didn't like me very much.\" </p> <p>The 70s brought what Long and Plimmer refer to, nostalgically, as the boom in armed robbery. It was a magic decade for Plimmer - 30 murders to investigate in five years, every one resulting in a conviction, interspersed with dramatic heists and rough ambushes. It was a good decade for Long too, who was robbing so frequently that he managed to develop a trademark - taking the pellets out of his shotgun cartridges and replacing them with rice. It was enough to stop a have-a-go hero but not to kill. </p> <p>\"It was a time when money was being carried about in Transits,\" he says, dreamily. \"Her Majesty's Royal Mail was ridiculous. You had a postman given an extra tenner a week to drive a post office van with no security whatsoever, with anything between \u00a330,000 and half a million in the back.\" </p> <p>\"Sixty-year-old postmen as well,\" chips in Plimmer. </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" says Long. \"So instead of taking them out when they were walking between the van and the post office, people started to say, well, why not have the lot? Why not open the back of the van and have the lot.\" </p> <p>\"They were queueing up,\" says Plimmer. </p> <p>\"This ended with me in 1971, doing an armed robbery in Coventry that went drastically wrong,\" says Long. \"In the middle of the rush hour the getaway car was rammed by a lorry. You can imagine the mayhem. I was eventually convicted and got 10 years in Gartree prison.\" When he and Plimmer met up again, it was 1977. Long had just been released and managed to lead a semi-straight life until one of his old associates rang up asking him to be a last- minute replacement on the supermarket robbery. </p> <p>\"Yeah, that was a tip-off we had. We just took them out,\" says Plimmer, with relish. \"We didn't recognise each other when we had our battle on the streets. I never looked at him until we got back to the nick. I knew of Bob Long the armed robber - he was a well-known professional - but I didn't associate Bob Long the robber with Bob Long the school lad. But I recognised him in the interview room because he looked a bit younger then than he does now.\" </p> <p>Long flinches, as Plimmer continues: \"We had a rabbit about school days, but he wouldn't talk about the crime, which in fairness I wasn't bothered about because he got caught with a gun in his hand anyway.\" </p> <p>Long was sent down for six years. In spite of this, when the two men bumped into each other in the Carpenters Arms in Birmingham in the mid-90s there was little animosity. Long had been straight for 10 years after landing a good job in the construction business. Plimmer had retired from the police force to become a writer. Long suggested that they do a book about their lives. They got \u00a330,000 for it and are now working on the sequel. </p> <p>There are unavoidable tensions. Long insists that the practice of \"bagging\", the brutal method of wrapping a plastic bag around a suspect's head to suffocate information out of him, was widespread in West Midlands CID in the 70s. Plimmer thinks he has \"got his wires crossed\". Long won't go on the Big Breakfast because he thinks that the television show's producer will make him run around waving a rubber truncheon. Plimmer takes a more relaxed view. </p> <p>What unites them, however, is not only a sense of shared history, but a subtler sense of pride that they participated in some kind of golden age. \"Being a professional criminal meant being in and out in 10 seconds,\" says Long. \"If you had to use violence it meant something had gone wrong. It was professional pride to be in and out and leave them scratching their heads.\" And he shoots a little look of triumph at Plimmer. </p> <p>The Inside Track is published by the House of Stratus on August 29.</p>",
