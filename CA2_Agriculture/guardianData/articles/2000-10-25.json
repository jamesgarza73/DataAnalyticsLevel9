      "body": "<p>The only disappointment for Arsenal's fans last night was that their side only scored four times. Two up inside seven minutes, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's players slipped into cruise control and produced only bursts of brilliance to make sure of top spot in Group B. </p> <p>Goals by Ray Parlour, Lauren and Lee Dixon put Arsenal in control and although Sparta Prague pulled one back, Nwankwo Kanu added a fourth early in the second half. Sparta's spirit deserved the impressive injury-time goal added by Tomas Rosicky but they never looked likely to prevent Arsenal continuing their 100% record here this season. </p> <p>Arsenal knew that whatever happened they could look forward to playing in the second group stage, having qualified last week with that 1-1 draw at Lazio. But Wenger's team were aware that victory would guarantee top spot and ensure they could draw only one other group winner in the next round. The \u00a3200,000 offered by Uefa for a win must also have interested Wenger as he saves up for decent binoculars and a good lawyer in case his appeal against a 12-match touchline ban fails. </p> <p>Not that Sparta, beaten 1-0 by a piece of Silvinho magic in Prague, had promised to be pushovers. And they must have fancied their chances when they saw Arsenal's defence. </p> <p>With five centre-halves unavailable, Wenger deployed Oleg Luzhny and Nelson Vivas at the heart of a back four composed entirely of full-backs. Barely had Sparta had a chance to test any weaknesses, though, than they were two goals down. It seemed their back line was made of made of players with bad backs, never mind full-backs. </p> <p>Arsenal's first arrived in the fifth minute, Patrick Vieira passing square into the path of Parlour, who struck the ball sweetly past Tomas Postulka from 25 yards. </p> <p>Then, two minutes later, came the second. Robert Pires was the architect, bursting past Libor Sionko on the left flank and cutting back a cross which Lauren swept into the corner. Had Thierry Henry found the back rather than the side of the net when Jiri Novotny made a hash of a back-pass Arsenal would have been three up inside 10 minutes. And, not surprisingly, they drifted for a while. </p> <p>It needed a fine save from David Seaman to tip a Vladimir Labant free-kick on to the underside of the bar, and Arsenal frequently looked a combination of complacent and confused at the back as Sparta refused to throw in the towel. </p> <p>Not long after Sionko and Michal Hornak had headed chances wide, though, Arsenal scored a third. Postulka failed to hold Henry's free-kick and the captain Dixon slammed in the loose ball from a couple of yards. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Arsenal, Seaman had clearly watched that incident too closely. Shortly afterwards he let a Rosicky free-kick slip from his grasp and brought down Marek Kincl as the ball ran loose. To the delight of Sparta's 93 fans Labant scored from the penalty spot. </p> <p>Perhaps to keep them on their toes, Arsenal switched from blue shirts to yellow at the interval, though the official explanation was that the two teams looked too similar to the fourth official. </p> <p>Whatever, the change did not confuse Wenger's players. Six minutes into the second half Henry burst into the box down the left and although his cross was blocked by Postulka, Kanu showed off his wonderful balance to wrongfoot a defender and clip in the loose ball. </p> <p>Still Sparta refused to give up. Seaman atoned for his earlier error by saving well from Sionko and Dixon headed off the line from the resulting corner. But it mattered little as Arsenal looked forward to more testing European ties. </p> <p><strong> \u0095The Lazio defender Sinisa Mihajlovic last night apologised </strong> for the abuse he directed at Arsenal's Patrick Vieira in last week's Champions League match. Speaking before last night's home match against Shakhtar Donetsk, the Yu goslav said on the public address system: \"I know I made a mistake last Tuesday and I want to sincerely apologise to all those who felt rightly offended for the expression I used in a moment of particular tension on the field.\" Mihajlovic also called on Lazio fans to cease racist chanting. </p> <p> <strong> Arsenal</strong> (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Vivas, Luzhny, Silvinho (Cole, h-t); Lauren, Parlour, Vieira, Pires (Bergkamp, 64min); Kanu, Henry (Wiltord, 71). </p> <p><strong> Sparta Prague </strong> (3-5-2): Postulka; Hornak, J Novotny, Bolf; Sionko (Papousek, 85), Jarosik, Rosicky, Hasek, Labant; Kincl, Jun (Mynar, h-t). </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> A Hamer (Luxembourg).</p>",

Goals by Ray Parlour, Lauren and Lee Dixon put Arsenal in control and although Sparta Prague pulled one back, Nwankwo Kanu added a fourth early in the second half. Sparta's spirit deserved the impressive injury-time goal added by Tomas Rosicky but they never looked likely to prevent Arsenal continuing their 100% record here this season. Arsenal knew that whatever happened they could look forward to playing in the second group stage, having qualified last week with that 1-1 draw at Lazio. But Wenger's team were aware that victory would guarantee top spot and ensure they could draw only one other group winner in the next round. The \u00a3200,000 offered by Uefa for a win must also have interested Wenger as he saves up for decent binoculars and a good lawyer in case his appeal against a 12-match touchline ban fails. Not that Sparta, beaten 1-0 by a piece of Silvinho magic in Prague, had promised to be pushovers. And they must have fancied their chances when they saw Arsenal's defence. With five centre-halves unavailable, Wenger deployed Oleg Luzhny and Nelson Vivas at the heart of a back four composed entirely of full-backs. Barely had Sparta had a chance to test any weaknesses, though, than they were two goals down. It seemed their back line was made of made of players with bad backs, never mind full-backs. Arsenal's first arrived in the fifth minute, Patrick Vieira passing square into the path of Parlour, who struck the ball sweetly past Tomas Postulka from 25 yards. Then, two minutes later, came the second. Robert Pires was the architect, bursting past Libor Sionko on the left flank and cutting back a cross which Lauren swept into the corner. Had Thierry Henry found the back rather than the side of the net when Jiri Novotny made a hash of a back-pass Arsenal would have been three up inside 10 minutes. And, not surprisingly, they drifted for a while. It needed a fine save from David Seaman to tip a Vladimir Labant free-kick on to the underside of the bar, and Arsenal frequently looked a combination of complacent and confused at the back as Sparta refused to throw in the towel. Not long after Sionko and Michal Hornak had headed chances wide, though, Arsenal scored a third. Postulka failed to hold Henry's free-kick and the captain Dixon slammed in the loose ball from a couple of yards. Unfortunately for Arsenal, Seaman had clearly watched that incident too closely. Shortly afterwards he let a Rosicky free-kick slip from his grasp and brought down Marek Kincl as the ball ran loose. To the delight of Sparta's 93 fans Labant scored from the penalty spot. Perhaps to keep them on their toes, Arsenal switched from blue shirts to yellow at the interval, though the official explanation was that the two teams looked too similar to the fourth official. Whatever, the change did not confuse Wenger's players. Six minutes into the second half Henry burst into the box down the left and although his cross was blocked by Postulka, Kanu showed off his wonderful balance to wrongfoot a defender and clip in the loose ball. Still Sparta refused to give up. Seaman atoned for his earlier error by saving well from Sionko and Dixon headed off the line from the resulting corner. But it mattered little as Arsenal looked forward to more testing European ties. \u0095The Lazio defender Sinisa Mihajlovic last night apologised for the abuse he directed at Arsenal's Patrick Vieira in last week's Champions League match. Speaking before last night's home match against Shakhtar Donetsk, the Yu goslav said on the public address system: \"I know I made a mistake last Tuesday and I want to sincerely apologise to all those who felt rightly offended for the expression I used in a moment of particular tension on the field.\" Mihajlovic also called on Lazio fans to cease racist chanting. Arsenal (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Vivas, Luzhny, Silvinho (Cole, h-t); Lauren, Parlour, Vieira, Pires (Bergkamp, 64min); Kanu, Henry (Wiltord, 71). Sparta Prague (3-5-2): Postulka; Hornak, J Novotny, Bolf; Sionko (Papousek, 85), Jarosik, Rosicky, Hasek, Labant; Kincl, Jun (Mynar, h-t). Referee: A Hamer (Luxembourg).",

      "body": "<p>Finally, five-and-a-half years after Rachel Whiteread's design for a Holocaust memorial in Vienna was approved, the sculpture was unveiled. </p> <p>As much as it is a sculpture Whiteread's memorial is a closed, windowless single storey building. It sits on a low plinth at one end of Judenplatz. The walls are covered from top to bottom in row upon row of books. But it is as though they have been turned to face the wall. </p> <p>One sees the edges of the book covers, the closed pages. They are like the books one holds in one's hand, about to be opened. Like the rest of the building the books are made of concrete, which in the autumn sunshine looked as pale as the stones which paved the newly pedestrianised square. </p> <p>A pair of doors at one end of the building are sealed shut. The metaphor, surely, is one of finality. </p> <p>The concrete looks fresh, although small imperfections in the surface make some of the books look used, the edges of the pages discoloured or speckled with age. </p> <p>Whiteread had to use a slightly less porous concrete than planned. She wanted the rain to get in and frost to age the sculpture, giving it what she called a somewhat sorry appearance. </p> <p>At a distance you can barely see the books, and the building appears to be made of a series of slabs. The top edge of the structure is cut off at an angle. Although it echoes the roofs of the baroque buildings which line the square, it looks like a bunker. </p> <p>Whiteread's memorial asserts itself against its surroundings. It is an interruption in the square. It stops you short. </p> <p>How can any public sculpture address the enormity of the Holocaust? Expressionist figurative sculpture risks the humiliation of its tormented mannerisms. Whiteread's nameless library is austere to the point of brutality, yet seen up close its details have a familiarity and approachability which invites a step towards it. </p> <p>At this point one looks down and reads the names of the death camps, and the dedication to the Jewish Austrian dead. </p> <p>This monument resists the affectations of style. Echoing the military bunkers of the second world war it achieves a kind of stylelessness, and timelessness. </p> <p>How can one read a closed book? What does a perpetually closed building signify? Whiteread will not be drawn into discussions about the memorial's symbolism although books inevitably speak of the histories and stories of their time. Conceived almost six years ago the Holocaust Memorial cannot be considered a new work by the artist and she is not, she has said, in the memorial business. Yet the Vienna memorial will undoubtedly enhance her international reputation as an artist of great seriousness, rigour and sensitivity. </p> <p>Across the Judenplatz the statue of Gottfraim Lessing gesticulates. Whiteread's building does not invite a dialogue with the statue nor with the buildings on the square nor with the remains of the 15th century synagogue, beautifully displayed in it's own subterranean vault beneath the square. </p> <p>The memorial's uncomfortable unapologetic presence has a certain grandeur. It is a reminder enough of its meanings. The building's emphatic muteness and silence is the appropriate response to the enormity of its subject. </p> <p>It will not disappear into forgetfulness or the every day. It is a place where memories happen.</p>",

The concrete looks fresh, although small imperfections in the surface make some of the books look used, the edges of the pages discoloured or speckled with age. Whiteread had to use a slightly less porous concrete than planned. She wanted the rain to get in and frost to age the sculpture, giving it what she called a somewhat sorry appearance. At a distance you can barely see the books, and the building appears to be made of a series of slabs. The top edge of the structure is cut off at an angle. Although it echoes the roofs of the baroque buildings which line the square, it looks like a bunker. Whiteread's memorial asserts itself against its surroundings. It is an interruption in the square. It stops you short. How can any public sculpture address the enormity of the Holocaust? Expressionist figurative sculpture risks the humiliation of its tormented mannerisms. Whiteread's nameless library is austere to the point of brutality, yet seen up close its details have a familiarity and approachability which invites a step towards it. At this point one looks down and reads the names of the death camps, and the dedication to the Jewish Austrian dead. This monument resists the affectations of style. Echoing the military bunkers of the second world war it achieves a kind of stylelessness, and timelessness. How can one read a closed book? What does a perpetually closed building signify? Whiteread will not be drawn into discussions about the memorial's symbolism although books inevitably speak of the histories and stories of their time. Conceived almost six years ago the Holocaust Memorial cannot be considered a new work by the artist and she is not, she has said, in the memorial business. Yet the Vienna memorial will undoubtedly enhance her international reputation as an artist of great seriousness, rigour and sensitivity. Across the Judenplatz the statue of Gottfraim Lessing gesticulates. Whiteread's building does not invite a dialogue with the statue nor with the buildings on the square nor with the remains of the 15th century synagogue, beautifully displayed in it's own subterranean vault beneath the square. The memorial's uncomfortable unapologetic presence has a certain grandeur. It is a reminder enough of its meanings. The building's emphatic muteness and silence is the appropriate response to the enormity of its subject. It will not disappear into forgetfulness or the every day. It is a place where memories happen.",

Max Stafford Clark, then director of the Royal Court, commissioned the play and now revives it and pairs it with a new work, A State Affair by Robin Soans.

      "body": "<p>From her desk at the Essex headquarters of Barnardo's, Maggie Smith oversees a small army of 3,000 staff and 15,000 volunteers. Her role as children's services manager gives her the ear of government and a key role shaping support for Britain's poorest, most disadvantaged youngsters. </p> <p>But when Smith looks back on a 30-year career, it is her first and smallest project that she describes as \"probably the best thing I ever did\". Newly estranged from her first husband, with no home, no furniture, and two small boys under five, she was one of a handful of lone parents in the West Yorkshire mill town of Keighley who, in 1972, founded a local Gingerbread group and the district's first modern childcare facility. </p> <p>That centre, Kiddicare, is still going, with Smith, now 53, as life president. And it was the experience of setting it up that launched her on her crusading course, dedicated to child welfare and social justice. \"It wasn't really a planned career,\" she says. \"I got involved with Keighley Gingerbread in desperation.\" </p> <p>Her first marriage ended abruptly and unhappily. She quit the family home in Bradford with her two sons and \"began to read and understand about social policy for the first time in my life\". Very soon, she was stung by the injustice of it all. </p> <p>\"If it wasn't for my parents, my children might have ended up in care,\" she recalls. \"Remember Cathy Come Home? You had very few rights in those days. The police wouldn't intervene in cases of domestic violence - restraining injunctions didn't exist. You'd lose your furniture, absolutely everything you ever owned. </p> <p>\"I was catapulted into poverty and homelessness. My circumstances had suddenly got a whole lot worse - my marriage had ended and I was homeless - but the council wouldn't house me, their rule then was that they put a six months 'stay' on your points, to prevent lone parents trying to jump the housing queue. Their argument was that you might go back to the family home. So even if your points shot up, as mine did, there was a six month period before they would take it into account.\" </p> <p>Smith was lucky: she could fall back on her parents, and their \"respectable\" working class home at Boston Spa, near Wetherby. But there was still the tut-tutting of elderly people in the queue at the post office while she stood in line waiting for her giro. \"At that time, the media focused on lone parents wanting more benefits, when the actual picture was that we wanted help to work.\" </p> <p>After landing a housing association tenancy in Bradford, she found her nurse training was next to useless. Shift working was out of the question with two children. Things changed when she got in touch with Gingerbread, the lone parent network. </p> <p>\"I contacted Gingerbread - I had seen someone talking about it on TV - and said: 'Where's my nearest group? I need help.' There were eight or 10 other lone parents, some in even worse states than me. There was a slow realisation that if we helped each other, we could actually survive much better, and try to lobby locally.\" </p> <p>They lobbied loudly and in the end, in classic early-70s fashion, the unlikely group did it themselves. A social worker's tip-off led them to a Keighley mill nursery which was due to close. Mill nurseries had been a common feature in Lancashire and Yorkshire, but the companies were closing them rapidly to avoid the 1974 health and safety regulations. </p> <p>\"Five of us went in to see social services,\" Smith recalls. \"We really didn't know what employing people - we eventually employed eight people - would be like. All we knew was we had nothing to lose. But we had some horrendous times.\" </p> <p>As well as Smith, there were three other young mums, and Noel, a father of four, widowed when his wife died of a brain haemorrhage on their youngest baby's first birthday. He was the most politically aware of the group. \"He would go to the library and get out government reports,\" says Smith. \"We'd read bits of it and get even more angry - we became very bolshie. We learned our politics the hard way, when we came up against bureaucracy.\" </p> <p>That learning process culminated in heated exchanges, and even threats of jail, when the childcare centre was adjudged to be operating without a registration certificate. Behind the acrimony, thinks Smith, was resentment on the part of the welfare establishment. \"They were angry that this rank group of amateurs, lone parents on benefit, should take on something so complex,\" she says. </p> <p>\"I'm proud that Kiddicare is still flourishing. It's helped 20,000 lone parents in 25 years, and is still managed by the parents. I go back from time to time - I still think it's probably the best thing I ever did.\" </p> <p>It was, however, just the beginning of a career fighting for children's rights. Smith was recruited to Gingerbread's staff, first in Keighley and then in London, and subsequently went into local government in Bradford and Manchester. After a couple of years in higher education, she joined Barnardo's in 1998. </p> <p>What attracted her to the charity was its work with children and young people right on the margins - the ones that other agencies had given up on. \"Barnardo's has a commitment to social justice for all children. It's the most inspiring work I've ever seen,\" she says.</p>",

I need help.' There were eight or 10 other lone parents, some in even worse states than me. There was a slow realisation that if we helped each other, we could actually survive much better, and try to lobby locally.\" They lobbied loudly and in the end, in classic early-70s fashion, the unlikely group did it themselves. A social worker's tip-off led them to a Keighley mill nursery which was due to close. Mill nurseries had been a common feature in Lancashire and Yorkshire, but the companies were closing them rapidly to avoid the 1974 health and safety regulations. \"Five of us went in to see social services,\" Smith recalls. \"We really didn't know what employing people - we eventually employed eight people - would be like. All we knew was we had nothing to lose. But we had some horrendous times.\" As well as Smith, there were three other young mums, and Noel, a father of four, widowed when his wife died of a brain haemorrhage on their youngest baby's first birthday. He was the most politically aware of the group. \"He would go to the library and get out government reports,\" says Smith. \"We'd read bits of it and get even more angry - we became very bolshie. We learned our politics the hard way, when we came up against bureaucracy.\" That learning process culminated in heated exchanges, and even threats of jail, when the childcare centre was adjudged to be operating without a registration certificate. Behind the acrimony, thinks Smith, was resentment on the part of the welfare establishment. \"They were angry that this rank group of amateurs, lone parents on benefit, should take on something so complex,\" she says. \"I'm proud that Kiddicare is still flourishing. It's helped 20,000 lone parents in 25 years, and is still managed by the parents. I go back from time to time - I still think it's probably the best thing I ever did.\" It was, however, just the beginning of a career fighting for children's rights. Smith was recruited to Gingerbread's staff, first in Keighley and then in London, and subsequently went into local government in Bradford and Manchester. After a couple of years in higher education, she joined Barnardo's in 1998. What attracted her to the charity was its work with children and young people right on the margins - the ones that other agencies had given up on. \"Barnardo's has a commitment to social justice for all children. It's the most inspiring work I've ever seen,\" she says.",

Borkowski PR, whose clients range from Bacardi Breezer to Sir Cliff Richard, won the task after a competitive pitch. It has previously created PR campaigns for the UN children's charity, Unicef, and for Jubilee 2000, the charity lobbying for the cancellation of third world debt. Amnesty is keeping details of the celebrations under wraps until the beginning of next year, but is understood to be planning an ambitious line-up of events across the world. Andy Hackman, fundraising manager for Amnesty, acknowledged that hiring Borkowski PR marked a departure from the organisation's usual practice of handling all its publicity in-house, but said that the scale of the operation had made it necessary to look outside.

The future of arms sales to Israel is also being considered, the sources said. Amnesty International yesterday called on the government to suspend all exports of any components for US Apache helicopters until Israel showed they would not be used to breach human rights. Whitehall last year licensed the sale of unidentified components to Israel for combat helicopters plus other equipment including \"small arms ammunition\", says the government's latest annual report on strategic export controls. It is thought that Israel denied British equipment had been used although Whitehall admits it is hard to discover where such equipment ends up. Amnesty, which has also called on Washington to halt arms sales to Israel, said Israeli forces had used US-supplied helicopter gunships \"to violate the human rights of Palestinians in punitive attacks on civilians\" and \"where there was no imminent danger to life\".

Last year, when Mr Barak came to power promising to make peace with the Palestinians, he declared 42 such settlements illegal. But in the months since then, Israeli bureaucrats have given the green light to nearly all of the settlements.</p> <p>If Mr Sharon joins the government, the settlers can expand their ambitions even more.

Israel remains on edge after another night of gunfire on Gilo, built on occupied land on the southern edges of Jerusalem. \"If the Palestinians will not stop firing, we will have to stop it, and it will require a massive operation,\" said Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert. \"It will cost them dearly.\" In such an atmosphere, the return of the Ben Dors to Mitzpeh Hagit is loaded with meaning. \"It sends a very clear message to the Palestinians that we are claiming a part of the West Bank. It is the same message as unilateral separation: that the Palestinians better be prepared to make a peace that doesn't include large parts of the West Bank,\" said Jeff Halper, an Israeli peace activist. That view suits the family just fine. Although Mrs Ben Dor says she wanted her four children to grow up in a pristine environment, and argues that in planting ficus and carob trees she is in communion with the desert, she admits her presence at Mitzpe Hagit is extremely political. \"We would not come and live here, if we did not believe this is Israel and should be part of Israel forever and ever.\" The outposts are envisaged as a chain of settlements that would outflank Palestinian villages along the road from Arab East Jerusalem to the West Bank city of Ramallah, and would bolster existing isolated settlements, which Mr Barak was prepared to abandon at his Camp David negotiations with Mr Arafat last July. Last year, when Mr Barak came to power promising to make peace with the Palestinians, he declared 42 such settlements illegal. But in the months since then, Israeli bureaucrats have given the green light to nearly all of the settlements. If Mr Sharon joins the government, the settlers can expand their ambitions even more. The Likud leader is a vigorous proponent of keeping large \"security zones\" in the Jordan valley, along with all settlements in the West Bank.

      "bodyText": "The former Conservative prime minister Sir Edward Heath , who became Father of the House of Commons, last night ended intense speculation about his future and announced his retirement as an MP after more than 50 years at Westminster. His letter to party activists in Old Bexley and Sidcup prompted a flood of tributes to the politician who took a wary Britain into Europe in 1973 - hoping in vain that he had finally settled the country's post-imperial destiny. Instead, the man who had drastically reformed trade union law suddenly fell from power over a miners' strike. Ousted by Margaret Thatcher in a Palace of Westminster coup in 1975, he resorted to one of the longest sulks in public life over his treatment by her. As the former prime minister (1970-74) last night flew out of London to visit Japan and China - where he is held in very high regard as a friend - Tony Blair spoke of his \"outstanding contribution\" and political courage. William Hague said he would be \"greatly missed\" while Michael Heseltine likened his European achievements to victory in the second world war. But Lady Thatcher, whom Sir Edward regularly denounced for 25 years, made no immediate statement. Though he aroused fierce loyalty among Europhile Tories like Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, Sir Edward was seen as a \"traitor\" and \"virtually a socialist\" by Thatcherite Tories. To them Europe and economic pragmatism were his great crimes. The decision by Sir Edward, 84, to step down at the coming general election - which had been widely predicted but never quite believed - came the day after he presided over a seven-hour process to elect Labour's Michael Martin as new Speaker of the Commons. Like much else in his career, Sir Edward's handling of the election had provoked both praise and criticism, much of it from MPs on both sides, who argued that he should have used his authority to change the rules - and get the 12-candidate election over with in two quick ballots. Last night he stressed that the timing of his decision had nothing to do with that controversy, but was tied to Conservative HQ's deadline of November 1 for older members to state their intentions for the coming election. In 1997 the amateur yachtsman and musician - who conducted great orchestras - had a majority of 3,569 (6.9%) over Labour, which will now try to seize the seat. Sir Edward's 50 years of unbroken service as an MP fell short of David Lloyd George's 54 years and that of his hero, Sir Winston Churchill, who served 62 years in all. Like Sir Edward, Churchill, who stayed an MP until he was 89, also rejected a peerage. In the 50s, Sir Edward had been one of Churchill's rising young stars. Colleagues at Westminster had said that Sir Edward's constituency activists hoped he would quit, but did not want to hurt his feelings by asking. He was still busy locally and yesterday Barry Fowler, his Bexley secretary, called him a \"national and international politician who never once forgot his constituents\". Beset by European problems of his own, Mr Blair struck a more ambiguous note. \"It was Sir Edward who took this country into the European community and he can be justly proud of that. Whether you agree with his views or not, no one is ever in any doubt what they are,\" he said.",

The company has previously limited itself to ads in the defence and technology trade press. Marconi now wants to reach out to ordinary consumers to convey its new image as a general IT company. The agencies were this week involved in first round presentations, and a decision on a final shortlist is expected shortly. In 1997, the electronics giant agreed a \u00a316bn deal to sell its defence electronics division to British Aerospace.",

Some times you gets what you pays for, of course, and it could be that Nu Wembley, with 150 corporate boxes and more toilets than any other international stadia, will be worth it. It could, however, also mean WNSL (chairman, Ken Bates) has got its sums wrong and may have even more trouble than anticipated in finding financing for the new home of football.</p> <p>The new figures are included in NMEC's - sorry - WNSL's own business plan, which arrived at City banks today. However, according to WNSL chief executive Bob Stubbs, there is nothing to worry about. \"The business plan has to look at the worst-case scenario, but even if that arises, we are confident we will raise the money and meet our commitments.\" WNSL are said to be looking for something in the region of \u00a3400m to finish the project. This they hope to secure via loans from the City, which in turn will be repaid via proposed ten-year debentures on seats which would allow people who like both football and Celine Dion to live out their wildest dreams.

      "bodyText": "Carlton Communications has confirmed that its airtime sales arm has picked up the contract to handle Scottish Media Group's \u00a3120m-a-year TV advertising business. Carlton Sales will take over the SMG contract, selling airtime for the company's Scottish and Grampian ITV subsidiaries, on January 1 next year, as part of a five year deal. Carlton will be conducting negotiations for 2001 advertising campaigns. Scottish and Grampian sales were previously handled by TSMS. The former United News &amp; Media sales house is being merged with Granada Sales, following the \u00a31.75m sale of United's ITV businesses to Granada Media. In order to get the deal cleared by the Office of Fair Trading, Granada gave an undertaking to the competition regulator that it would free the smaller ITV franchises from their airtime sales contracts. TSMS had handled the Scottish and Grampian accounts since 1994 and the existing deal was due to run until the end of 2002. SMG managing director Donald Emslie said the company held \"pretty thorough and extensive discussions\" with both Carlton Sales and Granada Sales before awarding the sales contract to Carlton. He added: \"We went with Carlton because of the deal that they offered in commercial terms and the services they could provide.\" He also said the deal was \"good news for ITV and advertisers, creating a balance in the marketplace between two equally strong sales houses\". SMG's total TV advertising revenues in the last full year reported, 1999, were just under \u00a3120m, with Scottish and Grampian accounting for 6.1% of ITV's net advertising revenue (NAR) in that year. Carlton Sales now handles 46% of ITV NAR with the addition of the Scottish stations. The outfit has also recently added HTV - which Carlton bought from Granada yesterday - to a client list that already includes the Carlton, Central and Westcountry ITV franchises.

      "body": "<p>They call her book \"the bible\", and its author \"Auntie Gina\". Her followers meet in small groups, usually over afternoon tea, to debate her teachings: some say they'd never have made it through without her, others that she has changed their lives. Occasionally, one of them will admit to having had a lie-in until 9am - and baby too - and they'll all giggle and admit that Auntie Gina wouldn't like that. No, she wouldn't like it one bit. </p> <p>These are the disciples of Gina Ford, mothers whose lives have been transformed by her Contented Little Baby Book - the book that has put routine back into the lives of Britain's parents. </p> <p>\"For years routine was a dirty word in childrearing,\" says Ford. \"But I believe passionately that there's no comparison between a baby who is demand-fed, and a baby who is in a routine from day one. Today's parents have been brainwashed into thinking it's damaging to let a baby cry for more than 10 minutes. But that's nonsense. </p> <p>\"The other problem today,\" she goes on, \"is that everything is regarded as 'normal': there's no one who will tell you when things could be improved and help you to change them.\" </p> <p>Until now, that is, with the advent of Auntie Gina. Her claim is that her followers are the happiest mothers in the country, and their babies are the happiest babies: because they are being raised the Gina way. Like Delia Smith's recipe for cheese souffl\u00e9, the Gina way never fails. Follow her advice about bedtimes and sleep times and feed times to the letter and you will not have a baby who is difficult, who keeps you awake or who cries endlessly for no reason at all. </p> <p>\"Gina's babies\", as they are invariably called by their delighted parents, are No Trouble At All. </p> <p>Auntie Gina is looking fairly contented herself today, as well she might given her runaway bestseller and a second book, From Contented Baby to Confident Child, about to join it on the shelves. There are other reasons to be cheerful: the website she's developing; the network of supporters she's setting up; and the endless TV offers (think Barbara Woodhouse and the Two Fat Ladies rolled into one). </p> <p>But being in demand is nothing new for her: until her new career as a parenting guru, Ford was so success ful as a maternity nurse that she became the Red Adair of the neonate. </p> <p>\"Some of my clients earned less than me,\" she says. Not many, though: some of her customers counted their annual earnings nearer the seven than the six-figure mark, and were she to name names (she won't), it would sound like the contents list of Hello! magazine. </p> <p>Ford fell into maternity nursing by chance. She used to babysit to boost her income while studying hotel management, and found she had rather a flair for looking after her charges. One of the families asked her to come and work for them, and Ford decided to give it a go. Ford has read her Penelope Leach and her Miriam Stoppard, but she is a self-taught expert who knows what she knows through watching babies. She might have left hotel management, but it has never quite left her: she watches the waiting staff like a hawk during our lunch, criticises and comments, sends back her main course, says it was never like this in her day. </p> <p>Babies, one suspects, come in for similar no-nonsense treatment: Ford is a bossy know-all rather than an empathetic supporter, a dictator rather than an enabler. She claims her schedules can make a woman into a confident parent, but the exact opposite would seem to be the case: she quotes mothers who phone to ask what to substitute for leeks in her recipes. She says some of her fans have begged her to write the follow-up book because \"they can't manage without it\". </p> <p>Does she like \"her babies\", as she calls them? </p> <p>\"What a naff question,\" she says, before claiming that she \"goes all gooey\" when she sees one. Yet Ford's philosophy is all about taming the little horrors, letting them know who's boss. You don't manage that by coming over all soppy and sentimental. </p> <p>Asked whether, as a non-parent, she's qualified to offer us pearls of wisdom, she is defensive. If you had a heart attack, she asks, would you rather be treated by a doctor who's had two himself, or one who's treated hundreds of heart-attack victims? </p> <p>You can see her intent: parenting gurus of recent years have invariably had their own children, and draw on their own experiences. This may be enriching, but it also limits them: Ford's proudest boast is that she's been in at the deep end with more than 300 families, and is able to draw on more experience of babies than most of her rivals on the parenting bookshelves. </p> <p>\"What I did in developing my routines,\" she says, \"was to watch the easy, settled babies, and to use the natural routines they seemed to be in as a blueprint for the babies who seemed more difficult to deal with.\" </p> <p>Every day, Ford says, she hears from dozens of mothers who love what she's done for them. Even her fans, though, concede that her routines are terribly complicated. \"You certainly have to work at it,\" according to one former client. Ford's instructions for breastfeeding a four-week-old are draconian: up by 7am, feed to be finished by 7.45am, nap in his room at 8.45am, woken an hour later, 25 minutes at the breast at 10am, play on his mat at 10.30am, in bed by 11.45am, awake again by 2pm, feed now but must be over by 3.15pm, walk at 4pm, next feed to be over by 5pm, bath at 5.45pm, feeding by 6.15pm, and \"fully swaddled and in the dark, with the door shut, no later than 7pm\". </p> <p>If only I'd known! My babies were breastfed anywhere and everywhere, stayed in a sling while I did the washing up, slept beside me on the sofa in the evenings before sleeping in my bed, and were blissfully unaware of what it meant to be swaddled. Ford seems genuinely amazed. </p> <p>\"All I can say,\" she says, \"is that you were very lucky. Not everyone has such easy babies as you obviously did. And not everyone works at home.\" </p> <p>In fact, I don't think my babies were particularly easy, but it is true that it's easier to dispense with routine if you're a home-based mother. Part of Ford's success is down to the fact that \"go with the flow\" mothering won't suffice for the large number of working mothers with small children. If you've got to be up and out by 8am for a hard day at the office you need to have slept for a few hours first. </p> <p>But if the Ford approach has its advantages, it also has its illusions. Babies aren't \"controllable\" as she would have us believe. There is no blueprint for parenting: you write your own rules and make your own mistakes. </p> <p>You also have to follow your heart, because childrearing is an emotional as well as a practical experience. But Ford is little interested in this: she believes love comes naturally, and doesn't need to be written about in books. For many new parents this is not the case: learning to love their baby is the most difficult lesson of all. It doesn't fit into any routine, but isn't this what matters most? </p> <p>\u0095 From Contented Baby to Confident Child is published next month by Vermilion.

For many new parents this is not the case: learning to love their baby is the most difficult lesson of all. It doesn't fit into any routine, but isn't this what matters most? \u0095 From Contented Baby to Confident Child is published next month by Vermilion. To order a copy for \u00a35.99 (rrp \u00a38.99) or The Contented Little Baby Book for \u00a35.99 (rrp \u00a38.99), freephone 0800 3166 102 or send your order with a UK cheque payable to The Guardian CultureShop, to 32-34 Park Royal Road, London, NW10 7LN.

      "body": "<p><strong> Ages 0-3</strong></p> <p><strong>Does a Kangaroo Have a Mother Too? by Eric Carle (Collins, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99)</strong></p> <p>After the joys of The Very Hungry Caterpillar, I was a little disappointed when I picked up Carle's Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? Thinking it rather dull and repetitive, it took me a while to realise that it was the repetition that was the point. In time, the book became a favourite with my children. Carle's latest is in similar style, full of the vibrant, patterned artwork that we've come to expect. The text is simplicity itself, taking the question in the title and substituting different animals from the giraffe to the dolphin. </p> <p>This is a book for chanting, for sharing between mothers and children and for finding out about all the creatures in the world. Ideal also for children taking their first steps in letter and word recognition. </p> <p><strong>Husherbye by John Burningham(Jonathan Cape, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99)</strong></p> <p>This is Burningham in classic form with a bedtime tale that is so snug, gentle and warm, it makes you want to rush off to bed immediately. Which is presumably the point. Books as the modern equivalent of the lullaby don't come more enchanting than this. </p> <p>Once again, simplicity is the keynote here, both in the everyday magic of the text and the simple drawings. Burningham actually manages to capture exactly what a fish looks like when it is heavy-eyed with sleep or how comfy the man-in-the-moon is as he settles down for the night. This is a book that, in the tale of the baby sailing a boat on the sea, the cat looking for a place for her kittens to stay and the goose who has been flying high, takes the reader on a journey from sleepiness to sleep itself. A book to bring the day to a close with a caress and a whisper. </p> <p><strong> Ages 4-7</strong> </p> <p><strong>Beware of the Storybook Wolves by Lauren Child(Hodder, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99)</strong></p> <p>Absolutely no apologies for reviewing another book by this writer/illustrator who has turned books for this age group upside down. Child makes words dance and topography jitterbug, and her sly sense of humour makes both children and adults giggle. This one is for anyone who has ever believed that there might be a wolf under the bed or has worried that the characters in books, particularly the nasty ones, might creep out of the pages and get you. </p> <p>At its most profound, this is about the tremendous power of books. At its silliest, it is about how wolves don't put toothpaste on their shopping lists and why they think jelly is for starters. Read this and your children will never look at Red Riding Hood the same way again. </p> <p> <strong>The Obvious Elephant by Bruce Robinson and Sophie Windham (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99)</strong></p> <p>\"Imagine a town, in a country, where a simple thing like an elephant had never been seen, or even heard of.\" That's the tantalising start to this completely enchanting and thought-provoking tale about an elephant that turns up in a town square one day. Nobody knows what to do with it. The people consider plugging it in, using it as a new kind of railway engine or vacuum cleaner. The elephant is not best pleased. Only a little boy called Eric knows what the elephant is and nobody will listen to him. </p> <p>Part of the joy of this book, written in simple prose and illustrated with magical pictures, is that it puts its young readers in a superior position to the silly adults in the story. But it is also a touching tale about friendship. This is the sort of book that both inspires and makes children think laterally. </p> <p><strong> Ages 8-11</strong></p> <p><strong>The Oldest Girl in the World by Carol Ann Duffy (Faber, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99)</strong></p> <p>So much poetry for children is just about jokes that scan. Duffy's is about living your life to the full. </p> <p>Between these pages are exquisite lives in miniature, a kind of distillation of experience. There are lullabies that remind us not to be scared because: \"The dark is only a blanket/ for the moon to put on her bed.\" Or morality tales about bad princesses who end up in the arms of dull young princes. It serves them right. Best of all are such transformations as that of 96-year-old Emily who throws off her clothes and the years and goes swimming: \"A poacher up to his tricks on the bank noticed her splashing away/Afterward, when they asked, she was young, was all he could say.\" Anyone could dive into this collection and surface with a pearl. </p> <p><strong>Polly's Running Away Book by Frances Thomas, illustrated by Sally Gardner (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99)</strong></p> <p>If you have any worries that your eight-year-old daughter is in danger of turning into a poppet version of Bridget Jones, you should hide this book. She will find it anyway. Sally Gardner's scrapbook-style illustrations have the chaotic charm of a child's treasure box crossed with what's underneath the average pre-teen bed - and they attract children at a 100 paces. This is one of the few books I've reviewed that has caused a queue of eager year fours to form. </p> <p>It is a first-person narrative, complete with misspellings, written by Polly, whose hamster has gone missing, whose mum is having a baby, and who doesn't like broccoli. This is as tough as it gets, but Thomas's writing is great on why it is the little things that seem big when you are in primary school. In truth, I found the whole thing just a bit too contrived, giggly and girlie. But who am I? </p> <p><strong>Ages 12+</strong></p> <p><strong> The Basic Eight by Daniel Handler (Allison and Busby, \u00a39.95; CultureShop price \u00a37.99)</strong></p> <p>The Basic Eight are 18-year-old Flannery and her pretentious, articulate, affluent clique of San Francisco high school friends. These are kids with Yale futures ahead of them, but circumstance, teenage hearts and adult failings conspire against them. Flannery commits murder - and the clique is classed as satanic and much studied by pop psychologists, worried parents' groups, self-styled experts and the makers of \"true story\" videos. </p> <p>This classy, clever and cheesy first novel, which takes the form of Flannery's diary, drips irony. It is very funny and very sharp - the biggest contribution to the high school murder genre since the movie Heathers. No doubt the film version is already on its way. Worldly-wise teenagers of 14 and over will covet it. </p> <p><strong>Awful End by Philip Ardagh (Faber, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99)</strong></p> <p>This is a book with character. To be precise, lots of incredible characters. Such as Gibbering Jane, the chambermaid who failed a bed-making course and has since lived in the cupboard under the stairs; Mrs Cruel Streak, who runs an orphanage; mad Uncle Jack and his even madder wife, who talks to her stuffed stoat. </p> <p>This scrumptious cross between Dickens and Monty Python tells the story of Eddie, who fails to heed his mother's warning not to be mistaken for a runaway orphan - lest he be taken to St Horrid's Home For Grateful Orphans, where he will suffer cruelty, hardship and misery. </p> <p> You can look at this book as an examination of: 1) the absurdities of the English language; 2) the absurdities of the 19th-century novel; 3) the absurdities of the way the English treat their kids; 4) the absurdities of the absurd. A child will enjoy its daft ness at 10, will get the references at 14, and will know that it is all true at 18. Brilliant. </p> <p><strong>Missing by Catherine Macphail (Bloomsbury, \u00a34.99)</strong></p> <p>Since her brother Derek went missing 10 months ago, 13-year-old Maxine has been feeling increasingly isolated and rejected. Her parents are so wrapped in their own grief that that she feels unloved and locked out. Their neglect sends her off the rails and into truancy. The situation isn't helped by Sweeny, the school bully who made Derek's life a misery and is now targeting Maxine. </p> <p>Macphail's story is a gritty, superior page-tuner. It creates a palpable sense of terror as a body is found and identified as Derek's, while Maxine starts to get mysterious phone calls from someone claiming to be her brother. As a thriller, it doesn't quite add up, but there is no doubting that Macphail captures the experiences of a teenager trying to cope in circumstances where the adults have copped out. Maxine is a credible, down-to-earth heroine and the story will hook the most reluctant reader. </p> <p>\u0095 Off the shelf can be used with the Guardian website (<a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk\">Books Unlimited</a>) to build a library of children's classics.

At six, I was particularly bad-tempered about having to tramp along the icy streets of Calgary carrying my loot bag up my neighbours' driveways with my beautiful nylon and coat-hanger wire wings crushed beneath my duffle coat. \"Fairies don't wear boots!\" I yelled before leaving the house that evening. </p> <p>Given that Hallowe'en came over with those 19th-century Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famines, it seems ironic that it is now understood as a North American tradition, fast gaining popularity in the UK.

The modern ritual has its origins in the ancient Celtic fire festival and New Year, the night when fairies would traipse through the land.

There were weeks during recess when we'd grill each other with, \"So, what are you going as?\" and then further time spent convincing a parent to stoop over a sewing machine or make a trip uptown to the department stores. Ghosts, cowboys, goblins, skeletons, fairies and monsters were popular. </p> <p>Hallowe'en was full of forbidden pleasures. Going out after dark with a bunch of other kids, getting a sackful of treats and having permission to pull a few \"tricks\" like wrapping trees in toilet paper or setting off firecrackers. But this misrule was balanced by churches and schools turning us all into UN volunteers. Every year, I took a Unicef collection box on Hallowe'en which we would shake at our neighbours who kept a stack of pennies ready on a tray next to the candy. While we gorged, we remembered the children of Biafra. </p> <p>There was a darker side to Hallowe'en, too. It flourished in \"real-life\" ghost stories, and urban legends about children who died eating apples that had razor blades embedded in their flesh or who went mad from drugged candy bars.

The biggest single influence over my daughter's excitement about Hallowe'en is her general infatuation with witches and wizardry, inspired by JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Hallowe'en themes are with us all year through television programmes such as Sabrina and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When we gave a Hallowe'en party last year, all 10 girls came dressed as witches, and \"playing Harry Potter\" is a favourite after-school game. </p> <p>The idea of trick or treat, however, seems alien here. The children who call at my south London home on Hallowe'en are rare and, even in those neighbourhoods where children fill up loot bags, the process is orchestrated by parents.

She receives many gushing testimonials, usually anonymous, along the lines of \"Thank you - you saved my marriage!\" and \"You made it possible for me to have a positive life.\" She is not, however, a marriage guidance counsellor or family therapist, but a successful businesswoman in a boom industry. Her company tests the DNA of parents and children in order to answer a heart-wrenching question apparently gnawing away at a growing number of men. Did they father the child they are raising? </p> <p>\"It's a very cathartic experience to learn that your child is really yours and your suspicions are unfounded,\" says Caskey, chief executive of Identigene of Houston, Texas. \"It's very common for fathers who get a positive result to burst into tears over the phone.\" </p> <p>Traditionally, DNA paternity testing has been sought by mothers trying to prove the fatherhood of men who are refusing to pay child support. The results, if positive, are used in civil court cases to force fathers to pay up. But over the past five years there has been a surge of applications from insecure American and, to a lesser extent, British men, anxious that their partners may have been less than faithful. </p> <p>\"About a third of fathers who come to us have their worst fears realised,\" says Craig Kelly of New Orleans-based ReliaGene Technologies, whose business has doubled since 1995. \"Some men are happy not to have to pay child support. Many others are devastated. But which is the greater tragedy for father and child: knowing the truth or not knowing it?\" </p> <p>Either way, their clients' anguish is good for business. There are now at least 40 major private testing firms across the US. According to the American Association of Blood Banks, which inspects accredited testing labs, the industry is growing by 11% a year, with more than 280,000 tests conducted in 1999. </p> <p>Business is growing in Britain, too. Seven private companies now offer a discreet service, while hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men have mail-ordered testing kits from US firms via their websites. \"Around 6,000 paternity tests are now conducted in Britain a year,\" says John Burn, professor of clinical genetics at Newcastle University, who in 1995 set up NorthGene, a non-profit company that tests about a hundred families a year. \"Most are done for legal purposes but more anxious fathers are also coming forward by their own choice.\" </p> <p>Half of a newborn's DNA is inherited from each parent, so a man can be ruled out as the father if his DNA markers are not found in \"his\" child. If their genetic patterns overlap, there is a more than 99% probability that they are father and child. </p> <p>Tests cost between \u00a3350 and \u00a3475 and can be done at home, or at a hospital or clinic, simply by taking a swab of skin cells inside the cheek. Samples do not need special packing and are couriered to the company's laboratory where they are amplified and then \"read\" by laser beam. The child's DNA is then compared, via computer analysis, to each parent's. Results typically take five to seven days and are posted, emailed or faxed to home addresses. </p> <p>While the procedure is relatively simple, the legal and social implications may be less so. An adverse result can shatter not only a father's emotional wellbeing, but that of the child he has brought up as his own. For this reason, some US states require that paternity tests are conducted very early in a child's life. For their part, testing companies require legal proof of parentage, such as birth certificates, before accepting a family. They also pass traumatised clients on to family support and counselling services. </p> <p>With genetic science progressing by leaps and bounds, the circumstances under which parental DNA testing is possible are becoming ever broader and more ethically challenging. Some US companies now conduct tests on amniotic fluid surrounding a foetus to determine parenthood. Identigene has also tested pregnant couples who used donor eggs implanted with the husband's sperm - just in case one of the wife's own eggs had been fertilised. In one recent instance, this turned out to be the case, much to the parents' joy. </p> <p>\"The technical barriers are falling very easily and the question of whether there should be any legal or ethical barriers is being left behind,\" says Professor Burn. Caroline Caskey concedes that firms like hers operate in a social minefield, but denies that they prey on people's insecurity. \"We offer a real social service. For example, fathers who are not bonding well with a child they are unsure of find out that they are the biological father and it paves the way for a much better relationship. Better to know for sure and then move on.\" </p> <p>Are there any instances when she would not recommend testing to parents? \"We have had cases where a woman has been a rape victim and has become pregnant soon after. She and her husband want to know that it's their baby. I think it is probably better they remain blissfully ignorant.\" </p> <p>The vast majority of the public, however, appears to be fair game. Identigene's effective but far-from-subtle advertising methods include a \"guess the father\" game on its website, which offers viewers pictures of a beaming baby and three potential dads. When I clicked on the correct face, I was told \"Lucky guess!\" and informed that many children don't look anything like their parents. </p> <p>The implication is clear: even if your child is the spitting image of you, there is always room for that tiny worm of doubt. </p> <p><strong>'It's better to know the truth': one father's story</strong></p> <p>Stanley Turner, 30, an electricity-meter reader from Memphis, Tennessee, is separated from his wife. He turned to Identigene after fearing that his three-year-old son Joshua, who lives with him, might have been fathered by another man. </p> <p>My wife and I got married a year after we had Joshua and then split up last July. Since we separated she has had numerous affairs and I became worried that Joshua might not be mine. I saw an item about DNA paternity test ing on a TV talkshow and I decided to have the test for peace of mind. Also, some of my family were saying they thought Joshua was not my son. </p> <p>He lives with me, I am his legal guardian, so we were able to do a test with just Joshua and me. They took cheek swabs at a local health clinic which shipped the sample off for testing. All I had to do was wait for a fax to arrive. It was very hard waiting. If he had not been mine, my heart would have been broken. Still, I think it's much better to know the truth, for the child as well as the parents. It gives the child a sense of stability he might not otherwise have. </p> <p>When the result came, it said that Joshua was mine and I was overjoyed. I don't like to think about how I would have felt with a different result. Still, I wouldn't have abandoned Joshua. His mother doesn't see him much and I'm the only father he has ever known. The test cost $500 (\u00a3350) and it was well worth it for my peace of mind.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sally Brampton, editor of women's magazine Red, is stepping down this week after being commissioned to write her fifth novel. Ian Birch, editor-in-chief of Emap Elan women's titles and a member of Red's launch team in 1998, will take over as editor from next week until a replacement is found. Ms Brampton, who was appointed editor in January, told staff in an internal memo: \"It has been a real joy editing Red and I wish the staff and the title every success for the future. \"I am now looking forward to my next novel and to possibly working with Emap on new magazine ideas in the future.\" Ms Brampton began her journalistic career on Vogue, going on to become fashion editor of the Observer. In 1985 she spearheaded the successful launch of British Elle. She was brought in to succeed Kath Brown as editor of Red in a bid to distinguish the first successful \"older\" women's magazine from the rash of new launches in the sector, including Eve, Nova and the now-defunct Parkhill magazine Aura.",

      "body": "<p>The current chairman of the Commercial Boat Operators Association had yet to be born when the last Labour prime minister left office in 1979. Andrew Burge is 20. And three-quarters. Like the fictional Adrian Mole, he has premises in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. But that's the only thing they have in common. Burge is a director of six companies, a dynamic character who believes passionately that more freight should be shifted on to Britain's under-used waterways. </p> <p>He recently wrote to the prime minister suggesting that they meet to discuss the possibilities. Alas, Tony Blair had rather more pressing concerns at the time. Bolshie hauliers and assorted hangers-on had just withdrawn their tankers from oil refineries after a week which had exposed the country's utter dependency on road transport. </p> <p>\"Has there ever been a better time to actively encourage water transport?\" Burge had asked. He asked it again in another letter, two weeks later, having received a standard reply from the Downing Street Direct Communications Unit. The barges' champion is nothing if not persistent - or cheeky, as he puts it. </p> <p>Unlike many of the boating fraternity, he is a young man in a hurry. He zips between Ashby and his other office which overlooks a boatyard on the edge of Tamworth, Staffordshire, in a 2.5 litre V-reg Rover 800 coupe. In fact, he travels 25,000 miles a year by car while campaigning for a more leisurely means of transport. \"Because of all the miles I drive,\" he says, \"I'm well aware of the queues on our motorways. I can't stand queuing.\" </p> <p>It would be unfair to suggest that he wants more lorries off the road simply so that he can get to meetings earlier. He has fond memories of childhood weekends on the family narrowboat, and he recently spent four days on a barge, conveying 20 tonnes of steam coal to London. \"I took it as holiday,\" he grins as we look out over the Tamworth boatyard which is rapidly expanding into an impressive marina, thanks to a major investment by his father. </p> <p>Malcolm Burge, 48, sold his parcel delivery firm, Captain Cargo, to the company which now calls itself Fastrack Parcels, and put some of the proceeds into water transport. Father and son have nine boats available for goods which, unlike parcels, are not time-sensitive. That's the area where Burge junior sees major scope for expansion among his 250 members. \"We're talking about cargoes like grain, timber, domestic coal and scrap,\" he says. And petrol? \"Certainly. You could get two or three lorryloads on to a big barge and pump it straight to the waterside from the oil refinery. Think of the advantages of that if these blockades become regular occurrences.\" </p> <p>One of several water transport trials involves moving 40,000 tonnes of petrol a year from the Humber estuary into Leeds, via the Air and Calder Navigation, in 210ft long barges. British Waterways estimates that, over five years, the scheme could take 16,500 tankers off the roads of Humberside and Yorkshire. To make the scheme possible, a new wharf had to be built in Leeds, financed by a \u00a3300,000 freight facility grant from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. </p> <p>The grants were set up by the Conservative government in 1981, when Andrew Burge was just one year old. Over the following 16 years, just \u00a32.29m was given away. Since Labour came to power in 1997, though, another \u00a39.82m has been awarded for road-to-water schemes. And in June, the DTER published a glossy document called Waterways for Tomorrow, in which the environment secretary, John Prescott, mentions the \"continuing scope for transporting freight\" by canal and river. </p> <p>Plenty of scope, for sure. Buried on page 41 is the revealing statistic that less than 1% of domestic freight is moved around the country by water. </p> <p>All the same, I suggest that Burge must sometimes feel as though he's pushing against an open door. He nods and acknowledges the change in attitude at the top. \"But I still think the government could do more in bringing interested parties together,\" he says. \"There are quite a few trials going on in various parts of the country, but those concerned need a bit more encouragement to make a leap of faith. They need to know that they're not alone in putting themselves on the line.\" </p> <p>Burge also feels that planning guidelines should take more account of the proximity of canals and rivers to new factories and warehouses, citing the Grange Park industrial estate in Northamptonshire. \"If they'd put it just a few miles down the road,\" he says, \"it would have been at the point where an arm of the Grand Union goes under the M1. At least it would have given companies an alternative to sending all their goods out on the motorway.\" </p> <p>The Grand Union could well have been filled in and covered with Tarmac by now were it not for a decision taken by a former Labour government, as Prescott points out in his foreword to Waterways for Tomorrow. \"Much of the system was under threat of closure,\" he writes. \"It is thanks to Barbara Castle that the waterways survived . . . Her bill, which became the Transport Act, created the structure that enabled the nationalised system to remain more or less intact and ready to meet the needs of the future.\" </p> <p>That was in 1968. Ancient history to young Burge. But if he has his way, another Labour government will oversee more productive use of a priceless legacy. </p> <p> Several trials are under way exploring the potential of canals and rivers to transport goods that are not time-sensitive. While petrol is travelling by barge from Humberside to Leeds, timber is being taken down the River Nene from Wisbech, near the Wash, to Northampton, and then by canal to other parts of the midlands. </p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer, meanwhile, have been sending waste paper and cardboard from their warehouse in Hayes, Middlesex, to a recycler in Birmingham, via the Grand Union canal. But more material than M&amp;S can supply is needed to make the project economically viable for the recycling company. Other retailers are likely to be approached in what could become a rare example of co-operation between competing supermarkets. </p> <p>Co-operation between seven local authorities in north and east London has seen domestic waste sent to an incinerator in Edmonton, via the River Lea. If the scheme is adapted into councils' management plans, British Waterways estimates there would be 45,000 fewer lorry journeys every year. </p> <p><strong> Unlocking the potential </strong> <br></p> <p>Britain's boat trip back to the future depends on a deep-seated nostalgia for the slower pace of the past, growing frustration at the problems caused by other modes of transport and a faith that a bastion of the industrial revolution can still offer cost-effective solutions in an age of new technology. </p> <p>Waterways executives claim the canals are seeing their busiest days for generations, made possible by a new political enthusiasm and a huge increase in funding options involving the national lottery, </p> <p>European aid, and the public and private sectors. The first new canal for more than a century between Milton Keynes and Bedford, a host of restoration projects - including one joining the rivers Thames and Severn - and regeneration projects revitalising city centres have been made possible. </p> <p>Birmingham, a veritable Venice of the midlands, was the herald for the renaissance to a golden age for the canals. And the modern demand for utility as well as the historic, cultural value bequeathed by Thomas Telford and other engineers, is answered not only by the growing tourist potential, landmark urban revamps, and still small-scale freight transport, but by the long-cherished but still under-used opportunities for solving water shortages. </p> <p>Next year the first contract to supply water from the north-west and Wales to the dry south-east is expected as British Waterways seeks to rival other big water companies. And in an evocative image of the lion of the hi-tech world of e-commerce lying down with the lamb of a once-threatened more old-fashioned conduit, hundreds of miles of fibre optic cable are being laid along canal towpaths. </p> <p>Add in the growing number of pleasure boaters, anglers, cyclists, ramblers and conservation volunteers treading towpaths (nearly 10m), and it is easy to see how tempting is the vision of a new golden age. But the 3m tonnes of freight now carried on the waterways remain a far cry from the heyday of the mid-19th century when 10 times that weight was carried on a 5,000-mile network started in 1757. </p> <p>The mileage of navigable rivers and canals is now only about 60% of what it once was, even if more is being unlocked by the week. It is a nice irony that the reopening of the northern stretch of the Lancaster canal will involve opening vistas destroyed by the building of the M6 in the 60s, for it was the new motorways, followed by the dreadful winter of 1962-3, as much as the railways, that killed the freight business. </p> <p>But this new drive towards green-tinged commercial operations brings its own environmental dilemmas and there may soon be tensions with some wildlife enthusiasts who believe the old backwaters provide refuge for flora and fauna. <strong>James Meikle</strong></p>",

The series won the award for a public information campaign, having prompted 15,000 calls to an information line set up to deal with viewers' concerns and to direct them to further sources of help. </p> <p>The best television documentary award went to Three Thin Ladies, a programme in the series, which profiled three older women who had eating disorders before the condition was understood.

Sitting in the waiting room at their local station, she noticed a woman who arrived mumbling to herself. She remembers, she says, thinking \"nutcase\". The woman walked on to the platform and there was the rush of an express train. When the family went out on to the platform, the woman's head was lying on the railway track. </p> <p>It was McAlister's first encounter with death. Hallucinations of the woman's head haunted her; she began to question whether she was living her own life or the life of the woman she had never met. </p> <p>In her characteristically direct way, she says: \"Well, it gets you down a bit, having this voice telling you how to die, and seeing heads fall out of the cupboard when you open it.

Ren\u00e9e has a very strong commitment to self-help, and welcomes the opportunity to move away from being stereotyped as a psychiatric patient.\" </p> <p>Now living in Brighton, where she is a well-known figure on the local poetry circuit, McAlister has built a reputation for her passionate, lyrical work. Nicky Mitchell, a jazz musician with whom she often works, appreciates the quality of her performance. \"It is almost a shamanic art to stay focused and fully present while delivering a performance, to allow oneself to be consumed with passion and be witnessed in it,\" she says. \"Ren\u00e9e has this art and power and has taught me to recognise it in myself.\" </p> <p>McAlister is committed to continuing her voluntary work helping others deal with their mental health issues. She says that recognition of the challenges facing mental health survivors is crucial if individuals are to feel more empowered to face their daily lives.

The annual awards, organised by training and resource group Mental Health Media, seek to foster good practice in the broadcast media's treatment of mental health, and aim to promote awareness, challenge stereotypes and stimulate debate. This year also saw the introduction of a \"survivor\" award, honouring not a programme maker but somebody featured in a shortlisted programme who demonstrates outstanding qualities as a positive role model. By far the most successful television production was a Channel 4 season, The Trouble With Food, a series of documentaries and short films on eating disorders. The series won the award for a public information campaign, having prompted 15,000 calls to an information line set up to deal with viewers' concerns and to direct them to further sources of help. The best television documentary award went to Three Thin Ladies, a programme in the series, which profiled three older women who had eating disorders before the condition was understood. It narrowly beat The Waiting Room, a Carlton documentary, about Ren\u00e9e McAlister, winner of the survivor award. The television drama award went to the first episode of Kid in the Corner, a Channel 4 series graphically demonstrating a lack of support for children experiencing behavioural problems.

      "body": "<p> Developing dementia need not mean going into residential care. But families do find the caring role a growing burden as the condition worsens. Now there is increasing interest in schemes to help carers cope with even the most severe cases. </p> <p>One scheme, in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has for seven years been offering a flexible, 24-hour respite service for carers of older people with dementia or mental illness. It has enabled hundreds of people to continue looking after loved ones while also leading a life of their own. </p> <p>Originally one of 15 projects funded by the Department of Health's \"caring for people at home\" initiative in 1992, Rochdale's plan from the start focused solely on the unglamorous issue of dementia care. By 1997, the project's \u00a3500,000 start-up funds had been fully allocated and a founding partnership with Age Concern had ended. But the scheme developed into an independent charity, Caring At Home, and its remit was extended to helping mentally-ill elderly people without carers. </p> <p>Educational psychologist, Anne Rushton, found the intervention of Caring At Home teams crucial in granting her the peace of mind to hold down her job while caring for her late father. As an only child, she was determined that Frank, 76 and suffering from advancing dementia, would not be packed off to a nursing home. Over a period of almost four years, the same team daily tended to the former research engineer. The team's input rose gradually from 15 to 28 hours weekly, for which the charge was latterly \u00a326 a week. </p> <p>Rushton says: \"Staff were so accommodating and responsive to my diabetic father's increasing requirements, and personality changes. He died on July 25. By remaining in his own home, under our joint supervision, he had the constant stimulation of familiar visual cues - he wasn't left sitting forlorn on some nursing home's orange plastic, wing-backed chairs. Dad could potter in the garden he'd always enjoyed, paint the shed - he tried to do the greenhouse too - go shopping and, basically, retain his dignity.\" </p> <p>However much you love your parents, says Rushton, dementia can tax family relations to the limit. \"The team restored my sanity and re-charged my batteries. They problem-solved as we went along. Regular risk assessments were taken so I knew dad was safe. I also knew, if necessary, his daytime respite hours could have been replaced by overnight stays. The service fitted round us.\" </p> <p>Stephen Netherwood, assistant director of Rochdale social services, sees the constancy of the project's management team and its meticulous recruitment and training methods as pivotal to the service's overall success. </p> <p>\"They do not take on someone one day and put them in the job on the next,\" he says. \"Their selection process is thorough and so staff are retained - which is vital for everyone concerned.\" </p> <p>Training, at \u00a31,200 a head, is intense. It is built upon with continuing updates, and turnover among the 22 support workers is minimal. To be eligible for the three-week induction course, workers must have at least two years' professional experience in dealing with older people with mental illness - if not some family experience of the situation. </p> <p>The scheme has been managed since its inception by Debra Collins, a former hospital discharge officer and psychiatric nurse. In the early 1990s, she recalls, home respite care services were already set up for people with physical impairments. \"Naturally, carers of older people with mental illness wanted the same choice. They believed if relatives remained within familiar home surroundings, their mental health would deteriorate less quickly. So these carers lobbied for the domiciliary service we put into practice in 1993.\" </p> <p>At present, Rochdale's support workers provide 75 clients with domiciliary care worth \u00a3240,000, 365 days a year. Many are also visited by the council's own home helps. Payment is banded and generally ranges from \u00a36.50 to \u00a326 a week. </p> <p>Confidence in Caring at Home is such that Rochdale council has upped its weekly contract from 350 to 500 hours. Extra funding has been provided for clients with early onset dementia. Caring At Home staff are available for three or four visits a day and of 10,000 planned visits since 1993, they have missed just two. </p> <p>National figures for the prevalence of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia indicate that one person in 20 will be affected by some mental disorder over age 65, one person in 10 over 70 and one person in five over 80. Although some people may be happy in residential care, others want to retain their independence as long as possible. </p> <p>But real life is a risky business at the best of times. In Rochdale, assessments of clients' changing circumstances are made collaboratively among social services, health teams, occupational therapists, families and Caring At Home workers. Problems of self-medication and failing mobility pose a daily challenge and may sometimes require very practical assistance, rather than emotional support and stimulation. One woman, for whom stairs had literally become a stumbling block, was still loath to face the final wrench of leaving her house for a nursing home. Solution: her staircase was blocked off and she was installed comfortably on the ground floor. </p> <p>While clients (and staff) must be protected from unnecessary hazards at all costs, the scheme's managers believe that precautionary measures should not place a stranglehold on older people's rights to continued independence. Simple changes to routine, adaptations and power-isolation switches for household appliances can resolve most problems and prolong independence at home - for those who wish it. </p> <p>Collins says: \"It's a matter of working through the risks and devising ways to minimise them wherever possible, so they are agreeable to the clients, family members and other professionals involved. Clients can then be empowered to retain some independence.\" </p> <p>Home care is taxing and not everyone's choice of provision for older people with dementia. But carers may be less discouraged by the undoubted difficulties if further schemes follow Rochdale's lead. </p> <p>\u0095 Caring At Home is on 01706-343300</p>",

One of its subsidiaries has been trying to build a giant waste incinerator in Guildford. Locals say it will be 230 ft taller than the cathedral, and is already blighting property values and threatening to pollute great areas of the city. So far, 5,000 protest letters have been sent to the Environmental Agency and Surrey county council planning officers and many people are exploring how to seek compensation. Should it ever be built, Eco soundings suspects the company will be as welcome as Shell in Ogoniland. The residents now hope the giant German company RWE, who have this week bought Thames, will see them right and decide to scrap the incinerator. Do they really equate Germany with greenness and social responsibility? </p> <p><strong> Dam and blast it</strong><br> </p> <p> As if pressure on the British government over the giant Illisu dam in Kurdistan was not enough, a team of fact finders from non governmental groups in Germany, the US and Britain has written to Stephen Byers of the Department of Trade and Industryasking it to withdraw support for the project which will make 78,000 people homeless, add to human rights abuses and drown an ancient city. Byers, who says he wants a new green industrial revolution, is not expected to be impressed. So what would change his and Blair's minds? Possibly, the World Commission on dams, which has been consulting widely on giant developments like this and is regarded by developers and environmentalists as pretty fair.If Illisu fails their test - and it's hard to imagine how it could pass - the government would not have a leg to stand on. </p> <p><strong> Efficiency drive</strong><br> </p> <p> It's energy efficiency week and a survey by the Energy Efficiency Trust says 79% of us Brits claim we have \"an environmental conscience\", yet only 3% consider the environmental impact of an electrical appliance as the most important consideration when shopping. In addition, even though we spend more than \u00a34bn a year on electricity in our homes, just one in three householders knows how much their bill is. So, in a bid to change the public mindset, the trust this week launches its \"Energy Efficiency Recommended\" label - a blue and orange affair - which should make it easy for shoppers to recognise the most energy efficient appliances.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Going for the burn Thames Water may be worth \u00a34.3bn, but its stock is very low in Surrey. One of its subsidiaries has been trying to build a giant waste incinerator in Guildford. Locals say it will be 230 ft taller than the cathedral, and is already blighting property values and threatening to pollute great areas of the city. So far, 5,000 protest letters have been sent to the Environmental Agency and Surrey county council planning officers and many people are exploring how to seek compensation. Should it ever be built, Eco soundings suspects the company will be as welcome as Shell in Ogoniland. The residents now hope the giant German company RWE, who have this week bought Thames, will see them right and decide to scrap the incinerator. Do they really equate Germany with greenness and social responsibility? Dam and blast it As if pressure on the British government over the giant Illisu dam in Kurdistan was not enough, a team of fact finders from non governmental groups in Germany, the US and Britain has written to Stephen Byers of the Department of Trade and Industryasking it to withdraw support for the project which will make 78,000 people homeless, add to human rights abuses and drown an ancient city. Byers, who says he wants a new green industrial revolution, is not expected to be impressed. So what would change his and Blair's minds? Possibly, the World Commission on dams, which has been consulting widely on giant developments like this and is regarded by developers and environmentalists as pretty fair.If Illisu fails their test - and it's hard to imagine how it could pass - the government would not have a leg to stand on. Efficiency drive It's energy efficiency week and a survey by the Energy Efficiency Trust says 79% of us Brits claim we have \"an environmental conscience\", yet only 3% consider the environmental impact of an electrical appliance as the most important consideration when shopping. In addition, even though we spend more than \u00a34bn a year on electricity in our homes, just one in three householders knows how much their bill is. So, in a bid to change the public mindset, the trust this week launches its \"Energy Efficiency Recommended\" label - a blue and orange affair - which should make it easy for shoppers to recognise the most energy efficient appliances.",

      "body": "<p>Cities are places of extremes - and an urban renaissance could make them more so. The very wealthy and the very poor often live as near neighbours, with walls, visible or invisible, in between. The gradual recovery of city centres has pushed up property prices far beyond expectations, making them unaffordable to all but a lucky few. Their density, night life, busy streets and original spaces make them highly attractive to some, but unsuitable or unattainable for others. </p> <p>City centres sit cheek by jowl with some of the poorest and increasingly abandoned inner-city neighbourhoods. People who cannot afford, or do not want, luxury city centre apartments, warehouse or canalside flats often reject the inner neighbourhoods that ring city centres and prefer to leapfrog to the quieter, safer, greener suburbs. </p> <p>But as land becomes scarcer and smaller households multiply, the poorer inner areas of London, Edinburgh and other successful cities gain new \"kerb appeal\". These large, under-exploited and often uncared for areas hold the key to affordable housing. They have capacity; they have surviving but struggling communities; they offer proximity, transport, amenities. They contain potentially valuable, already existing, mixed-use communities. They cry out for \"urban pioneers\" to help reclaim them and restore their vibrancy. </p> <p>To overcome the long legacy of social exclusion, cities must hold on to both richer and poorer residents. Their interests coincide. They both want good quality, spacious homes in a pleasant, safe environment, close to work, good schools, shops and transport. The two groups need each other. The original welfare state was built on this compact. So are cities. The rich pay in, and gain, alongside the poor - and both benefit. </p> <p>The voices of citizens are crucial to regenerating cities. People roundly rejected the old, over-dense, disease- ridden, filthy, impoverished industrial cities and fled if they could. But planners, largely without community consent, then decided to dismember our traditional compact urban patterns into ghettoised estates and suburban sprawl. Now people are beginning to come back, seeking a new kind of density - of services, leisure, new jobs, social contact and support. </p> <p>Mixed communities are hard to plan, but if we are serious about protecting the countryside and recycling buildings and \"brown\" land, they will occur naturally - within the inner areas of towns and cities where space, historic buildings and a close-woven pattern of streets offer boundless scope for new ideas. </p> <p>Citizens gravitate towards compact cities because they like their energy, opportunity, diversity and excitement, all of which are the results of close proximity. But attractive, integrated urban environments do not just happen. They are the product of choice, good design and sound organisation. </p> <p>Obviously, no one individual or group can pull it off. Cities require both collective action and a host of individual efforts - the special contribution of \"urban pioneers\". It requires not just vision and leadership, but architecture, engineering, social and communication skills. Buildings within existing streets and neighbourhoods can meet changing needs. They require, in addition to careful design itself, high quality craftsmanship, attention to detail, tight control of conditions, and long-term management. </p> <p>It is the rediscovery of the compact city, of the value of social contact and interchange, of the potential for reintegrating our fragmented society, that makes older, poorer city centres suddenly more desirable. Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle-upon-Tyne epitomise this shift of attitude. But it needs a strong social and political commitment, as well as careful design, to pull the different communities together and encourage a sense of shared citizenship, a desire to live as well as work in the city. The run-down inner areas that ring revitalising cores need the people who use the centre, otherwise they will empty and die. </p> <p>Can we stem the leapfrogging motion to new green field development? If city councils support local effort and devolve some resources and decisions to neighbourhood level, inner neighbourhoods can build up unique local centres with their own identity - real urban villages. Highbury, in north London, is a good example. These neighbourhoods will then attract residents working in the city who can contribute to their regeneration. At the same time, they can hold on to their traditional communities which will gain from the new growth. Shops and schools will stay open; street conditions will improve; empty, underused property will be renovated and bare spaces from earlier demolitions will be filled in. </p> <p>We need to work from the centre outwards, layer by layer, and start by reconnecting, restoring and repopulating the innermost neighbourhoods, which are only minutes on foot from vibrant centres. Helping people feel they have a voice in making their neighbourhoods work will relieve the sense of powerlessness that often makes city dwellers seek simpler, more peaceful environments. </p> <p>\u0095 Anne Power is professor of social policy at the London School of Economics.

It was on a brownfield site; it was well designed by Darbourne and Darke - leading architects of the day; it put the pedestrian first; and it was built to high density, with 200 bed spaces per acre (or 494 per hectare). </p> <p>In a deliberate contrast to 1960s tower blocks, the estate was designed as a series of streets and alleys of mostly family houses with gardens around a series of green spaces. In short, it was an environment that Rogers and Power are now calling for - \"dense but green\". </p> <p>The scheme was highly commended for good design in housing by the old Department of the Environment, and it was described as a \"magnificent showpiece\" by the then prime minister, Harold Wilson, when he came to open it. But, soon after, the Marquess became a disaster. It quickly gained a fearsome reputation as an area of high crime, with twice as much vandalism as anywhere else in the borough. Its tightly compact and intricate layout was seen as a major cause of crime and fear of crime on the estate. The police said the design \"lends itself to crime\". </p> <p>Rogers and Power now argue that \"denser and more compact urban forms\" provide more \"informal policing\" than lower density areas. But research by Bill Hillier, at University College London, found that the Marquess's compact layout meant that very few people walked through the estate. So, in this case, there was actually less self-policing because of the compact layout. </p> <p>The problems at the Marquess, which also included damp and noisy flats, became so acute that Islington took the drastic step of deciding to tear down 463 of the homes. It is now rebuilding the estate, on a more simple street pattern in partnership with Southern Housing Group (SHG). </p> <p>Renamed New River Green, the estate is being opened up to encourage more people to walk through. More homes for sale and shared ownership are also being provided in an attempt to promote a mixture of incomes on the estate. Housing minister Nick Raynsford gave his seal of approval to the \u00a322m project when he visited work in progress last week. </p> <p>What is interesting in the light of the call by Rogers and Power for more compact cities is that the remodelled estate now has significantly fewer homes. More than 150 of them are not being replaced in the rebuilding work. Teresa Shaffer, SHG senior development officer, says regeneration of the estate \"would not work\" without reducing the density. </p> <p>Raynsford, himself an enthusiast for high density, points out that density on the estate is still high - even with the loss of 155 homes. But he says: \"The Marquess was too large: it had a high concentration of poor families in close proximity, with no mix of tenures.\" </p> <p>Under new guidance from the Housing Corporation, the reduction in density at the Marquess would now be frowned upon. Egged on by the urban task force, the corporation now warns it will be \"very cautious\" about funding regeneration schemes that do not at least maintain the density of any demolished homes. </p> <p>If this guidance was to be rigidly applied, the type of refurbishment undertaken at the Marquess would not be possible. The same goes for the flagship regeneration scheme at Holly Street in Hackney, east London, which also involved a reduction in density. </p> <p>Simon Dow, deputy chief executive of the corporation, claims that the agency will be more flexible than the guidance suggests. But he says: \"We will challenge density a lot more than we have in the past. We are learning about trying to get more homes into the inner city.\" </p> <p>To avoid suburban sprawl, we need to get more homes into the inner city. This can be successfully achieved. As Rogers and Power point out, some of the most desirable homes in the country are built at high densities, from Kensington in west London to Edinburgh New Town.

But the experience of the Marquess estate shows that high density itself is no panacea. \u0095 Matt Weaver is news editor of Building Design magazine",

It was February 14, and he went into hiding after attending a memorial service for the writer Bruce Chatwin, at the Greek Orthodox cathedral in Bayswater, west London. Spring and summer were marked by marches, demonstrations and arrests, with protesters frustrated at their impotence to get legal redress because Islam was not covered by the blasphemy law. </p> <p>What has been the effect of those turbulent times? A Channel 4 documentary, Words of Fire, has asked some of those involved at the time what they feel has been the lasting effect of the campaign against Rushdie. </p> <p>Most of the protests and public burnings of The Satanic Verses took place in Bradford. Aki Nawaz, 27 at the time, grew up there, and was very concerned that the general British public did not realise that a grave spiritual offence had been committed by Rushdie. In the early 90s, Nawaz founded the punk rock band Fundamental, to carry the message of protest. Looking back, he reckons the reaction at the time was instinctive, frustrated and somewhat naive. He is still annoyed that there was no proper debate about the hurt which Rushdie's work had caused. \"We were willing, as grassroots people off the street, to talk about it, but there was no discussion,\" he says. </p> <p>The community was divided over what to do, and sought leaders of stature to put its case. Nawaz blames the author, the then Conservative government and even some Muslims for not arranging a forum. In the absence of a debate, some Muslims went along with the fatwa, even though they were not comfortable with it. </p> <p>If Islam faced a blasphemous attack today, Nawaz believes the reaction would be exactly the same. \"The community hasn't forgotten, and definitely hasn't come up with some liberal reason to forgive Rushdie,\" he says. Even now, he'd like to see Rushdie facing Islamic scholars in a TV debate. </p> <p>Apart from lobbying and marching, British Muslims - who began to identify themselves as such, as opposed to \"Asian\" - began to find other ways ways of setting their agenda: through popular culture (such as Nawaz's band); by setting up the self-styled Muslim parliament (intended as a separate, parallel forum to Westminster). A third strand was an interest in human rights for Asian immigrants. </p> <p>The parliament, with its specifically Muslim agenda, was a clever move, but it fizzled out after four years. It exists now only as a committee, meeting occasionally. At least now there are more Asians in mainstream Westminster politics, but the head of the Muslim Institute, Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, regrets that more have not emerged to argue their case. \"We still do not have philosophers, writers and journalists (to put our case),\" he says. \"It is time for such people to appear.\" </p> <p>Others disagree and say there is a rising group of movers and shakers in the professions, not least the media. Masoud Shajareh is a former member of the parliament, who thinks that its remaining rump is of no consequence. </p> <p>Shajareh believes that the Rushdie affair was a catalyst. It led to change in the community: in his case, this means he is now working for an Islamic human rights group. \"Because of Islamaphobia, Muslim issues are not getting a fair hearing,\" he argues. \"In the last 10 years, 70% of the victims of racially motivated attacks are Muslims.\" But, he maintains, enough protection is still not being provided. </p> <p>Many Muslims featured in the documentary still feel shocked at the hatred of Islam which surfaced a decade ago, on top of existing racism. The Satanic Verses was the first time the community had to put up with such an obscene attack on its values, says Siddiqui. And, as an unsure and marginalised group, it felt the refusal of British government ministers to act on its behalf was all part of a conspiracy. </p> <p>\"Muslims always accept that people will criticise their faith, but here was a book that hit below the belt,\" Siddiqui says. \"It wasn't an academic book.\" </p> <p>It's quite easy to find young Muslims who are critical of the community leadership a decade ago.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of Gypsies will go to the small Cotswold town of Stow-on-the-Wold tomorrow to keep an ancient tradition alive. Horses will be traded, crockery will be bought and sold and old friendships renewed. The last Gypsy horse fair of the year is a place to swap not just goods but gossip. </p> <p>One topic that is likely to arouse much passion are the attacks that have been made this summer on the dozen Gypsy horse fairs held throughout Britain. The fairs are the rural equivalent of the Notting Hill carnival to Britain's Romani ethnic minority - except you won't see any policemen dancing or singing. </p> <p>Policemen were marching on September 10 this year when a five-mile exclusion zone, complete with road blocks and armed units, was set up to ban the ancient Horsmonden horse fair in Kent. Local councillors, irritated by the disruption to the local community, banned the one-day fair, which has traditionally been held on Horsmonden's village green. </p> <p>Hundreds of Gypsies attempted to enter the village with horses and wagons, only to be searched and held up at roadblocks for hours. A solitary horse-drawn Romani vardo (caravan), which had evaded the police operation, led a protest march through the village. </p> <p>Eli Frankham, president of the National Romani Rights Association, organised the march. He is enraged at the way his people have been treated. \"My grandmother was born on Horsmonden green,\" he says. \"In an age when nomadic life is outlawed, fairs such as these bind our community together. They are the places we meet, trade and continue our traditions. The attack on this fair is a direct assault on the Gypsy community of this country.\" </p> <p>The Horsmonden fair doesn't only attract Gypsies. Ex-agricultural workers from the east end of London, who worked alongside Romanies in the Kentish hop fields earlier this century, stand alongside ex-rag and bone men whose passion for horses has outlived the demise of their trade. Together, they make up Britain's other horse culture. </p> <p>The fairs may not be as classy as gymkhanas, the Badminton horse trials or foxhunting, but they are a part of country culture no one from the Countryside Alliance is interested in. When horseboxes destined for a local gymkhana sailed through the roadblocks banning Horsmonden fair, Susanna Hersey, a Romani woman who settled in the village over 30 years ago, recognised double standards she has seen all her life. </p> <p>\"It makes me very angry,\" she says, \"I've lived and paid taxes here for 30 years. I've loved and attended the fair since I was a child, but this year many of my family weren't even allowed to come to my house on fair day.\" Susanna may have chosen to settle in the garden of England, but some roses, it seems, smell sweeter than others. </p> <p>The Horsmonden ban is only the tip of the iceberg in a campaign of cultural cleansing which Gypsies say is being waged throughout England. As the only Gypsy horse fair in the country without a royal charter guaranteeing its continued existence, Horsmonden fair was banned by a single parish council meeting. </p> <p>Getting rid of the larger fairs at Stow and at Appleby, in Cumbria, will require an act of parliament unless no one attends the fairs and the annual tradition is broken. Local authorities seem to have that end in mind as they continue a war of attrition in the form of court injunctions and police harassment. </p> <p>Stow-on-the-Wold has held its five-day fair ever since it was granted by royal charter in 1476, but a court injunction now threatens every trader with imprisonment if they camp overnight in the field in which it is held. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Cotswold district council, which took out the injunction, says: \"The object is not to discourage the fair, but to control the level of disturbance to local residents.\" </p> <p>Vera Norwood, the chair of Stow town council, disagrees. \"My personal opinion is that the Gypsies should be allowed to hold the fair without interference,\" she says. \"They own the field and should just be allowed to get on with it.\" </p> <p> The authorities' tactics range from misinformation about the dates of the fair, to the closing of public toilets and persuading local pubs to close when the fair is on. Similar tactics can be seen from Priddy fair, in Somerset, to Appleby. But the Gypsies keep coming; it will take more than a court injunction and a few closed doors to overcome the tenacity of the Romani people. </p> <p>Over the years the fairs have changed, but they have lost none of their social importance for courting or binding the far-flung communities together. And modern caravans and lorries have largely replaced the painted wagons visitors would have seen 30 years ago. Horses may be less useful these days, but they are vitally important to Gypsy families, from the Cotswolds to the Carpathians. </p> <p>Pride of place among the horses are skewbald and piebald cobs. They are robust horses that have been used by travellers for hundreds of years. Renowned for their good temperament, strength and versatility, they can be recognised by their distinctive black and brown and white markings, and their hairy, \"feathered\" feet. At fairs, travellers often shampoo and backcomb the feathers into a bush of hair that would turn Tina Turner green with envy. </p> <p>Tomorrow, in Stow, police permitting, Gypsy men and boys will show off their horsemanship as they have done for hundreds of years. They will ride and drive horses throughout the crowd without warning, scattering spectators everywhere. The chaos that follows might seem more suited to the streets of Spain than the quiet lanes of the Cotswolds, Kent or Cumbria, but England's increasingly sterile countryside would be a poorer place without it. </p> <p> <strong> Jake Bowers is a Romani</strong></p>",

The fairs are the rural equivalent of the Notting Hill carnival to Britain's Romani ethnic minority - except you won't see any policemen dancing or singing. Policemen were marching on September 10 this year when a five-mile exclusion zone, complete with road blocks and armed units, was set up to ban the ancient Horsmonden horse fair in Kent. Local councillors, irritated by the disruption to the local community, banned the one-day fair, which has traditionally been held on Horsmonden's village green. Hundreds of Gypsies attempted to enter the village with horses and wagons, only to be searched and held up at roadblocks for hours. A solitary horse-drawn Romani vardo (caravan), which had evaded the police operation, led a protest march through the village. Eli Frankham, president of the National Romani Rights Association, organised the march. He is enraged at the way his people have been treated. \"My grandmother was born on Horsmonden green,\" he says. \"In an age when nomadic life is outlawed, fairs such as these bind our community together. They are the places we meet, trade and continue our traditions. The attack on this fair is a direct assault on the Gypsy community of this country.\" The Horsmonden fair doesn't only attract Gypsies. Ex-agricultural workers from the east end of London, who worked alongside Romanies in the Kentish hop fields earlier this century, stand alongside ex-rag and bone men whose passion for horses has outlived the demise of their trade. Together, they make up Britain's other horse culture. The fairs may not be as classy as gymkhanas, the Badminton horse trials or foxhunting, but they are a part of country culture no one from the Countryside Alliance is interested in. When horseboxes destined for a local gymkhana sailed through the roadblocks banning Horsmonden fair, Susanna Hersey, a Romani woman who settled in the village over 30 years ago, recognised double standards she has seen all her life. \"It makes me very angry,\" she says, \"I've lived and paid taxes here for 30 years. I've loved and attended the fair since I was a child, but this year many of my family weren't even allowed to come to my house on fair day.\" Susanna may have chosen to settle in the garden of England, but some roses, it seems, smell sweeter than others. The Horsmonden ban is only the tip of the iceberg in a campaign of cultural cleansing which Gypsies say is being waged throughout England. As the only Gypsy horse fair in the country without a royal charter guaranteeing its continued existence, Horsmonden fair was banned by a single parish council meeting. Getting rid of the larger fairs at Stow and at Appleby, in Cumbria, will require an act of parliament unless no one attends the fairs and the annual tradition is broken. Local authorities seem to have that end in mind as they continue a war of attrition in the form of court injunctions and police harassment. Stow-on-the-Wold has held its five-day fair ever since it was granted by royal charter in 1476, but a court injunction now threatens every trader with imprisonment if they camp overnight in the field in which it is held. A spokesperson for Cotswold district council, which took out the injunction, says: \"The object is not to discourage the fair, but to control the level of disturbance to local residents.\" Vera Norwood, the chair of Stow town council, disagrees. \"My personal opinion is that the Gypsies should be allowed to hold the fair without interference,\" she says. \"They own the field and should just be allowed to get on with it.\" The authorities' tactics range from misinformation about the dates of the fair, to the closing of public toilets and persuading local pubs to close when the fair is on. Similar tactics can be seen from Priddy fair, in Somerset, to Appleby. But the Gypsies keep coming; it will take more than a court injunction and a few closed doors to overcome the tenacity of the Romani people. Over the years the fairs have changed, but they have lost none of their social importance for courting or binding the far-flung communities together. And modern caravans and lorries have largely replaced the painted wagons visitors would have seen 30 years ago. Horses may be less useful these days, but they are vitally important to Gypsy families, from the Cotswolds to the Carpathians. Pride of place among the horses are skewbald and piebald cobs. They are robust horses that have been used by travellers for hundreds of years. Renowned for their good temperament, strength and versatility, they can be recognised by their distinctive black and brown and white markings, and their hairy, \"feathered\" feet. At fairs, travellers often shampoo and backcomb the feathers into a bush of hair that would turn Tina Turner green with envy. Tomorrow, in Stow, police permitting, Gypsy men and boys will show off their horsemanship as they have done for hundreds of years. They will ride and drive horses throughout the crowd without warning, scattering spectators everywhere. The chaos that follows might seem more suited to the streets of Spain than the quiet lanes of the Cotswolds, Kent or Cumbria, but England's increasingly sterile countryside would be a poorer place without it.

      "bodyText": "ITV is planning to move its version of Match of the Day from its traditional 10.30pm slot to a teatime slot, according to Chris Evans. The Virgin Radio presenter blurted out what he claimed is ITV's secret plan for its own version of Match of the Day next year on his breakfast show this morning. Mr Evans told listeners that ITV intended to call its Saturday night Premier League highlights show All the Goals - \"ATG\" - and run it in the early evening, at 6pm or 7pm. The media mogul and DJ, who makes a habit of revealing media stories and gossip on his show, said he had been told the news yesterday by ITV controller of sport Brian Barwick. If confirmed, the proposals will cause havoc with the Saturday teatime schedules, traditionally the home of light entertainment shows such as Blind Date, Barrymore and Don't Try This at Home. A teatime slot would be a major gamble and could hand a major ratings advantage to BBC1. It would delight millions of football fans but could drive many female viewers away from Saturday night ITV altogether. An ITV spokeswoman said the broadcaster had not yet finalised plans for its Saturday night Premier League coverage. She said: \"We have not made a decision on the scheduling or the title of the programme.\" Mr Evans said Mr Barwick had only agreed to discuss ITV's plan for its Saturday night football show after the DJ first promised not to talk about it on the radio. The ITV spokeswoman disputed Mr Evans' version of events, saying Mr Barwick had denied the programme would be called All the Goals, or that it would be scheduled at 6pm or 7pm. Nevertheless, the relevation comes as a major embarrassment for the ITV sports chief, who is famously reluctant to speak to journalists. A Virgin spokeswoman said the pair had met by chance yesterday lunchtime at London restaurant Langan's, where Mr Evans was attending a party for the presenters and production team on his Saturday afternoon show, Rock 'n' Roll Football. ITV stunned the BBC earlier this year by snatching away the rights to Premier League highlights, which form the backbone of BBC1's long-running Match of the Day. Former Match of the Day anchor Des Lynam, now with ITV, criticised the BBC for scheduling the show so late on Saturday when he defected to ITV last year. Mr Evans said this morning: \"Football highlights, the biggest TV news on a Saturday night and [the BBC] were showing it at 11.30pm.

      "body": "<b>Why is the issue of safety in the news?</b> <br> Partly because last week's Hatfield crash was the third major train crash in three years, and partly because government ministers, rail passengers, MPs and industry insiders are all now concerned that privatisation has got in the way of the safe operation of the rail network. Sorting this out is a priority. <p><b>Are trains getting more dangerous?</b><br> No. Although the Ladbroke Grove accident killed 33 passengers last year - the highest total since the Clapham crash in 1988 - the overall number of significant incidents (such as derailments) fell to the lowest-ever total. Only 67 such incidents took place on the Railtrack property last year, compared with 118 in 1993-94. The current alarm about safety has been generated by three high-profile accidents: at Southall in 1998, at Ladbroke Grove in 1999 and at Hatfield in October 2000. All appear to have been easily avoidable and many believe that, without privatisation, they would not have occurred.</p> <p><b>Why is privatisation being blamed?</b> Because the process gave many different organisations a stake in rail safety and no single body seems to be in command.</p> <p><b>So which organisations are involved?</b> At the top of the list is Railtrack, which operates and maintains the rails on which trains run, as well as some large stations. It has a commercial interest in cutting costs. But it is also responsible for keeping track in an acceptable condition, although it does little maintenance itself. This is done by private contractors, such as Balfour Beatty, which was due to repair the track at Hatfield before the accident. Meanwhile, the trains are run by a host of different companies, all of which want to both run their trains safely and offer a quick, reliable service. This can produce contradictions, such as Scotrail's anger at Railtrack's decision to close parts of the West Coast main line for repair.</p> <p>On top of these private companies, official organisations also have a stake in preventing accidents. Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate monitors incidents, approves new equipment for use by rail companies and investigates accidents. The rail regulator, Tom Winsor, who supervises the performance of private rail firms, is also involved. So is the newly-established Strategic Rail Authority, which is intended to \"encourage investment and manage the passenger rail franchises\" under the guidance of its chief executive, Sir Alistair Morton. Finally, the government sits at the top of the heap, with the secretary of state for transport, John Prescott, setting overall policy on rail safety, footing many of the bills and answering for it in the House of Commons.</p> <p><b>Sounds confusing\u0085</b> It is, and that is what worries safety campaigners.

      "bodyText": "Why is the issue of safety in the news? Partly because last week's Hatfield crash was the third major train crash in three years, and partly because government ministers, rail passengers, MPs and industry insiders are all now concerned that privatisation has got in the way of the safe operation of the rail network. Sorting this out is a priority. Are trains getting more dangerous? No. Although the Ladbroke Grove accident killed 33 passengers last year - the highest total since the Clapham crash in 1988 - the overall number of significant incidents (such as derailments) fell to the lowest-ever total. Only 67 such incidents took place on the Railtrack property last year, compared with 118 in 1993-94. The current alarm about safety has been generated by three high-profile accidents: at Southall in 1998, at Ladbroke Grove in 1999 and at Hatfield in October 2000. All appear to have been easily avoidable and many believe that, without privatisation, they would not have occurred. Why is privatisation being blamed? Because the process gave many different organisations a stake in rail safety and no single body seems to be in command. So which organisations are involved? At the top of the list is Railtrack, which operates and maintains the rails on which trains run, as well as some large stations. It has a commercial interest in cutting costs.

      "body": "<p><strong>West Indies</strong></p> <p> The <strong> Windward Islands </strong> won their first Red Stripe Bowl since 1989 after defeating the <strong> Leeward Islands </strong> by five wickets in the final at Sabina Park, Kingston. In a slightly disappointing finale to the competition, the Leeward Islands elected to bat after winning the toss, and reached 61 without loss in the 19th over, thanks to <strong> Wilden Cornwall</strong>, who finished with 53, and <strong> Stuart Williams </strong> (28). It was all downhill from there, though, as this turned out to be easily the highest partnership of the match. The Leewards collapsed to 109-7 before scraping their way to 163-8 off their 50 overs, thanks to a late 28 from captain <strong> Ridley Jacobs</strong>. <strong> Rawl Lewis </strong> was the best of an effective, if hardly spectacular, Windwards attack with 3-31. The Windwards started confidently but were struggling at 55-3 before <strong> Junior Murray </strong> (30), named Man of the Series, put on a quick 31 with <strong> John Eugene </strong> (13). They were followed by their captain Lewis (23*) and <strong> Roy Marshall</strong>, who top-scored for the Windwards with 36*. These two played sensibly to ease their side home with more than seven overs to spare.</p> <p><strong> Leeward Islands* </strong> 163-8 (50 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands </strong> 164-5 (42.5 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands won by 5 wickets </strong> </p> <p> Earlier, in a semi-final notable for poor batting on both sides, the <strong> Leeward Islands </strong> had beaten <strong> Barbados </strong> by 13 runs to advance to their fourth consecutive final. After being asked to bat the Leewards tottered to 169 all out, the only significant contribution coming from a seventh-wicket partnership between wicketkeeper-captain <strong> Ridley Jacobs </strong> (44) and <strong> Carl Tuckett </strong> (39). One-time West Indies one-day player <strong> Hendy Bryan </strong> took 3-25. With a required run-rate of only 3.4 Barbados should have had the match under control, but it was not to be. Wickets fell regularly as they slumped to 156 all out, with <strong> Wilden Cornwall </strong> taking 3-25.</p> <p><strong> Leeward Islands </strong> 169 (49.5 overs)<br> <strong> Barbados* </strong> 156 (48.4 overs)<br> <strong> Leeward Islands won by 13 runs </strong> </p> <p>Under-par batting was also a feature of the second semi-final, which had resulted in a four-wicket win for the <strong> Windward Islands</strong> over <strong> Jamaica</strong>. After winning the toss Jamaican captain <strong> Jimmy Adams </strong> elected to bat, a decision which soon backfired as his side collapsed to 9-3 after 7 overs. Jamaica were forced to struggle for every run against some fine bowling, particularly from <strong> Nixon McLean </strong> (4-28), and eventually reached 187-9. <strong> Marlon Samuels </strong> (52) was the only player to get past 20. In reply the Windward Islands lost wickets regularly but never looked in serious trouble as they overhauled their target in the 49th over. Their major scorers were <strong> John Eugene </strong> (44*) and <strong> Junior Murray </strong> (42).</p> <p><strong> Jamaica* </strong> 187-9 (50 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands </strong> 191-6 (48.2 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands won by 4 wickets </strong> </p> <p> There were no shocks in the final set of group matches. Following their amazing defeat of <strong> Barbados</strong>, the <strong> USA </strong> capitulated to 62 all out against <strong> Trinidad and Tobago</strong>, who took only 5.1 overs to reach their target. The <strong> Cayman Islands </strong> were the only team in the competition to finish with no points, following their six-wicket defeat by the <strong> Windward Islands</strong>. After a scare in which they lost their last six wickets for 41 runs, all to <strong> Davis Joseph</strong>, <strong> Jamaica </strong> easily overcame <strong> Canada </strong> by 91 runs.</p> <p><strong> USA </strong> 62 (35.2 overs)<br> <strong> Trinidad and Tobago* </strong> 65-1 (5.1 overs)<br> <strong> Trinidad and Tobago won by 9 wickets </strong> </p> <p><strong> Cayman Islands* </strong> 103 (43.1 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands </strong> 104-4 (24 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands won by 6 wickets </strong> </p> <p><strong> Jamaica* </strong> 226 (50 overs)<br> <strong> Canada </strong> 135 (46.3 overs)<br> <strong> Jamaica won by 91 runs </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Pakistan </strong> </p> <p><strong> Gujranwala </strong> scraped their way past a modest target to defeat <strong> Lahore Blues </strong> in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Grade I at the LCCA Ground in Lahore.

Griqualand had notched up 427-4 in their first innings, with a career-best 165 from <strong> Mickey Arthur </strong> which included one six and 27 fours. He put on a club record first-wicket partnership of 254 with <strong> Martin Gidley </strong> (86), and they were backed up by <strong> Pieter Koortzen </strong> (82*) and <strong> Wendell Bossenger </strong> (72*). In reply Gauteng crumbled to 184 all out, with Koenig scoring more than half the runs. Legspinner <strong> Craig Copeland </strong> was the chief destroyer for GW, taking 5-52. After being asked to follow on, Koenig looked to be all that was standing between Gauteng and an embarrassing defeat against last year's wooden-spoonists, and he replied by scoring 108, his fifth first-class century, while occupying the crease for a shade over six hours.

      "bodyText": "West Indies The Windward Islands won their first Red Stripe Bowl since 1989 after defeating the Leeward Islands by five wickets in the final at Sabina Park, Kingston. In a slightly disappointing finale to the competition, the Leeward Islands elected to bat after winning the toss, and reached 61 without loss in the 19th over, thanks to Wilden Cornwall, who finished with 53, and Stuart Williams (28). It was all downhill from there, though, as this turned out to be easily the highest partnership of the match. The Leewards collapsed to 109-7 before scraping their way to 163-8 off their 50 overs, thanks to a late 28 from captain Ridley Jacobs. Rawl Lewis was the best of an effective, if hardly spectacular, Windwards attack with 3-31. The Windwards started confidently but were struggling at 55-3 before Junior Murray (30), named Man of the Series, put on a quick 31 with John Eugene (13). They were followed by their captain Lewis (23*) and Roy Marshall, who top-scored for the Windwards with 36*. These two played sensibly to ease their side home with more than seven overs to spare. Leeward Islands* 163-8 (50 overs) Windward Islands 164-5 (42.5 overs) Windward Islands won by 5 wickets Earlier, in a semi-final notable for poor batting on both sides, the Leeward Islands had beaten Barbados by 13 runs to advance to their fourth consecutive final. After being asked to bat the Leewards tottered to 169 all out, the only significant contribution coming from a seventh-wicket partnership between wicketkeeper-captain Ridley Jacobs (44) and Carl Tuckett (39). One-time West Indies one-day player Hendy Bryan took 3-25. With a required run-rate of only 3.4 Barbados should have had the match under control, but it was not to be. Wickets fell regularly as they slumped to 156 all out, with Wilden Cornwall taking 3-25. Leeward Islands 169 (49.5 overs) Barbados* 156 (48.4 overs) Leeward Islands won by 13 runs Under-par batting was also a feature of the second semi-final, which had resulted in a four-wicket win for the Windward Islands over Jamaica. After winning the toss Jamaican captain Jimmy Adams elected to bat, a decision which soon backfired as his side collapsed to 9-3 after 7 overs. Jamaica were forced to struggle for every run against some fine bowling, particularly from Nixon McLean (4-28), and eventually reached 187-9. Marlon Samuels (52) was the only player to get past 20. In reply the Windward Islands lost wickets regularly but never looked in serious trouble as they overhauled their target in the 49th over. Their major scorers were John Eugene (44*) and Junior Murray (42). Jamaica* 187-9 (50 overs) Windward Islands 191-6 (48.2 overs) Windward Islands won by 4 wickets There were no shocks in the final set of group matches. Following their amazing defeat of Barbados, the USA capitulated to 62 all out against Trinidad and Tobago, who took only 5.1 overs to reach their target. The Cayman Islands were the only team in the competition to finish with no points, following their six-wicket defeat by the Windward Islands. After a scare in which they lost their last six wickets for 41 runs, all to Davis Joseph, Jamaica easily overcame Canada by 91 runs. USA 62 (35.2 overs) Trinidad and Tobago* 65-1 (5.1 overs) Trinidad and Tobago won by 9 wickets Cayman Islands* 103 (43.1 overs) Windward Islands 104-4 (24 overs) Windward Islands won by 6 wickets Jamaica* 226 (50 overs) Canada 135 (46.3 overs) Jamaica won by 91 runs Pakistan Gujranwala scraped their way past a modest target to defeat Lahore Blues in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Grade I at the LCCA Ground in Lahore. Needing just 175 in their second innings, the Gujranwala openers got off to a brisk start with a partnership of 58 between Imran Abbas (26) and debutant Attiq-ur-Rehman (36), but were reduced to 108-6 before Asim Munir (30*) and Kamran Younas (23) steered them out of trouble. Lahore Blues had previously been dismissed for 179 and 212, the highlight of their second innings being a patient 73 from Farid Butt. After being reduced to 120-5, Gujranwala made 217 in their first innings with left-arm spinner Mohammad Hussain taking 5-54.

Our favourite Indian/Bangladeshi/Sylheti dish is chicken tikka masala. Most Indians, Bangladeshis and Sylhetis would run a mile rather than eat it. 7. We are also extremely keen on balti dishes, steeped as they are in centuries of exotic oriental mystery. Another theory is that they first saw the light of day in Birmingham in the 1950s. 8. Most of the stuff \"Indian\" restaurants turn out bears not the slightest resemblance to real south Asian food. For that, you have to go sharply upmarket to wonderful places like the Red Fort in Soho, or Chutney Mary in Fulham. 9. Or make it youself. Here are a few recipes to start you off. For more, try any of the splendidly anecdotal books by Madhur Jaffrey, the original spice girl. 10. It's National Curry Day on November 7.",

In the earliest stages of intoxication, the will power is destroyed and inhibitions and restraints are released; the moral barricades are broken down and often debauchery and sexuality result. Where mental instability is inherent, the behaviour is generally violent. An egotist will enjoy delusions of grandeur, the timid individual will suffer anxiety, and the aggressive one often will resort to acts of violence and crime. Dormant tendencies are released . . . Constant use produces an incapacity for work and a disorientation . . . often leading to insanity after prolonged use.</p> <p>Anslinger's claims have been endorsed by high officials ever since. \"There is not a shred of scientific evidence that shows that smoked marijuana is useful or needed,\" declared the former US drugs czar General Barry McCaffrey in 1996. \"This is not a medicine. This is a cruel hoax.\" Our own home secretary endorsed this line after his son's arrest for a drug offence in 1997. Ann 'zero-tolerance' Widdecombe is even more opposed to it (except, it seems, when used by shadow cabinet colleagues and other supposedly 'educated, articulate people').</p> <p>Anslinger was lying. In The Science of Marijuana, Leslie Iversen has produced the most authoritative and up-to-date scientific assessment of the medical uses of cannabis now available. He recalls that cannabis was recommended for the treatment of constipation, gout, malaria, rheumatism and menstrual problems in a Chinese compendium of herbal medicines published around 2800 BC. It was a medicament in many subsequent cultures. Difficulties in standardising cannabis preparations meant, however, that it was not widely used in 19th-century western medicine. Even so, in 1937, when its medical use was suppressed in the US, there were 28 different medicines in which it was an ingredient. In 1964 came confirmation that virtually all the pharmacological activity in hashish extracts is attributable to one compound, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Later, the existence of specific receptors for cannabinoids in the brain and other tissues was established.</p> <p>Early in the 1970s the US Drugs Enforcement Agency was petitioned to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug which could be prescribed by physicians. Finally, in 1986, after prolonged legal tussles, the DEA agreed to public hearings on the petition. The hearings lasted for more than two years. Despite the DEA's legal expert recommending the rescheduling, and his conclusion that cannabis is \"one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man\", the DEA denied the petition. Iversen refers to a 1990 finding that 44 per cent of US oncologists had suggested that a patient smoke marijuana for relief of the nausea induced by chemotherapy. If the drug were really unsafe for use even under medical supervision, as its Schedule I status affirms, this recommendation would have been unthinkable.</p> <p>Despite the DEA's obstruction, the discovery of the cannabinoid control system in the body has revitalised scientific research. Two synthetic cannabinoids have become available on prescription to patients in Europe and the US. The annual sales of dronabil (sold under the trade name of Marinol) in the US are estimated to be worth about $20 million: some 80 per cent of prescriptions are as an appetite stimulant for people with Aids or HIV, 10 per cent to counteract the nausea associated with chemotherapy and 10 per cent for other purposes. The Eli Lilly Company has developed nabilone: under the trade name of Cesamet it, too, is used to treat nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy, although it also gave promising results in clinical trials in the treatment of anxiety. In addition, many patients with multiple sclerosis have reported benefiting from smoking cannabis. The possibility of its use in the treatment of glaucoma and epilepsy is being looked into.</p> <p>During 1997, the American Medical Association recommended controlled clinical trials on the medical uses of smoked marijuana, and the BMA recommended trials of synthetic cannabinoids. The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee reported in 1998 that more clinical research was needed, but recommended the drug's rescheduling to permit its medical use. A year later, the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine urged that its therapeutic use in pain relief, control of nausea and appetite stimulation be further investigated. New clinical trials will probably soon be underway in Europe and the US, and I don't doubt from the evidence laid out by Iversen that they will yield positive data. It will then be hard for governments to refuse approval for the medical use of cannabis or cannabinoids. </p> <p>\"The argument that approval of the medical use of cannabis would be tantamount to encouraging the legalisation of the drug for all purposes is clearly specious,\" Iversen concludes, \"and is no justification for withholding an effective medicine from patients who need it.\" Such ideas were anathema to the egregious McCaffrey. \"There could be no worse message to young people,\" he insisted. \"Just when the nation is trying its hardest to educate teenagers not to use psychoactive drugs . . . they are being told that marijuana is a medicine.\"</p> <p>Many other psychoactive drugs have a recognised place in European medicine notwithstanding the dangers of misuse. Heroin is the foremost example. Despite Congressman Stephen Porter's disastrous Act of 1924 prohibiting its medical use in the US, European countries resisted postwar American pressure (directed through the United Nations) to impose this ban globally. An attempt under the Eden Government in 1955 to prohibit its medical use in Britain was defeated by a House of Lords rebellion led by the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, supported by a number of medical peers.</p> <p>One of the virtues of William McAllister's meticulously researched history of 20th-century drugs diplomacy is to highlight the source of most national drug regulatory systems in the series of international conferences on the subject held since 1912. Summaries of diplomatic proceedings, or of the Conventions they produce, can make dry reading, but McAllister brings a wry humour to his subject. The book is indispensable to understanding the drug controls and policing of the world in 2000; among many rich details, it gives disturbing insights into the influence of pharmaceutical companies on global policy. At the crucial Conference on Psychotropic Substances held in Vienna in 1971, several key delegations, including the US delegation, were infiltrated by company executives defending their freedom to sell amphetamines and barbiturates with minimal regulation. The mystery as to why the spokesman for six Latin American countries opposing tight regulations spoke only broken Spanish was solved when he was discovered to be a Swiss employee of Hoffman-LaRoche.</p> <p>McAllister's is an international history, drawing on diplomatic archives: he does not go into detail on the home office's troubled relations with cannabis. The home office first took notice of what was then known as Indian hemp in 1922, when it was sent a substance found in the coalshed of an Egyptian coffee-house keeper in South Shields. The home office confirmed to the chief constable that on analysis the substance proved to be 'hasheesh', which was not covered by the Dangerous Drugs Act (DDA) of 1920. Next, in 1923, ten tons of cannabis resin en route from Bombay to Djibouti were detained: the shipper was Henri de Monfreid, whose memoir La Croisiere du Hachich (1935) - in English translation, Hashish: A Traveller's Tale (1994) - is a splendid introduction to the subject of trafficking and drugs regulations. The home office was consulted before Monfreid's shipment was allowed to proceed. Shortly afterwards, two waiters, one Italian and the other Sudanese, were arrested in Old Compton Street and accused of offering to supply raw opium. In fact, the brown substance in their possession was hashish, which it was then legal to possess, and the case was abandoned. But it provided the excuse for an alarmist series of cheap newspaper articles in the silly season - including a supposed interview in the Daily Mail with a home office official - in the relevant file in the Public Record Office the official in question has written the word 'Liar!' in the margin. On the strength of the hoo-ha metropolitan police recommended the incorporation of cannabis in the Dangerous Drugs Act, one CID officer advising that cannabis \"has practically the same effect as cocaine and morphine upon its victims\". </p> <p>Even the Met was not optimistic about the success of prohibition: the \"only result\" of prohibiting the drug in Egypt had been \"an increase of price to its consumers\". The home office did not want to legislate, but foresaw that \"the prevalence of the vice in Egypt\" - despite prohibition there - might result in 'international regulation of the drug'. This was prescient. A month later, the Egyptian ministry of the interior concluded that as it was \"practically impossible to keep hashish out of Egypt . . . the League of Nations should consider hashish as an international affair and should try to persuade its members to make dealing in or consuming the drug a crime punishable by severe penalties.\"</p> <p>Consequently, at the Geneva Conference on Opium of 1924-25, Egypt's delegate proposed bringing hashish within the Hague Convention of 1912. His memorandum, circulated to support this proposal, represented it as \"a dangerous narcotic . . . more harmful than opium\", and stated that \"about 70 per cent of insane people in lunatic asylums in Egypt are haschiche eaters or smokers.\" Congressman Porter, the monomaniacal leader of the US delegation, was keen on this initiative. \"We are asking them to help us to destroy the vice of opium, coca leaves and their derivatives,\" he declared of the Egyptians. \"This is a good time to practise a little reciprocity. They have their troubles and we have ours.\"</p> <p>The contracting powers at the Geneva Conference accordingly agreed in 1925 to prohibit the import and export of Indian hemp except for certified medical or scientific purposes. In Britain, cannabis was immediately rescheduled as a poison, with effect from April 1925. A few months later, a new DDA brought Britain into line for the ratification of the Geneva Convention. The House of Commons debate on the Bill lasted less than five minutes: Indian hemp, or cannabis, was not mentioned once. The House of Lords debate was slightly longer. Peers followed the advice of Lord Haldane that, as it was \"impossible to form any judgment on the details of the Bill\", it should \"be taken by the House to a large extent on trust\". It was on this slipshod basis that cannabis was criminalised.</p> <p>This might not have mattered much had it not been for the enduring effects of Prohibition in the US. Cannabis was listed in the US Pharmacopoeia as a recognised medicine from 1850 until 1942. It was sold cheaply by drugstores in the form of fluid extracts, and was smoked in cigarette form by asthmatics. Between 1900 and 1920 it began to be used on a limited scale as a recreational drug by immigrant labourers from Mexico and the Caribbean. Its consumption was enormously increased after the 18th Amendment - prohibiting alcohol - came into force in 1920. Alcohol became more difficult to obtain, more expensive and often of poor quality. In urban centres 'tea pads' operating like speakeasies provided cheap marijuana. In 1944, Mayor La Guardia's Committee on Marijuana estimated that there had been five hundred 'tea pads' in New York City by the 1930s.</p> <p>The mass marketing of marijuana for recreational use was the result of bad law-making. Congressman Porter's response to the Egyptians at Geneva showed that cannabis was not then regarded as a problem by anti-drugs propagandists in the US. It first received public attention in a series of sensationalised and false reports in the New Orleans press in 1926 involving drug-crazed black marijuana users and corrupted schoolchildren. By 1931, all but two states west of the Mississippi and several others in the East had made a criminal offence of the possession or use of cannabis. By 1937, every state had outlawed the drug under legislation allowing no distinction between physiologically addictive narcotics such as heroin, habit-forming stimulants like cocaine, and hallucinogens. Anslinger felt that his agents at the Bureau of Narcotics were overstretched coping with opiates without having to suppress a drug that could be easily grown in many states of the Union. He accepted then that \"the marijuana addict\" did not \"graduate into a heroin, an opium or a cocaine user\".</p> <p>Once he'd decided that he would have to submit to political pressure for a Federal law to be passed against marijuana, he did so in a manner calculated, not untypically, to strengthen his own position and that of the Bureau. He strenuously supported the Marijuana Tax Bill. \"How many murders, suicides, robberies, criminal assaults, hold-ups, burglaries and deeds of maniacal insanity it causes each year, especially among the young, can only be conjectured,\" he said, assuring the House of Representatives that under the influence of the drug, \"people will fly into a delirious rage and many will commit violent crimes.\" His corrupt rhetoric was contaminating. It produced such an atmosphere than when the official representative of the American Medical Association came to testify against the Bill, he was bullied and insulted. (An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association of 1 May 1937 advised that \"the proposed Federal venture into the interstate control of cannabis hardly seems to be justified by experience . . . After more than twenty years of Federal effort and the expenditure of millions of dollars, the opium and cocaine habits are still widespread.\")</p> <p>Like Lord Haldane 12 years earlier in the House of Lords, Congressman Sam Rayburn assured Congress that \"this Bill has a unanimous report from the committee and there is no controversy about it.\" When asked what the Bill was about, he added, vaguely: \"it has something to do with something that is called marijuana. I believe it is a narcotic of some kind.\" The Bill passed after less than half an hour's debate. If a good law is one that reduces misconduct, while a bad law results in increased infractions, then the Marijuana Tax Act was calamitous. It raises the question that is too seldom addressed when considering policy on drugs: does social deviance lead to social controls, or do such controls result in deviance? In the five years after 1937, about sixty thousand tons of marijuana were destroyed in the US and about a thousand people arrested annually for violating the law. The number of arrests in California rose from 1156 in 1954 to 50,327 in 1968. By 1998, there were 695,000 arrests annually in the US: 86,086 was the comparable figure for Britain in 1997. The policing of cannabis accounted for nearly 80 per cent of police time spent on drug offences in both countries.</p> <p>The DEA has grown into a second international intelligence agency, with a global network of agents rivalling that of the CIA. The total spent on the War on Drugs rose from $537m in 1980 to $1.2bn in 1984. By 1991, the Government was spending $7.7bn on action against illegal intoxicants. Despite the deployment of all these repressive instruments, the US has failed to disrupt the dynamics of prohibition and illegal supply. As the late Jan-Willem Gerritsen writes in his perceptive study of prohibition policies, \"the high 'business risks' keep prices high and guarantee good profit margins for successful entrepreneurs, so that the market continues to exercise tremendous magnetic appeal.\" Although \"increasingly stiff sentences imposed under the criminal law aggravate the risks on the supply side, they also boost the market position of those able to evade prosecution. The harsher the repressive measures, the greater the reward for successful entrepreneurs, who have every reason to expand their market and increase the volume of their supply.\"</p> <p>Such reasonable observations are anathema to the prohibitionists. Anslinger moved ruthlessly and mendaciously to discredit the authoritative medical and scientific report commissioned by La Guardia. His agents would have been equally hostile to Iversen, who in his temperate and understated book regrets that cannabis \"has rarely been regarded simply as a substance with effects and side effects\". Instead, it \"has been equated with morality and the debate about its use portrayed as one of good versus evil. Marijuana has been linked with the pursuit of pleasure and with idleness rather than the work ethic.\" Most scientists believe that the grave short-term risks attributed to cannabis \"were grossly exaggerated\", but neither scientists nor anyone else can prove the effect of a substance to be non-existent; it is therefore impossible to prove that any substance is harmless. Most mental effects of cannabis are potential rather than inherent; the potential physical effects cannot be assessed without much more data on long-term consumption. While it is less habit-forming than heroin, nicotine and cocaine, Iversen postulates that \"as many as 10% of regular users will become dependent on the drug.\" Current recreational use of cannabis has less adverse effect on public health than either tobacco or alcohol, but it is likely \"that an increased use of cannabis would bring an increased public health impact\".</p> <p>The profits from trafficking in illegal intoxicants are always 'black': they fall outside the supervision and authority of governments. As Gerritsen argues, 'since a country's sovereignty stands or falls with its monopoly on taxation and the obligation of its citizens to pay taxes, the illegal drugs trade forms a fundamental threat to the system of national states.' Since 1985, under the insistent leadership of the US, there has been a concerted campaign to control the international laundering of black-market money derived from drugs. This aspect of the war on drugs, he writes, is leading 'to something that was never intended: a uniform global regulatory regime, which will be applicable to all types of financial service'.</p> <p>Gerritsen's sociological history charts the way 20th-century controls on drugs were used to defend social norms. Men like Anslinger, who was obsessed with Red China, and Richard Nixon, who revived the widespread use of cocaine by his maladroit War on Drugs, regarded their sale and use as a collective threat from outsiders. The 'silent majority' (a phrase Nixon borrowed from Homer, who was referring to the dead) refused to acknowledge that prohibitionist legislation and its enforcement are indispensable preconditions for the growth of illicit supply. \"In a repressive climate of this kind, more informal modes of regulation - which certainly exist among users - are by definition confined to a twilight subculture that is a natural breeding ground for crime and other expressions of counter-culture,\" Gerritsen writes.</p> <p>This is one of the quandaries addressed by the Police Foundation inquiry into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The members of this committee (chaired by Lady Runciman) are essentially pragmatic:</p> <p>It has become inescapably clear to us that the eradication of drug use is not achievable and it is not therefore either a realistic or a sensible goal of public policy. The main aim of the law must be to control and limit the demand for and the supply of illicit drugs in order to minimise the serious individual and social harms caused by their use.</p> <p>Rather than react to the bullying of journalists, drugs laws should reflect the latest scientific understanding; they should also \"be accepted by the public as fair, consistent, enforceable, consistent and just\". As to social attitudes, the Mori survey commissioned by Runciman showed that tobacco and alcohol were considered more harmful than cannabis by every age group. Illegal drug use remained a minority pursuit well after the 1960s. But by the late 1990s, the majority of people aged between 16 and 29 admitted to having tried illegal drugs; the estimate is that up to one third of this group may have used cannabis or other drugs within the last year. Cannabis accounted for between 70 and 85 per cent of all offences under the MDA, of which there were more than 110,000 in 1997.</p> <p>The best chance of formulating a workable policy lies in viewing drugs as commodities within a hugely lucrative, dynamic and expanding illicit economy.

In the earliest stages of intoxication, the will power is destroyed and inhibitions and restraints are released; the moral barricades are broken down and often debauchery and sexuality result. Where mental instability is inherent, the behaviour is generally violent. An egotist will enjoy delusions of grandeur, the timid individual will suffer anxiety, and the aggressive one often will resort to acts of violence and crime. Dormant tendencies are released . . . Constant use produces an incapacity for work and a disorientation . . . often leading to insanity after prolonged use. Anslinger's claims have been endorsed by high officials ever since. \"There is not a shred of scientific evidence that shows that smoked marijuana is useful or needed,\" declared the former US drugs czar General Barry McCaffrey in 1996. \"This is not a medicine. This is a cruel hoax.\" Our own home secretary endorsed this line after his son's arrest for a drug offence in 1997. Ann 'zero-tolerance' Widdecombe is even more opposed to it (except, it seems, when used by shadow cabinet colleagues and other supposedly 'educated, articulate people'). Anslinger was lying. In The Science of Marijuana, Leslie Iversen has produced the most authoritative and up-to-date scientific assessment of the medical uses of cannabis now available. He recalls that cannabis was recommended for the treatment of constipation, gout, malaria, rheumatism and menstrual problems in a Chinese compendium of herbal medicines published around 2800 BC. It was a medicament in many subsequent cultures. Difficulties in standardising cannabis preparations meant, however, that it was not widely used in 19th-century western medicine. Even so, in 1937, when its medical use was suppressed in the US, there were 28 different medicines in which it was an ingredient. In 1964 came confirmation that virtually all the pharmacological activity in hashish extracts is attributable to one compound, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Later, the existence of specific receptors for cannabinoids in the brain and other tissues was established. Early in the 1970s the US Drugs Enforcement Agency was petitioned to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug which could be prescribed by physicians. Finally, in 1986, after prolonged legal tussles, the DEA agreed to public hearings on the petition. The hearings lasted for more than two years. Despite the DEA's legal expert recommending the rescheduling, and his conclusion that cannabis is \"one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man\", the DEA denied the petition. Iversen refers to a 1990 finding that 44 per cent of US oncologists had suggested that a patient smoke marijuana for relief of the nausea induced by chemotherapy. If the drug were really unsafe for use even under medical supervision, as its Schedule I status affirms, this recommendation would have been unthinkable. Despite the DEA's obstruction, the discovery of the cannabinoid control system in the body has revitalised scientific research. Two synthetic cannabinoids have become available on prescription to patients in Europe and the US. The annual sales of dronabil (sold under the trade name of Marinol) in the US are estimated to be worth about $20 million: some 80 per cent of prescriptions are as an appetite stimulant for people with Aids or HIV, 10 per cent to counteract the nausea associated with chemotherapy and 10 per cent for other purposes. The Eli Lilly Company has developed nabilone: under the trade name of Cesamet it, too, is used to treat nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy, although it also gave promising results in clinical trials in the treatment of anxiety. In addition, many patients with multiple sclerosis have reported benefiting from smoking cannabis. The possibility of its use in the treatment of glaucoma and epilepsy is being looked into. During 1997, the American Medical Association recommended controlled clinical trials on the medical uses of smoked marijuana, and the BMA recommended trials of synthetic cannabinoids. The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee reported in 1998 that more clinical research was needed, but recommended the drug's rescheduling to permit its medical use. A year later, the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine urged that its therapeutic use in pain relief, control of nausea and appetite stimulation be further investigated. New clinical trials will probably soon be underway in Europe and the US, and I don't doubt from the evidence laid out by Iversen that they will yield positive data. It will then be hard for governments to refuse approval for the medical use of cannabis or cannabinoids. \"The argument that approval of the medical use of cannabis would be tantamount to encouraging the legalisation of the drug for all purposes is clearly specious,\" Iversen concludes, \"and is no justification for withholding an effective medicine from patients who need it.\" Such ideas were anathema to the egregious McCaffrey. \"There could be no worse message to young people,\" he insisted. \"Just when the nation is trying its hardest to educate teenagers not to use psychoactive drugs . . . they are being told that marijuana is a medicine.\" Many other psychoactive drugs have a recognised place in European medicine notwithstanding the dangers of misuse. Heroin is the foremost example. Despite Congressman Stephen Porter's disastrous Act of 1924 prohibiting its medical use in the US, European countries resisted postwar American pressure (directed through the United Nations) to impose this ban globally. An attempt under the Eden Government in 1955 to prohibit its medical use in Britain was defeated by a House of Lords rebellion led by the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, supported by a number of medical peers. One of the virtues of William McAllister's meticulously researched history of 20th-century drugs diplomacy is to highlight the source of most national drug regulatory systems in the series of international conferences on the subject held since 1912. Summaries of diplomatic proceedings, or of the Conventions they produce, can make dry reading, but McAllister brings a wry humour to his subject. The book is indispensable to understanding the drug controls and policing of the world in 2000; among many rich details, it gives disturbing insights into the influence of pharmaceutical companies on global policy. At the crucial Conference on Psychotropic Substances held in Vienna in 1971, several key delegations, including the US delegation, were infiltrated by company executives defending their freedom to sell amphetamines and barbiturates with minimal regulation. The mystery as to why the spokesman for six Latin American countries opposing tight regulations spoke only broken Spanish was solved when he was discovered to be a Swiss employee of Hoffman-LaRoche. McAllister's is an international history, drawing on diplomatic archives: he does not go into detail on the home office's troubled relations with cannabis. The home office first took notice of what was then known as Indian hemp in 1922, when it was sent a substance found in the coalshed of an Egyptian coffee-house keeper in South Shields. The home office confirmed to the chief constable that on analysis the substance proved to be 'hasheesh', which was not covered by the Dangerous Drugs Act (DDA) of 1920. Next, in 1923, ten tons of cannabis resin en route from Bombay to Djibouti were detained: the shipper was Henri de Monfreid, whose memoir La Croisiere du Hachich (1935) - in English translation, Hashish: A Traveller's Tale (1994) - is a splendid introduction to the subject of trafficking and drugs regulations. The home office was consulted before Monfreid's shipment was allowed to proceed. Shortly afterwards, two waiters, one Italian and the other Sudanese, were arrested in Old Compton Street and accused of offering to supply raw opium. In fact, the brown substance in their possession was hashish, which it was then legal to possess, and the case was abandoned. But it provided the excuse for an alarmist series of cheap newspaper articles in the silly season - including a supposed interview in the Daily Mail with a home office official - in the relevant file in the Public Record Office the official in question has written the word 'Liar!' in the margin. On the strength of the hoo-ha metropolitan police recommended the incorporation of cannabis in the Dangerous Drugs Act, one CID officer advising that cannabis \"has practically the same effect as cocaine and morphine upon its victims\". Even the Met was not optimistic about the success of prohibition: the \"only result\" of prohibiting the drug in Egypt had been \"an increase of price to its consumers\". The home office did not want to legislate, but foresaw that \"the prevalence of the vice in Egypt\" - despite prohibition there - might result in 'international regulation of the drug'. This was prescient. A month later, the Egyptian ministry of the interior concluded that as it was \"practically impossible to keep hashish out of Egypt . . . the League of Nations should consider hashish as an international affair and should try to persuade its members to make dealing in or consuming the drug a crime punishable by severe penalties.\" Consequently, at the Geneva Conference on Opium of 1924-25, Egypt's delegate proposed bringing hashish within the Hague Convention of 1912. His memorandum, circulated to support this proposal, represented it as \"a dangerous narcotic . . . more harmful than opium\", and stated that \"about 70 per cent of insane people in lunatic asylums in Egypt are haschiche eaters or smokers.\" Congressman Porter, the monomaniacal leader of the US delegation, was keen on this initiative. \"We are asking them to help us to destroy the vice of opium, coca leaves and their derivatives,\" he declared of the Egyptians. \"This is a good time to practise a little reciprocity. They have their troubles and we have ours.\" The contracting powers at the Geneva Conference accordingly agreed in 1925 to prohibit the import and export of Indian hemp except for certified medical or scientific purposes. In Britain, cannabis was immediately rescheduled as a poison, with effect from April 1925. A few months later, a new DDA brought Britain into line for the ratification of the Geneva Convention. The House of Commons debate on the Bill lasted less than five minutes: Indian hemp, or cannabis, was not mentioned once. The House of Lords debate was slightly longer. Peers followed the advice of Lord Haldane that, as it was \"impossible to form any judgment on the details of the Bill\", it should \"be taken by the House to a large extent on trust\". It was on this slipshod basis that cannabis was criminalised. This might not have mattered much had it not been for the enduring effects of Prohibition in the US. Cannabis was listed in the US Pharmacopoeia as a recognised medicine from 1850 until 1942. It was sold cheaply by drugstores in the form of fluid extracts, and was smoked in cigarette form by asthmatics. Between 1900 and 1920 it began to be used on a limited scale as a recreational drug by immigrant labourers from Mexico and the Caribbean. Its consumption was enormously increased after the 18th Amendment - prohibiting alcohol - came into force in 1920. Alcohol became more difficult to obtain, more expensive and often of poor quality. In urban centres 'tea pads' operating like speakeasies provided cheap marijuana. In 1944, Mayor La Guardia's Committee on Marijuana estimated that there had been five hundred 'tea pads' in New York City by the 1930s. The mass marketing of marijuana for recreational use was the result of bad law-making. Congressman Porter's response to the Egyptians at Geneva showed that cannabis was not then regarded as a problem by anti-drugs propagandists in the US. It first received public attention in a series of sensationalised and false reports in the New Orleans press in 1926 involving drug-crazed black marijuana users and corrupted schoolchildren. By 1931, all but two states west of the Mississippi and several others in the East had made a criminal offence of the possession or use of cannabis. By 1937, every state had outlawed the drug under legislation allowing no distinction between physiologically addictive narcotics such as heroin, habit-forming stimulants like cocaine, and hallucinogens. Anslinger felt that his agents at the Bureau of Narcotics were overstretched coping with opiates without having to suppress a drug that could be easily grown in many states of the Union. He accepted then that \"the marijuana addict\" did not \"graduate into a heroin, an opium or a cocaine user\". Once he'd decided that he would have to submit to political pressure for a Federal law to be passed against marijuana, he did so in a manner calculated, not untypically, to strengthen his own position and that of the Bureau. He strenuously supported the Marijuana Tax Bill. \"How many murders, suicides, robberies, criminal assaults, hold-ups, burglaries and deeds of maniacal insanity it causes each year, especially among the young, can only be conjectured,\" he said, assuring the House of Representatives that under the influence of the drug, \"people will fly into a delirious rage and many will commit violent crimes.\" His corrupt rhetoric was contaminating. It produced such an atmosphere than when the official representative of the American Medical Association came to testify against the Bill, he was bullied and insulted. (An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association of 1 May 1937 advised that \"the proposed Federal venture into the interstate control of cannabis hardly seems to be justified by experience . . . After more than twenty years of Federal effort and the expenditure of millions of dollars, the opium and cocaine habits are still widespread.\") Like Lord Haldane 12 years earlier in the House of Lords, Congressman Sam Rayburn assured Congress that \"this Bill has a unanimous report from the committee and there is no controversy about it.\" When asked what the Bill was about, he added, vaguely: \"it has something to do with something that is called marijuana. I believe it is a narcotic of some kind.\" The Bill passed after less than half an hour's debate.

      "bodyText": "\"I really can't think why we can't have Catholics on the throne,\" Paddy Ashdown quotes Prince Charles as saying during a conversation on the plane back from Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in November 1995. Apart from the propriety of whether he should have quoted a private conversation with the heir to the aforementioned throne, Mr Ashdown knows very well what he is doing by dropping this little nugget into his newly published diaries. He understands just as well as Prince Charles the answer to the question. There are stiff constitutional and political obstacles involved - the Bill of Rights, which followed the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688, and the Act of Settlement 13 years later, both prohibit anyone who professes the popish religion or marries a papist. Even if these obstacles could be abolished, there would be a lot of unpicking of the position of the established church to be undertaken. That would involve not just lofty principles but also practical problems, such as who would be responsible for the upkeep of the 40 per cent of Britain's listed buildings currently occupied but not owned by the Church of England. And then there is the question of how many Anglican bishops (as opposed to members of other religions and faiths) should be allowed to sit in the House of Lords. Funnily enough, it is very easy to find Anglican bishops who will tell you how relaxed they are about disestablishment - less easy to find other religious leaders who are similarly inclined. They fear the downgrading of the Church of England would have a knock-on effect on other churches' positions in the country too. It would be a considerable upheaval and one for which there is very little political appetite, since it would involve much long-drawn out effort for little concrete result. Also, it is a matter that is scarcely pressing. The Queen and all her conceivable heirs and successors are protestants. Even Camilla Parker-Bowles, the ostensible source of possible concerns, is a protestant. She just happened to be married to a Catholic at one time. The position of Catholics in British public life is not a cause of controversy and has not been for nearly 150 years. The House of Commons may have just elected the first Catholic since the Reformation to be its Speaker (formally, if not effectively, the highest-ranking commoner in the land) - but Michael Martin's religion was the least cause of comment surrounding his appointment. Only the sad group of protestant fundamentalists such as the Rev Ian Paisley and the doughty souls who subscribe to the English Churchman newspaper (which this week was still describing the Pope as Satan) are likely to be perturbed. It is 40 years since John F Kennedy won the presidency of the United States by pointing out that he would not expect to be taking his orders from Rome while in the Oval office. It is only a week since the Queen met the Pope on perfectly amicable terms. In such circumstances, putting a Catholic on the throne seems to be hardly an issue worth going to the stake over.",

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office is today demanding to see seven Britons held in a Cuban jail on suspicion of spying. Authorities in Havana are investigating allegations that the group, hired to investigate a case of marital infidelity involving a millionaire Cuban national, had used methods in breach of the country's law. British embassy officials are still being denied access to the group, and Foreign Office minister Peter Hain will summon the Cuban charge d'affaires to see him in London today. \"Whatever the state of the Cuban investigation, they are entitled under international conventions to have consular access,\" said a spokesman said. No charges have yet been brought but the Cuban authorities have tried to provide access to a lawyer. The mother of one of the seven said today that he told her not to worry before he jetted off to Fidel Castro's communist island earlier this month. Londoner Ken Lodge, 53, who has run Snaresbrook-based SIP Investigations for more than 20 years, had told her he would only be gone for a fortnight. \"We're close but he didn't go into detail about what work he was doing,\" said Mrs Lodge, of Forest Gate, east London, who is in her 70s. \"He's my only son and I want him to come home.\" According to reports, the other detainees include Londoner John Fawcett, Derek Pitt from Hertfordshire, two men identified only as Will Smart and Mike, and the latter's girlfriend. All are understood to be from south-east England. Mr Hain has attacked the situation as \"unacceptable\" and demanded immediate access to the seven. \"Last night we were told for the first time by the Cuban authorities the reason why they are being held,\" he said. \"It is rather bizarre and it is a shame, because we enjoy increasingly close and friendly relations with Cuba. We want to see that relationship continue. \"I hope this incident is resolved quickly and we can put it behind us.\" Useful links Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Granma Internacional Digital",

The commission will say next month whether the bids from the People's Lottery and Camelot meet the criteria relating to \"all due propriety\" and \"the protection of the interests of every participant in the lottery\". If only one of the bids is suitable, then a final decision could be made then. If both bids are eligible, then the commission will consider which will provide the greater proceeds for the National Lottery Distribution Fund, and hopes to make an announcement in mid-December. The People's Lottery bid, which has been revised since the recent high court decision ruling that the commission's treatment of Camelot was illegal, was submitted on September 23. The commission has stated that it has not examined Sir Richard Branson's proposals during the month of negotiations with Camelot leading up to the submission of their revised bid yesterday. The commission has promised to make the final decision \"without preconceptions and without regard to any conclusions it reached about this matter leading up to its announcement on 23 August\". Meanwhile Lord Burns, speaking this morning at a London press conference, urged the other Lottery commissioners not to resign. \"The commissioners bring considerable experience and knowledge to the process.

      "bodyText": "Running as an ill-tempered sideshow to the presidential election, the rumble between Washington and Hollywood shows little sign of dying down. Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator John McCain, is this week expected to demand quarterly reports to monitor how the big studios are honouring their pledge to stop targeting R-rated films at an underage audience. McCain will square Hollywood's actions with the twelve-point plan agreed as a result of last month's damning Federal Trade Commission report which concluded that Hollywood knowingly markets violent films to younger audiences. In contrast to the knife-edge presidential contest, early indications suggest that the federal government currently has the movie industry running scared. Variety reports that there is an unspoken sense within Hollywood that concessions must be made, even in a year which has seen the film industry playing the role of whipping boy. This newer, purer Hollywood can already be seen in the prominent signs in cinemas warning punters to have their IDs ready and print advertisements that list a movie's content like a shopping list. Take the Nora Ephron lottery comedy Lucky Numbers (pictured), starring John Travolta and Friends star Lisa Kudrow. Sounds harmless enough, doesn't it? Except that, according to the cautionary Paramount print ad, the film contains \"language, sex, some drug use and brief violence\". But if such warnings are meant to scare off the adolescent market, the reverse effect may prove be the case. With such alluring subject matter on offer, cosy Aunt Nora looks set to attract a hip younger demographic.",

A third of under 16s are sexually active and every year 15,000 girls under 18 have an abortion. MSI has now launched a \"Sexplanations\" booklet aimed at helping parents to discuss the subject with their children. Liliana Risi, from MSI, said: \"The survey reveals a gap between good intentions and the reality of what parents will discuss. Even when parents are discussing sex they tend to focus on the emotional side. \"This is obviously important but young people also need hard facts so that they can lead safe, happy sexual lives.\"",

      "bodyText": "Emap is poised to launch dozens of TV programmes based on its magazines, including Smash Hits and heavy metal title Kerrang!. The move is part of an initiative by the publishing giant to launch 'masthead' programmes that mirror its magazine portfolio. Sources have said Emap's newly-created Emap Performance Television division will in the coming months launch masthead TV versions of all its successful music, and some non-music, magazine brands. The company is also examining the possibility of replicating all of its successful magazine brands in a radio format. Emap last month created three posts: head of pop for former head of BBC music programmes Trevor Dann, head of dance for Kiss and Magic managing director Mark Story and head of rock for ex-Kerrang! editor Dave Henderson. Where Emap has a corresponding magazine and radio station, such as Mixmag and Kiss radio, it is likely to drop the weaker brand. This policy is already being extended to video channel the Box, which over the next few months will be rebranded as the Smash Hits channel. And Emap Performrance TV is understood to be preparing to launch a Kerrang! masthead show. Emap Performance last month created a division called Emap Performance Television, headed by former the Box channel director Shirley Renwick. Emap's move comes as rival IPC Media is poised to turn many of its successful magazine brands into television shows. IPC and MTV are in talks about joint ventures based on IPC music magazine brands such as the NME, which is soon to launch a show on the Telewest-owned Bravo channel. IPC's head of TV strategy, Nick Ryle, said: \"MTV and the NME are working in similar areas and there is potential for us to work together. We have had some meetings.\" But Mr Ryle added that the company had no firm plans to launch a channel or programmes with MTV.

The service, which offers five themed web portals and an Asian satellite TV channel based around the same mix of content, launched in June. Mr Li, 33, and PCCW were the darlings of the Hong Kong economy earlier this year with investors queueing up. His father, Li Ka-shing, known as 'Superman', is Hong Kong's richest man. Mr Li has also clashed with Rupert Murdoch. Eight years ago he borrowed money from his father to set up Star TV, the first pan-Asian satellite service. He sold it to Murdoch for almost $1bn but the service has been losing money ever since.",

      "bodyText": "Peter Guilford, former Brussels correspondent for the Times, has teamed up with ex-BBC political correspondent Nigel Gardner to form a Brussels-based communications company. The pair have a wealth of European Union contacts and plan to cash in on their experience by offering \"unparalleled knowledge of European media\". Mr Guilford, known to all Brussels-based journalists as deputy spokesman for EU president Romano Prodi, made his mark in the EC as a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan. Mr Gardner is the Labour party's communications director in the European Parliament and has worked as EC spokesman on world trade and foreign policy. The new company, which has yet to be named, will specialise in public affairs and media relations. It opens its doors on December 1 and will be fully funded by London communications consultancy Luther Pendragon. Charles Stewart-Smith, co-founder of Luther Pendragon, said: \"For some time we have needed someone in Brussels for our international clients, but none of the existing companies was quite good enough. \"There are lots of companies doing old-school political lobbying, but they don't understand the relationship between politics and the media in the way that Peter and Nigel do.\" Mr Guilford said: \"We can bring to clients not just a real insight into the mind of the EU but also an unparalleled knowledge of the European media. Brussels now has the largest press corps in the world - and one with growing influence on political thinking. \"We believe no one else in Brussels offers such an integrated approach with such high-level knowledge.\" Luther Pendragon was founded by Mr Stewart-Smith, a former programme editor on ITN's News at Ten, and George Pitcher, former industrial editor at the Observer. It has affiliations with Nichols Dezenhall in Washington and vom Hoff Kommunikation in Dusseldorf.",

The volunteer force that will take its place, giving women a military role for the first time, makes total sense. But its arrival was tinged with regret.</p> <p>A young, fractious country born only in 1861, Italy relied on conscription to forge a sense of nationhood by jumbling together southerners and northerners. For generations of Italians who did not even speak the same language, it succeeded.</p> <p>British schoolboys snigger at Benito Mussolini's incompetent forays into north Africa, and the switch to the Allies as the tide of the second world war changed, but Italians remember their army for other things.</p> <p>A ragtag, outnumbered force which united the country against the odds was its progenitor. In Alpine valleys it eventually hammered the Austrians and Germans in the first world war, losing 600,000 men in the process. It has been deployed in southern Italy and Sicily to counter terrorism and the mafia.</p> <p>In peacekeeping and relief operations in Lebanon, Namibia, East Timor and Kurdistan it has earned respect. It has shouldered much of Nato's burden in the Balkans. Not a slick killing machine, but one worthy of pride, reckon most Italians.</p> <p>Yet the senate voted overwhelmingly to abolish conscription, a procedure started two centuries ago by Napoleon Bonaparte. Over the next seven years the 270,000-strong force will shrink to 190,000 volunteers.</p> <p>Opposed only by the far-left Refounded Communists, the law is intended to boost the army's aptitude for peace-keeping. As well as short-term savings, an end to conscription means higher salaries, improved training and better equipment.</p> <p>\"While military personnel will be sensibly reduced, the number of troops that we will actually be able to deploy on international missions will increase,\" said defence minister Sergio Mattarella.</p> <p>Defence spending is expected to rise 50% in the next few years. Conscription, otherwise known as <i>naja</i>, can be reactivated in times of war or international crisis.</p> <p>Following similar moves in France and Germany, Italy is to abolish its draft from January 2003; eight of European Union's 17 members now done likewise. Commentators agreed the move was sound but could not help mourning what will be lost.</p> <p>The force, after all, will change almost beyond recognition. A first generation of female officer cadets have recently signed up after an eight-year campaign by the Association of Aspiring Women Soldiers (Anados). By 2002 women will be able to volunteer for every sector of the armed forces.</p> <p>Less positively, an elite alpine unit protested that the army's unifying influence would crumble due to the disproportionate number of volunteers expected from the jobless south, lured by the prospect of \u00a3635 a month. For a shop assistant on \u00a32-an-hour, that's not bad.</p> <p>Charities also expressed concern at losing the annual help of around 100,000 conscientious objectors who were allowed to serve their 10-month stint doing voluntary work; grumpy some might have been, but they were like manna from heaven.</p> <p>The Refounded Communists reiterated the argument, echoed in Germany, that conscripts ensured the army remained linked to the people, thus acting as a bulwark against militarisation and coups.</p> <p>Yet for males born after 1985, the cut-off date for the new law, such fears are for fuddy duddies. Where those born before may still have to serve their military service as the draft is phased out, they will be the first generation grateful to escape a 10-month sentence of boredom.</p> <p>After all, sons of wealthy families often studied abroad to try to avoid the call-up, which applied to those aged 18-26, and generations of fathers, uncles and elder brothers have regaled family dinner tables with tales of waste, mismanagement, homesickness and futility.</p> <p>Few were surprised last month when auditors discovered that the army had stored enough clothing and kit to last for the next 3,000 years. An inspection revealed warehouses bursting with tons of forgotten shoes, boots, underwear, hairbrushes and uniforms, including some for children or extremely small adults. Clearly a spring-clean has been long overdue.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:rory.carroll@theguardian.com\">rory.carroll@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28rory+carroll%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=rory+carroll&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Rory Carroll</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/\" target=\"_new\">Corriere della Sera</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ilsole24ore.com/\" target=\"_new\">Il Sole 24 ORE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.lastampa.it/Redazione/Ultima/Redazione/Menu/Principale/HomePage.stm\" target=\"_new\">La Stampa</a><br><a href=\"http://www.repubblica.it/\" target=\"_new\">La Repubblica</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ilmanifesto.it/\" target=\"_new\">Il Manifesto</a><br><a href=\"http://www.parlamento.it/\" target=\"_new\">Italian parliament</a><br><a href=\"http://governo.it/\" target=\"_new\">Italian government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.quirinale.it/\" target=\"_new\">Italian president</a></p>",

British schoolboys snigger at Benito Mussolini's incompetent forays into north Africa, and the switch to the Allies as the tide of the second world war changed, but Italians remember their army for other things. A ragtag, outnumbered force which united the country against the odds was its progenitor. In Alpine valleys it eventually hammered the Austrians and Germans in the first world war, losing 600,000 men in the process. It has been deployed in southern Italy and Sicily to counter terrorism and the mafia. In peacekeeping and relief operations in Lebanon, Namibia, East Timor and Kurdistan it has earned respect. It has shouldered much of Nato's burden in the Balkans. Not a slick killing machine, but one worthy of pride, reckon most Italians. Yet the senate voted overwhelmingly to abolish conscription, a procedure started two centuries ago by Napoleon Bonaparte. Over the next seven years the 270,000-strong force will shrink to 190,000 volunteers. Opposed only by the far-left Refounded Communists, the law is intended to boost the army's aptitude for peace-keeping. As well as short-term savings, an end to conscription means higher salaries, improved training and better equipment. \"While military personnel will be sensibly reduced, the number of troops that we will actually be able to deploy on international missions will increase,\" said defence minister Sergio Mattarella. Defence spending is expected to rise 50% in the next few years. Conscription, otherwise known as naja, can be reactivated in times of war or international crisis. Following similar moves in France and Germany, Italy is to abolish its draft from January 2003; eight of European Union's 17 members now done likewise. Commentators agreed the move was sound but could not help mourning what will be lost. The force, after all, will change almost beyond recognition. A first generation of female officer cadets have recently signed up after an eight-year campaign by the Association of Aspiring Women Soldiers (Anados). By 2002 women will be able to volunteer for every sector of the armed forces. Less positively, an elite alpine unit protested that the army's unifying influence would crumble due to the disproportionate number of volunteers expected from the jobless south, lured by the prospect of \u00a3635 a month. For a shop assistant on \u00a32-an-hour, that's not bad. Charities also expressed concern at losing the annual help of around 100,000 conscientious objectors who were allowed to serve their 10-month stint doing voluntary work; grumpy some might have been, but they were like manna from heaven. The Refounded Communists reiterated the argument, echoed in Germany, that conscripts ensured the army remained linked to the people, thus acting as a bulwark against militarisation and coups. Yet for males born after 1985, the cut-off date for the new law, such fears are for fuddy duddies. Where those born before may still have to serve their military service as the draft is phased out, they will be the first generation grateful to escape a 10-month sentence of boredom. After all, sons of wealthy families often studied abroad to try to avoid the call-up, which applied to those aged 18-26, and generations of fathers, uncles and elder brothers have regaled family dinner tables with tales of waste, mismanagement, homesickness and futility. Few were surprised last month when auditors discovered that the army had stored enough clothing and kit to last for the next 3,000 years. An inspection revealed warehouses bursting with tons of forgotten shoes, boots, underwear, hairbrushes and uniforms, including some for children or extremely small adults. Clearly a spring-clean has been long overdue.

The fact the FBI has not been able to find Whitey Bulger since he disappeared five years ago is all the more embarrassing because it turns out he was one of their own - an informant who was allowed, quite literally, to get away with murder in return for information about rival, mostly Italian, gangs.

      "bodyText": "The brunt of the blame for the BSE fiasco will be placed on civil servants in the long-awaited report into the crisis which is published tomorrow - despite criticisms of some former ministers. Institutional failures within the Whitehall culture, including an inability to trust the public with information, turf wars between departments and a tendency to try to second-guess what ministers might want to hear are all cited in the 16-volume verdict, which was compiled after more than two years of public hearings. However, people hoping to find scapegoats from previous Tory administrations will be disappointed. Senior Whitehall sources have suggested that the inquiry team headed by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers had made \"no searing indictments\" of individuals, although officials and ministers whose behaviour is thought to have fallen outside a range of \"reasonable\" responses are listed. Despite speculation to the contrary, John Gummer, an agriculture minister during the crisis, does not get slapped down for the infamous publicity stunt in which he fed a burger to his daughter Cordelia to demonstrate the safety of beef, although it is believed he faces other criticisms. There is already acute embarrassment within the government at the report's chronicling of the way civil servants and other advisers apparently sought to put the best possible spin on the scientific evidence available, failing to change their outlook as the scientific community's concerns about the risks of BSE transferring to humans increased. The political climate of the Thatcher and Major years, the clamour for deregulation, an apparent demand to produce success stories rather than admit problems, and the experience of the salmonella-in-eggs affair in 1988 emerge as factors in Whitehall attitudes. The report alleges that civil servants were focused on day-to-day governance rather than contingency planning for any worst case scenario. The health department, which has largely avoided the opprobrium heaped on agriculture officials during the 1990s, will share criticism for failing to recognise the shift in scientific opinion on the potentially disastrous consequences of the disease. It was reluctant to support an offal ban in 1989, now seen as the most important anti-BSE safeguard, because such an action went beyond the advice of eminent scientists. The then agriculture minister, John MacGregor, justified the offal ban on the grounds that huge numbers of cows with \"hidden BSE\" were entering the food chain before clinical signs were evident, on emerging evidence that some offals could potentially be infective, and because it was a \"belt and braces\" precautionary measure. Douglas Hogg, the beleaguered agriculture minister at the height of the crisis, will emerge with more credit than might have been expected. He felt new scientific information establishing a strong circumstantial link between exposure to infected meat and the death of several young people from a new incurable disease - new variant CJD - justified further tough measures to protect food, but he was over-ruled by cabinet colleagues. They felt let down by previous scientific advice which they saw as \"defective\" because it had emphasised the remote risk of BSE's transmission to humans. They saw no reason to rely on new advice and rejected any consideration of compensation for the victims, arguing that the government had followed the latest scientific advice throughout the epidemic. The inquiry team is understood to criticise the way officials and ministers chose to \"cherry pick\" good news from the first inquiry report into BSE, headed by the Oxford professor Richard Southwood and published in 1989, which concluded that \"it was most unlikely that BSE will have any implications for human health\". Thus for years, even as scientific uncertainty about the potential threat to the public was continuing, policy was based on the Southwood conclusion. The report will say the government did not take adequate note of the Southwood inquiry's caveats, including a warning that if its assessment were proved wrong, the implications would be \"extremely serious\". Any warning of potential risk from outside the government was also played down. Whitehall sources say there will be greater scepticism about scientific advice in future. They promise greater government honesty over risks to public health. But the revelations just last week that vaccines using material from British cows were banned from use only on Friday has further damaged credibility. There is a feeling in some parts of Whitehall that the inquiry has not got to the heart of how government works, depending too much on the written record of memos, minutes and briefing papers from civil servants. No ministerial private secretaries were asked to appear before the inquiry, despite their inside knowledge. Lord Phillips's recommendation for a centrally funded care package for the victims of the human form of BSE - 84 so far - has been accepted in principle by ministers. There is still debate over how compensation should be awarded, either leaving a new trust to determine individual sums or a tariff of payments reflecting broad bands of family circumstances. Likely to be criticised: \u0095 Civil servants Richard Packer, permanent secretary at agriculture, 1993-2000 Keith Meldrum, chief veterinary officer, 1988-97 Donald Acheson, chief medical officer, 1983-91 Kenneth Calman, chief medical officer, 1991-98 \u0095 Ministers John MacGregor, agriculture minister, 1987-89 John Gummer, agriculture minister, 1989-93 Kenneth Clarke, health secretary, 1988-90",

      "body": "<p>It was the sort of story guaranteed to lift the spirits of any Daily Telegraph reader on an autumn morning. John Prescott, crossing a lake by VIP launch after opening an exhibition of Henry Moore bronzes in a Beijing park, had supposedly mouthed a string of inanities about the work of his fellow Yorkshireman. Weren't \"He didn't like heads, did he?\" and \"Hands are very hard to get right\" precisely the sort of remarks that could be expected from a man who drives two Jags? </p> <p>Within hours last Tuesday, the London Evening Standard was telling the same tale under the headline \"Look no hands\"; by Thursday the Daily Mail had put together an entire spoof page entitled Prescott's A-Z of Art. No matter that Prescott had later explained that \"a lot of the critics make the point... about hands and heads\", and that many Telegraph readers might agree. History had been written and prejudices reinforced. </p> <p>But not so fast. How did Prescott, in China to attend trade talks, end up opening a British Council exhibition of Moore's sculptures? Authentic or otherwise, the thoughts of Prescott prove to be the least interesting aspect of the affair. </p> <p>Like much else in Beijing, Beihai Park has no real British equivalent. A willow-pattern place of water and temples, pagodas and lotus flowers, it is a spiritual recreation ground for many of the city's residents. Each morning they use it for singing, dancing and t'ai-chi. On the morning of the official unveiling, the asphalt is wet with Chinese calligraphy, ephemeral graffiti done in water from the lake for the edification of passers by. And already, the bronzes are pulling crowds, as they have done every day since a team from the Henry Moore Foundation in England set them up. </p> <p>There are 12 pieces, and each has had a uniformed guard since it was found that Chinese children had a tendency to treat the works as vast, slippery climbing frames. But the guards are happy to allow touching. </p> <p>Right from the outset, the exhibition has attracted people of all ages and most classes. \"People in their 20s and 30s have been waiting for this for months,\" says Michael O'Sullivan, cultural counsellor at the British embassy in Beijing. \"They have studied Moore's work, and they know its significance.\" But O'Sullivan is more interested in what older Beijingers make of the sculptures, and he has spent many hours canvassing their opinions. \"They want to know what they are, what they represent and what they mean,\" he says. \"I tell them that in western art a work doesn't have to mean what the artist says it means. And they quite like that.\" </p> <p>The cultural counsellor has just been talking to a man who started off saying that it wasn't appropriate to have such contemporary sculptures in Beihai Park, where they would be juxtaposed with ancient monuments. \"He was worried that some of them were too pointy. It's a feng shui thing. But he ended up asking if we would be leaving one of them here. He thought we should!\" </p> <p>While the Henry Moore Foundation may be less than happy to see one of its bronzes take permanent root in Beijing soil - the show will tour to Shanghai and Guangzhou next spring anyway - the suggestion is clearly music to O'Sullivan's ears, since one of the aims of the exhibition is to raise the profile of the UK in China. </p> <p>\"Not many people here have much awareness of Britain,\" he says, \"and those who do have a very traditional image. They imagine that London resembles a scene from David Copperfield, or is full of men wearing bowler hats and carrying umbrellas.\" </p> <p>Given that China will soon be the world's biggest economy, this is an alarming state of affairs, says O'Sullivan. And while the British Council is \"not a flag-waving organisation\", it is keen to support the huge changes that are happening in Chinese society, if only because \"there would be far-reaching consequences for the rest of the world if the process of change were suddenly to fall apart\". </p> <p>Last year the council screened an entire series of The Bill, and at the same time it introduced Chinese lawyers to the concept of the jury by mounting several mock jury trials. This was all part of the process of nurturing change, while at the same time blowing away the image of pea-soupers and Beefeaters. </p> <p>Hence the exhibition of sculptures in the city. But why pick Henry Moore, an artist who died in 1986, and can hardly be considered at the cutting edge of British art? Although they are hazy about British law enforcement, Beijingers are no strangers to other western phenomena. This vast metropolis now has 80 KFCs and more than 100 McDonald's; Madonna is number one in the Chinese charts. </p> <p>But for all the savvy in matters of popular culture, the Chinese arts establishment is still isolated. Not only can local artists still find works banned for political incorrectness, the work of artists from other countries - even Asian countries - is virtually unknown in schools. </p> <p>Initially, the British Council had in mind a Hockney exhibition, but the Chinese said they were more interested in Moore. It proved to be the ideal choice. The Chinese have a long tradition of appreciating natural forms, and Beijing's parks are full of eroded rocks and boulders erected as curiosities and objects of contemplation. Yet Chinese sculpture remains firmly in the beaux arts tradition, and the sculpture parks are full of naturalistic figures exhorting the viewer to put body and soul behind the latest five-year plan. Moore, on the other hand, took natural forms and used them as a starting point for works that echoed classical forms, yet said something new. The transition from the figurative to the abstract and from nature to art is clear for all to see. </p> <p>If Moore's work seems tailor-made for a Chinese public looking to have its horizons expanded, then his life also has many points of contact with Chinese ideals. The son of a coal miner and a lifelong socialist, Moore was injured during the first world war. Yet he triumphed over adversity and became enormously prolific, even turning down a knighthood along the way. Add to this the fact that his major works are designed to be shown outdoors, where, perforce, they will be encountered by ordinary people, and the logic of Moore in China, as the exhibition is entitled, becomes startlingly obvious. </p> <p>But if the reasons for mounting the show are compelling, the practical problems involved were to prove almost insurmountable. Stand outside the Soviet-built China Art Gallery and you might think yourself in 1950s Moscow. But step inside, and you could be in a Stanley Spencer resurrection painting. For this is where 106 of Moore's smaller works are being shown, and today, as they emerge from their crates, they are greeted by pandemonium. </p> <p>\"Yesterday there were 25 people in this room watching what we were doing,\" says the white-gloved David Mitchinson, curator at the Henry Moore Foundation. \"They were asking why we were painting the columns, why we had put up false walls, why the pieces were crated in this way... They were fascinated.\" And why were they putting up false walls, exactly? Why were they coating the place with 300 gallons of whitish-grey paint, even taping over black skirting boards that spoiled the sense of space? </p> <p>It had taken two years to negotiate the use of Beihai Park, and only as the crated sculptures were being loaded on to a ship at Felixstowe Docks had the Chinese authorities sent the final written OK. On arriving in China, the crates could not be trucked into Beijing by day because of traffic restrictions, and so a procession had made its way into the city by night, while a man perched atop the highest crate kept a lookout for low bridges. </p> <p>Yet even after all this, the foundation's travelling exhibition team was insisting on remodelling the city's premier gallery. Why? Because they wanted to give Beijingers a total Western Art Experience the like of which they had never known before. </p> <p>It all seems a little excessive, until you talk to the people who work the magic - people like Malcolm Woodward, a sculptor who can position a Henry Moore bronze in the corner of a Beijing park with such exquisite sensitivity that to remove it again will seem like an act of desecration. To discuss Henry Moore with Woodward - just to hear him talk about the precise colour of a plinth - is to have your eyes opened a little wider. Which is probably why John Prescott spent most of his brief voyage on the VIP boat doing just that. \"He was really interested in the details,\" says Woodward.

      "body": "<p>You may have thought that genre in-joking could not go much further than the Scream series, those drolly self-reflexive horror films about horror films. But then came Scary Movie, which parodied not only Scream itself, but every other film in which over-sexed high-schoolers were filleted by maniacs with meat cleavers. </p> <p>Scary Movie's enthusiastically encyclopedic spoof was originally planned under the working title Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween. And oddly enough, the working title of Scream itself was - you guessed it - Scary Movie. So the circle of self-reference seems to be closed. Or not quite - last week's Variety featured an ad for a film currently in post- production, with a poster illustration awkwardly echoing both Scream and Scary Movie. The title is Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th. It can't be long before we get a mock chiller about a critic driven insane by reviewing too many mock chillers: Stab Me if You've Heard this One Before. </p> <p>The standard critical reaction, when faced with one genre spoof too many, is to protest that you can't parody what is already a parody. Oh, but you can, and only too profitably, as Scary Movie proves. The blame is probably to be laid at the feet of Scream director Wes Craven, who himself produced the best self-conscious horror riff ever, with his film Wes Craven's New Nightmare, a belated coup de grace to his own Nightmare on Elm Street series. Perhaps he should have left it at that, instead of letting Scream spawn all these films out-parodying and out-ironising each other. </p> <p>Halloween is a traditional time to moan about how much better horror used to be when it took itself seriously. Last year, in fact, things looked hopeful.

      "bodyText": "You may have thought that genre in-joking could not go much further than the Scream series, those drolly self-reflexive horror films about horror films. But then came Scary Movie, which parodied not only Scream itself, but every other film in which over-sexed high-schoolers were filleted by maniacs with meat cleavers. Scary Movie's enthusiastically encyclopedic spoof was originally planned under the working title Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween. And oddly enough, the working title of Scream itself was - you guessed it - Scary Movie. So the circle of self-reference seems to be closed. Or not quite - last week's Variety featured an ad for a film currently in post- production, with a poster illustration awkwardly echoing both Scream and Scary Movie. The title is Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th. It can't be long before we get a mock chiller about a critic driven insane by reviewing too many mock chillers: Stab Me if You've Heard this One Before. The standard critical reaction, when faced with one genre spoof too many, is to protest that you can't parody what is already a parody. Oh, but you can, and only too profitably, as Scary Movie proves. The blame is probably to be laid at the feet of Scream director Wes Craven, who himself produced the best self-conscious horror riff ever, with his film Wes Craven's New Nightmare, a belated coup de grace to his own Nightmare on Elm Street series. Perhaps he should have left it at that, instead of letting Scream spawn all these films out-parodying and out-ironising each other. Halloween is a traditional time to moan about how much better horror used to be when it took itself seriously. Last year, in fact, things looked hopeful. The Blair Witch Project was a refreshing anomaly that opted wholeheartedly for the power of suggestion - whatever you think you saw in the shadows in that old dark house, someone you know will have imagined far worse.

      "body": "<p>During the American election campaign of 1992, President Bush delivered a scathing verdict on Messrs Clinton and Gore: \"My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than these two bozos.\" Now the United States may be about to elect an even bigger bozo - George W Bush.</p> <p>\"Dubya\" could certainly use some expert advice from Millie. Last November, a TV interviewer asked him to name the leaders of a few countries that were in the news. \"The new Pakistani general,\" Bush replied, having already failed with India and Chechnya, \"he's just been elected - not elected, this guy took over ...\" \"And can you name him?\" \"General, I can name the general.\" \"And it's ...?\" \"General.\"</p> <p>Liberal Washingtonian sophisticates were vastly amused. The online magazine Slate began compiling an archive of Bushisms (\"updated daily\") which now runs to 11 long pages. Some of these are essentially malapropisms - \"hostile\" for \"hostage\", \"anecdote\" for \"antidote\", \"cufflink\" for \"handcuff\", \"preservation\" for \"perseverance\", or (my favourite) \"terrier\" for \"tariff barrier\". Others are expressions of plain ignorance, such as his admission that he thought Slovakia was the same place as Slovenia.</p> <p>A few, rather like Dan Quayle's best lines, have their own surreal splendour: \"I know the human being and the fish can coexist peacefully\"; \"families is where wings take dream\"; \"I am a person who recognises the fallacy of humans\"; \"it is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil: more and more of our imports come from overseas\"; \"you can't take the high horse and then claim the low road\"; \"will the highways on the internet become more few?\"</p> <p>At the start of this year, the American punditocracy seemed to assume that Bush's dunderheadedness would guarantee his eventual defeat. Yet he has now overtaken the studiously cerebral Al Gore, the self-proclaimed creator of the internet, who can probably identify the capital of Slovenia or the president of Pakistan in his sleep. Why?</p> <p>One reason is that many voters apparently don't want a president who makes them feel stupid. Bush himself is clearly aware of this, and now cracks self-mocking jokes about his linguistic incompetence at every opportunity. He was also quick to deny a suggestion in this month's Vanity Fair magazine that he has severe dyslexia, even though it might have won him some sympathy and disarmed his tormentors. (Musn't mock the afflicted, must we?) The implication of his rebuttal seemed to be: I ain't ill or disabled, I'm just a good old American dimwit - an amiable chump, a genial goof, a second Ronnie Reagan.</p> <p>But there is another message, albeit largely subliminal (or \"subliminable\", as Bush would say): You can trust me, cos I'm not smart enough to be devious and dishonest. Even when he is caught telling a whopper - as in last week's presidential debate, when he boasted of pushing through a patients' bill of rights which he had in fact vetoed - people seem willing to blame it on his feeble, faulty memory rather than wilful deceit.</p> <p>Al Gore, by contrast, is not only a smart-alec whose head bulges with hard-disk capacity but also a liar. Last month he told the Teamsters union that when he was a baby his mum lulled him to sleep by singing Look for the Union Label - a song which was written when Gore was 27 years old and had presumably outgrown his cradle. The story is about as plausible as Tony Blair's recollection of watching Jackie Milburn play football for Newcastle.</p> <p>As with Blair, however, Gore's inventiveness isn't limited to harmless and endearing childhood anecdotes. Blair has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that he voted for Mike Foster's anti-hunting bill; Gore says that he was \"the author\" of the earned income tax credit, even though it was passed by Congress in 1975, two years before he entered the house. According to Andrew Rawnsley's book, Tony Blair lied about Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m gift to the Labour party; Al Gore's mendacity about his own fund-raising activities is eerily similar.</p> <p>Three years ago, Gore flatly denied that he had ever attended meetings at the White House to discuss illegal \"hard-money\" donations. When documents later surfaced showing that the vice-president had indeed been present, he told the FBI that he \"drank a lot of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a rest-room break\". (This ingenious alibi was promptly exploded by Harold Ickes, the former deputy chief of staff, who testified that he had always stopped the meetings when the vice-president left the room.) Under interrogation by the justice department in April this year, Gore was asked about more than 30 fund-raising \"coffee mornings\" which he had hosted at the White House before the last presidential campaign. He said he had \"no concrete recollection\" of any such events. Perhaps all those cups of coffee had kept him almost permanently in the lavatory.</p> <p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, various wiseacres have asserted that we are now at the End of History: that American-style democracy is the unimprovable culmination of human achievement, a universal model which all countries will henceforth copy. A glance at this year's contest between Dumbo and Pinocchio might make even Francis Fukuyama wonder if he spoke too soon.</p> <p>The one serious and substantial candidate, Ralph Nader, has been excluded from the televised debates and largely ignored by the mainstream media, perhaps for fear that he'll show up his rivals as a couple of bozos. Potential Nader supporters are being warned by liberal Democrats that unless they vote for Gore as \"the lesser of two evils\" they will be responsible for letting Bush into the Oval Office. This is a counsel of despair and desperation - \"like a man on a raft facing the decision of whether to drink seawater or his own urine\", in the words of Alexander Cockburn.</p> <p>Yet the American media is still gamely and patriotically pretending that the election confirms the sublime superiority of their version of democracy, and that the electorate should thank Gore and Bush for forcing it to decide between piss and the deep blue sea. A Washington Post editorial this week argued that although many aspects of the campaign were \"squalid\" and \"corrupt\", and although neither candidate had any obvious principles or \"inner conviction\", nevertheless both Gore and Bush were decent, admirable fellows: \"The nation this year is fortunate in its choice.\" The latest issue of Time magazine piles on the flattery: \"The Lover vs The Fighter ... With just two weeks to go, the campaigns have made the choice clear: Do you want Bush's pledges of civility or Gore's crusading punch?\"</p> <p>The lover versus the fighter!

      "bodyText": "During the American election campaign of 1992, President Bush delivered a scathing verdict on Messrs Clinton and Gore: \"My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than these two bozos.\" Now the United States may be about to elect an even bigger bozo - George W Bush. \"Dubya\" could certainly use some expert advice from Millie. Last November, a TV interviewer asked him to name the leaders of a few countries that were in the news. \"The new Pakistani general,\" Bush replied, having already failed with India and Chechnya, \"he's just been elected - not elected, this guy took over ...\" \"And can you name him?\" \"General, I can name the general.\" \"And it's ...?\" \"General.\" Liberal Washingtonian sophisticates were vastly amused. The online magazine Slate began compiling an archive of Bushisms (\"updated daily\") which now runs to 11 long pages. Some of these are essentially malapropisms - \"hostile\" for \"hostage\", \"anecdote\" for \"antidote\", \"cufflink\" for \"handcuff\", \"preservation\" for \"perseverance\", or (my favourite) \"terrier\" for \"tariff barrier\". Others are expressions of plain ignorance, such as his admission that he thought Slovakia was the same place as Slovenia. A few, rather like Dan Quayle's best lines, have their own surreal splendour: \"I know the human being and the fish can coexist peacefully\"; \"families is where wings take dream\"; \"I am a person who recognises the fallacy of humans\"; \"it is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil: more and more of our imports come from overseas\"; \"you can't take the high horse and then claim the low road\"; \"will the highways on the internet become more few?\" At the start of this year, the American punditocracy seemed to assume that Bush's dunderheadedness would guarantee his eventual defeat. Yet he has now overtaken the studiously cerebral Al Gore, the self-proclaimed creator of the internet, who can probably identify the capital of Slovenia or the president of Pakistan in his sleep. Why? One reason is that many voters apparently don't want a president who makes them feel stupid. Bush himself is clearly aware of this, and now cracks self-mocking jokes about his linguistic incompetence at every opportunity. He was also quick to deny a suggestion in this month's Vanity Fair magazine that he has severe dyslexia, even though it might have won him some sympathy and disarmed his tormentors. (Musn't mock the afflicted, must we?) The implication of his rebuttal seemed to be: I ain't ill or disabled, I'm just a good old American dimwit - an amiable chump, a genial goof, a second Ronnie Reagan. But there is another message, albeit largely subliminal (or \"subliminable\", as Bush would say): You can trust me, cos I'm not smart enough to be devious and dishonest. Even when he is caught telling a whopper - as in last week's presidential debate, when he boasted of pushing through a patients' bill of rights which he had in fact vetoed - people seem willing to blame it on his feeble, faulty memory rather than wilful deceit. Al Gore, by contrast, is not only a smart-alec whose head bulges with hard-disk capacity but also a liar. Last month he told the Teamsters union that when he was a baby his mum lulled him to sleep by singing Look for the Union Label - a song which was written when Gore was 27 years old and had presumably outgrown his cradle. The story is about as plausible as Tony Blair's recollection of watching Jackie Milburn play football for Newcastle. As with Blair, however, Gore's inventiveness isn't limited to harmless and endearing childhood anecdotes. Blair has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that he voted for Mike Foster's anti-hunting bill; Gore says that he was \"the author\" of the earned income tax credit, even though it was passed by Congress in 1975, two years before he entered the house. According to Andrew Rawnsley's book, Tony Blair lied about Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m gift to the Labour party; Al Gore's mendacity about his own fund-raising activities is eerily similar. Three years ago, Gore flatly denied that he had ever attended meetings at the White House to discuss illegal \"hard-money\" donations. When documents later surfaced showing that the vice-president had indeed been present, he told the FBI that he \"drank a lot of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a rest-room break\". (This ingenious alibi was promptly exploded by Harold Ickes, the former deputy chief of staff, who testified that he had always stopped the meetings when the vice-president left the room.) Under interrogation by the justice department in April this year, Gore was asked about more than 30 fund-raising \"coffee mornings\" which he had hosted at the White House before the last presidential campaign. He said he had \"no concrete recollection\" of any such events. Perhaps all those cups of coffee had kept him almost permanently in the lavatory. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, various wiseacres have asserted that we are now at the End of History: that American-style democracy is the unimprovable culmination of human achievement, a universal model which all countries will henceforth copy. A glance at this year's contest between Dumbo and Pinocchio might make even Francis Fukuyama wonder if he spoke too soon. The one serious and substantial candidate, Ralph Nader, has been excluded from the televised debates and largely ignored by the mainstream media, perhaps for fear that he'll show up his rivals as a couple of bozos. Potential Nader supporters are being warned by liberal Democrats that unless they vote for Gore as \"the lesser of two evils\" they will be responsible for letting Bush into the Oval Office. This is a counsel of despair and desperation - \"like a man on a raft facing the decision of whether to drink seawater or his own urine\", in the words of Alexander Cockburn. Yet the American media is still gamely and patriotically pretending that the election confirms the sublime superiority of their version of democracy, and that the electorate should thank Gore and Bush for forcing it to decide between piss and the deep blue sea. A Washington Post editorial this week argued that although many aspects of the campaign were \"squalid\" and \"corrupt\", and although neither candidate had any obvious principles or \"inner conviction\", nevertheless both Gore and Bush were decent, admirable fellows: \"The nation this year is fortunate in its choice.\" The latest issue of Time magazine piles on the flattery: \"The Lover vs The Fighter ... With just two weeks to go, the campaigns have made the choice clear: Do you want Bush's pledges of civility or Gore's crusading punch?\" The lover versus the fighter! Oh brave new world, that has such titans in it. The real \"choice\", alas, is rather less alluring: will it be the flubber or the fibber? Playing to the crowd I have been rebuked by the Rev Douglas Alexander, who conducted Donald Dewar's obsequies, for the \"tastelessness and insensitivity\" of my comments last week. For the benefit of the Rev and anyone else who missed the point, let me try again: the object of my mockery was not Donald Dewar, whom I liked, but the eccentric Blairite notion that the theme of the bloodthirsty book of Isaiah is \"social inclusion\". (I'm reminded of the prime minister's claim a few years ago that New Labour owed its philosophy to \"the ancient prophets of the Old Testament\".) Meanwhile, if Douglas Alexander wishes to pursue his campaign against tasteless and insensitive behaviour, he should have a word with his friend Tony Blair - who strode into Dewar's funeral, as he had done at Cardinal Hume's, grinning and waving to the crowd like a Spice Girl at a royal film premiere.",

      "body": "<p>I have spent most of the last week watching Al Gore do his best to lose an election. And make no mistake, this was Gore's to lose. He started out as the incumbent at a time of American dominance abroad and record-breaking prosperity at home - running against a graduate from the Dan Quayle school of political gravitas. It should have been a walk in the park. But Gore has succeeded in making it a slog in the mire.</p> <p>Of course, in a race this close everything could change between now and November 7. But the evidence so far is not encouraging. It's not just the bald poll numbers, which have George W Bush narrowly ahead. It's the state-by-state polls, crucial in a system where winning the right combination of states matters more than the total number of votes nationwide. Here's where Gore is in trouble. Places he should be able to call his own - Minnesota, Oregon, his native Tennessee - are suddenly in play, with Bush inching out front.</p> <p>But more important than any poll is the feel and atmosphere, the smell of the campaign - and that's what's turning against Gore. He's beginning to look like a loser. If that impression solidifies, he's done for: Americans like to back a winner and, if Bush is deemed the man, Gore's support will haemorrhage away.</p> <p>How has this happened? How has a candidate who should have coasted to the White House come to see it slip into the distance? The answer says lots about Al Gore, a fair bit about America - and much about the way our own politics could soon be heading.</p> <p>Here's a Gore soundbite I heard repeated perhaps a dozen times: \"This election is not about the past, it's about the future.\" Put that down as Gore mistake number one: he is not running on the record of the last eight years, he's running from it. Sure, he mentions the phenomenal prosperity Americans enjoy now, which they did not in 1992, but only in order to discuss how he might build on it.</p> <p>That may be honourable, but it is dumb politics. For it takes the current budget surplus as a given, an inevitable fact of nature which both Presidents Gore or Bush would enjoy. In an instant, the playing field is level - and Americans are not asked who deserves credit for this success, but to choose between rival plans on how to spend it. Gore's entire advantage is eroded.</p> <p>The flesh-and-blood embodiment of Gore's refusal to run on the recent record is, of course, Bill Clinton. The vice president never refers to the Clinton-Gore administration, even though it still enjoys sky-high approval ratings; nor does he refer to his boss by name; nor does he want to be seen with him in public. Score that as Gore mistake number two.</p> <p>The strategists say Clinton is still a turn-off to the crucial undecided voters in swing states, America's Worcestor Women, who regard the Prez as a sleaze. But by bowing to that tiny sliver of voters, Gore has robbed himself of the nuclear weapon of American politics: the best campaigner in the world. He could have had Clinton working below radar, energising the core Democratic vote, firing up black communities (where Clinton is still adored), doing radio ads, motivating workers in blue-collar states like Michigan. Instead, Gore has kept the big dog chained up, pining to be set free.</p> <p>How could Gore do this to himself? The answer probably has less to do with electoral calculation than egotism and petulance. The vice president is sick of being in the big guy's shadow; he desperately wants to win this one on his own, as \"my own man\". There is a horrible precedent here. In 1996, Israeli Labour party aides begged Shimon Peres to use TV ads centred on his much-loved (and slain) predecessor Yitzhak Rabin. But Peres was too proud. Like Gore, he wanted to win the election on his own. Instead, he lost it all by himself.</p> <p>Which brings us to the central problem of the Gore candidacy: his personality. The simple fact, repeated ad nauseam, is that the vice president does not connect. I'd read it before, but now I've seen it. I watched him address a trade union rally in downtown Manhattan, a hotel ballroom packed with activists and loyal Democrats. They were rooting for Al, desperate for him to do well. They lifted their heads and waved their banners, straining to make a connection with the candidate. And he spoke fluently and well. But the moment of connection - that near-telepathic moment of emotional docking that happens every time Bill Clinton steps into a room - just refused to happen. Gore's words seemed to skim over the audience, not one of them sinking in. At the rally's end the room drained instantly, a sure-sign of an ailing candidacy: when it's a good one, the punters can't tear themselves away.</p> <p>Part of the trouble is linguistic. Gore uses complex, Latinate vocabulary while his opponent prefers plain, Anglo-Saxon English. Asked about the Middle East, Gore urged the Palestinians to \"cease and desist\"; Bush said, \"Put down your rocks, put down your stones.\" Which message would you remember?</p> <p>This is why the three TV debates were all bad news for Gore. Technically he may have won, by being smarter than Bush, but that was not the problem. By sighing audibly in the first debate and marching over to Bush and, in Americanese, \"invading his personal space\" in the third, Gore came off as arrogant and obnoxious, a combination of school swot and playground bully. Bush, meanwhile, sounded sufficiently plausible on the issues to scrape across the threshold required of a presidential candidate - and was a whole lot more charming. One poll afterward found Bush beating Gore on the likeability index by 60 points to 31.</p> <p>Why does this matter? Because this is where this elections is being fought. Compulsory campaign stops these days are not the factory gates or county fair, but Regis Live and the Rosie O'Donnell Show: the Richard and Judy hour of American TV. Presidential candidates have to go on these shows, alongside Hollywood wannabes and breast cancer survivors, and be warm, open and friendly. Gore struggles. Bush is a natural.</p> <p>\"This is not a popularity contest,\" says the Gore team. But that's mistake number three. For that's exactly what this election has become. We are in the era of Big Brother democracy, with politics a national soap opera. Election day is like that Friday night moment on Channel 4, with the viewers deciding who to cast in America's lead role. Voters are not so much choosing the leader of the free world, as deciding which guy they want to see on their TV sets day in, day out for the next four years: Gore's voice droning on, or W - a guy who knows how to party?</p> <p>Clinton's to blame, of course. He turned the Oval Office into the Big Brother house, a voyeurs' den of sex and psychodrama. He survived each week, but the deputy enjoys none of his luck.

He also pledged \u00a350m to tackle the growing waste mountain through kerbside recycling schemes, and a similar sum to improve local environments affecting 700,000 people. His speech was applauded for its sentiment and its analysis of global and national problems but criticised for its lack of initiatives. \"It takes two to tango,\" said Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth. \"Mr Blair's speech contained some sharp analysis of how environmental action can be good for the economy and for business. Now we want to see specific and radical green policies in Labour's manifesto for a second term.\" Mr Secrett questioned Mr Blair's assertion that he was \"neither pro nor anti\" GM food, saying that No 10 and the cabinet office had intervened repeatedly to support the biotech industry. Lynn Sloman, of Transport 2000, said: \"At long last Mr Blair has made explicit the link between using cars and climate change. We hope this marks a change of tack for a government which has been on the run from the motoring and haulage lobbies.\" Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace, said: \"We are pleased that the prime minister has accepted the royal commission on environmental pollution's case that we need to cut carbon dioxide emissions by at least 60% by 2050.\" He added that Mr Blair's stand would have to mean substantial investment in renewable technology. \"But we need to see the government move much further and more quickly.\" The prime minister confirmed that a \u00a350m carbon trust, paid for by a climate-change tax on businesses, would be launched next year to develop low-carbon technologies. The government was also strongly backing a potentially profitable international trading system for fossil fuel emissions. But Mr Blair was criticised for not doing more to help developing countries. \"The new money is paltry in comparison with the financial and human cost of climate related disasters the victims will be people already living on the very margins of existence\" said a Christian Aid spokesman. Mr Blair said: \"There are points of real conflict between the interest of consumption and the longer term interests of the environment and between the politicians' need to woo the electorate as well as lead it.We should proceed according to science and a set of common values. We should build a business case for the environment, working to harness clean technologies, seeing business as part of the answer rather than the problem.\"",

In a letter to the three main broadcasting companies, the Conservative chairman, Michael Ancram, yesterday formally tabled proposals involving all three parties. Mr Ancram suggested debates between William Hague and Tony Blair; Charles Kennedy and Mr Blair; and Mr Hague and Mr Kennedy. Separate arrangements would be made for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Tory proposals were welcomed as constructive by Sky TV news political editor, Adam Boulton, who said it was the job of the TV companies to come up with an offer the parties could not refuse. Divisions between the TV companies, indecision over the participation of the Liberal Democrats, and Labour reluctance to throw away a big poll lead all led to the collapse of protracted negotiations before the 1997 election. The Liberal Democrats' cam paign chairman, Lord Razzell, yesterday welcomed the idea of debates, saying: \"At a time when interest in the democratic process is in decline, leaders' debates would be a valuable way of reviving it\". But Lord Razzell also tabled some detailed objections, saying: \"We believe that three-way debates between the leaders of the three main parties would be far preferable to a series of one-to-one gladiatorial contests on the lines which the Conservatives have proposed.\" The Conservatives want the debates believing that Mr Hague will reproduce his sparkling debating form seen frequently at prime ministers' questions.

The debates would be shown on BBC, ITV and Sky News, as well as broadcast on radio and the internet. The Tories reignited the issue of set piece TV debates such as those seen over the past few weeks in the US presidential election, at the Conservative party conference.

He got a taste of what is to come yesterday when Tory MPs demanded that he insist John Prescott turn up for a debate on fuel today.</p> <p>Yesterday Martin turned up for work on his first full day minus the wig which male predecessors have long worn.</p> <p>Some MPs took it as a good \"modernising\" signal as did those Opposition members who asked him for an emergency \"private notice question\" to ministers about the troubled British nuclear submarine fleet - and had the request granted, as they might not have under the Boothroyd regime.</p> <p>With bitterness lingering in both main parties about the election Mr Martin's Labour allies remain confident that he has the skills to heal the wounds which saw most Labour MPs ignore pleas of senior ministers to back Tory grandee Sir George Young on the grounds that it was \"their turn\".</p> <p>So angry were Labour backbenchers at being asked to disown a trade union veteran in favour of an Old Etonian that they were threatening to unseat Clive Soley as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) next month as a punishment for voting for Sir George.</p> <p>Some Conservatives admitted privately that \"we picked the wrong candidate\". Sir George was - by coincidence in the aftermath of the Hatfield crash - the transport secretary who carried through rail privatisation.</p> <p>In the event he won nearly 70 Labour votes, including 25 ministers on Tony Blair's payroll, and cut Mr Martin's majority to 76, 341 to 170, the closest vote of the night. Later Labour ex-cabinet minister, Dr David Clark, got the winner down to a 257-192 victory. Around 130 Labour MPs and some senior Tories and Lib Dems backed him.</p> <p>But Tory dismay was linked to the fact that Mr Martin was one of only three of the 12 candidates not to have a sponsor from a rival party. Conservative displeasure was shown again yesterday by only thin cheers on their side for the new Speaker and by the refusal of all but 11 Conservative MPs to back him in the final symbolic vote on Monday.</p> <p>An opening speech by the Labour MP who proposed his candidacy in the Commons, Peter Snape, set the tone for Monday's debates as he stressed Mr Martin's working class credentials and took a sideswipe at the media to further rally Labour's core vote. The tactic worked. Even yesterday the slightest questioning of his suitability was met with charges of southern snobbery from MPs who backed the new Speaker to the hilt.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Martin got a predictably hostile press from sections of the London based media to whom he is an unknown quantity.</p> <p>Allies insist \"he'll be fine.

      "bodyText": "Twenty-four hours after she resigned as an MP Betty Boothroyd was last night made a life peer as Michael Martin, her successor in the Speaker's chair at Westminster, moved to assert his authority over a sharply divided Commons. In an unprecedented move Mr Martin will this morning stage a press conference to signal his support for changing the election process for his own job and other reforms of parliament's creakier procedures. A secret ballot for future speakers is expected to be introduced though not before Mr Martin has endured a baptism of fire as tempers rise on both sides in the pre-election run-up. He got a taste of what is to come yesterday when Tory MPs demanded that he insist John Prescott turn up for a debate on fuel today. Yesterday Martin turned up for work on his first full day minus the wig which male predecessors have long worn. Some MPs took it as a good \"modernising\" signal as did those Opposition members who asked him for an emergency \"private notice question\" to ministers about the troubled British nuclear submarine fleet - and had the request granted, as they might not have under the Boothroyd regime. With bitterness lingering in both main parties about the election Mr Martin's Labour allies remain confident that he has the skills to heal the wounds which saw most Labour MPs ignore pleas of senior ministers to back Tory grandee Sir George Young on the grounds that it was \"their turn\". So angry were Labour backbenchers at being asked to disown a trade union veteran in favour of an Old Etonian that they were threatening to unseat Clive Soley as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) next month as a punishment for voting for Sir George. Some Conservatives admitted privately that \"we picked the wrong candidate\". Sir George was - by coincidence in the aftermath of the Hatfield crash - the transport secretary who carried through rail privatisation. In the event he won nearly 70 Labour votes, including 25 ministers on Tony Blair's payroll, and cut Mr Martin's majority to 76, 341 to 170, the closest vote of the night. Later Labour ex-cabinet minister, Dr David Clark, got the winner down to a 257-192 victory. Around 130 Labour MPs and some senior Tories and Lib Dems backed him. But Tory dismay was linked to the fact that Mr Martin was one of only three of the 12 candidates not to have a sponsor from a rival party. Conservative displeasure was shown again yesterday by only thin cheers on their side for the new Speaker and by the refusal of all but 11 Conservative MPs to back him in the final symbolic vote on Monday. An opening speech by the Labour MP who proposed his candidacy in the Commons, Peter Snape, set the tone for Monday's debates as he stressed Mr Martin's working class credentials and took a sideswipe at the media to further rally Labour's core vote. The tactic worked. Even yesterday the slightest questioning of his suitability was met with charges of southern snobbery from MPs who backed the new Speaker to the hilt. Yesterday Mr Martin got a predictably hostile press from sections of the London based media to whom he is an unknown quantity. Allies insist \"he'll be fine. You won't get the histrionics we had with Betty, more of a quiet but firm word in people's ear. And he'll stand up to the government\".",

      "bodyText": "Confidential intelligence agency reports may show the car bombing of Jewish targets in London six years ago was part of a secret \"tit for tat\" war between Israel and Iran and had nothing to do with two Palestinian students convicted at the Old Bailey, the court of appeal heard yesterday. Lawyers acting for Jawad Botmeh, 31, and Samar Alami, 33, said important and relevant information presented to M15 before the explosions was not disclosed at the time of the trial, even though it could have affected the outcome. Michael Mansfield, QC, said revelations in a Sunday newspaper three years ago by the former MI5 officer David Shayler cast doubt on prosecution speculation that the bombing of the Israeli embassy, and a second blast at the offices of Jewish charities in north London, had been down to \"homegrown\" Palestinian extremists, working on their own. Shayler's information pointed to a much larger and more sophisticated organisation being responsible for the bombings, the court heard. According to Shayler, a reliable source had warned M15 that an attack on the Israeli embassy was imminent. But a report was shelved and the police were not notified. Attempts to establish the truth of Shayler's claims had been stifled, the court heard. The home secretary Jack Straw had signed \"public interest immunity\" (PII) certificates preventing disclosure, throwing a blanket of secrecy over intelligence agency information. Demands for intelligence reports on attacks in other countries, particularly the car bombing of a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires shortly before the London campaign, had been rejected, Mr Mansfield said. \"It is unrealistic for the crown to dig in like this when similar attacks at a similar time by agents or groups with hostility to Israel must be relevant. \"We believe there is more information that may link London to Buenos Aires and to a secret war that has been going on between Iran and Israel.\" Attempts to find out what role Israeli government agents had played in examining the scene of the Israeli embassy blast had also come to nothing, Mr Mansfield said. \"Somebody undoubtedly did come from Israel and for some reason nobody knows who they were or what they took away from the scene or what conclusions they came to.\" The type of explosive used in the Israeli embassy bomb was also still a mystery, the court heard. Mr Mansfield told Lord Justice Rose, Mr Justice Hooper and Mr Justice Goldring, that the appellants had received \"no more material at all\" since their convictions, despite concern that key evidence was being withheld. Botmeh and Alami, both British residents, were jailed for 20 years in December 1996 for conspiracy to cause explosions in the UK. The pair, graduates from English universities, were convicted on the basis that they were part of a UK-based extremist terrorist cell. They admitted experimenting in an amateurish way with a certain type of explosive in order to provide technical information for the protection of their home communities in Palestine. But they denied involvement in the bombings, insisting the explosions in London were counter-productive. The pair were granted leave to appeal on the grounds that information covered by the PII certificates could have affected the outcome of the trial. Their lawyers claim that the non-disclosure breached the Human Rights Act and Article 6 of the European Human Rights Convention entitling everyone to a fair trial. The campaign to free Botmeh and Alami has been supported by Amnesty International and numerous politicians. In a joint statement, MPs Lynne Jones and Tony Benn said they believed there had been a miscarriage of justice. \"The conspiracy of which they are accused can only have been organised by a highly-trained professional and experienced group,\" they said. The hearing continues.",

He is a genuine cosmos fanatic, ready to seize even the slimmest chance of realising a lifelong fantasy. </p> <p>It is a preoccupation that dates back to his impressionable teenage years. The son of immigrants from Southern Italy who worked printing wine bottle labels in New York, he was enraptured as a 17-year-old by news of the Soviet Union's first satellite launch. He switched immediately to a degree in aerospace engineering and spent the first five years of his career working for Nasa. </p> <p>His passion was never shared by anyone in his family. \"If my mother were alive today she'd be sick with worry and crying all the time. My father would just think I'd gone crazy,\" he says. Neither his two sons nor his daughter - all grown up now - have inherited his enthusiasm. \"They think, 'That's just Dad for you'. They know if something happens, at least I will have been doing exactly what I wanted to do.\" </p> <p>His work with Nasa hardly touched the glamorous frontline field of space travel. \"I never thought I could become an astronaut myself. I was way down the food chain; I decided to do something constructive instead,\" he says. So he moved into investment management, where, legend has it, he began applying the mathematical formulas for space flight trajectories to investing - with some success. In the 70s he founded Wilshire Associates, a company which now looks after about $10bn in assets. </p> <p>Last week he abandoned his LA home (built, he says, in the style of an English manor house, with more rooms than he has ever bothered to count) to travel to Star City - an hour's drive from Moscow - for the final three months of preparation. </p> <p>He has brought few belongings with him; the shelves are covered only with space manuals and piles of tiny flash cards (space-ship vocabulary written in English on one side, in Russian on the other) for testing himself as he battles to learn enough Russian to talk to his two fellow crew members in time for lift-off. Next to a Russian dictionary are two jars of spaghetti sauce and some cook-in-the-bag pasta spirals. Without the chefs and servants who normally attend to him, Tito is relearning how to make his own meals. \"I don't think of myself as a rich guy any more. I'm a trainee cosmonaut and I'm living like a soldier,\" he says. </p> <p>While he has adapted swiftly to the frugality of his new life, he admits that overall conditions at the centre came as something of a surprise. No longer the showcase of a superpower, the complex is heavy with an atmosphere of decayed glory. This was the high-security centre where Yury Gagarin trained for his mission to space, the place that led the world to develop frontier-breaking technology in the 60s, an integral weapon in the USSR's cold-war struggles against America. Now it has the time-warp atmosphere of a dusty 70s-era science museum. </p> <p>A young soldier still stands by a checkpost at the entrance to the cosmonaut's town, but he doesn't have the energy to go through the rigmarole of security checks. \"You want to go in? Go on in then,\" he says, casually lifting the barrier. </p> <p>Concrete apartment blocks were built in the 50s as prestigious housing for the Soviet cosmonaut elite. Shabbier now, the flats remain - a washing line of frozen socks and underpants hanging from almost every balcony. The people who put man into space are surviving in a world without washer-driers. The only modern buildings on site are three large wooden-panelled ranch-style buildings - the Americans' cottages, imported for visiting US astronauts. Everywhere there are stained-glass windows with images of soaring pilots, mosaics showing cosmonauts floating up to space in small bubbles, statues of once proud, now dead, astronauts. These serve to depress rather than to inspire. </p> <p>It is not only the buildings but the machines that feel ancient. The mock-up space capsules - identical to the Soyuz capsule Tito will be travelling in during his journey to Mir - are filled with heavy, clunking dials and fat, yellowing, plastic switches. The equipment appears to pre-date the invention of the microchip. </p> <p>\"This is technology you would expect to see in a 50-year-old car. These are the kind of switches that you would find in an aeroplane from the 40s,\" he says, pointing at pictures in the instruction manual he is studying at night. </p> <p>His enthusiasm does not allow him to dwell on the negative for long, however. \"At least it's easy to see how it works. There is a simplicity to this 40- to 50-year-old technology; it has all been proven to work and, as long as it does the job, basic technology is fine. The cosmonauts can go up there and fix things, in the same way that you can open the bonnet and fix up your 50s car.\" </p> <p>There are some computers, but their role is not central, he says. \"A bicycle doesn't have a computer on it, but you know how it works and it will get you from A to B safely.\" Tito labours this point for some time, as if he draws personal reassurance from these arguments. </p> <p>After six weeks of preliminary training, he is already very familiar with the kind of equipment he will be using during his trip. As well as psychological testing, to ensure he was mentally up to the journey, he has undergone tough physical endurance tests to guarantee his suitability. </p> <p>The most alarming was the centrifuge. In a huge circular warehouse, a crane contraption has been designed to spin a capsule, carrying a trainee cosmonaut, around the room hundreds of times a minute. People not suited to space travel pass out during this test, designed to recreate the G-force of 3.5 which astronauts experience as they tear through the atmosphere. The effect is to make you feel three and a half times heavier than your normal weight, and it is like being \"whacked against a wall\", he says. He survived being taken up to a G-force of 8, coming out with nothing worse than the sensation of having undergone \"a Beverly Hills cosmetic lift\". </p> <p>Then there was the altitude chamber, where pressure and oxygen levels are reduced. (Tito passed the alertness test, reciting telephone numbers of ex-girlfriends to himself as it became harder to breathe.) Then the vestibular training - being spun around in a chair to determine how sick you begin to feel - and the weightlessness training in an aeroplane which is dipping and diving to create a gravity-free sensation. </p> <p>He also has one-on-one rocket science tuition, teaching him about Mir - so that, if necessary, he can perform the occasional task on board. </p> <p>Listing what he has been subjected to, Tito concludes that space tourism in its current form is unlikely to win mass appeal. \"I've made sacrifices of time, comfort and money and I still don't know if I'm going to be able to fly. Not everyone can put up with that.\" </p> <p>But he fails to see anything strange about his own desire to fly. With his old-fashioned delight in rockets and stars, Tito sees beyond the decay that surrounds him to a glorious vision of space travel. \"It has always been the nature of mankind to explore new frontiers. It's only natural to want to go beyond our planet to explore and colonise other planets,\" he says happily. \"In a few thousand years we'll have colonies on Mars.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former Conservative prime minister Sir Edward Heath, who became Father of the House of Commons, last night ended intense speculation about his future and announced his retirement as an MP after more than 50 years at Westminster. His letter to party activists in Old Bexley and Sidcup prompted a flood of tributes to the politician who took a wary Britain into Europe in 1973 - hoping in vain that he had finally settled the country's post-imperial destiny. Instead, the man who had drastically reformed trade union law suddenly fell from power over a miners' strike. Ousted by Margaret Thatcher in a Palace of Westminster coup in 1975, he resorted to one of the longest sulks in public life over his treatment by her. As the former prime minister (1970-74) last night flew out of London to visit Japan and China - where he is held in very high regard as a friend - Tony Blair spoke of his \"outstanding contribution\" and political courage. William Hague said he would be \"greatly missed\" while Michael Heseltine likened his European achievements to victory in the second world war. But Lady Thatcher, whom Sir Edward regularly denounced for 25 years, made no immediate statement. Though he aroused fierce loyalty among Europhile Tories like Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, Sir Edward was seen as a \"traitor\" and \"virtually a socialist\" by Thatcherite Tories. To them Europe and economic pragmatism were his great crimes. The decision by Sir Edward, 84, to step down at the coming general election - which had been widely predicted but never quite believed - came the day after he presided over a seven-hour process to elect Labour's Michael Martin as new Speaker of the Commons. Like much else in his career, Sir Edward's handling of the election had provoked both praise and criticism, much of it from MPs on both sides, who argued that he should have used his authority to change the rules - and get the 12-candidate election over with in two quick ballots. Last night he stressed that the timing of his decision had nothing to do with that controversy, but was tied to Conservative HQ's deadline of November 1 for older members to state their intentions for the coming election. In 1997 the amateur yachtsman and musician - who conducted great orchestras - had a majority of 3,569 (6.9%) over Labour, which will now try to seize the seat. Sir Edward's 50 years of unbroken service as an MP fell short of David Lloyd George's 54 years and that of his hero, Sir Winston Churchill, who served 62 years in all. Like Sir Edward, Churchill, who stayed an MP until he was 89, also rejected a peerage. In the 50s, Sir Edward had been one of Churchill's rising young stars. Colleagues at Westminster had said that Sir Edward's constituency activists hoped he would quit, but did not want to hurt his feelings by asking. He was still busy locally and yesterday Barry Fowler, his Bexley secretary, called him a \"national and international politician who never once forgot his constituents\". Beset by European problems of his own, Mr Blair struck a more ambiguous note. \"It was Sir Edward who took this country into the European community and he can be justly proud of that. Whether you agree with his views or not, no one is ever in any doubt what they are,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, yesterday pointedly refused to give his backing to the chief executive of Railtrack as more worries over the maintenance of Britain's railways were revealed. Speaking after delivering a Commons statement on last week's Hatfield crash, which occurred while he was in China, Mr Prescott rejected a call by Bernard Jenkin, shadow transport minister, that he publicly support Mr Corbett. Mr Corbett's offer of resignation was spurned by Railtrack's board, but Mr Prescott said: \"If the argument is whether Mr Corbett has done the job rightly or wrongly, I'll wait for an inquiry to make some judgment about that.\" Mr Prescott said his junior Lord Macdonald's apparent endorsement of Mr Corbett last week referred to the relief that there would be continuity within the rail industry. The deputy prime minister drew attention to the fact that the broken rail which contributed towards the Hatfield crash had been known about in March and had still not been mended. \"That does seem to be a management failure. There was an offer of a resignation and I assume a resignation means that something had gone wrong on behalf of the management.\" Mr Prescott's comments came as it was revealed that Railtrack had sent a scathing letter about a major track repair scheme to Balfour Beatty, contractors on the Hatfield line repairs, only two weeks before the derailment. In a letter leaked to BBC North, the company describes work on approaches to Leeds station, one of the busiest on the national network, as far below required standards. The letter from Mick Pollard of Railtrack calls workmanship \"appalling\" and describes how the safety inspection team from Railtrack witnessed the effects at first hand. A strongly worded memo from Railtrack to managers refers to \"crap efficiency\" at Leeds and a failure by Balfour Beatty to manage the work tightly enough. Mr Pollard said joints requiring four connecting bolts had been left with only three because of a shortage, protective covers were lifted off or broken, and cables had been left loose in ballast rather than being pinned to sleepers. This demonstrated ignorance \"coupled with a lack of discipline and rigour among the supervisors\". That memo followed another leaked letter from Railtrack to the company revealed last week in which Railtrack complained that 82% of faults on the east coast main line had not been rectified. It warned Balfour Beatty that each defect could have led to a derailment.

They will be among the first satellites with their own internet address, since one day satellites could push the world wide web into orbit.

      "bodyText": "Two \"downsized\" satellites designed to swing more than 20,000 miles out into space twice a day could point the way to a generation of smarter and much smaller spacecraft. A pair of the 100kg \"micro satellites\", known as STRVs and packed with 25 pieces of experimental equipment, will \"piggyback\" along with a bigger payload aboard Europe's giant Ariane 5 when the rocket blasts off from French Guyana next month. The STRVs - space technology research vehicles - will go into a huge 12-hour elliptical orbit moving, at their nearest, 600km from the earth, and, at their most distant, up to 39,000km away. In a deliberate test of their ability to survive years in space, the satellites will be swinging through the Van Allen belt, a kind of radiation firewall around the earth. The satellites follow on the heels of a similar 1994 experiment but with new hardware and communication gadgetry, according to Dera, the defence evaluation and research agency, which unveiled them yesterday. They will be among the first satellites with their own internet address, since one day satellites could push the world wide web into orbit. They will carry new kinds of carbon fibre joints never before tested in space, lithium ion batteries, and a microprocessor hardened against space radiation. The important thing, however, is their size. Being compact and light, they can ride with bigger launch payloads, which will bring down the costs of putting hardware into space. And they open the way for an earth observation satellite that can, from space, resolve objects just 2.5m wide. \"Five or six years ago, you were talking about a one-ton satellite, something 10 times the size, with that sort of capability,\" said Richard Blott, Dera business projects manager.

      "bodyText": "South Africa yesterday attempted to end the row over President Thabo Mbeki's controversial views on the causes of Aids by launching a nationwide health campaign which implicitly repudiates the presidential opinion. The minister of health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, told reporters in Soweto yesterday that the new guidelines for healthcare workers were intended to help implement the government's five-year plan released earlier this year. She insisted the government operated on the premise that HIV caused Aids - earlier this year Mr Mbeki attracted withering international criticism for associating with dissident theorists who doubt whether HIV is the sole cause of the disease. The ANC government's new campaign, launched in full-page newspaper advertisements, emphasises the benefits of safe sex and the use of condoms and faithfulness between partners. But criticisms remained last night that despite the new campaign, the Mbeki government was still failing to issue anti-retroviral drugs to an estimated 4.2m citizens already carrying the virus. The charge has been exploited by the opposition Democratic Alliance. With a eye to local government elections on December 5 - the first test of the Mbeki presidency since the general election - they have promised to distribute the medicines free of charge in municipalities which fall under their control. The opposition leader, Tony Leon, is expected in Europe this week for negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies on the supply of anti-retroviral drugs at reduced prices. The ANC hit back angrily by claiming that the opposition offer mounted to an attempt to use black people as guinea pigs in drug experiments. Evoking parallels with experiments with poisons carried out on blacks during apartheid, the ANC's chief spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama, said: \"We find it quite outrageous that this issue, which is at the core of survival of humanity, can be exploited for political grandstanding. \"[South Africans] are being used as guinea pigs and conned into using dangerous and toxic drugs that are detrimental to their own health.\" There are indications that support for Mr Mbeki is declining as a result of his stand. Recent polls indicate that his personal popularity has fallen from 71% in May to 52.2%. In spite of the ministry of health claim that the government accepts the causal link between HIV and Aids, political insiders close to the presidency report that Mr Mbeki, if anything, is becoming more emphatic in his contrary stand. Earlier this month a leaked account of an ANC parliamentary caucus meeting had him not only reasserting his denial of a causal link between HIV and Aids but claiming that the truth was being covered up by a conspiracy among the drugs companies, backed by the CIA. He claimed that the international conspiracy to undermine him and South Africa had been mounted because the country was seen as an emerging leader of the developing nations in its challenge to the world economic order. He also said there was a campaign to brand him as being deranged and the government was investigating those responsible.",

      "body": "<p>Step foward GoVia, the Anglo-French company, charged with the near impossible job of trying to run the most congested rail network in Britain. Yesterday its close rival, Connex, became the first victim of one of the government's two regulators, in a political move designed to show that ministers and regulators know what it is good for commuters.</p> <p>Sir Alastair Morton, the man responsible for building the Channel Tunnel, wielded his axe and it fell on the neck of one of Britain's worst performing rail companies. It has become a legend in its own lifetime, infamous for running short trains, packing in passengers, and allowing the public to sit in some of the dirtiest rolling stock in Britain.</p> <p>Connex and GoVia have one thing in common. The French like them. Connex, which has been operating the south central franchise from London through Surrey and Sussex for the past four years, is owned by the French multi-national, Vivendi, while the French state railway, SNCF, has a 35% stake in GoVia.</p> <p>It would ironic, not to say remarkable, if SNCF, a railway underpinned by considerable support from the French taxpayer, eventually found itself in charge of GoVia, at a time when the British government clearly believes that state control of the railways is out of date.</p> <p>What Connex and GoVia do not have in common is that GoVia controls Thames Trains, the company at the heart of the Paddington rail crash: one of its employees, driver Hodder, went through a red light. Investigations after the event brought before Lord Cullen's inquiry into the disaster, revealed that Thames has a poor record in driver training and in scutinising new employees.</p> <p>So, Sir Alastair, now chairman of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority, the government's son of British Rail, was in a cleft stick. The SSRA is supposed to be government's main representative on the platform, the trains and the booking offices. It has the power to divvy out 25 rail franchises and to withdraw them if companies under perform. Was it to be the unpopular incumbent Connex, or alternatively the company associated with Paddington?</p> <p>In the case of Connex, the public had long decided that it should go, so Sir Alastair was only responding to the public mood. If he had decided to award Connex a new 20-year franchise, he might have been strung up on Platform One at East Croydon by angry commuters.</p> <p>The SSRA can only blame itself for getting into this position. There were other bidders, but it boxed itself in by deciding that only Connex and GoVia should finally contest the franchise.</p> <p>Yesterday's announcement was presented as an example of the industry acting in the interests of the public. But it still remains an act of faith. Very little separated the companies in terms of presentation. Both promised to invest around \u00a31.5bn in the franchise over the next 20 years. It sounds a lot, but boils down to less than \u00a3170m a year, with a guaranteed commuter base.</p> <p>The announcement also puts the SSRA under the public spotlight. This is John Prescott's great white hope for the future of the railways. It is looked on as the new vibrant organisation, giving a lead to a rapidly expanding industry written off after privatisation. More than 18 months have passed since Sir Alastair was appointed chairman, and yet the industry is still crying out for a strategy. Promised for months, it has been constantly delayed: it should finally emerge before the end of the year.</p> <p>Instead of announcing a strategy, the SSRA invited train companies to come forward with their own ideas as they start their bidding in the re-franchising process.

      "bodyText": "Step foward GoVia, the Anglo-French company, charged with the near impossible job of trying to run the most congested rail network in Britain. Yesterday its close rival, Connex, became the first victim of one of the government's two regulators, in a political move designed to show that ministers and regulators know what it is good for commuters. Sir Alastair Morton, the man responsible for building the Channel Tunnel, wielded his axe and it fell on the neck of one of Britain's worst performing rail companies. It has become a legend in its own lifetime, infamous for running short trains, packing in passengers, and allowing the public to sit in some of the dirtiest rolling stock in Britain. Connex and GoVia have one thing in common. The French like them. Connex, which has been operating the south central franchise from London through Surrey and Sussex for the past four years, is owned by the French multi-national, Vivendi, while the French state railway, SNCF, has a 35% stake in GoVia. It would ironic, not to say remarkable, if SNCF, a railway underpinned by considerable support from the French taxpayer, eventually found itself in charge of GoVia, at a time when the British government clearly believes that state control of the railways is out of date. What Connex and GoVia do not have in common is that GoVia controls Thames Trains, the company at the heart of the Paddington rail crash: one of its employees, driver Hodder, went through a red light. Investigations after the event brought before Lord Cullen's inquiry into the disaster, revealed that Thames has a poor record in driver training and in scutinising new employees. So, Sir Alastair, now chairman of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority, the government's son of British Rail, was in a cleft stick. The SSRA is supposed to be government's main representative on the platform, the trains and the booking offices. It has the power to divvy out 25 rail franchises and to withdraw them if companies under perform. Was it to be the unpopular incumbent Connex, or alternatively the company associated with Paddington? In the case of Connex, the public had long decided that it should go, so Sir Alastair was only responding to the public mood. If he had decided to award Connex a new 20-year franchise, he might have been strung up on Platform One at East Croydon by angry commuters. The SSRA can only blame itself for getting into this position. There were other bidders, but it boxed itself in by deciding that only Connex and GoVia should finally contest the franchise. Yesterday's announcement was presented as an example of the industry acting in the interests of the public. But it still remains an act of faith. Very little separated the companies in terms of presentation. Both promised to invest around \u00a31.5bn in the franchise over the next 20 years. It sounds a lot, but boils down to less than \u00a3170m a year, with a guaranteed commuter base. The announcement also puts the SSRA under the public spotlight. This is John Prescott's great white hope for the future of the railways. It is looked on as the new vibrant organisation, giving a lead to a rapidly expanding industry written off after privatisation. More than 18 months have passed since Sir Alastair was appointed chairman, and yet the industry is still crying out for a strategy. Promised for months, it has been constantly delayed: it should finally emerge before the end of the year. Instead of announcing a strategy, the SSRA invited train companies to come forward with their own ideas as they start their bidding in the re-franchising process. So far only two new franchises have been agreed, GoVia yesterday to replace Connex and Chiltern confirmed to operate its straightforward franchise between London and Birmingham several months ago. Other train companies are uncomfortable and critical. One of them said yesterday: \"We just don't know where we stand. Where is the blueprint for the industry? We should not be left in the dark.\" When it comes, will it reduce the industry to fewer train companies, allowing the strong to expand and the minnows to be swallowed up? Almost certainly, but the timescale for change is long and the landscape which would reduce the companies to three or four leading players will take several years to achieve. With clear doubts about the credentials of both Connex and GoVia, the SSRA could have adopted another option. It could have declared that neither was satisfactory and started the bidding process all over again. It would have delayed matters, but the Connex franchise was not due to expire until 2003, plenty of time for the SSRA to reconsider the issue. But there are political pressures on it to deliver and it has duly obliged. In an obvious reference to GoVia, it added the caveat yesterday that safety is paramount. So the SSRA will be closely monitoring the Cullen report into the Paddington crash and any implications for Thames Trains. Running the south central franchise, even with the re-modelled title of the New Southern Railway, will not be easy for GoVia. The name may evoke memories of kippers for breakfast on the Brighton Belle, and strike an immediate chord with passengers.

      "bodyText": "Women could be the answer to the armed forces' recruitment problem, the equal opportunities commission said yesterday. The army was short of more than 6,000 trained soldiers yet it barred women from 30% of posts, said Julie Mellor, chairwoman of the EOC which gives evidence today to the Commons defence committee's inquiry into staff shortages. \"Rather than automatically excluding women from certain posts, it makes sense to judge each individual on the basis of their ability to carry out the job, using relevant tests to measure their ability\", she said. \"If a woman can't pass the necessary tests, she would not be accepted to do the job. But we believe that the armed services are missing out on many good recruits\". But if women were to be retained, the culture within the services needed to change so that staff were given the support they needed. Attitudes towards women with children remained a problem, she said. Fathers, as well as mothers, needed time with their families, and it was clear that many cases of voluntary early release were related to this issue. \"Many women have also told us that they were not happy with the way their complaints of sexual harassment were dealt with,\" said Ms Mellor. \"In many cases they were not informed about the complaints procedure or they were dissuaded from using it.\" The commission pointed to research by David Segal of the US Centre for Research on Military Organisation. He concluded that there was no evidence to back up claims that women personnal had \"a negative impact\". He said similar arguments were used in the US to delay the integration of black and homosexual soldiers.",

      "body": "<p>It's a mystery, said Sir Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, yesterday when asked about sterling's remarkable strength against the euro. Equally baffling are the latest trade figures which show Britain recording a trade surplus with Europe for the first time in five years, despite the runaway pound. Export volumes were up 10% over the past three months, compared with a year ago, an impressive performance given the exchange rate. </p> <p>So why are the figures holding up? </p> <p>Firstly, manufacturers are slashing profit margins to keep a toehold in European markets and to ward off competition at home from cheap continental imports. As a result, manufacturing profitability has fallen sharply since the start of 1999. Firms are tightening their belts and cutting costs, and jobs, in order to stay afloat. In the first quarter of 2000, rates of return fell to below 7%, around half the rate earned in 1998. </p> <p>Faced with declining profitability, firms have moved upmarket in search of high quality products where they are no longer competing on price. Those stuck in low growth commodity markets - textiles, bulk chemicals and basic metals - are closing or moving overseas. </p> <p>The changing composition of Britain's manufacturing sector demonstrates the search for value: the fastest growing sectors are electrical and optical equipment, biotech and drugs, all producing goods which are less price sensitive. </p> <p>Britain's trade balance with Europe has been improving for nearly a year, which suggests that yesterday's figures are not just a flash in the pan.

      "bodyText": "It's a mystery, said Sir Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, yesterday when asked about sterling's remarkable strength against the euro. Equally baffling are the latest trade figures which show Britain recording a trade surplus with Europe for the first time in five years, despite the runaway pound. Export volumes were up 10% over the past three months, compared with a year ago, an impressive performance given the exchange rate. So why are the figures holding up? Firstly, manufacturers are slashing profit margins to keep a toehold in European markets and to ward off competition at home from cheap continental imports. As a result, manufacturing profitability has fallen sharply since the start of 1999. Firms are tightening their belts and cutting costs, and jobs, in order to stay afloat. In the first quarter of 2000, rates of return fell to below 7%, around half the rate earned in 1998. Faced with declining profitability, firms have moved upmarket in search of high quality products where they are no longer competing on price. Those stuck in low growth commodity markets - textiles, bulk chemicals and basic metals - are closing or moving overseas. The changing composition of Britain's manufacturing sector demonstrates the search for value: the fastest growing sectors are electrical and optical equipment, biotech and drugs, all producing goods which are less price sensitive. Britain's trade balance with Europe has been improving for nearly a year, which suggests that yesterday's figures are not just a flash in the pan. This raises the possibility that the pound may not be as overvalued as the markets are assuming. Do not expect the Treasury to celebrate Britain's improvement in competitiveness anytime soon, however. As long as the euro remains so unpopular with voters, the high pound can be used as an excuse for not joining. Off the rails John Prescott yesterday opened up fresh doubts again about the role of Railtrack's Gerald Corbett, whose belated love-in with some of the victims of the Paddington rail crash is remarkable.

I found them profoundly searching. I thought they presented an acute challenge to our reading of Scripture; to our moral and political consistency in the face of events fatefully unfolding on our television screens; to our reading of the history of the last century; and a challenge to our willingness to be identified as participants, because we are Christian, in today's crisis of the Holy Land.</p> <p>Behind that passage lies the significance of Hebron, first as the place of the burial of the patriarch Abraham, and then as the first capital for David's kingship before his capture of Jerusalem - a kingship which created the reality, the promise and the myth down to this day, of \"the land of Israel\". Of this reality, promise or myth, Hebron is therefore fundamentally symbolic. So, in the modern Israel, Hebron is a place of especially determined Jewish settlers, and a front line between them and such local people as remain. Our text is not separable from today's bitterness and violence.</p> <p>To our reading of Scripture, the challenge is not just that of remembering that Jews read these texts too, but differently - because there are Christians who read them as some Jews read them, justifying from them the presence, the history, the behaviour of the modern state of Israel and of the movements out of which it was born. The challenge is to wrestle with the implications of recognising that these texts are shot through with what we have come to see as the barbarous brutality of \"ethnic cleansing\". As such, they have played a part in forming what we would now see as among the darker episodes in our own colonial history; and in that of Imperial Russia and Nazi Germany, against Jews among others - and in Israel's dealings with those whom Joshua and Caleb's 20th-century successors found in possession of the Land of Promise.</p> <p>To our moral and our political consistency the challenge seems to me this: are we prepared to read the present crisis in the Holy Land through the lens with which we read the recent history of, say, Kosovan Albanians at the hands of Milosevic's Serbia, or of Marsh Arabs at the hands of Saddam Hussein's Iraq? With the further stimulus if we are Christians, that a significant minority of Palestinians are Christiansm- and that some see themselves as the direct descendants of the first Christian generations. Will it be just or acceptable if today's Kosovan refugees, and their children and grandchildren, are still in camps in Montenegro 50 years from now?</p> <p>But think, pray like this and the challenges press in upon our understanding of 20th-century history. Does the terrible reality of the Holocaust - built upon centuries of especially European persecution and ill-treatment of the Jews, and built in part upon New Testament texts which lent themselves to anti-semitic reading - require of European and North American Christians unlimited approval of the state of Israel?</p> <p>Was the land empty when the Jewish settlers arrived in the last century, or did they empty it? Whose was the land, and whose is it? Above all, whose was, and whose is, the uniquely symbolic Jerusalem - uniquely symbolic for Christians as well as for Jews and for Muslims - which with its holy places was under Muslim protection from 640 to 1914, with only short interludes of Crusader, and much less tolerant, rule?</p> <p>With which set of eyes do we view the settlements rising on so many hills, and the defended roads that cut through (as Palestinians see it) Palestinian land to link them; with which set of eyes do we view what Israel sees as generous concessions for which Palestinians should be grateful, and what Palestinians see as barely a start towards a long overdue return of what was so violently snatched from them? Will we work to understand the fundamental significance to both sides of the land; and the axiomatic Israeli determination, rooted in such terrible experience, never again to be dependent for their security on anyone other than themselves?</p> <p>Lastly, the challenge to see ourselves, as British descendants of those who undertook the Mandate and who made the Balfour Declaration, as Europeans in the light of the long horror of European anti-semitism, and as followers of one of the faiths for whom this is the Holy Land and Jerusalem a place of the most special significance - to see ourselves as sharing responsibility both that things are as they are, and for their resolution?</p> <p>Far more is here at stake than over Kosovo last year, or over Iraq in 1991. Only a genuinely international coalition can successfully press, but by means other than weaponry, for statehood and the return of at least some land for Palestinians, and for guaranteed security for Israel - and, as the Vatican has long urged, for an international responsibility for Old Jerusalem.</p> <p>Christians have long read my opening quotation as part of the long march of preparation for the Messiah Jesus, closing our eyes to elements in them that we now perceive to be ungodly, and viciously destructive.</p> <p>With our eyes opened by the terrible 20th century, they can jolt us into praying with understanding for those who still look to them as title deeds to land, and for those who still suffer from their doing so. They can jolt us into confessing our share of responsibility for what is happening and into a new commitment to take a part in discovering ways towards Shalom, which is well-being and justice and not just the absence of war.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:michael.scott-joynt@dial.pipex.com\">michael.scott-joynt@dial.pipex.com</a></p>",

With which set of eyes do we view the settlements rising on so many hills, and the defended roads that cut through (as Palestinians see it) Palestinian land to link them; with which set of eyes do we view what Israel sees as generous concessions for which Palestinians should be grateful, and what Palestinians see as barely a start towards a long overdue return of what was so violently snatched from them? Will we work to understand the fundamental significance to both sides of the land; and the axiomatic Israeli determination, rooted in such terrible experience, never again to be dependent for their security on anyone other than themselves? Lastly, the challenge to see ourselves, as British descendants of those who undertook the Mandate and who made the Balfour Declaration, as Europeans in the light of the long horror of European anti-semitism, and as followers of one of the faiths for whom this is the Holy Land and Jerusalem a place of the most special significance - to see ourselves as sharing responsibility both that things are as they are, and for their resolution? Far more is here at stake than over Kosovo last year, or over Iraq in 1991. Only a genuinely international coalition can successfully press, but by means other than weaponry, for statehood and the return of at least some land for Palestinians, and for guaranteed security for Israel - and, as the Vatican has long urged, for an international responsibility for Old Jerusalem. Christians have long read my opening quotation as part of the long march of preparation for the Messiah Jesus, closing our eyes to elements in them that we now perceive to be ungodly, and viciously destructive. With our eyes opened by the terrible 20th century, they can jolt us into praying with understanding for those who still look to them as title deeds to land, and for those who still suffer from their doing so. They can jolt us into confessing our share of responsibility for what is happening and into a new commitment to take a part in discovering ways towards Shalom, which is well-being and justice and not just the absence of war. michael.scott-joynt@dial.pipex.com",

      "bodyText": "Rail passenger groups may have been cheering as French group Connex was stripped of the right to run the busy London to south coast commuter line, but spare a thought for the shareholders of Go-Ahead. Their company's joint venture with SNCF, the state-backed owner of the French rail network, has been awarded the franchise to run the line for the next 20 years. At first glance the risks in taking on the franchise look frightening. In order to win the franchise the joint venture, called Go-Via, has pledged to invest up to \u00a31.5bn in the route over the course of the next 20 years. Analysts say the upfront investment will be around \u00a3100m. Then there are risks. Staff morale at Connex is already said to be at rock bottom. So it was not surprising to Go-Ahead, which is still under scrutiny for its role in the Paddington rail crash, that its shares closed 24.5p lower at 658p. But balanced against such concerns are the potential gains. Broker HSBC Securities reckons the franchise win is positive and has upgraded its rating to \"buy\" and set an 850p target price. The awarding of the franchise almost doubles the number of passengers using Go-Ahead's rail services. Go-Ahead already operates Thames Trains while Go-Via controls the Thameslink franchise which runs cross-London services. Strong full-year results from Go-Ahead - pretax profits were a better-than-expected \u00a344.8m - were largely attributable to the robust performance of its two rail franchises. The fact the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority has got tough and stripped Connex of its franchise means other incumbent operators could be facing the same fate and Go-Ahead could pick-up more franchises. Nevertheless, the risk lies in the execution. Go-Ahead's management, which recently rebuffed an 800p a share takeover offer, has much to prove. Hold on for the ride.",

Finally, the mention of some of our outstanding finalists of the 70s does not do justice to some subsequent finalists - Kimura Parker, Lortie, Berezovsky, Pizzaro, Vogt, McCawley and Madzar are all enjoying fine international careers. I can assure you the piano competition is continuing onwards and upwards. Fanny Waterman Chairman and artistic director, Leeds International Pianoforte Competition Andrew Clements implies that the decision to award Alessio Bax first prize at this year's competition was unanimous. As a member of the jury at Leeds, I am not at liberty to disclose how I, or any of my colleagues, voted. However, to set the record straight: the vote for Bax was by no means unanimous.

      "byline": "Neil Hume",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Time may be about to be called on the takeover offer for <strong> Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries</strong>. </p> <p>It is two months since entrepreneur Robert Breare first approached the pub and breweries group and, according to the market gossips, his interest is waning. </p> <p>Yesterday the stock price of the company - which brews Bank's, Cameron and Marston's bitter - slid 35.5p, or 8.34% to 390p, on talk that Mr Breare and his private equity backers have turned their attention to the pub estate of <strong> Whitbread</strong>, up 5p to 465p. </p> <p>Whitbread stunned the market last week by announcing plans to sell its 3,000-strong pub estate in order to concentrate on expanding hotel and leisure activities, such as its Marriott hotels and David Lloyd sports clubs. </p> <p>Analysts estimate that the Whitbread estate could fetch \u00a31.4bn. Admittedly, this is a tad higher than Mr Breare's tentative \u00a3470m offer for Wolves. The Whitbread business, however, is much cleaner - it has no breweries - and it has nothing like Wolves's \u00a3584m debt. </p> <p>Apparently Mr Breare and his private equity chums have become frustrated with the attitude of Wolves and its adviser, NM Rothschild. Although the firm put itself up for sale earlier this month and reopened talks, Mr Breare is still finding it tough gaining access to financial data needed to launch a formal bid, it is said. </p> <p>Sources close to Mr Breare admit that he has taken a look at the Whitbread estate, although they insist he is still interested in Wolves. </p> <p>This has led some to conclude that Mr Breare's new posture is nothing more than a negotiating tactic to reduce the offer price for Wolves. Aside from Whitbread, <strong> Bass</strong>, 1.5p higher at 671.5p, and <strong> Scottish &amp; Newcastle</strong>, off 1p to 446p, are also trying to offload pubs at the moment. </p> <p>Whether Mr Breare has turned his back on Wolves or not, one thing is clear - the shares have further to fall. </p> <p>The FTSE 100, meanwhile, ended higher for the fourth session as investors rekindled their love affair with telecommunications stocks. </p> <p>Opinion was divided over the reasons: there was relief among some that the Italian mobile licence auction has ended early, while others said the sector was \"bombed out\" and due to bounce. Broking powerhouse Morgan Stanley, which advised its clients to buy as many European telecom stocks as they could lay their hands on, may have had an influence. </p> <p>Whatever the reason, the effects were electrifying. Four of the five best performing blue chip stocks were from the sector. <strong> Colt Telecom</strong> led the charge, with a gain of 295p to \u00a322.80, closely followed by <strong> Energis</strong>, up 64p to 554, <strong> BT</strong>, 81p stronger at 788p, and <strong> Cable &amp; Wireless</strong>, 89p better at 950p. </p> <p>Lifted by these performances, the FTSE 100 ended up 122.5 points at 6,438.4, its best closing level since September 14. Over the past four sessions the blue chip index has gained nearly 300 points. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 rose 46 points to 6,564.1 and the Techmark powered ahead 114.8 to 3,541.25. </p> <p>Away from the telecoms sector, controls group <strong> Invensys</strong>, up 11p to 148p, continued to move higher on bid speculation. Traders reckon that a predator is building a stake. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate ladder dealers spent much of the day trying to spot the next takeover target. </p> <p>With the bids for plant hire group <strong> Hewden-Stuart, </strong> up 20.5p to 89p, and chemicals distributor <strong> Ellis &amp; Everard</strong>, 55p higher at 203.5p, now out in the open, the speculative money moved into estate agent <strong> Countrywide Assured</strong>, 8.5p better at 116.5p, and engineer <strong> Bodycote</strong>, up 24.5p to 190p. </p> <p>Stockbroker<strong> Collins Stewart</strong> made a strong debut, closing at 365p - a rise of 49p from its offer price. </p> <p><strong> Shire Pharmaceuticals</strong> fell 86p to \u00a313.09 on the news that its promotion to the FTSE 100 has been delayed.</p>",

Yesterday the stock price of the company - which brews Bank's, Cameron and Marston's bitter - slid 35.5p, or 8.34% to 390p, on talk that Mr Breare and his private equity backers have turned their attention to the pub estate of Whitbread, up 5p to 465p. Whitbread stunned the market last week by announcing plans to sell its 3,000-strong pub estate in order to concentrate on expanding hotel and leisure activities, such as its Marriott hotels and David Lloyd sports clubs. Analysts estimate that the Whitbread estate could fetch \u00a31.4bn. Admittedly, this is a tad higher than Mr Breare's tentative \u00a3470m offer for Wolves. The Whitbread business, however, is much cleaner - it has no breweries - and it has nothing like Wolves's \u00a3584m debt. Apparently Mr Breare and his private equity chums have become frustrated with the attitude of Wolves and its adviser, NM Rothschild. Although the firm put itself up for sale earlier this month and reopened talks, Mr Breare is still finding it tough gaining access to financial data needed to launch a formal bid, it is said. Sources close to Mr Breare admit that he has taken a look at the Whitbread estate, although they insist he is still interested in Wolves. This has led some to conclude that Mr Breare's new posture is nothing more than a negotiating tactic to reduce the offer price for Wolves. Aside from Whitbread, Bass, 1.5p higher at 671.5p, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, off 1p to 446p, are also trying to offload pubs at the moment. Whether Mr Breare has turned his back on Wolves or not, one thing is clear - the shares have further to fall. The FTSE 100, meanwhile, ended higher for the fourth session as investors rekindled their love affair with telecommunications stocks. Opinion was divided over the reasons: there was relief among some that the Italian mobile licence auction has ended early, while others said the sector was \"bombed out\" and due to bounce. Broking powerhouse Morgan Stanley, which advised its clients to buy as many European telecom stocks as they could lay their hands on, may have had an influence. Whatever the reason, the effects were electrifying. Four of the five best performing blue chip stocks were from the sector. Colt Telecom led the charge, with a gain of 295p to \u00a322.80, closely followed by Energis, up 64p to 554, BT, 81p stronger at 788p, and Cable &amp; Wireless, 89p better at 950p. Lifted by these performances, the FTSE 100 ended up 122.5 points at 6,438.4, its best closing level since September 14. Over the past four sessions the blue chip index has gained nearly 300 points. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 rose 46 points to 6,564.1 and the Techmark powered ahead 114.8 to 3,541.25. Away from the telecoms sector, controls group Invensys, up 11p to 148p, continued to move higher on bid speculation. Traders reckon that a predator is building a stake. Lower down the corporate ladder dealers spent much of the day trying to spot the next takeover target. With the bids for plant hire group Hewden-Stuart, up 20.5p to 89p, and chemicals distributor Ellis &amp; Everard, 55p higher at 203.5p, now out in the open, the speculative money moved into estate agent Countrywide Assured, 8.5p better at 116.5p, and engineer Bodycote, up 24.5p to 190p. Stockbroker Collins Stewart made a strong debut, closing at 365p - a rise of 49p from its offer price. Shire Pharmaceuticals fell 86p to \u00a313.09 on the news that its promotion to the FTSE 100 has been delayed.",

Mr Straw sparked an outcry among Labour MPs in May when he allowed the American former world heavyweight champion and convicted rapist into Britain for the second time in six months despite protests from women's groups that his visits made a mockery of the government's stand against domestic violence. Visitors who have been sentenced to 10 years or more in prison or been convicted of a crime involving violence, sexual violence or guns, will be refused entry to Britain by immigration officers under the rule changes. The new rules will put the onus on visitors who have been to jail for any term to declare their criminal convictions when they arrive in Britain. Failure to do so will result in them being charged with \"deceiving an immigration officer\" and facing deportation as illegal entrants. At the time of the Tyson affair, Mr Straw complained that the existing immigration rules were unfair and inconsistent in that they only tended to catch \"celebrity villains\" whose visits were discussed in the media or who were recognised by immigration staff. Only about 10 to 20 people a year have been prevented from entering Britain under the old rules even though they were theoretically much \"tougher\" because they were supposed to ban anyone who had served a sentence of more than 12 months. On both visits by Tyson, who came to Britain to fight in \"pay per view\" boxing promotions, Mr Straw allowed him to enter the country under an \"exceptional circumstances\" clause.

But, envisaging billions of pounds in profits, the atomic energy minister, Yevgeni Adamov, has submitted a bill to parliament which would allow not only nuclear waste processing but also storage.</p> <p>The new legislation could be passed by the end of the year, making it possible for major nuclear countries to add Russia to the list of repositories for their troublesome waste.</p> <p>Russian government documents obtained by Greenpeace propose that more than 20,000 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel be imported initially, and name 14 countries from Japan to Germany as possible clients.</p> <p>The atomic energy ministry estimates income of \u00a314bn, half of which would be profit, the other half used to build and maintain the storage facilities. Four possible sites are being considered, in the Urals, the far east, and the far north.</p> <p>An alternative plan, believed to be supported by the US, has an American company, Non-Proliferation Trust Inc, pushing for the Russian storage of 10,000 tonnes of foreign nuclear waste.</p> <p>A strong signal of the Russian nuclear lobby's determination to take in the world's waste came on Monday when Bulgaria disclosed that Mr Adamov told Sofia last week that the waste obtained from reprocessing spent fuel from the latter's Kozloduy plant would not be returned from Russia to Bulgaria for storage.</p> <p>\"Temporary storage\" of such material \"might bring considerable profit to Russia and would not be detrimental to the ecology\", Mr Adamov said earlier this month.</p> <p>Greenpeace activists draped the parliament building in slogans declaring \"we don't want to live on a nuclear rubbish dump.\" By law, 2m signatures are needed to force a referendum.

      "bodyText": "Russian anti-nuclear campaigners yesterday demanded a popular vote on whether the country should be turned into what they dub \"the world's nuclear waste dump\". They submitted petitions to the authorities carrying more than 2.5m signatures of people opposed to government plans to store other countries' nuclear waste. The campaigners, including Greenpeace, hope to force Russia's first referendum on an environmental issue. Storage of foreign nuclear waste is illegal in Russia. But, envisaging billions of pounds in profits, the atomic energy minister, Yevgeni Adamov, has submitted a bill to parliament which would allow not only nuclear waste processing but also storage. The new legislation could be passed by the end of the year, making it possible for major nuclear countries to add Russia to the list of repositories for their troublesome waste. Russian government documents obtained by Greenpeace propose that more than 20,000 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel be imported initially, and name 14 countries from Japan to Germany as possible clients. The atomic energy ministry estimates income of \u00a314bn, half of which would be profit, the other half used to build and maintain the storage facilities. Four possible sites are being considered, in the Urals, the far east, and the far north. An alternative plan, believed to be supported by the US, has an American company, Non-Proliferation Trust Inc, pushing for the Russian storage of 10,000 tonnes of foreign nuclear waste. A strong signal of the Russian nuclear lobby's determination to take in the world's waste came on Monday when Bulgaria disclosed that Mr Adamov told Sofia last week that the waste obtained from reprocessing spent fuel from the latter's Kozloduy plant would not be returned from Russia to Bulgaria for storage. \"Temporary storage\" of such material \"might bring considerable profit to Russia and would not be detrimental to the ecology\", Mr Adamov said earlier this month. Greenpeace activists draped the parliament building in slogans declaring \"we don't want to live on a nuclear rubbish dump.\" By law, 2m signatures are needed to force a referendum. But it would be surprising if the government allowed one on this issue if it has decided to back the storage plan.",

      "body": "<p>DH Lawrence saw Sarah Bernhardt in La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, in 1906. She was, he wrote, \"the incarnation of violent emotion, liberating the primitive passions of woman\". John Gielgud, recalling a lifetime's theatre-going to Le Monde in 1991, remembered seeing her at the Coliseum in London, performing a self-written piece called Champ d'Honneur. \"It was during the first world war, Sarah had already lost her leg... She appeared lying on a tree trunk from which she pulled out as if by miracle the French tricolour, before declaiming a long patriotic poem in French. I was bowled over.\" Such was Marcel Proust's regard for the actress that he created a character called Berma based on her for his magnum opus A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. </p> <p>Sarah Bernhardt was an enigmatic, ultimately one-legged, probably bisexual, part-Jewish, self-mythologising hunting and travelling enthusiast. She was also, quite possibly, the greatest actor ever. </p> <p>Her remarkably long career extended from her first performances at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in 1861 to her death in 1923, took in 70 roles and 125 plays. Born in Paris in 1844 to a Dutch courtesan and a father whose identity is uncertain but who was probably French, Bernhardt knew from the start the life of an adventuress - thanks to her mother's lifestyle. </p> <p>But the mother didn't care for the girl, arranged for Bernhardt to be brought up by relations and parcelled her off at the age of seven to boarding school. Later, at a convent school in Versailles, Sarah became obsessed with religion and decided to devote her life to God. Her mother, however, had other ideas: inspired by another man in her life, the Duc de Morny, half-brother of Louis Napoleon, she sent her daughter to the Conservatory for Dramatic Arts. Against her will, as a result, Bernhardt devoted her life to the theatre. </p> <p>The influential Duc later managed to win her a place at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, where she made her debut in 1862, pronouncing: \"The curtain of my life has risen.\" Two years later she gave birth to a son, but chose not to marry. Instead, she took up a contract at the Th\u00e9tre de l'Od\u00e9on, where she played the classics, especially Racine, and particularly his greatest play, Ph\u00e8dre - a role that she was to perform regularly from 1874 to 1913. \"People often ask me why I never played Corneille,\" she once wrote. \"The reason is very simple: in my opinion, Corneille could not write for women... Let's speak of Ph\u00e8dre. There is the most touching, the most pure, the most sad victim of love!\" </p> <p>She performed roles written for her by the greatest French playwrights of her day - Rostand, Hugo and Dumas fils. Rostand, especially, gave her some of her finest modern roles. She played Roxane in the premiere of his Cyrano de Bergerac in New York. She triumphed in his play L'Aiglon, a play that exalted French national pride. </p> <p>Cunningly, as France limped into its Third Republic and licked its wounds after the Franco-Prussian war, the divine Sarah thrilled patriots by playing national heroines. L'Aiglon was only one example. She also portrayed the revolutionary activist Th\u00e9roigne de M\u00e9ricourt, she was La Fille de Roland. The novelist Anatole France saw her as Joan of Arc and wrote: \"She is at the same time a vision of an ideal life and an exquisite archaism: she is the legend animated.\" But Bernhardt did more than animate a legend. She took the raw material of Joan of Arc and made that legend part of herself. She had appropriated something of the Maid of Orleans's iconic power and thereby became an icon herself. The line between life and art was increasingly and appealingly blurred. </p> <p>But in 1898, at the height of the Dreyfus Affair, she let it be known that she was half Jewish. Here was another Bernhardt - one step ahead of those who would try to define her. Yes, she was Jewish, but why reveal that fact then? \"There is no artist worth the name who doesn't incessantly split their personalities in two,\" she wrote in her memoirs, My Double Life. But only a double life? Sarah Bernhardt led many more than that. </p> <p>By now an international icon, Bernhardt toured Europe, and triumphed repeatedly in the United States. In the 1890s, she also became the personification of the Belle Epoque and a living symbol of Art Nouveau - decadent, morbid, dabbling in mysticism, and quite possibly partaking of illicit pharmaceuticals. Her intimate circle included men, such as the artist Gustave Dor\u00e9, the composer and pianist Reynaldo Hahn, and Alphons Mucha, who created a series of posters of her greatest roles during the 1890s. The misogynistic aesthete poet Robert de Montesquiou was lured to Bernhardt's lair by the belief that she incarnated his philosophy - that women only achieved their raison d' tre by becoming works of art. </p> <p>If Bernhardt was more work of art than woman (a silly if suggestive thought), she was constantly making this artwork more intriguing. During the first world war, her right leg, which was damaged as a result of repeated falls on stage, was amputated, but she continued to work until the last year of her life, 1923. Indeed, before the new century had reached its teens, Bernhardt was a film star - the 1912 film Elizabeth, Queen of England was a hit in the US. Her film career continued off and on until her death. She died in her son's arms, and thousands of Parisians followed her funeral cortege through the city. </p> <p>Many are still obsessed with Sarah Bernhardt. In France, two biographies have just been published, neither of which nails the enigma. But perhaps biographies don't help - we need to hear her voice, to see the costumes she wore in order to feel something of what Gielgud and Lawrence experienced when they saw her on stage. </p> <p>Now that the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris has a sumptuous exhibition devoted to Bernhardt, we can do just that. Or can we? Not for nothing is the exhibition subtitled \"the divine liar\". Bernhardt lied herself into being, and in so doing made herself captivating. Jean Cocteau, for whom Bernhardt was a \"sacred monster\", wrote: \"Madame Sarah Bernhardt presented the phenomenon of living at the extremity of her personality in her life, on the stage.\" The important word there is \"presented\", and the crucial elision here is between her life and what she did as an actor. Isn't it possible to find out what she really was? Perhaps not. </p> <p>And yet all the evidence is here - photographs, paintings, dresses, play bills, the sheer weight of historical documentation. One can hear Bernhardt in the 1906 production of Racine's Ph\u00e8dre, or employing vibrato that reminds one of Edith Piaf during a particularly fraught scene from L'Aiglon, performed at the Theatre Sarah Bernhardt 100 years ago. </p> <p>There she is as Hamlet, and as P\u00e9lleas in Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. We see her caricatured by Aubrey Beardsley as Salome holding John the Baptist's severed head, in the play that Oscar Wilde wrote for her. Here too, towards the end of her life, is the theatrical icon as advertising tool, powdering her face with La Diaphane Poudre de Riz, and later raising a glass of Terminus absinthe (although she took legal action against the advertisers for using her image without her knowledge). </p> <p>And there, at the culmination of this exhibition, is the fully mythologised Sarah in a reproduction of Georges Clairin's post Pre-Raphaelite painting The Enchantress in Her Lair, her body a twisting swirl of ivory dress, topped by a feline head whose potent gaze not so much returns as devours ours. She consumes our interest and tells us nothing. </p> <p>The organisers muse on the question: Who are Bernhardt's successors? Greta Garbo (who played Bernhardt in the 1928 biopic The Divine Woman) and Maria Callas (who identified with Bernhardt and sang many of the roles she had acted) are held up as possibles, as (unexpected this) is Glenda Jackson. The organisers forebear from suggesting that she is the Madonna of a century ago, though perhaps they shouldn't have. </p> <p>Ultimately, the image of Bernhardt that burns itself into the brain is a photograph taken in 1892. She is Ph\u00e8dre, arms outstretched, face exultant. Her rictus recalls Gloria Swanson's insane pose at the end of Sunset Boulevard - ready, eager even, for her close up. But in Bernhardt's case, it seems clear, even the most scrutinising close up will give nothing away. </p> <p>\u0095 Sarah Bernhardt or the Divine Liar is at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris, until January 14.

      "bodyText": "Spare a thought for Amazonian sometime actress Anna Nicole Smith, injured after a serious dumbell-related accident and now being sued for damages by a film producer after backing out of a prospective movie co-starring Joey Buttafucco, the Long Island adulterer who acquired a certain notoriety after his teenage lover Amy Fisher shot his wife back in 1992 (Tawdry? Us?). The enterprise in question, The Underground Comedy Movie, wound up being released last year anyway, despite Smith's withdrawal on the grounds of - oh dear - it potentially damaging her public image. Anything else to take into consideration? Well, the defendant just won $450 million in a courtroom tussle over her inheritance from late oil tycoon J Howard Marshall, whom she married back in 1994, when she was 26 and he 89 (he died a year later). Which might, if one were to throw a cynical slant on things, possibly have spurred producer Vince Offer into action. Offer, it should be noted, is no stranger to litigation, with his plagiarism suit against the producers of There's Something About Mary - filed after Offer thrust a script into star Ben Stiller's hand in an LA street - still pending... Meanwhile, Drew Barrymore 's estranged mother, former Playboy model Jaid (Tawdry? Us?) has finally walked free after being arrested on an illegal firearms rap back in May. Ma Barrymore had originally been charged after being searched while fly-posting for a local rock band in downtown Manhattan - going through her purse, police promptly discovered a loaded and unlicensed .357 Magnum, a misdemeanour even if, as she later argued, said handgun was \"so old and dirty it couldn't fire\". After a plea bargain last Friday, the old dear was sentenced to 10 days of community service and six months' probation.",

But satire isn't supposed to be subtle, and Lee, a fearless, full-throttle film-maker at the best of times, has never been one to pull his punches.

While Bamboozled paints a portrait that's intentionally extreme, its point is well taken.\" Kissinger should know. He's just signed a one-year development deal with Lee. Having excoriated television executives in Bamboozled for failing to adequately reflect African-American experience on screen, Lee is now getting into bed with them. \"I'm elated that I'm getting a shot, being put in a position to do something good in a medium I've been very critical of\", Lee told the Hollywood Reporter, adding that it was time for him to \"put up or shut up\". </p> <p>Lee isn't the only one taking TV executives to task here.

The networks have made some efforts to respond to the NAACP's criticism: broadcasting giants NBC and ABC, for instance, agreed in January to increase the number of black faces on television and have committed themselves to employing more people from ethnic minorities to work behind the camera.

Three of the major hits this summer - The Klumps, Big Momma's House and Scary Movie - have starred African-Americans, and Lee himself notched up a surprise success with his last film The Original Kings Of Comedy, a concert film shot on video starring four black stand-ups.

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Eddie George, acknowledged yesterday that the pound was \"substantially overvalued\" against the single currency, as sterling's surge on the foreign exchanges was blamed for the loss of 1,300 jobs at Panasonic's Cardiff plant. In the latest blow to the struggling manufacturing sector, the company cited the government's indecision over the European single currency and the pound's strength against the euro, and weakness against the dollar and yen, as factors prompting its decision to cut half its workforce. But Sir Eddie warned that the pound could be brought down against the euro only by cutting interest rates, which would destabilise the economy. Making a robust defence of UK policy towards the euro since its launch at the beginning of last year, Sir Eddie said that to have joined when the single currency was introduced would have risked \"something of an inflationary boom\". Britain would have been faced with both a weaker exchange rate and lower interest rates during a period when the economy was growing strongly, he said. Panasonic's decision is the latest by a foreign investor, including other Japanese groups, to scale down its Welsh operations, with around 2,000 jobs lost in television-making in the past few months. Last week Sony cut 400 jobs at its Pencoed plant near Bridgend, partly blaming the pound's strength against the euro, while Hitachi and other groups have also reduced their workforces in response to sterling and technological change. The Welsh economy is heavily dependent on manufacturing, which accounts for 30% of GDP compared with the UK's 17%, and after years of attracting foreign manufacturers bodies such as the Welsh development agency have only just begun switching their emphasis to promoting services. Panasonic said it would cut 700 permanent jobs from among its 1,800-strong full-time staff, with 600 part-timers who work on a seasonal basis to go as planned. The redundancies are due to take effect by Christmas. Adair Turner, vice-chairman of the pro-EMU lobby group Britain in Europe, said: \"This decision is yet another example of the damage that sterling's volatility outside the euro is bound to do to British manufacturing.\" Sir Eddie, speaking at a conference in Paris alongside Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, said the weakness of the euro complicated the task of the Bank's monetary policy committee in setting UK interest rates. The economy was growing faster than it had historically, unemployment was the lowest for 20 years and on one commonly used measure inflation was the lowest in Europe. \"Our problem in the UK is the imbalance within the overall economy between those sectors that are competing with producers in the euro zone, who are under considerable pressure, and the rest of the economy, which is doing relatively well. \"Believe me, we are very conscious of the desirability of exchange rate stability with our partners in the single market,\" he said, though he added that signing up for the single currency would provide only limited exchange rate certainty. \"The ... weakening of the euro since the beginning of last year has not made things easier for us.

Nearly three weeks after he was declared the winner of Yugoslavia's presidential election, Mr Kostunica's allies won the right to oversee the Serbian premiership and the key ministries of police, information, justice, and finance. As Yugoslav president, Mr Kostunica's main power is in appointing the foreign and defence ministers and the army chief of staff. He has kept on the defence minister appointed by Mr Milosevic, even though he is an indicted war criminal, on the grounds that it takes time to consolidate democracy. The other key powers are with the Serbian government, which was controlled by Mr Milosevic's Socialist party. A Socialist, Milomir Minic, will be the new prime minister of Serbia, but he will have to act in agreement with his two deputies, one an ally of Mr Kostunica and the other a representative of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement. Three-party troikas will be in charge of the main ministries. This unusual division of power will at least allow Mr Kostunica's allies to escape some of the blame for what looks like being a tough winter for most Serbs, with looming shortages of fuel. But he will get credit for the huge programme of food and energy aid from the European Union and the United States which his election victory has unleashed. Mr Kostunica is hoping that the alliance of 18 parties which won him the presidential election will get the majority of seats in the Serbian parliament in the polling booths on December 23. \"The time of this government is limited and so are its tasks,\" Mr Minic told parliament. \"Its two main missions are to stabilise economic policy and urgently address the economic needs of the citizens.\" The new president is planning to visit Moscow on Friday to thank his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for the important role he played in the transfer of power. The Russians were the last major state to recognise Mr Kostunica's victory. Although this was derided by many western officials as a sign that Moscow was out of touch, the timing of the Russian declaration was significant. It came a few hours before Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, arrived in Belgrade to see Mr Milosevic and the new president the day after crowds stormed the parliament building and the main state-owned television station. The announcement that Mr Putin accepted Mr Kostunica's victory was a bitter blow to Mr Milosevic. Mr Milosevic was still wondering about using the army to reverse the result and restore his rule, but at their meeting Mr Ivanov warned him not to try. In some ways the Russians' action paralleled their contribution during Nato's air strikes, when their special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, joined forces with western governments in urging Mr Milosevic to accept defeat in the military duel. This too was highly significant. Mr Ivanov also persuaded Mr Kostunica to visit the defeated president at his villa and mollify him with assurances that he would not be extradited to the Hague. According to Yugoslav intelligence sources, Mr Kostunica promised Mr Milosevic that he would resist western pressures for extradition, however strong they became. He also promised to maintain stability in the army, which was interpreted to mean that he would not replace the defence minister and army chief of staff. Some Yugoslavs wonder whether Mr Kostunica needed to take such a conciliatory approach.

Ms Nystad believes the government is playing for time. \"As a nation we have lived here for thousands of years in tune with our environment. It is not us that that have caused problems. We are still waiting for promises given to us in 1981 over the Alta dam to be honoured. We have been disappointed many times since then and we are not going to let it happen again with the gold mine. The Samis have been patient for too long.\"",

But he makes an unlikely star. At little more than 1.5 metres (5ft), he has had to compensate for lack of stature with a big stage presence and a talent for phrasing the French chanson unmatched since that of woman who discovered him, Edith Piaf. He is also the first French singer since Maurice Chevalier to have had a successful career in Britain, and above all the US, where, last year, visitors to Time magazine's website, Time Online, voted him Entertainer of the century. The composer of the line \"She ... may be a face I can't forget, a trace of pleasure or regret\" was born Sharmouz Aznavourian in Paris in 1924, the son of an Armenian actor and a Turkish singer who were running a cafe at the time. His Armenian roots are important to him and he still presides over a relief association he founded to help the victims of the 1988 Armenian earthquake. Inspired by the recordings of Maurice Chevalier, he began to write songs which he sang - with no success whatsoever - in the cabarets during the German occupation. In 1946 he met Piaf - he swears they were never lovers - who persuaded him to have his nose remodelled, taught him how to deliver his songs, and told him he could be a star.",

      "bodyText": "Moves to avert a diplomatic row between Britain and Cuba were under way yesterday after the Havana authorities took steps to allow diplomats access to six British security firm workers detained on suspicion of industrial espionage. The British consul in Havana, Bernard Garside, met Cuban officials last night in an attempt to gain access to the five men and one woman who were being held at an undisclosed location on the Caribbean island. The move by Cuba followed a statement from the Foreign Office demanding \"immediate access\" to the Britons, who have been held for more than two weeks. Conflicting accounts of what the six were doing in the country emerged last night. It was rumoured they had been arrested on suspicion of some form of industrial espionage involving the oil or gas industry. But there were also reports that the five men were private eyes hired to tail a millionaire businessman suspected of cheating on his wife. Ken Lodge, from east London, John Fawcett, also from London, and Derek Pitt, from Hertfordshire, were thought to be among those detained. Mr Garside received assurances that the six detainees were in good health and that he would be granted access within the next 48 hours, the Foreign Office said last night. \"The Cuban authorities are investigating allegations that the six had been hired in connection with a private investigation into a case of marital infidelity involving a Cuban national for which they were using methods in breach of Cuban law.\" No charges had yet been brought and the Cuban authorities had undertaken to provide access to a lawyer, he added. \"We will continue to press the Cuban authorities to honour their obligations under international conventions and grant access to consular staff without delay.\" Mr Garside was told on October 9 that the six had been arrested. But the Cuban government did not give official notification of their detention until October 13, and despite requests for consular access to be granted the interior ministry refused permission for British officials to visit them. Peter Hain, the Foreign Office minister, said yesterday: \"It is unacceptable that six British nationals are being held in Cuba without explanation and without access. \"Their relatives have the right to know what is happening to them, they themselves have the right to know why they are being held, and the British government has the right to offer them consular protection.\" Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said the fact the six had been refused access to consular help could mean the Cuban authorities considered that they were a threat to national security. \"It is unprecedented for the British government not to be given access for this length of time,\" he said. \"That persuades me it is no ordinary criminal matter.\" Mr Jakobi said whatever the outcome there was no way the six could get a fair trial. \"In 16 days you can get anybody to declare they are the Queen of Sheba.
