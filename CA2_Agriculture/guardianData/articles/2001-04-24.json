      "body": "<p>Ruud van Nistelrooy is used to being the centre of attention - and the hubbub buzzed around Britain's most expensive footballer yesterday at Holland's training camp here - but he is likely to spend this evening kicking his heels on the sidelines. </p> <p>Holland play Cyprus in a World Cup qualifier at Eindhoven's Philips stadium but the \u00a319m 24-year-old is expected to start on the bench. It is 13 months since he last represented the Dutch; he will have to make do with a possible late walk-on appearance, and then only if dominance on paper translates into early goals against the Cypriots. Even so, after his injury-wrecked year that represents progress. </p> <p>\"When you get injured and you know you will be out for up to a year, the time ahead looks so long,\" he said. \"Yet sitting here it feels as if it was yesterday. I was determined this wasn't going to be the end of my career. I saw a lot of examples of people who came back from all sorts of injuries and that gave me confidence. Most players did recover.\" </p> <p>It is exactly a year since Van Nistelrooy failed his medical in Cheadle, the legacy of a medial ligament injury sustained in a friendly against Silkeborg that month. Two days later he collapsed in pain at PSV's training ground having ruptured the cruciate ligament in the same (right) knee. \"I rushed things and it cost me a year,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I just wanted to show everybody that I was fit after failing the medical, in particular the Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard. But United wanted to open my knee and that would have put me out of Euro 2000. I really wanted to play in front of the Dutch fans. Maybe I should have gone ahead with the operation; I won't make the same mistake again.\" </p> <p>With his knee clamped in a support brace and the memory of his \u00a318.5m transfer fading fast, he was encouraged by words of inspiration from heady sources. \"Ronaldo offered me great support, which was fantastic,\" Van Nistelrooy recalled. The Brazilian, another former PSV player, has spent the best part of two years injured. </p> <p>\"As soon as he heard what happened he was on the phone to me. I also spoke with Marc Overmars. They told me what to expect with this injury and how to handle it. Mr Ferguson reminded me about Roy Keane and Lothar Matth\u00e4us, who both had injuries like this. Their determination showed me how it was possible to come back with the knee as strong as before.\" </p> <p>Then there was Sir Alex Ferguson. \"I rang to tell him about the injury and he was sympathetic. He told me not to worry. Whatever was wrong, it would be fine. He was a big help. </p> <p>\"A few days after it happened he came over to see me personally. It was incredible that someone who had won so much at such a big club should show me so much warmth. The feeling that the whole club gave me - not just Mr Ferguson - swung my decision. I am just delighted to be able to work with him at all, even if it is for just one year.\" </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy remains a PSV player for now - he will complete his move to Manchester United on July 1 - and the champions will not be obliged to sign him should he suffer a relapse. But Premiership opponents are already fretting over how to nullify the considerable threat that has brought him 60 goals in two injury-free seasons. </p> <p>\"Everyone will see what a quality player Ruud is,\" said the Holland and Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. \"If you were looking for a centre-forward and you made a list of the qualities required and then took everything together, you would come up with Ruud van Nistelrooy. He is the total striker.\" </p> <p>Despite all the plaudits, the striker is by no means certain of making an appearance tonight. \"He doesn't have the match fitness yet but I picked him in my squad just to stimulate him as a player,\" said the Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. </p> <p>Not that Van Nistelrooy needs further incentive. \"I feel I am back to my best and nobody should worry about my fitness,\" he added. \"I can be the player I was, if not a better one.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

I am just delighted to be able to work with him at all, even if it is for just one year.\" Van Nistelrooy remains a PSV player for now - he will complete his move to Manchester United on July 1 - and the champions will not be obliged to sign him should he suffer a relapse. But Premiership opponents are already fretting over how to nullify the considerable threat that has brought him 60 goals in two injury-free seasons. \"Everyone will see what a quality player Ruud is,\" said the Holland and Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. \"If you were looking for a centre-forward and you made a list of the qualities required and then took everything together, you would come up with Ruud van Nistelrooy. He is the total striker.\" Despite all the plaudits, the striker is by no means certain of making an appearance tonight. \"He doesn't have the match fitness yet but I picked him in my squad just to stimulate him as a player,\" said the Dutch coach Louis van Gaal. Not that Van Nistelrooy needs further incentive. \"I feel I am back to my best and nobody should worry about my fitness,\" he added. \"I can be the player I was, if not a better one.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The US investment bank, which employs some 5,000 people in London, told its 62,000 staff that it would shed 4% of its workforce. By revealing the scale of its job cuts, which are expected to fall most heavily on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley contrasts with rivals which have refused to be specific about the extent to which they have reduced staff. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Goldman Sachs would give details of their cuts, although the latter is said to have shed 650 jobs from a total workforce of 22,000, including some senior managing directors. Other Wall Street firms to have announced layoffs recently include Charles Schwab, the online brokerage, Citigroup and Bear Stearns. Morgan Stanley was understood to be talking yesterday to employees caught up in its largest retreat since it was formed from the merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, the retail broker, more than three years ago. Most of the cuts will come from operations in New York and Silicon Valley although some 200 jobs will go in Europe and some in Asia.

The company sold off its US business for $1, was forced to launch a \u00a325m rescue rights issue and its auditors warned there was a \"fundamental uncertainty\" that the business was a going concern. </p> <p>But with the aid of Asian conglomerate Malayan United Industries - which underwrote the rights issue and now owns 40% of the company - the company has made a u-turn. </p> <p>The \u00a310.2m profit recorded in the year to the end of January, compared with the \u00a34.1m loss registered a year earlier, was driven by home furnishings, where like-for-like sales rose nearly 20%. That growth has continued in the first weeks of the new financial year and finance director Jim Bellingham said the company was now planning to open one or two specialist home furnishings shops a month. It already has six, and is targeting well-off provincial towns like Nantwich in Cheshire and Sevenoaks in Kent. </p> <p>The company now employs a 40-strong design team, doing commercial and domestic interior designs, and supplying everything from paint to lamp shades. At the same time, Laura Ashley's clothes are also showing double-digit growth. \"We have been working closely with our customers\", said Mr Bellingham. \"They don't want us to be trendy, but they do want us to be up to date, and they wanted a more casual feel\". </p> <p>The stores have been updated and the firm is \"quietly and cautiously\" expanding in Europe. It already operates 63 stores in Europe and plans another six in Germany this year, bringing its total there to 23. </p> <p>Mr Bellingham has also brought back mail-order - axed by Ms Iverson - and has slowed e-tailing development. The firm is licensing out the name, which now adorns goods from carpets to paint and perfume and is considering licensing the brand to kitchens and garden furniture. </p> <p>The shares rose 0.75% to 23p.</p>",

The \u00a310.2m profit recorded in the year to the end of January, compared with the \u00a34.1m loss registered a year earlier, was driven by home furnishings, where like-for-like sales rose nearly 20%. That growth has continued in the first weeks of the new financial year and finance director Jim Bellingham said the company was now planning to open one or two specialist home furnishings shops a month. It already has six, and is targeting well-off provincial towns like Nantwich in Cheshire and Sevenoaks in Kent. The company now employs a 40-strong design team, doing commercial and domestic interior designs, and supplying everything from paint to lamp shades. At the same time, Laura Ashley's clothes are also showing double-digit growth. \"We have been working closely with our customers\", said Mr Bellingham. \"They don't want us to be trendy, but they do want us to be up to date, and they wanted a more casual feel\". The stores have been updated and the firm is \"quietly and cautiously\" expanding in Europe. It already operates 63 stores in Europe and plans another six in Germany this year, bringing its total there to 23. Mr Bellingham has also brought back mail-order - axed by Ms Iverson - and has slowed e-tailing development. The firm is licensing out the name, which now adorns goods from carpets to paint and perfume and is considering licensing the brand to kitchens and garden furniture. The shares rose 0.75% to 23p.",

The Faber Book of Science edited by John Carey</strong><br>This collection contains some of the best science writing since Leonardo da Vinci first picked up a quill.

A dedicated Marxist who wrote for newspapers and magazines in the 1920's and 30's, he combined clear explanation of scientific ideas with forthright political opinions and vivid personal anecdotes.

The Man Who Counted by Malba Tahan</strong><br>In a series of tales straight out of the Arabian Nights, Beremiz Samir, an ingenious Persian mathematician, uses his mathematical skills to solve puzzles, settle quarrels, and overcome his adversaries, thereby winning his way to fame and fortune. A mathematical fantasy, originally aimed at children of 10 years and older (but with a narrative that will captivate any adult), this book deserves to be as widely read as Harry Potter. It must be good: I lent my copy to a friend several years ago and haven't had it back.</p> <p><strong>4. Zarafa by Michael Allin</strong><br>Zarafa was the first giraffe ever seen in France.

The sight of this extraordinary long-necked animal so astonished the people that by the time she arrived at le Jardin des Plantes, the French centre for research into natural history, in 1827 she was feted as a celebrity. I love this book for its meticulous research and beautiful writing. It's a simple tale, but one to treasure.</p> <p><strong>5. Darwin by Adrian Desmond and James Moore</strong><br>I don't think I've read a better biography. This one grips from beginning to end: the dilettante student; the adventure of the Beagle; the stress of his secret theory; the illnesses; the acclaim that greeted The Origin; it's all here, thrillingly written, wrapped in insight and peppered with so many brilliantly observed details that you feel you're walking in Darwin's shoes.</p> <p><strong>6. The Double Helix by James D Watson</strong><br>On a recent visit to the Science Museum I found myself marveling at how Crick and Watson's original model of DNA - the famous double helix - was held together, Heath-Robinson style, by a handful of retort stands. Watson's own account of how he and Crick unraveled its structure in Cambridge in the 1950's - between chasing girls and surviving the college food - is one of the classics of science literature.</p> <p><strong>7. Fermat's Last Theorem by Simon Singh</strong><br>In the pages of an old text book the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat left a tantalising note: \"I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain\". His proof, however, was never found, and the proposition - Fermat's last theorem - remained unsolved for 358 years. Simon Singh's compelling account of the quest to solve the riddle is a tale of driven personalities, mathematical enigmas, and, ultimately, sheer determination.</p> <p><strong>8. On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen by Harold McGee</strong><br>This is more of a reference book to dip into, rather than a book to read in one go, but it's a great volume to have handy in the kitchen to answer those puzzling questions such as why sauces thicken, how toast browns, and why some meat is white and other meat red.</p> <p><strong>9. Companion to the Cosmos by John Gribbin</strong><br>This book is surely a must for amateur astronomers, or indeed anyone interested in the universe and what makes it tick. It's essentially an encylopaedia of astronomy, but Gribbin's explanations are beautifully clear, and the range of subjects covered - from aberration to ZZ-Ceti stars - is as comprehensive as most people could wish.<br><strong><br>10. Bold Science: Seven Scientists who are Changing Our World by Ted Anton</strong><br>Entertaining short biographies of some of the major players at the cutting edge of science today: gene-mapper Craig Venter; neuroscientist Susan Greenfield; planet-hunter Geoffrey Marcy; immunobiologist Polly Matzinger; cosmologist Saul Perlmutter; conservation biologist Gretchen Daily; and physicist turned evolutionist Carl Woese.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Czech Philharmonic's London visit forms part of the Barbican's Bohemian Spring Season, though Czech music itself doesn't feature in their programming. Their first concert with Vladimir Ashkenazy - music director since 1998 - consisted of works by composers whose relationship to Czech culture is tangential: Mozart, who later in life found more acceptance in Prague than he did in Vienna, and Prokofiev, whose works form a response to the Soviet system that subsequently attempted to subsume Czechoslovakia into itself. </p> <p>Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, for all its popularity, is a problem piece. It was written in 1944 and the question of political relevance looms large over it. Prokofiev claimed the symphony depicted \"the grandeur of the human spirit\", and some have deemed it an attempt either to bypass or transcend contemporary events. In many respects, however, this ignores Prokofiev's flickering irony. \"The human spirit\" possessed anything but \"grandeur\" at the time. The symphony's tone is far from heroic, and much of its thematic material derives from rejected sections of other Prokofiev scores that depict tragic love stories - the ballet Romeo and Juliet, a soundtrack for a film of Pushkin's The Queen of Spades. </p> <p>Ashkenazy probes it cautiously in a performance that is strong on ambivalence, if not so hot on sheer clout. The relentless climaxes of the first movement hover between gaudy triumph and totalitarian heaviness. The scherzo is by turns elated and grotesque, its central section lurching from bucolic whimsy to graceless screeching. It is scrupulously played, if sometimes lacking the flamboyance usually associated with the Czech Philharmonic. </p> <p>Ashkenazy couples it with Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto, one of his darkest, most nerve-ridden scores. Eighteenth-century rationalism is conspicuously absent from the piece, which seethes with febrile tension and a twitchy sensibility. Ashkenazy directs it from the keyboard, locating its emotional core in the extravagant jolts of the second movement and pushing the whole towards high Romanticism. </p> <p>The opening allegro is curiously reflective when it could be wilder, though there are some wonderfully louring woodwind sonorities. Ashkenazy further stresses the concerto's Romantic links by playing the cadenza that Beethoven wrote for insertion into the first movement. It doesn't quite integrate into the whole - but that is Beethoven's responsibility rather than Ashkenazy's.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Czech Philharmonic's London visit forms part of the Barbican's Bohemian Spring Season, though Czech music itself doesn't feature in their programming. Their first concert with Vladimir Ashkenazy - music director since 1998 - consisted of works by composers whose relationship to Czech culture is tangential: Mozart, who later in life found more acceptance in Prague than he did in Vienna, and Prokofiev, whose works form a response to the Soviet system that subsequently attempted to subsume Czechoslovakia into itself. Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, for all its popularity, is a problem piece. It was written in 1944 and the question of political relevance looms large over it. Prokofiev claimed the symphony depicted \"the grandeur of the human spirit\", and some have deemed it an attempt either to bypass or transcend contemporary events. In many respects, however, this ignores Prokofiev's flickering irony. \"The human spirit\" possessed anything but \"grandeur\" at the time. The symphony's tone is far from heroic, and much of its thematic material derives from rejected sections of other Prokofiev scores that depict tragic love stories - the ballet Romeo and Juliet, a soundtrack for a film of Pushkin's The Queen of Spades. Ashkenazy probes it cautiously in a performance that is strong on ambivalence, if not so hot on sheer clout. The relentless climaxes of the first movement hover between gaudy triumph and totalitarian heaviness. The scherzo is by turns elated and grotesque, its central section lurching from bucolic whimsy to graceless screeching. It is scrupulously played, if sometimes lacking the flamboyance usually associated with the Czech Philharmonic. Ashkenazy couples it with Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto, one of his darkest, most nerve-ridden scores. Eighteenth-century rationalism is conspicuously absent from the piece, which seethes with febrile tension and a twitchy sensibility. Ashkenazy directs it from the keyboard, locating its emotional core in the extravagant jolts of the second movement and pushing the whole towards high Romanticism. The opening allegro is curiously reflective when it could be wilder, though there are some wonderfully louring woodwind sonorities. Ashkenazy further stresses the concerto's Romantic links by playing the cadenza that Beethoven wrote for insertion into the first movement. It doesn't quite integrate into the whole - but that is Beethoven's responsibility rather than Ashkenazy's.",

But surely even the second subject of the opening movement of the Spring Sonata doesn't need to be delivered in such a brutal way.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>KenLoach</strong> <br> Hello, Ken Loach here. Thanks for all your questions - I'll try and come up with some sensible answers.</p> <p><strong>ASA1 </strong><br> Ken, where did you find Elipidia Carillos? And will we be seeing more of her?</p> <p><strong>KenLoach</strong><br> I met Elpidia in LA when we were auditioning a lot of people for Bread &amp; Roses. She's been in several well received films like Salvador and was really brilliant to work with. </p> <p><strong>FilmFan </strong><br> What do you think of the current state of the British film industry? What goes through your head every time a film like The Full Monty becomes a huge success? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach</strong><br> The current state of the British film industry is much like its past state, and as long as we're a colony of the US as regards cinema, we will remain so. The problem is not shortage of talent, it's shortage of screens. We need to gain control of the screens and the way they're programmed so that a wide variety of films can be shown. Then film-makers here can start to have real relationship with the audience. </p> <p><strong>SpankTM </strong><br> Your films have been cursed with spotty British distribution over the years (though things seem to have got better since you hooked up with FilmFour). What do you think could be done to give non-Hollywood movies a fighting chance out there? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach</strong><br> The problem is usually not the distribution but the exhibition because you can have a good distributor who works hard, but if the screens are already out of reach you can't do anything. As I said, you need to find a new kind of system of ownership. Screens need to be programmed by people who care about and enjoy a wide variety of films... This is where the Labour government have failed completely - they won't tackle cinema ownership, being basically free marketeers. So however much they wring their hands over the state of the British film industry, nothing will change substantially until they tackle the question of cinema ownership. </p> <p><strong>KingBoyD </strong><br> Hi Ken. Land And Freedom seems to suggest that Stalin exploited the Communist Party in Spain in order to provoke division and mistrust among the various assemblies of freedom-fighters. History not being my forte, I'm interested to know what convinced you of this. </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> Yes, this is a good but complicated question! The politics of Stalinism in relation to the Spanish civil war are I think acknowledged. He was determined to prevent a workers' state arising in Spain because he felt that if he was seen to encourage that, the Soviet Union would itself be threatened from attacks by the West. He therefore undermined the struggles by those Republicans who were establishing collectives on the land and workers' control in the factories. Volunteers like George Orwell who fought with a Marxist group were chased out of Spain. This was at the same time as the Moscow Show Trials were eliminating the old Bolsheviks who had made the revolution. Sorry, this is a big subject and we could go on a long time, but a very important one, because it shows that when the chips were down, the communists - ie Stalinists - and Social Democrats supported a bourgeois republic but would not support a workers' republic. </p> <p><strong>FayJay </strong><br> Rather a Blue Peter-ish couple of questions, I'm afraid, but: Who do you think are the most exciting new directors? (For the matter, do you go &amp; see lots of other people's films yourself or not?) Also, do you have a particular favourite amongst your own films, or do you always simply focus on the next project? </p> <p><strong>Mcgowan2 </strong><br> Dear Ken, which football team? Coventry or Manchester City? I know it's not MFC but I have a sneaky feeling it could be Man Utd. Also, what do you think of the new Saturday Glossy Guardian? Last one. What is going to be the title of The Navigators. I know it was a working title. Anything decided? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> I don't go to the cinema very much - preferring football, but there are some good new directors. I enjoyed Lyn Ramsay's Ratcatcher, the films by Gary Oldman and Tim Roth. The brothers behind Rosetta, and I thought The Last Resort was good. And on the subject of football: Neither Coventry nor Manchester City, but Bath city, where I lived for a long time. I also look for the results of Fulham and Nuneatan Borough, but anybody living in the south west, get yourself to Twerton Park before the end of the season! </p> <p><strong>FilmFan </strong><br> Who would you say were your biggest influences? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach</strong> My biggest influences - European films of the 50s and 60s, particularly Italian films by Vittorio de Sica and Czech films of the Prague Spring. </p> <p><strong>barquing </strong><br> In the British reviews of Bread &amp; Roses, how quickly did it take for the \"Oh my God, Ken Loach had made a film in LA\" attitude to get on your nerves? And while I'm at it, do you think there should be a balance between a film's form and a film's message and if so how well do you think you achieve this? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> It wasn't that attitude that is irritating, but those writers and reviewers who are contemptuous of any time when people take collective action. You see the consequences of the Thatcherite triumph in the reviews more than the films, in the way individualism is lauded at the expense of any group of people getting together. One reviewer attacked it simply because it was about trade unions. Maggie must be rubbing her hands in glee. Second question: Yes, content and form should be indivisible, and if the content can be reduced to a message, it's probably not worth passing on. One problem I have is the label 'political' which means there's a danger that people don't see what is really in the film, they see what they expect to see. </p> <p><strong>Seona </strong><br> Are you suggesting we break up the big multiplexes like UGC, Odeon, etc? Because I'm more than happy to do that, evil things that they are. </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> Yes - what happens in Norway is interesting. Many cinemas there seem to be owned by municipalities and are programmed by people who seem to have a genuine interest in film. My favourite cinema is the Ritzy, Brixton. There are several others that I also like. </p> <p><strong>ASA1 </strong><br> With reference to \"Raining Stones\", is there a truly socialist alternative? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> Yes there is, but I guess you have to go back and read the books to discover it. One thing's for certain, it's not to be found in the Labour Party. </p> <p><strong>FilmFan </strong><br> You're well-known for keeping portions of your scripts secret from your actors until the key moment. Could you elaborate on your reasons behind this - I'm thinking of the loan sharks scene in Raining Stones - and what effect having to re-take has on the a) the actors, and b) the scene. (Also, how often would you typically re-shoot an emotional scene such as that?) </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> The reason to sometimes keep a script away from the actors is because surprise is the hardest thing to act, so if you film the actual surprise you sometimes reach an authenticity in your response which you wouldn't do otherwise. </p> <p><strong>zorglub </strong><br> Is it annoying to be considered controversial simply because you do not propagate right-wing politics or apply a highly stylised form in your films? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> This comment is spot on! It's the pro CIA films or cold war films that are always seen as just entertainment whereas a counter view is marked down as political. \"Common sense is the sense of the ruling class.\" </p> <p><strong>Gazer30 </strong><br> Hi Ken, Do you think that New Labour has gone so far to the right that it is impossible for it to regain its old 'agenda'? How much hope to you have in the Socialist Alliance instead? Does it have enough appeal to become a serious contender to parliamentary politics?</p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> Yes, I think Blair has continued the work of other Labour leaders in transforming the Labour party into a party of business. The last election's slogan was 'Labour means business' without apology. I think the vacuum on the left is waiting to be filled. The most hopeful development in recent years has been the socialist alliances. I think there's an opportunity to develop a real challenge from the left. The Scottish socialist party has made a good start in Scotland. so look out for the alliance!</p> <p><strong>RichardM </strong><br> Ken, at the NFT in '98 you said that you wanted to go to the States and use it as a location the same way as Hollywood uses Europe as a location. Was the experience of making Bread and Roses there a satisfying one, and would you go back again? Also are you frustrated that it has taken almost a year since its Cannes premiere for B&amp;R to be released in the UK?</p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> Yes, B&amp;R is a European film on location in LA, with the protagonists being Mexicans and one north American from New York. But I think the whole approach was European, much to the bemusement of the resident film people. As for the time it's taken to be released here: No, we're accustomed to films taking longer here than anywhere else. </p> <p><strong>susannahfr </strong><br> Dear Ken, I am currently writing my PHD thesis (University of Lille, France) on your work since the mid-60s (TV,fiction and documentaries) and I am particularly interested in social, political and historical issues. Having seen Days of Hope and Questions of Leadership, my question is : how can you account for the lack of publicity/interest accorded by the media and critics to the issues addressed in this particular strand of your work, whilst most attention focuses on \"the latest film\" ? How do you think the views expressed in Questions of Leadership and A Question of Leadership have stood the test of time ? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> SusannaFR: Yes, people who write about films here seem unable to deal with wider issues, style and technique and show business. The wider questions of society and politics leave them cold. That seems to be the tradition of our cinema, which follows in the wake of the US and is why it's such a pleasure to work with other Europeans, either as co-producers or taking the films to European cinemas. In the case of Land and Freedom, as a typical example, in France we had 120 prints, in Britain we had 17. I guess that about sums it up. </p> <p> <strong>Seymour2 </strong><br> Hi Ken, did you ever consider going into politics when you were younger? Why do you think the younger generation is so generally apathetic these days? </p> <p><strong>KenLoach </strong><br> No, my memory's too bad, and you'd have to mix with other politicians - it'd be a terrible waste of your life! ... </p> <p>...That's all we've got time for - thanks for all the questions. The outlook may not be as black as we sometimes depict it ! </p> <p> <strong>Questions Ken didn't have time to answer</strong></p> <p><strong>danst </strong><br> Bread &amp; Roses is your first film set entirely in the US. Does this mean that you may start making more films in the US or is the US setting merely there to tell this particular story? </p> <p><strong>barquing </strong><br> You've probably been asked this a lot (sorry!) but given that you do a lot of work with non-professional actors, what are your views on the forthcoming SAG and Writer's Guild strikes? </p> <p><strong>FayJay </strong><br> Do you have any unfulfilled ambitions (cinematic or otherwise)? </p> <p><strong>Datta </strong><br> Did you see \"The Limey\"? What did you think (in particular, of the way in which the clips from \"Poor Cow\" were used)? Did you have any say as to whether or not the clips were used? If so, did you ask to see the script or talk to the producers of \"The Limey\" before you agreed to the inclusion of the clips? Can I please have some clips from \"Kes\" for the Brian Glover wrestling/bio pic I am developing? </p> <p><strong>ASA1 </strong><br> Could you settle an argument please. Who's the better actor Brad Pitt or Keenau Reeves? Have you even heard of them? </p> <p><strong>zorglub </strong><br> I am teaching English at the local prison (in Norway) this summer and I wonder whether to show 'Raining Stones' or 'My Name is Joe'. Which one would you suggest? Despite the fact that your films are never condescending in any way I am afraid that perhaps my showing them in that particular setting would make them appear so. Do you think there is such thing as a wrong setting to show your films in, or a wrong way to present them? </p> <p><strong>BeckyLewis </strong><br> Dear Ken, Is it true that you once made an advert for McDonald's? </p> <p><strong>mattgale</strong><br>Hi, I was wondering as to what were your main goals, intentions, or what have you, as to why you decided to direct a film in the USA. I can imagine that it isn't for the reasons of technology, or even the money. Is it for the experience or is there some other motive as to why? </p> <p><strong>nina793 </strong><br> Your films rarely receive the popular success they deserve. Would you like to have a huge international hit? Do you have a particular audience in mind when you write your films? </p> <p><strong>sirtaylor </strong><br> Dear Ken, Doesn't it annoy you a bit that the people you make films about would rather watch \"Die Hard\" and \"Gone in 60 seconds\"? </p> <p><strong>chrislis </strong><br> I am interested to know how you came to make Kes. Did you read the book and think it would make a good film, did someone ask you to direct it, or did you intend to make a film about the education system or a working class child and look for a suitable script? </p> <p><strong>eroica </strong><br> Film making is a crappy and exploitative business in which people are forever ripping off each-other's ideas. How are you able to square your personal convictions with the shoddy politics of making a film? Perhaps you could use \"Raining Stones\" as a case study? </p> <p><strong>RussellCrowe </strong><br> Hi Ken. Have you ever been asked to direct a big budget film? Would you consider making Titantic II or Armageddon II if you could slip in some leftist propaganda? Or do you feel that your principles would be compromised by the accountants and studio executives if you took the big studio dollar? </p> <p><strong>jodmitchell </strong><br> Why are British film-makers often unable to source funds domestically? Do we, as a nation, lack self-belief? Or ambition? </p> <p><strong>KingBoyD </strong><br> Ken, would you agree that you are one of only a few directors of recent times with as committed an ideology / agenda / social conscience? As an aside, what would you be doing if not directing? </p> <p><strong>RichardM </strong><br> I've heard that the screenplay for Land and Freedom had to be cut back due to insufficient funds. Were there any major differences between what you wanted to depict and what ended up on screen? Also are there any other historical events or more ambitious projects than usual that you'd like to tackle if given the chance? </p> <p><strong>KasperHauser </strong><br> Ken, In the unlikely event that one of your films was nominated for an Oscar, would you go to the ceremony? - if so, what would your acceptance speech be like if you won? ...also, what did you think of Peter Mullan's 'Orphans'? Along with 'My Name Is Joe' it's one of the few British films I can actually remember liking in recent years... </p> <p><strong>barquing </strong><br> .. and what did you make of FilmFour's treatment of Orphans? </p> <p><strong>criticalmass </strong><br> Ken, You're directing a party election broadcast for the Socialist Alliance. What will be in it? Also, you must have given money to the Labour party in the past - on their current performance, would you demand a refund? </p> <p><strong>ka0310 </strong><br> Hi Ken, As an expat of 10 years here in Barcelona, I'd love to know if your recent \"Latino\" themes have anything to do with the success you have had here compared to the bizzare lack of acclaim that you have garnered in the english speaking world. </p> <p><strong>zorglub </strong><br> in the unlikely event that someone offered to finance it, would you consider directing re-makes/spoofs of British mega hits such as Four Weddings, Full Monty etc? </p> <p><strong>Jamie Sexton </strong><br>: I'd like to ask you about your early television experiences. More particularly, what did you think about the use of 16mm film in television drama? Did you feel that this technology was personally liberating and did you think it had a positive effect on television drama as a whole? If so, in what way? </p> <p><strong>ZAPPATA </strong><br> Hello Mr Loach, with regards to your highlighting of the human rights abuses &amp; needs of refugee or migrant workers in your films, in particular 'Bread &amp; Roses' &amp; 'Ladybird,Ladybird' (last of which I found shockingly powerful &amp; the former I look forward to seeing)how does your experience of the U.S.A's political &amp; social systems compare with that of the U.K,are there similarities? And just one last question, what is your view of the peaceful entry of Subcomandante Marcos &amp; the Zapatistas into Mexico City last month? </p> <p><strong>nac1 </strong><br> Do you like John Sayles' work? Is he the nearest thing to an American Ken Loach?! Was Matewan an inspiration when you were making Land &amp; Freedom? </p> <p> <strong> Seona </strong><br> Ken, a completely pointless question but ... do you ever watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer?</p> <p><strong>EvilWillow </strong><br> Hi Ken, Have you seen Requiem for a Dream? Stylistically, very different from you. What do you think of the influence of music videos on recent films? </p> <p><strong>zorglub </strong><br> Norwegian cinemas are part state-owned. it is not (i think) entirely up to the individual cinema to decide the programme. this ensures that small cinemas in thinly populated areas get the chance to screen European and Asian films as well as the big ones. it is of course also a good idea that 'art' films and hollywood films are not segregated into different cinemas. Norwegian cinemas are doing better and better every year. </p> <p><strong>Gazer30 </strong><br> Will there be a directors cut of Land and Freedom, considering on another post here it was mentioned that you had to miss out parts due to monetary reasons?!? </p> <p><strong>Jorge17 </strong><br> How much merit do you think there is in any kind of social democratic politics these days? It seems that whatever happens the system swallows you up within its logic. Do you think that cinema and the arts have now a more vital role to play in terms of promoting some kind of utopian alternative to the corrosive capitalist order? </p> <p><strong>harrybackhouse </strong><br> Ken, when you've got a minute, could I ask you to check out <a href=\"www.keepcinemalocal.co.uk\" target=\"_new\"> www.keepcinemalocal.co.uk</a> with a view towards possibly giving them your support? They can use all the help they can get. Ta. Loved Land and Freedom, by the way. </p> <p><strong>branch11 </strong><br> do you think your films suffer from an overly romanticised view of the radical potential of the working class? </p> <p><strong>brankie </strong><br> Hi I am currently come to the end of my dissertation. I am investigating the strategies need to create cultural and social intervention through documentary film. In which I have used Cathy Come Home as on of my case studies. I would like to ask you what would you consider to be to the essential elements needed to make a film facilitate social and cultural intervention in society. To motivate people to create change, like Cathy Come Home did. Thank you </p> <p> <strong>savageearthheart </strong><br> I'd like your read your comments about two different issues, if it's not too demanding, really. I'm writing an essay on the indigenous people of Nicaragua, and I'd like to have your opinion on the relations they had with the Sandinistas. The second question is related to 'Land and Freedom' in a way. Do you think that fighting for a better world today has a chance? I believe there are people who do want this, but get lost somewhere among pragmatism, cynicism, fragmentation of efforts and information overload. Do you think there is still hope for making thing better? Thank you</p>",

He was determined to prevent a workers' state arising in Spain because he felt that if he was seen to encourage that, the Soviet Union would itself be threatened from attacks by the West. He therefore undermined the struggles by those Republicans who were establishing collectives on the land and workers' control in the factories. Volunteers like George Orwell who fought with a Marxist group were chased out of Spain. This was at the same time as the Moscow Show Trials were eliminating the old Bolsheviks who had made the revolution. Sorry, this is a big subject and we could go on a long time, but a very important one, because it shows that when the chips were down, the communists - ie Stalinists - and Social Democrats supported a bourgeois republic but would not support a workers' republic. FayJay Rather a Blue Peter-ish couple of questions, I'm afraid, but: Who do you think are the most exciting new directors? (For the matter, do you go &amp; see lots of other people's films yourself or not?) Also, do you have a particular favourite amongst your own films, or do you always simply focus on the next project? Mcgowan2 Dear Ken, which football team? Coventry or Manchester City? I know it's not MFC but I have a sneaky feeling it could be Man Utd. Also, what do you think of the new Saturday Glossy Guardian? Last one. What is going to be the title of The Navigators. I know it was a working title. Anything decided? KenLoach I don't go to the cinema very much - preferring football, but there are some good new directors. I enjoyed Lyn Ramsay's Ratcatcher, the films by Gary Oldman and Tim Roth. The brothers behind Rosetta, and I thought The Last Resort was good. And on the subject of football: Neither Coventry nor Manchester City, but Bath city, where I lived for a long time. I also look for the results of Fulham and Nuneatan Borough, but anybody living in the south west, get yourself to Twerton Park before the end of the season! FilmFan Who would you say were your biggest influences? KenLoach My biggest influences - European films of the 50s and 60s, particularly Italian films by Vittorio de Sica and Czech films of the Prague Spring. barquing In the British reviews of Bread &amp; Roses, how quickly did it take for the \"Oh my God, Ken Loach had made a film in LA\" attitude to get on your nerves? And while I'm at it, do you think there should be a balance between a film's form and a film's message and if so how well do you think you achieve this? KenLoach It wasn't that attitude that is irritating, but those writers and reviewers who are contemptuous of any time when people take collective action. You see the consequences of the Thatcherite triumph in the reviews more than the films, in the way individualism is lauded at the expense of any group of people getting together. One reviewer attacked it simply because it was about trade unions. Maggie must be rubbing her hands in glee. Second question: Yes, content and form should be indivisible, and if the content can be reduced to a message, it's probably not worth passing on. One problem I have is the label 'political' which means there's a danger that people don't see what is really in the film, they see what they expect to see. Seona Are you suggesting we break up the big multiplexes like UGC, Odeon, etc? Because I'm more than happy to do that, evil things that they are. KenLoach Yes - what happens in Norway is interesting. Many cinemas there seem to be owned by municipalities and are programmed by people who seem to have a genuine interest in film. My favourite cinema is the Ritzy, Brixton. There are several others that I also like. ASA1 With reference to \"Raining Stones\", is there a truly socialist alternative? KenLoach Yes there is, but I guess you have to go back and read the books to discover it. One thing's for certain, it's not to be found in the Labour Party. FilmFan You're well-known for keeping portions of your scripts secret from your actors until the key moment. Could you elaborate on your reasons behind this - I'm thinking of the loan sharks scene in Raining Stones - and what effect having to re-take has on the a) the actors, and b) the scene. (Also, how often would you typically re-shoot an emotional scene such as that?) KenLoach The reason to sometimes keep a script away from the actors is because surprise is the hardest thing to act, so if you film the actual surprise you sometimes reach an authenticity in your response which you wouldn't do otherwise. zorglub Is it annoying to be considered controversial simply because you do not propagate right-wing politics or apply a highly stylised form in your films? KenLoach This comment is spot on! It's the pro CIA films or cold war films that are always seen as just entertainment whereas a counter view is marked down as political. \"Common sense is the sense of the ruling class.\" Gazer30 Hi Ken, Do you think that New Labour has gone so far to the right that it is impossible for it to regain its old 'agenda'? How much hope to you have in the Socialist Alliance instead? Does it have enough appeal to become a serious contender to parliamentary politics? KenLoach Yes, I think Blair has continued the work of other Labour leaders in transforming the Labour party into a party of business. The last election's slogan was 'Labour means business' without apology. I think the vacuum on the left is waiting to be filled. The most hopeful development in recent years has been the socialist alliances. I think there's an opportunity to develop a real challenge from the left. The Scottish socialist party has made a good start in Scotland. so look out for the alliance! RichardM Ken, at the NFT in '98 you said that you wanted to go to the States and use it as a location the same way as Hollywood uses Europe as a location. Was the experience of making Bread and Roses there a satisfying one, and would you go back again? Also are you frustrated that it has taken almost a year since its Cannes premiere for B&amp;R to be released in the UK? KenLoach Yes, B&amp;R is a European film on location in LA, with the protagonists being Mexicans and one north American from New York. But I think the whole approach was European, much to the bemusement of the resident film people. As for the time it's taken to be released here: No, we're accustomed to films taking longer here than anywhere else. susannahfr Dear Ken, I am currently writing my PHD thesis (University of Lille, France) on your work since the mid-60s (TV,fiction and documentaries) and I am particularly interested in social, political and historical issues. Having seen Days of Hope and Questions of Leadership, my question is : how can you account for the lack of publicity/interest accorded by the media and critics to the issues addressed in this particular strand of your work, whilst most attention focuses on \"the latest film\" ? How do you think the views expressed in Questions of Leadership and A Question of Leadership have stood the test of time ? KenLoach SusannaFR: Yes, people who write about films here seem unable to deal with wider issues, style and technique and show business. The wider questions of society and politics leave them cold. That seems to be the tradition of our cinema, which follows in the wake of the US and is why it's such a pleasure to work with other Europeans, either as co-producers or taking the films to European cinemas. In the case of Land and Freedom, as a typical example, in France we had 120 prints, in Britain we had 17. I guess that about sums it up. Seymour2 Hi Ken, did you ever consider going into politics when you were younger? Why do you think the younger generation is so generally apathetic these days? KenLoach No, my memory's too bad, and you'd have to mix with other politicians - it'd be a terrible waste of your life! ... ...That's all we've got time for - thanks for all the questions. The outlook may not be as black as we sometimes depict it ! Questions Ken didn't have time to answer danst Bread &amp; Roses is your first film set entirely in the US. Does this mean that you may start making more films in the US or is the US setting merely there to tell this particular story? barquing You've probably been asked this a lot (sorry!) but given that you do a lot of work with non-professional actors, what are your views on the forthcoming SAG and Writer's Guild strikes? FayJay Do you have any unfulfilled ambitions (cinematic or otherwise)? Datta Did you see \"The Limey\"? What did you think (in particular, of the way in which the clips from \"Poor Cow\" were used)? Did you have any say as to whether or not the clips were used? If so, did you ask to see the script or talk to the producers of \"The Limey\" before you agreed to the inclusion of the clips? Can I please have some clips from \"Kes\" for the Brian Glover wrestling/bio pic I am developing? ASA1 Could you settle an argument please. Who's the better actor Brad Pitt or Keenau Reeves? Have you even heard of them? zorglub I am teaching English at the local prison (in Norway) this summer and I wonder whether to show 'Raining Stones' or 'My Name is Joe'. Which one would you suggest? Despite the fact that your films are never condescending in any way I am afraid that perhaps my showing them in that particular setting would make them appear so. Do you think there is such thing as a wrong setting to show your films in, or a wrong way to present them? BeckyLewis Dear Ken, Is it true that you once made an advert for McDonald's? mattgale Hi, I was wondering as to what were your main goals, intentions, or what have you, as to why you decided to direct a film in the USA. I can imagine that it isn't for the reasons of technology, or even the money. Is it for the experience or is there some other motive as to why? nina793 Your films rarely receive the popular success they deserve. Would you like to have a huge international hit? Do you have a particular audience in mind when you write your films? sirtaylor Dear Ken, Doesn't it annoy you a bit that the people you make films about would rather watch \"Die Hard\" and \"Gone in 60 seconds\"? chrislis I am interested to know how you came to make Kes. Did you read the book and think it would make a good film, did someone ask you to direct it, or did you intend to make a film about the education system or a working class child and look for a suitable script? eroica Film making is a crappy and exploitative business in which people are forever ripping off each-other's ideas. How are you able to square your personal convictions with the shoddy politics of making a film? Perhaps you could use \"Raining Stones\" as a case study? RussellCrowe Hi Ken. Have you ever been asked to direct a big budget film? Would you consider making Titantic II or Armageddon II if you could slip in some leftist propaganda? Or do you feel that your principles would be compromised by the accountants and studio executives if you took the big studio dollar? jodmitchell Why are British film-makers often unable to source funds domestically? Do we, as a nation, lack self-belief? Or ambition? KingBoyD Ken, would you agree that you are one of only a few directors of recent times with as committed an ideology / agenda / social conscience? As an aside, what would you be doing if not directing? RichardM I've heard that the screenplay for Land and Freedom had to be cut back due to insufficient funds. Were there any major differences between what you wanted to depict and what ended up on screen? Also are there any other historical events or more ambitious projects than usual that you'd like to tackle if given the chance? KasperHauser Ken, In the unlikely event that one of your films was nominated for an Oscar, would you go to the ceremony? - if so, what would your acceptance speech be like if you won? ...also, what did you think of Peter Mullan's 'Orphans'? Along with 'My Name Is Joe' it's one of the few British films I can actually remember liking in recent years... barquing .. and what did you make of FilmFour's treatment of Orphans? criticalmass Ken, You're directing a party election broadcast for the Socialist Alliance. What will be in it? Also, you must have given money to the Labour party in the past - on their current performance, would you demand a refund? ka0310 Hi Ken, As an expat of 10 years here in Barcelona, I'd love to know if your recent \"Latino\" themes have anything to do with the success you have had here compared to the bizzare lack of acclaim that you have garnered in the english speaking world. zorglub in the unlikely event that someone offered to finance it, would you consider directing re-makes/spoofs of British mega hits such as Four Weddings, Full Monty etc? Jamie Sexton : I'd like to ask you about your early television experiences. More particularly, what did you think about the use of 16mm film in television drama? Did you feel that this technology was personally liberating and did you think it had a positive effect on television drama as a whole? If so, in what way? ZAPPATA Hello Mr Loach, with regards to your highlighting of the human rights abuses &amp; needs of refugee or migrant workers in your films, in particular 'Bread &amp; Roses' &amp; 'Ladybird,Ladybird' (last of which I found shockingly powerful &amp; the former I look forward to seeing)how does your experience of the U.S.A's political &amp; social systems compare with that of the U.K,are there similarities? And just one last question, what is your view of the peaceful entry of Subcomandante Marcos &amp; the Zapatistas into Mexico City last month? nac1 Do you like John Sayles' work? Is he the nearest thing to an American Ken Loach?! Was Matewan an inspiration when you were making Land &amp; Freedom? Seona Ken, a completely pointless question but ... do you ever watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer? EvilWillow Hi Ken, Have you seen Requiem for a Dream? Stylistically, very different from you. What do you think of the influence of music videos on recent films? zorglub Norwegian cinemas are part state-owned. it is not (i think) entirely up to the individual cinema to decide the programme. this ensures that small cinemas in thinly populated areas get the chance to screen European and Asian films as well as the big ones. it is of course also a good idea that 'art' films and hollywood films are not segregated into different cinemas. Norwegian cinemas are doing better and better every year. Gazer30 Will there be a directors cut of Land and Freedom, considering on another post here it was mentioned that you had to miss out parts due to monetary reasons?!? Jorge17 How much merit do you think there is in any kind of social democratic politics these days? It seems that whatever happens the system swallows you up within its logic. Do you think that cinema and the arts have now a more vital role to play in terms of promoting some kind of utopian alternative to the corrosive capitalist order? harrybackhouse Ken, when you've got a minute, could I ask you to check out www.keepcinemalocal.co.uk with a view towards possibly giving them your support? They can use all the help they can get. Ta. Loved Land and Freedom, by the way. branch11 do you think your films suffer from an overly romanticised view of the radical potential of the working class? brankie Hi I am currently come to the end of my dissertation. I am investigating the strategies need to create cultural and social intervention through documentary film. In which I have used Cathy Come Home as on of my case studies. I would like to ask you what would you consider to be to the essential elements needed to make a film facilitate social and cultural intervention in society. To motivate people to create change, like Cathy Come Home did. Thank you savageearthheart I'd like your read your comments about two different issues, if it's not too demanding, really. I'm writing an essay on the indigenous people of Nicaragua, and I'd like to have your opinion on the relations they had with the Sandinistas. The second question is related to 'Land and Freedom' in a way. Do you think that fighting for a better world today has a chance? I believe there are people who do want this, but get lost somewhere among pragmatism, cynicism, fragmentation of efforts and information overload. Do you think there is still hope for making thing better? Thank you",

      "body": "<p>This has been a funny old week, mainly in terms of accommodation. After finishing my last report, I set off rather late in the day for Wanaka. Having failed to learn from previous mistakes, I found myself once again negotiating a mountain pass at dusk. Forgetting that it was Easter weekend, and ignorant of the fact that Wanaka had a wine and food festival and a rodeo the next day, I blithely drew up outside my chosen hostel. 'Full' said a sign on the door, so I drove on to the next one, which was also full, so on to the next, and the next, and the next... I began to panic, and drove around to look for motels. There were plenty of them, but every one had a 'no vacancies' sign. </p> <p>I was just beginning to resign myself to a night in the car when I came across a bed and breakfast. Although it, too, was full, the nice lady made a couple of phone calls and a bed was found about 3km out of town. The price was five times what I'd normally pay, but I agreed and asked her to tell them I would be there as soon as I had eaten. As it happened the arrangement suited my new accommodation plan - the night before, still full of cold, I had suffered the mortifying experience of being shouted at in the middle of the night by a dorm-mate to \"stop fucking snoring!\". How embarrassing. I'd resolved to pay for a room to myself until normal breathing resumed. </p> <p>Back in the car I checked my cash situation to find that there wasn't much left after the price of the room - just enough for a sad-looking sandwich&nbsp;from a garage. Garage food seems to conform to the same low standards all over the world. However, the b&amp;b was luxurious with fluffy towels and umpteen pillows, and the following morning I ate an enormous breakfast of pancakes and hot cross buns. </p> <p> I pre-booked a single room in a hostel in Queenstown for that night and, in bright sunshine, set off to explore Wanaka. I found a lovely two-hour walk up Mount Iron which gave panoramic views of Wanaka Lake and the surrounding countryside. It then occured to me that I had never been to a rodeo, so I paid my $10 and spent a very entertaining&nbsp;few hours watching men being thrown off horses and steers being roped in various ways. I didn't know that New Zealand had so many&nbsp;would-be cowboys, all dressed for the part and watching with deadly seriousness. </p> <p>I tore myself&nbsp;away from the rodeo in order to be in Queenstown before it got too late. &nbsp;Queenstown has every sort of foolish, semi-dangerous pastime that the tourist industry can dream up. As&nbsp;I was here and it was now &nbsp;Easter Sunday I entered into the spirit of the place and looked around for the least dangerous but mildly exciting activity. Jet-boating down the Mataura river seemed to fit the bill, and I bought my ticket. I must admit that&nbsp;my adrenalin was activated more by the fantastic scenery of the river and the mountains&nbsp;than rushing under bridges, narrowly missing the banks and the 360 degree skids in the water, but it was all good fun. 20 minutes late I returned to my car to find I had a parking ticket. Initially angry, I then reflected that if&nbsp; I was a traffic warden having&nbsp;to work Easter Sunday I would probably slap a ticket on anyone enjoying themselves for too long as well. </p> <p>Queenstown was as far south as&nbsp;time allowed,&nbsp;now I had to start heading north again to get back to Auckland for my flight on Sunday. I'd booked a room at Killermont Station, a farm on the road to Christchurch, described as \"a peaceful place\". I drove up a dirt track to a nice-looking farm house from which a lady emerged and beckoned me to follow her, whereupon we drove in convoy down another dirt track until we came to a corrugated shed-like building in the middle of a field. It was perfectly comfortable inside but when I asked if there was anyone else due to arrive the answer was no - and there was no key for the front door, either.&nbsp;\"It's perfectly safe out here, dear,\" she said, as she drove off, leaving me alone in the middle of a field with no key and no phone trying to decide if I should stay or go. The bedroom did have a bolt and there was a sturdy kitchen table to push in front of the front door, so I opted to stay. I&nbsp;turned on the fire and cooked my dried noodles, but declined to&nbsp;use the washing machine complete with mangle, which would have been snapped up by any English antique shop. &nbsp;The silence was a bit deafening so I put on my \"Get by in Latin American Spanish\" tape, and listened to the chapter on accommodation - unfortunately there wasn't a section on being marooned on a cattle station. My reward in the morning, after a restless night, was to be surrounded by beautiful mountains, without a human in sight. </p> <p>I continued on to Christchurch, where the only place with single rooms was an all-female hostel called Frauenreishaus. This was easily the best-equipped hostel I have yet&nbsp;found - free washing machine, cheap internet, lovely warm duvets (good to give the sleeping bag a rest) and every mod con you could think of in the kitchen, including a bread-making machine.&nbsp;The home comforts - plus a compelling&nbsp;desire to stand still for a day - persuaded me to stay a second night.&nbsp;I wandered around Christchurch doing all those things that it's difficult to find time for when you are always on the move&nbsp;- getting films developed, sending off post, faxing my bank to sort out my visa payments and buying a new day-bag. The zip on my trusty bag that never leaves my side, even in bed, had become unreliable. Time for a new one.&nbsp;The only cloud on my horizon was that there were no spaces on the ferry to North Island at all the next day, which meant crossing on Thursday - very tight for reaching Auckland&nbsp;to hand the car back on Saturday. This left me the Wednesday to stop at Kaikoura to go on a whale-watching boat trip. Unfortunately, as we waited,&nbsp;a message was received that the whales were heading out to sea and the trip was cancelled. I suppose &nbsp;I can't be lucky the whole time. </p> <p>That evening was one of my few bad ones in terms of feeling lonely and homesick. I'd sat for a while with a group of youngsters discussing their A-level results (mine were so long ago I can hardly remember which subjects I took, never mind the grades), there was no internet available, and I was beginning to panic about how to spend my time in South America.&nbsp; I think travelling in Australia and New Zealand has made me a bit soft - it's so easy. Also, having a car has meant that I haven't had to lug the monster bag around. I'm sure that once I get to South America I'll be fine. I'll also relax a bit when I have booked my first night's accommodation. </p> <p>I felt better the next day and had a calm crossing between the Islands before going out for a delicious meal (lamb, of course) with&nbsp;Mike and Clare on Wellington harbour front. No need to worry about my snoring disturbing Jack, their cat, who shares the guest room. I gather that Milly and I must have passed each other at some point in New Zealand; I hope she liked it as much as I did, I'll be very sorry to leave. I'm now beginning to get excited about South America, and the emails are starting to come in with suggestions, which gives&nbsp;me a starting point. </p> <p>I will be writing from Argentina next week!&nbsp;</p>",

      "bodyText": "The editor-in-chief of the New York Post, Xana Antunes has resigned, fuelling speculation that she could be returned to work at a News International newspaper in the UK. News Corporation has confirmed that Col Allen, editor-in-chief of the Sydney Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph since 1999, will succeed Ms Antunes. Ms Antunes is a former Independent and Evening Standard business reporter. At her time on the Post, she worked under David Yelland in his previous role as editor of the New York paper. A release from News Corporation said Ms Antunes had left her post \"for personal reasons\", but it has been reported that she left as a result of direct pressure from Rupert Murdoch. Insiders said Ms Antunes was tired of her job after three gruelling years and had been talking of moving on to other things, possibly writing a book. She has also indicated her unhappiness at Lachlan Murdoch's increasingly hands-on role at the paper. In a recent editorial meeting, Rupert Murdoch publicly criticised changes at the paper, even though the changes had come at Lachlan's prompting. Friends doubt that Ms Antunes will move back to England immediately, as she likes New York.

      "body": "<p>Gloria Gordon noticed the young woman on the London bus was reading a textbook from the National Bakery School. \"This is where I started 20 years ago,\" thought Dr Gordon, who was last week shortlisted as one of the best higher education lecturers in the country. </p> <p>She used to get the bus to the same school (now part of South Bank University) and has gone on to build an academic career and inspire generations of students with her conviction that they can make a difference and change their own lives. </p> <p>South Bank, which nominated her for one of 20 National Teaching Fellowships, acknowledges that both students and colleagues in the business school where she teaches find her approach challenging. </p> <p>The judging panel of the National Teaching Fellowship Scheme has now included Dr Gordon among 43 top lecturers in line for \u00a31m prize money. Under the scheme, organised by the Institute of Learning and Teaching, 20 winners will each receive \u00a350,000 to be spent on developing their learning and teaching. The shortlist was chosen from 86 academics put forward by their universities and colleges in England and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Gloria Gordon says that as a woman of African Caribbean descent, one way to escape racism was through gaining academic qualifications. </p> <p>The national diploma in baking technology she gained as a mature student was the first step in a long road. After becoming a part-time and then full-time teacher at the National Bakery School, she embarked on a diploma in management studies, followed by an MBA at South Bank and a PhD at Bath University. Meanwhile, her teaching moved from further to higher education students at what is now South Bank's business school. </p> <p>The student body at the university is relatively diverse, but there aren't many black women lecturers. She says students are often surprised. Because she believes research and learning should explore the assumptions of those involved as well as the subject - \"double loop learning\" - she takes up and discusses remarks and attitudes that some might brush aside. </p> <p>It doesn't make for a comfortable ride for her students. While they are warm in their praise by the end of the course, she encounters resistance at first. \"It's not immediately appealing to everyone,\" she concedes. \"You can go into a classroom and shut off and go through the motions - I don't plan my classes for that to be the experience. It can be quite disorientating the unsettling. </p> <p>\"I don't want to be one of the lecturers who deliver material and stare at the wall while I'm delivering it. I am doing something I feel passionately about and something that can make a difference to people's lives.\" </p> <p>Students respond to this innovative way of teaching. \"I like the realistic and honest view you have of developing and challenging ourselves as individuals . . . I am really keen to use this approach for my dissertation as the aim of studying for me was to stretch and challenge me as an individual, both in terms of my intellect and approach,\" said one student, quoted in the university's citation for the teaching fellowship. </p> <p>Others commented on being challenged. \"This unit has made me think and question numerous different areas of my life, it has also contributed to my growth as a person and increased my maturity. </p> <p>\"A completely different style of guidance was delivered by the lecturer, forcing oneself to adopt a critical thinking approach, allowing individuals to reason out the con trasting opinions of the group. I found this to be effective.\" </p> <p>Her students are not the only ones with praise for Gordon. In recommending her, South Bank stated: \"Her work is clearly challenging to her personally, but is also sometimes similarly received by colleagues. This means that individuals are not always immediately receptive to her approach. Nevertheless, there is demonstrable evidence of colleagues actively engaging with Dr Gordon's approach and being inspired by it.\" </p> <p>Gordon's specialism is the behaviour of people in organisations and her message is that her students can shape the organisations they go into, that they are not passive entities. </p> <p>\"Somewhere out there are students I have influenced to think differently and act differently, to look at a situation and say 'how can I make it different?'. I believe it is a privilege for me to be in a position where I am influencing people's minds. I want to do that as ethically and as best I can.\" </p> <p>Gordon says she wants to see \"en thusiasm and expectancy\" returned to the centre of the educative process. She wants learners who are personally challenged and want to become lifelong learners. </p> <p>Coming from a completely different research background in immunology, including HIV, Lesley-Jane Reynolds, of Surrey's School of Biomedical Sciences and Life Sciences, is also passionate about improving her students' teaching and learning. </p> <p>She makes no secret of her view that current undergraduates are getting a raw deal from large class sizes and the break-up of courses into modules. \"The student experience, at a most basic level, is not terribly acceptable,\" said Dr Reynolds. \"With first-year classes having up to 200 students, it is hard to get one-to-one time unless they are brave enough to ask for it.\" </p> <p>Given the huge demands on limited resources in universities, she believes it is possible to give students more individual attention. \"The fellowship would allow me to develop an integrated learning programme including small group tutorials and the promotion of individual study, a learning to learn approach. Though this would mean fewer contact hours for the students, they would be better quality, allowing any particular problems to be addressed there and then.\" </p> <p>Renowned by students and peers for her enthusiasm and attentiveness, students have described her lectures as \"inspiring\" and \"hugely enjoyable\", said the university's citation. </p> <p>Reynolds specialises in macrophages (immune cells that are usually responsible for the initial attack against an invasion launched by a virus, bacterium, or fungus), more specifically in relation to toxic shock and the development of atherosclerosis. </p> <p>The head of her school has proclaimed it \"a testament to her skill that even on the Masters programme where she teaches the same class from 10am until 5pm she still receives high praise\". </p> <p>Ben Knights, head of the English and Cultural Studies department at Teesside University, describes himself as an \"intellectual odd-jobs man\" and is currently entertaining his level three students with the wonders of masculinity in fiction. </p> <p>Praised by his university as \"an exceptional teacher and professional educator; an innovative and reflective practitioner and an excellent role model for colleagues\", Professor Knights is credited with turning round the English department since arriving at Teesside five years ago. </p> <p>He studied history at Oxford, before gaining a PhD at Cambridge. He then worked in continuing education at the University of Durham until he joined Teesside. </p> <p>The shortlist for the second year of the teaching fellowship scheme reflected a wide range of talent in different types of institution (23 from old universities, 15 from new and five from higher education colleges) and subjects, said Professor Sally Brown, director of membership services at the Institute of Learning and Teaching. \"We were very pleased with the submissions this year, they were of a very high standard.\" </p> <p>The winners will be announced in June and have a fairly free hand over how they spend their \u00a350,000 fellowships. </p> <p>Like the other academics on the shortlist, Gloria Gordon now has to draw up a proposal to spend the money if she was to win one of the 20 fellowships. Her students pressed her recently on whether she wouldn't rather be teaching at Oxford or Cambridge. She told them with conviction that she is happy at South Bank. She grew up in Brixton and loves the diversity of that area of London and the mix of students of all ages who come through the university's doors. </p> <p>\"South Bank has challenged me in many ways and in my own way I have challenged South Bank. At the end of the day, I think it is a very important type of institution in the higher education network. </p> <p>\"If I can be an inspiration to other people there I am happy to do so and support them in their own learning and development.\" </p> <p>Who knows what future the young woman studying her bakery textbook on the bus has in front of her? </p> <p><strong>Roll of honour - the nominations in full </strong></p> <p> <strong> Bath </strong> Professor Christopher Budd, School of Mathematical Sciences </p> <p><strong> Birmingham </strong> Dr Claire Davis, School of Metallurgy and Materials </p> <p><strong> Bournemouth </strong> Mrs Ruth Soetendorp, School of Finance and Law </p> <p><strong> Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education</strong> Dr Margaret Harrison, School of Environment </p> <p><strong> Coventry</strong> Mr David Grantham, School of International Studies and Law </p> <p><strong> Derby</strong> Professor Don Mackenzie, Centre for Interactive Assessment Development </p> <p><strong> Edge Hill University College</strong> Dr Graham Rogers, History Department </p> <p><strong> Exeter</strong> Dr Warren Houghton, School of Engineering and Computer Science </p> <p><strong> Hertfordshire</strong> Mrs Jennifer Blumhof, School of Environmental Sciences and Natural Sciences </p> <p><strong> Huddersfield </strong> Dr Glen Hardaker, Business School </p> <p><strong> Imperial College </strong> Dr Paul Ewing, School of Mechanical Engineering </p> <p><strong> Kent </strong> Dr Les Walczowski, Electronics </p> <p><strong> Lancaster </strong> Ms Susan Armitage, Higher Education Development Centre </p> <p><strong> Leeds </strong> Professor Ian Hughes, School of Biomedical Sciences </p> <p><strong> Liverpool Hope </strong> Dr Lin Norton, School of Psychology </p> <p><strong> Liverpool </strong> Dr David Hall, School of Sociology, Social Policy and Social Work Studies </p> <p><strong> London School of Economics </strong> Mr Nick Byrne, Language Centre </p> <p><strong> Loughborough</strong> Mr Mick Wallis, Dept of English and Drama </p> <p><strong> Luton </strong> Mrs Joelle Commeau- Fanghanel, School of Humanities </p> <p><strong> Manchester </strong> Professor Paul O'Neill, School of Medicine </p> <p><strong> Middlesex </strong> Dr Phillip Frame, Middlesex Business School </p> <p><strong> Nottingham </strong> Dr Stuart Brown, School of Biomedical Sciences </p> <p><strong> Open University </strong> Ms Margaret Johnson, Teaching, Guidance and Learning Development </p> <p><strong> Oxford Brookes </strong> Ms Margaret Price, Business School </p> <p><strong> Plymouth </strong> Dr Les Jervis, School of Biological Sciences </p> <p><strong> Portsmouth </strong> Dr Michael McCabe, School of Computer Science and Maths </p> <p><strong> Reading </strong> Ms Rachel Percy, School of International and Rural Development. </p> <p><strong> Royal Holloway </strong> London, Dr Jennifer Neville, School of English </p> <p><strong> Royal Northern College of Music </strong> Dr Christopher Rowland, School of Strings </p> <p><strong> Royal Veterinary College </strong> Dr Matthew Pead, Veterinary Surgery </p> <p><strong> Sheffield Hallam</strong> Dr Anthony Rosie, School of Social Science and Law </p> <p><strong> Sheffield </strong> Dr Stephen Peters, School of Health and Related Research </p> <p><strong> South Bank</strong> Dr Gloria Gordon, Business School </p> <p><strong> Southampton</strong> Dr Keith Hillier, School of Medicine </p> <p><strong> Sunderland</strong> Ms Caroline Walker-Gleaves, School of Education </p> <p><strong> Surrey</strong> Dr Lesley Jane Reynolds, School of Biomedical Sciences and Life Sciences </p> <p><strong> Teesside </strong> Professor Ben Knights, School of Law, Arts and Humanities </p> <p><strong> Ulster </strong> Dr Pol O' Dochartaigh, School of Languages and Literature </p> <p><strong> UMIST </strong> Professor Nathan Efron, School of Optometry and Neuroscience </p> <p><strong> University College London </strong> Dr Anthony Gardner-Medwin, School of Physiology </p> <p><strong> University College Northampton </strong> Dr Chris Ringrose, Cultural Studies </p> <p><strong> University College Worcester </strong> Dr John Peters, Learning and Teaching Centre </p> <p><strong> University of the West of England</strong> Dr Ursula Lucas, Bristol Business School </p> <p>Institute of Learning and Teaching: <a href=\"http://www.ilt.ac.uk\">www.ilt.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Gloria Gordon noticed the young woman on the London bus was reading a textbook from the National Bakery School. \"This is where I started 20 years ago,\" thought Dr Gordon, who was last week shortlisted as one of the best higher education lecturers in the country. She used to get the bus to the same school (now part of South Bank University) and has gone on to build an academic career and inspire generations of students with her conviction that they can make a difference and change their own lives. South Bank, which nominated her for one of 20 National Teaching Fellowships, acknowledges that both students and colleagues in the business school where she teaches find her approach challenging. The judging panel of the National Teaching Fellowship Scheme has now included Dr Gordon among 43 top lecturers in line for \u00a31m prize money. Under the scheme, organised by the Institute of Learning and Teaching, 20 winners will each receive \u00a350,000 to be spent on developing their learning and teaching. The shortlist was chosen from 86 academics put forward by their universities and colleges in England and Northern Ireland. Gloria Gordon says that as a woman of African Caribbean descent, one way to escape racism was through gaining academic qualifications. The national diploma in baking technology she gained as a mature student was the first step in a long road. After becoming a part-time and then full-time teacher at the National Bakery School, she embarked on a diploma in management studies, followed by an MBA at South Bank and a PhD at Bath University. Meanwhile, her teaching moved from further to higher education students at what is now South Bank's business school. The student body at the university is relatively diverse, but there aren't many black women lecturers. She says students are often surprised. Because she believes research and learning should explore the assumptions of those involved as well as the subject - \"double loop learning\" - she takes up and discusses remarks and attitudes that some might brush aside. It doesn't make for a comfortable ride for her students. While they are warm in their praise by the end of the course, she encounters resistance at first. \"It's not immediately appealing to everyone,\" she concedes. \"You can go into a classroom and shut off and go through the motions - I don't plan my classes for that to be the experience. It can be quite disorientating the unsettling. \"I don't want to be one of the lecturers who deliver material and stare at the wall while I'm delivering it. I am doing something I feel passionately about and something that can make a difference to people's lives.\" Students respond to this innovative way of teaching. \"I like the realistic and honest view you have of developing and challenging ourselves as individuals . . . I am really keen to use this approach for my dissertation as the aim of studying for me was to stretch and challenge me as an individual, both in terms of my intellect and approach,\" said one student, quoted in the university's citation for the teaching fellowship. Others commented on being challenged. \"This unit has made me think and question numerous different areas of my life, it has also contributed to my growth as a person and increased my maturity. \"A completely different style of guidance was delivered by the lecturer, forcing oneself to adopt a critical thinking approach, allowing individuals to reason out the con trasting opinions of the group. I found this to be effective.\" Her students are not the only ones with praise for Gordon. In recommending her, South Bank stated: \"Her work is clearly challenging to her personally, but is also sometimes similarly received by colleagues. This means that individuals are not always immediately receptive to her approach. Nevertheless, there is demonstrable evidence of colleagues actively engaging with Dr Gordon's approach and being inspired by it.\" Gordon's specialism is the behaviour of people in organisations and her message is that her students can shape the organisations they go into, that they are not passive entities. \"Somewhere out there are students I have influenced to think differently and act differently, to look at a situation and say 'how can I make it different?'. I believe it is a privilege for me to be in a position where I am influencing people's minds. I want to do that as ethically and as best I can.\" Gordon says she wants to see \"en thusiasm and expectancy\" returned to the centre of the educative process. She wants learners who are personally challenged and want to become lifelong learners. Coming from a completely different research background in immunology, including HIV, Lesley-Jane Reynolds, of Surrey's School of Biomedical Sciences and Life Sciences, is also passionate about improving her students' teaching and learning. She makes no secret of her view that current undergraduates are getting a raw deal from large class sizes and the break-up of courses into modules. \"The student experience, at a most basic level, is not terribly acceptable,\" said Dr Reynolds. \"With first-year classes having up to 200 students, it is hard to get one-to-one time unless they are brave enough to ask for it.\" Given the huge demands on limited resources in universities, she believes it is possible to give students more individual attention. \"The fellowship would allow me to develop an integrated learning programme including small group tutorials and the promotion of individual study, a learning to learn approach. Though this would mean fewer contact hours for the students, they would be better quality, allowing any particular problems to be addressed there and then.\" Renowned by students and peers for her enthusiasm and attentiveness, students have described her lectures as \"inspiring\" and \"hugely enjoyable\", said the university's citation. Reynolds specialises in macrophages (immune cells that are usually responsible for the initial attack against an invasion launched by a virus, bacterium, or fungus), more specifically in relation to toxic shock and the development of atherosclerosis. The head of her school has proclaimed it \"a testament to her skill that even on the Masters programme where she teaches the same class from 10am until 5pm she still receives high praise\". Ben Knights, head of the English and Cultural Studies department at Teesside University, describes himself as an \"intellectual odd-jobs man\" and is currently entertaining his level three students with the wonders of masculinity in fiction. Praised by his university as \"an exceptional teacher and professional educator; an innovative and reflective practitioner and an excellent role model for colleagues\", Professor Knights is credited with turning round the English department since arriving at Teesside five years ago. He studied history at Oxford, before gaining a PhD at Cambridge. He then worked in continuing education at the University of Durham until he joined Teesside. The shortlist for the second year of the teaching fellowship scheme reflected a wide range of talent in different types of institution (23 from old universities, 15 from new and five from higher education colleges) and subjects, said Professor Sally Brown, director of membership services at the Institute of Learning and Teaching. \"We were very pleased with the submissions this year, they were of a very high standard.\" The winners will be announced in June and have a fairly free hand over how they spend their \u00a350,000 fellowships. Like the other academics on the shortlist, Gloria Gordon now has to draw up a proposal to spend the money if she was to win one of the 20 fellowships. Her students pressed her recently on whether she wouldn't rather be teaching at Oxford or Cambridge. She told them with conviction that she is happy at South Bank. She grew up in Brixton and loves the diversity of that area of London and the mix of students of all ages who come through the university's doors. \"South Bank has challenged me in many ways and in my own way I have challenged South Bank. At the end of the day, I think it is a very important type of institution in the higher education network. \"If I can be an inspiration to other people there I am happy to do so and support them in their own learning and development.\" Who knows what future the young woman studying her bakery textbook on the bus has in front of her?

Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 universities can now \"intercept communications\" and read emails sent on their systems. </p> <p>People may now ferret about in other people's private correspondence and tap their phone. If senior members of staff at Cambridge want a good read, all they have to do is decide that it is \"necessary to gain access to information\" in my absence. Each head of department is allowed to \"supplement\" this rule, so even that requirement could be dispensed with (I could find myself facing charges of misconduct for submitting this article electronically).</p> <p>Surely this should not be happening in a great research institution like Cambridge? Our guidelines do not seem to respect the privacy of the scholarly exchange, the overseas student writing in with queries, students writing in trust about their problems. And the same thing is happening in other universities. But if you want access to materials in which you are mentioned, that's another story. </p> <p>The Lancaster University Data Protection project (<a href=\"http://www.lancs.ac.uk/dataprotection\">www.lancs.ac.uk/dataprotection</a>) guidelines suggest that all information held by the university should be accessible to the data subject unless a specific exemption applies. In the meantime, in higher education institutions which have set themselves against a simple policy of handing everything over, students and staff have to wait until October 24, 2001 to ask for manual records under the Data Protection Act 1998. While we wait, \"shred-it\" instructions are being circulated and documents are being re-filed so that they can be kept out of reach of the Act.

His friends all urge a bullied technician to use the grievance procedure. The head of department calls in the friends to make sure they understand the consequences of being seen to support the technician. He is advised to ask for the records relating to him under the Data Protection Act. The department says it has no records on this technician beyond his basic personnel file and statement of grievance. </p> <p>Meanwhile, according to our rules, \"the university reserves the right to listen to or have access to read any communication made or received by a member of staff using its computers or telephone system without notice\", so the senior bully will be able to go fishing for \"evidence\" against his victim.</p> <p>Gillian Evans lectures in medieval theology and intellectual history at Cambridge University and is public policy secretary of the Council for Academic Freedom and Academic Standards.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Read any good emails lately? Were they someone else's? Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 universities can now \"intercept communications\" and read emails sent on their systems. People may now ferret about in other people's private correspondence and tap their phone. If senior members of staff at Cambridge want a good read, all they have to do is decide that it is \"necessary to gain access to information\" in my absence. Each head of department is allowed to \"supplement\" this rule, so even that requirement could be dispensed with (I could find myself facing charges of misconduct for submitting this article electronically). Surely this should not be happening in a great research institution like Cambridge? Our guidelines do not seem to respect the privacy of the scholarly exchange, the overseas student writing in with queries, students writing in trust about their problems. And the same thing is happening in other universities. But if you want access to materials in which you are mentioned, that's another story. The Lancaster University Data Protection project (www.lancs.ac.uk/dataprotection) guidelines suggest that all information held by the university should be accessible to the data subject unless a specific exemption applies. In the meantime, in higher education institutions which have set themselves against a simple policy of handing everything over, students and staff have to wait until October 24, 2001 to ask for manual records under the Data Protection Act 1998. While we wait, \"shred-it\" instructions are being circulated and documents are being re-filed so that they can be kept out of reach of the Act. It appears that has already happened with the electronic records. Students discontented with their exam results will ask to see the marked papers, the comments of the examiners, the minutes of the examiners' meetings and the report of the external examiner. But my university says that the student is not entitled to see the minutes, since they are not filed with reference to him as data subject. His friends all urge a bullied technician to use the grievance procedure. The head of department calls in the friends to make sure they understand the consequences of being seen to support the technician. He is advised to ask for the records relating to him under the Data Protection Act. The department says it has no records on this technician beyond his basic personnel file and statement of grievance. Meanwhile, according to our rules, \"the university reserves the right to listen to or have access to read any communication made or received by a member of staff using its computers or telephone system without notice\", so the senior bully will be able to go fishing for \"evidence\" against his victim.

Currently, there are no vacancies - although that may change if the head starts enforcing the statutory six-month rule. </p> <p>Failure to attend a single meeting over a six-month period means being automatically struck off, even if you've been more forthcoming and punctual with your apologies than President Bush. </p> <p>But when you consider the demands on most working parents, not to mention those on single parents, it is hardly surprising that most governing bodies are short of bodies. The Labour group on the Local Government Association has suggested this might be remedied by paying expenses up to \u00a31,000 a year, rather like jury service. It's a good idea, but seems unlikely to happen. </p> <p>Truth be told, the curriculum committee meetings are not scintillating affairs.

      "bodyText": "Confession: for the first time since taking a place on the governing body I missed a curriculum committee meeting. I felt a little guilty - even though I was able to give my apologies the day before - but a work crisis intervened so, inevitably, paid work took precedence over the unpaid, voluntary kind. Our governing body struggles for attendance, but, at least in theory, we can put bums on plastic seats. Currently, there are no vacancies - although that may change if the head starts enforcing the statutory six-month rule. Failure to attend a single meeting over a six-month period means being automatically struck off, even if you've been more forthcoming and punctual with your apologies than President Bush. But when you consider the demands on most working parents, not to mention those on single parents, it is hardly surprising that most governing bodies are short of bodies. The Labour group on the Local Government Association has suggested this might be remedied by paying expenses up to \u00a31,000 a year, rather like jury service. It's a good idea, but seems unlikely to happen. Truth be told, the curriculum committee meetings are not scintillating affairs. They don't have the dangerous glamour of disciplinary committee meetings, nor the heady power of the finance committee.

      "body": "<p>More and more schools are facing a similar dilemma: how to effect a miracle on their bleak, tarmac wasteland of a playground with next to no resources? </p> <p>What's required is transformation so that the area will stimulate imaginative play, offer an outdoor \"classroom\", feed into the national curriculum, raise ecological awareness and allow children to take pride in their school's surroundings. </p> <p>More often than not, the school and Parent Teachers' Association have little in the kitty, no millionaire benefactors or corporate sponsors in the offing and a dozen other pressing demands on the budget - such as leaking roofs, for instance. </p> <p>And the creation of a 21st-century play area does not come cheap. A single piece of equipment - like swings, balancing beams or a Wendy house - can cost between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000. Even with a high volunteer input, landscaping, murals, floor games, climbing frames, tables and benches can easily push costs way beyond \u00a350,000. </p> <p>So how to make the dream come true? One solution may be to enlist outside help in establishing an after-school club, to generate extra cash. </p> <p>A decade ago, Jackie Nunns, now the mother of a 13-year-old, ran a successful night club in London's West End with her husband. </p> <p>They divorced, she sold her share in the club and, with the financial freedom that brought, decided that she wanted \"to do something that involved children and the community and offered more social capital\". She had no qualifications except her track record running a business. </p> <p>In 1994, Nunns saw a part-time job for someone with \"entrepreneurial flair\" as a community development officer at Eardley Primary in south London. She was hired, Nunns says dryly, because the job had been advertised three times and no one else had applied. </p> <p>Seven years on, she heads The Trojans Scheme, a multiple award-winning educational charity, which runs after-school clubs at 14 south London schools. It also runs holiday schemes and acts as a community catalyst, providing advice and guidance to four other London boroughs and numerous PTAs on how to create clubs. Crucially, it advises on how to access funding to improve school premises and playgrounds. </p> <p>\"Government aims, such as the creation of a national childcare strategy and the reduction of child poverty, mean that there is a lot of money out there - what is difficult is finding the people who have the time and skills to apply for the funding that's available. Trojans can help because it has learned how to do it,\" Nunns says. </p> <p>Three years ago, Trojans opened an after-school club at Granton Primary School in Lambeth, south London. Now, more than 50 of the school's 320 children attend each day, and in September a breakfast club will open, also run by Trojans. </p> <p>\"We were wary at first about allowing outsiders in,\" explains Richard Courtenay, the school's finance manager. \"We'd had our fingers burned with a previous scheme, but our reservations were soon overcome. Trojans knows what it's doing, and does it well - and it opens the gate to extras we wouldn't otherwise have.\" </p> <p>The Trojans scheme is straightforward. A school provides rent-free premises and access to some equipment. Trojans keeps the fees at \u00a33.25 a night, \u00a31.50 for those on benefits or free if a parent acts as a volunteer (all volunteers are given training). </p> <p>An after-school club means the premises are open a further 25% of the day so they have community use.

      "bodyText": "More and more schools are facing a similar dilemma: how to effect a miracle on their bleak, tarmac wasteland of a playground with next to no resources? What's required is transformation so that the area will stimulate imaginative play, offer an outdoor \"classroom\", feed into the national curriculum, raise ecological awareness and allow children to take pride in their school's surroundings. More often than not, the school and Parent Teachers' Association have little in the kitty, no millionaire benefactors or corporate sponsors in the offing and a dozen other pressing demands on the budget - such as leaking roofs, for instance. And the creation of a 21st-century play area does not come cheap. A single piece of equipment - like swings, balancing beams or a Wendy house - can cost between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000. Even with a high volunteer input, landscaping, murals, floor games, climbing frames, tables and benches can easily push costs way beyond \u00a350,000. So how to make the dream come true? One solution may be to enlist outside help in establishing an after-school club, to generate extra cash. A decade ago, Jackie Nunns, now the mother of a 13-year-old, ran a successful night club in London's West End with her husband. They divorced, she sold her share in the club and, with the financial freedom that brought, decided that she wanted \"to do something that involved children and the community and offered more social capital\". She had no qualifications except her track record running a business. In 1994, Nunns saw a part-time job for someone with \"entrepreneurial flair\" as a community development officer at Eardley Primary in south London. She was hired, Nunns says dryly, because the job had been advertised three times and no one else had applied. Seven years on, she heads The Trojans Scheme, a multiple award-winning educational charity, which runs after-school clubs at 14 south London schools. It also runs holiday schemes and acts as a community catalyst, providing advice and guidance to four other London boroughs and numerous PTAs on how to create clubs. Crucially, it advises on how to access funding to improve school premises and playgrounds. \"Government aims, such as the creation of a national childcare strategy and the reduction of child poverty, mean that there is a lot of money out there - what is difficult is finding the people who have the time and skills to apply for the funding that's available. Trojans can help because it has learned how to do it,\" Nunns says. Three years ago, Trojans opened an after-school club at Granton Primary School in Lambeth, south London. Now, more than 50 of the school's 320 children attend each day, and in September a breakfast club will open, also run by Trojans. \"We were wary at first about allowing outsiders in,\" explains Richard Courtenay, the school's finance manager. \"We'd had our fingers burned with a previous scheme, but our reservations were soon overcome. Trojans knows what it's doing, and does it well - and it opens the gate to extras we wouldn't otherwise have.\" The Trojans scheme is straightforward. A school provides rent-free premises and access to some equipment. Trojans keeps the fees at \u00a33.25 a night, \u00a31.50 for those on benefits or free if a parent acts as a volunteer (all volunteers are given training). An after-school club means the premises are open a further 25% of the day so they have community use. Trojans, which mostly operates in areas where there is social deprivation, can therefore apply for government funding, from the Children's Fund and the Single Regeneration Budget, in addition to non-governmental trusts and grants. Under the government's New Opportunities Fund for instance, \u00a3465 may be given for each after-school place created. A 50-place club will generate over \u00a322,000. The school, Trojans and the children can then decide how best to spend the money. At Granton, the arrival of Trojans generated \u00a324,000, which was used to buy a mini-bus. More funding means that a playground improvement scheme is about to begin. Trojans also provides access to volunteers from corporate bodies who are able to help with, for example, playground redesign. Trojans is also attractive because teaching staff do nothing once they have been invited in. \"Teachers can be very territorial,\" smiles Nunns.\"It takes about a year for us to calm the horses. We always have sufficient numbers of trained staff and volunteers so that we know who is where - and doing what.\" Central to the Trojans philosophy is that children's views count. One child called the clubs Kids' Cities. \"They like to see themselves as taking over the school,\" Nunns explains. The name Trojans also came from a child: \"She said she saw herself as safe in the club, and that outside was a dangerous place.\" Clubs are highly structured - a mix of play, education and free time. No one is turned away. The first club at Eardley allocated 11 spaces but 33 children had to be accommodated. Three activities are offered each session, which run until 5.45pm. Among the activities are cookery, IT, drama, junk modelling, chess, martial arts, crafts and talks given by visiting tutors. A third of parents use the clubs as childcare, but its main aim is providing fun, fitness and educational play. At Henry Cavendish Primary School in Lambeth, school governors heard about Trojans a year ago and asked Liz Antrobus, the head, to consider the scheme. \"I took a bit of convincing,\" she says. \"I was particularly worried about who would keep it going and about security. From the outset, though, Trojans has proved such a bonus.

      "body": "<p>High speed training for Britain's railworkers and train drivers now appears inevitable following the intervention by a minister and a devastating exposure by a man from the Mirror newspaper. </p> <p>The debris following the fatal Hatfield crash last autumn had barely been cleared, when lifelong learning minister Malcolm Wicks voiced concern that \"pitifully few\" employees in the rail industry were equipped with nationally recognised qualifications. </p> <p>Staggeringly, out of a national workforce of around 200,000, just 207 national vocational qualifications were awarded to rail employees in the four years to June 2001, he revealed. Just 24 drivers collected similar awards during the same period; the other 14,776 drivers remained empty-handed. </p> <p>Coinciding with unprecedented anxiety over rail safety, imposed speed restrictions, service cancellations and recriminations, Wicks contacted Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), to press for immediate talks to try torectify the lamentable situation. </p> <p>Rail workers' training \"urgently needs to be improved\", Wicks demanded, suggesting that competing train operating companies would fail to win future franchise battles if \"clear training and skills targets\" were absent from their initial, core plans. \"Training has become a casualty of privatisation,\" Wicks said. </p> <p>Morton does not disagree. The Hertfordshire incident, in which four people died, was, according to the rail authority boss, a \"pivotal episode\" in the post-privatisation of the country's railways. The railway business had hit rock bottom, with a desperate shortage of skilled people cited as a root cause of its shattered reputation. </p> <p>\"Hatfield revealed problems we did not wish ever to see within our industry and occasioned a period of deep soul-searching,\" Morton admitted. </p> <p>These deficiencies were succinctly exposed a couple of weeks later by Mirror journalist David Pilditch, whose disturbing report entitled \"A day of lunacy\" made grim reading. </p> <p>\"It took me just 10 minutes on my first day on the railways to be made a site manager in charge of briefing 18 men about safety on the line,\" Pilditch wrote after joining a trackside gang. \"No matter that I had only two days' training. No matter that I did not have a clue what to do. No matter that I was colour blind.\" </p> <p>He went on: \"I had been told stories of how unqualified men were put to work on the track with little or no training after buying their jobs on the black market. Now I was seeing the truth for myself and it was frightening.\" </p> <p>Pilditch said he paid \u00a3130 for a two-day course in track safety, \u00a340 for a basic medical test and \u00a330 for a pair of steel toe-capped boots. </p> <p>\"The workforce can be supplied by little-heard-of agencies employing anyone they can get hold of. Many of those who apply are moonlighting from other trades. No references were required and the section of my application form showing my 'skills' was left blank.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most devastating revelation was the observation of a rail manager. \"People come in off the street and are sent to work with no training. They are out on their own and totally out of their depth. It's dangerous for them and the consequences for passenger safety are horrific. </p> <p>\"But the pressure is to turn men out so the contractors can get the job done on time.\" </p> <p>Here is the deep-seated problem. Rail workers may have little or no skills and fewer prospects of obtaining fresh ones, but \"work intensification\" makes these limited prospects even more remote. Inevitably a reduced workforce, dealing with a higher number of trains and demanding passenger expectations, plus repairing damaged track within a shorter timescale, has resulted in the workers doing longer and more unregulated hours. Subcontractors are often clueless as to what's going on up or down the line. </p> <p>Morton admits the \"perfect fix\" is not going to be achieved within months, following 175 years of evolution and seven years of privatisation. \"It is in the nature of railways to move forward in carefully planned, slowly implemented steps or chaos will ensue,\" he says. </p> <p>He accepts that the fundamental premises of privatisation were faulty, but says, it is time \"to go forward, grow up, and cure, replace or repair our shortcomings - not go back to some hazy, but comfortable public sector womb. We need more resources - not only money but people, trained people, skilled people.\" </p> <p>One positive outcome of the minister's concern has already emerged, with the publication last week of an 18-point action plan agreed by DfEE officials and representatives of the Strategic Rail Authority. </p> <p>Wicks views the document, Framework for Skills for the Rail Industry, as a major step forward, setting out ways to improve recruitment and skill levels over the next six months and harnessing the franchising system in order to improve training. </p> <p>A pilot scheme has also been put in motion between the Learning and Skills Council and five rail companies - Railtrack, Virgin, GNER, Amey and Central - to develop 300 NVQs. Some 100 signalmen and drivers will be among the first to be tested for their existing skills, with checks made to identify how new skills can be acquired. </p> <p>\"I'm very pleased with the progress that's been made,\" Wicks announced. Further down the line the minister said he hoped to see appropriate centres for excellence based in one or more further education colleges. </p> <p>\"There needs to be a very close relationship between the rail industry and the further education sector,\" he commented. </p> <p>He expects rail companies will only win franchising bids if they first spell out their training intentions. </p> <p>\"Although this is a matter for the Strategic Rail Authority, I have asked how each company might set out their human resources <strong> </strong> as part of their bids, so that training really does become centre-stage.\" </p> <p>This was the task envisaged by the Permanent Way Institution - so named to distinguish the permanent rails, sleepers and ballast from temporary track laid to build the railway. The institution, formed in 1884 by a group of enlightened railwaymen in Nottingham, still exists today. Its purpose, enshrined in its founding statement, is to \"advance track knowledge and the spreading of exchanging of such knowledge among railwaymen throughout all railway systems at home and abroad.\" </p> <p>The influence of such a well-meaning body seems marginal in the cut-throat world of today's railway system, so clearly exposed by the Mirror's report. </p> <p>So, said Wicks, there would be no turning back. \"We are what we are and there is now a consensus that training is crucial.

      "body": "<p>Our time at Njaya Lodge had been lovely and tranquil but eventually we tore ourselves away and returned to Lilongwe. This involved the usual exciting bus journey. The first leg, Nkharta Bay to Mzuzu, was in a pick-up full of bananas and included an unscheduled stop at a police roadblock. Unfortunately our driver's insurance was out of date and he was hauled away by the police out of sight of the mzungus. I was expecting a severe beating or electrodes on the testicles at the very least, but he soon returned cheerfully tearing up the ticket. A small 'tip' for the police had sorted everything out.</p> <p>We spent the night at a resthouse in Mzuzu and got up early on Sunday to catch the 7am express bus to Lilongwe. Despite the normal chaos at the bus station but we found a biggish looking bus with 'Lilongwe' written on a board in the windscreen. I stepped up and asked the driver if this was the express. He said yes it was, 450 kwatcha (about four pounds) each please. We paid up and sat down. Ten minutes later I saw a bus which was clearly the real express drive past the entrance. The lady next to us confirmed this and said our bus wouldn't be leaving until it was full.</p> <p>H and I went over to have a shout at the driver. It was too late by then, of course, but it made us feel better and started a lively discussion amongst the other passengers. They broadly split into two camps: the irate women (\"You should not cheat the mzungus!\") and the more sanguine men (\"Business is business.\"). The driver kept his head down and looked suitably abashed.</p> <p>After an hour the bus was full and we set off. Forty five minutes later, inexplicably and to the great delight of our driver, we overtook the express bus labouring up a hill.</p> <p>I find Africa maddening and wonderful in turn. All you can do is sit back and go with the flow.</p> <p>The remainder of the journey was uneventful apart from a chicken falling on to my head out of the roof rack.</p> <p>We only had an afternoon in Lilongwe. This was just as well as we'd exhausted the entertainment options after half an hour and spent the rest of the day in the bar of the old colonial Imperial Hotel.</p> <p>Our real reason for coming back to the capital was to travel across the border into Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. In terms of accessibility and sheer numbers of game, South Luangwa is one of the best wildlife parks in Africa and offers a wilderness experience that the parks in Malawi can't match. We had booked a tour with Land and Lake Safaris, and were at their office early on Monday morning. Our guides were Godfrey (a Zambian) and Eric (Malawian). Our fellow passengers consisted of three Finnish girls and an expat couple and their 16-month-old baby.</p> <p>It was a long, hot, dusty drive to the Luangwa valley. It was still the rainy season and once we had crossed the border, the road deteriorated into a pot-holed, track. Even with the two large four-wheel-drive Land Rovers we were rarely able to get over 30km/hour.</p> <p>But the journey was interesting nonetheless. We swept through small towns with traders frying chips or selling sugar canes and peanuts by the side of the road. We saw small boys struggling on their bicycles with huge bags of maize flour - the staple food here. At one point our vehicle got a puncture. Godfrey and Eric jumped out and changed the wheel with practised ease. Five minutes later we were on the move again. For them this was just another trip along another African road. The expat couple, who were surprisingly unprepared for the journey, helped by complaining the whole way. The baby was fine - it was the parents who did all the whining.</p> <p>Nearing the Park, the track suddenly turned into a tarmac road. This was the route the Zambian President used when taking his guests to see the wildlife, so of course it was well-maintained.</p> <p>We were all relieved to reach the camp in late afternoon. The lodge was situated just outside the Park in a serene spot overlooking the Luangwa river. Families of baboons played in the trees and we could see hippos wallowing across the water.</p> <p>Early the next morning, Godfrey took us into the Park in search of big game. Perched on top of the Land Rover we had an excellent view, and soon came across herds of elephant. They always seemed a bit annoyed at our arrival. Most would turn their backs on us in disgust but occasionally a large, tusked female would trumpet at us in anger. There were tall, languid giraffe who stared at us with utter surprise and would then carry on munching. There were colourful birds and skittish antelope such as impala, and puku.</p> <p>We did two game drives during the day and saw some amazing wildlife. I was more than happy, but Godfrey didn't seem satisfied. He kept shaking his head and muttering about how quiet it was. He was most disappointed that he hadn't found any lions and joked that he would have to send lots of emails to the relevant authorities that night to see if they could organise something for us tomorrow.</p> <p>Back at the lodge we had an excellent dinner. It turned out that Godfrey used to be in charge of the anti-poaching strategy in the Park. He would lead teams of armed men into the bush and, camping out at night and tracking the poachers during the day, they would try and ambush them in the act. It was dangerous work and many of his men were injured and even killed.</p> <p>The expat couple kept wanting to talk about breast-feeding, and how clever their baby was at managing regular bowel movements. The baby baboons could manage regular bowel movements too, but I wasn't expecting them to be intellectuals when they got older.</p> <p>The next day Godfrey was clearly on a mission to find some lions for us.

      "bodyText": "Our time at Njaya Lodge had been lovely and tranquil but eventually we tore ourselves away and returned to Lilongwe. This involved the usual exciting bus journey. The first leg, Nkharta Bay to Mzuzu, was in a pick-up full of bananas and included an unscheduled stop at a police roadblock. Unfortunately our driver's insurance was out of date and he was hauled away by the police out of sight of the mzungus. I was expecting a severe beating or electrodes on the testicles at the very least, but he soon returned cheerfully tearing up the ticket. A small 'tip' for the police had sorted everything out. We spent the night at a resthouse in Mzuzu and got up early on Sunday to catch the 7am express bus to Lilongwe. Despite the normal chaos at the bus station but we found a biggish looking bus with 'Lilongwe' written on a board in the windscreen. I stepped up and asked the driver if this was the express. He said yes it was, 450 kwatcha (about four pounds) each please. We paid up and sat down. Ten minutes later I saw a bus which was clearly the real express drive past the entrance. The lady next to us confirmed this and said our bus wouldn't be leaving until it was full. H and I went over to have a shout at the driver. It was too late by then, of course, but it made us feel better and started a lively discussion amongst the other passengers. They broadly split into two camps: the irate women (\"You should not cheat the mzungus!\") and the more sanguine men (\"Business is business.\"). The driver kept his head down and looked suitably abashed. After an hour the bus was full and we set off. Forty five minutes later, inexplicably and to the great delight of our driver, we overtook the express bus labouring up a hill. I find Africa maddening and wonderful in turn. All you can do is sit back and go with the flow. The remainder of the journey was uneventful apart from a chicken falling on to my head out of the roof rack. We only had an afternoon in Lilongwe. This was just as well as we'd exhausted the entertainment options after half an hour and spent the rest of the day in the bar of the old colonial Imperial Hotel. Our real reason for coming back to the capital was to travel across the border into Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. In terms of accessibility and sheer numbers of game, South Luangwa is one of the best wildlife parks in Africa and offers a wilderness experience that the parks in Malawi can't match. We had booked a tour with Land and Lake Safaris, and were at their office early on Monday morning. Our guides were Godfrey (a Zambian) and Eric (Malawian). Our fellow passengers consisted of three Finnish girls and an expat couple and their 16-month-old baby. It was a long, hot, dusty drive to the Luangwa valley. It was still the rainy season and once we had crossed the border, the road deteriorated into a pot-holed, track. Even with the two large four-wheel-drive Land Rovers we were rarely able to get over 30km/hour. But the journey was interesting nonetheless. We swept through small towns with traders frying chips or selling sugar canes and peanuts by the side of the road. We saw small boys struggling on their bicycles with huge bags of maize flour - the staple food here. At one point our vehicle got a puncture. Godfrey and Eric jumped out and changed the wheel with practised ease. Five minutes later we were on the move again. For them this was just another trip along another African road. The expat couple, who were surprisingly unprepared for the journey, helped by complaining the whole way. The baby was fine - it was the parents who did all the whining. Nearing the Park, the track suddenly turned into a tarmac road. This was the route the Zambian President used when taking his guests to see the wildlife, so of course it was well-maintained. We were all relieved to reach the camp in late afternoon. The lodge was situated just outside the Park in a serene spot overlooking the Luangwa river. Families of baboons played in the trees and we could see hippos wallowing across the water. Early the next morning, Godfrey took us into the Park in search of big game. Perched on top of the Land Rover we had an excellent view, and soon came across herds of elephant. They always seemed a bit annoyed at our arrival. Most would turn their backs on us in disgust but occasionally a large, tusked female would trumpet at us in anger. There were tall, languid giraffe who stared at us with utter surprise and would then carry on munching. There were colourful birds and skittish antelope such as impala, and puku. We did two game drives during the day and saw some amazing wildlife. I was more than happy, but Godfrey didn't seem satisfied. He kept shaking his head and muttering about how quiet it was. He was most disappointed that he hadn't found any lions and joked that he would have to send lots of emails to the relevant authorities that night to see if they could organise something for us tomorrow. Back at the lodge we had an excellent dinner. It turned out that Godfrey used to be in charge of the anti-poaching strategy in the Park. He would lead teams of armed men into the bush and, camping out at night and tracking the poachers during the day, they would try and ambush them in the act. It was dangerous work and many of his men were injured and even killed. The expat couple kept wanting to talk about breast-feeding, and how clever their baby was at managing regular bowel movements. The baby baboons could manage regular bowel movements too, but I wasn't expecting them to be intellectuals when they got older. The next day Godfrey was clearly on a mission to find some lions for us. We covered a lot of ground and did just spot the rear end of a female disappearing into the bush. Unfortunately she refused to come out and give us a proper look. It was on the final drive of the trip that Godfrey triumphed. We went back to the place where we had seen the female in the morning. And there with the sun setting behind them, lay two very content, well-fed lions. We got quite close but they completely ignored us. As far as these beautiful, powerful creatures were concerned, we were of absolutely no threat. In a hushed silence we watched them pad about. Godfrey drove us back to the lodge with a happy smile on his face. The emails had clearly paid off.",

      "bodyText": "Healthcare group Nycomed Amersham's plans to float its $3.5bn life sciences unit in the United States have been put on hold until stockmarket conditions improve. The Nasdaq flotation of APBiotech was due to take place in \"the spring\" but the chief executive, Sir William Castell, yesrterday admitted that market turbulence now made that unlikely. \"We will only go when markets stabilise and our bankers say the time is right,\" he said. \"Our business is generating profits and cash, so it's not as if we have to go to the market to raise money. We will be prudent with our timing.\" Nycomed underlined its long-term commitment to the listing by reporting quarterly figures in line with Nasdaq requirements for the first time. Results for the three months to the end of March were slightly ahead of analysts' expectations and the shares climbed 8.5p to 485.5p. Group sales rose 16% to \u00a3375m but it was sales at APBiotech that interested analysts most. They climbed 21% to \u00a3154m, a figure slightly distorted by the inclusion of sales delayed from the end of last year and a favourable comparison with a weak corresponding period last year. Analysts said the upbeat statement should give investors confidence at a time when rival s were being forced to slow spending.",

      "bodyText": "A power struggle in the Vatican has burst into the open with the claim that liberals nobbled one of the most influential speeches in papal history. Pope John XXIII's opening address to the second Vatican council in 1962, which reformed the Catholic church, has been misunderstood, it is alleged, because translators purged its conservatism. The Vatican newspaper, Osservatore Romano, said that progressive forces hijacked the agenda by excising a key passage which defended doctrine and continuity. Its chief theologian, Gino Concetti, said that successive Italian translations of the Latin text had distorted its explosive impact. Analysts said Sunday's article was an opening shot before next month's extraordinary consistory in Rome, at which cardinals and bishops will debate the direction of the church. Traditionalists are mobilising to rebuff an expected assault from progressives who want more democracy and open thinking. The victors are likely to be those who succeed in claiming the legacy of Vatican II, which between 1962 and 1965 agreed reforms which still gust through the church. Its guiding force, John XXIII, electrified the gathering by embracing modernity with a vision of a pastoral church of mercy, charity and optimism. Fr Concetti said the address, on October 11 1962, had been distorted by the omission of two significant phrases: \"the truth contained in our venerable doctrine\" and \"always conserving the same meaning and the same values\". The next day's Osservatore Romano carried the Latin text and a flawed Italian translation which dropped the two qualifications and paved the way for four decades of misunderstanding, Fr Concetti said. By seizing on his word aggiornamento - updating - liberals effectively appropriated the authority of John XXIII. \"Deviant steps were the result,\" he said Critics ridiculed the accusation. There was no cover-up since the Latin text had been freely available to scholars and some translations included the phrases, Alberto Melloni, an expert on the council, told La Repubblica. The pope wrote the text in Italian and it was translated into Latin for the address. The version translated back into Italian for Osservatore Romano was closer to his original meaning than the Latin, he added. John XXIII would have had time to correct significant errors, since he lived another eight months, until June 1963. John Allen, Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said the row was a pre-emptive strike by traditionalists on the eve of the consistory. \"It is a first strike. People are putting down markers, as there is going to be pressure for greater collegiality and decentralisation of power.\" Collegiality is the Vatican's term for internal democracy. The church is divided into those who think the council's spirit has gone too far and those who think it has not gone far enough. The memory of John XXIII served as a proxy battle last year when John Paul II put him on the road to sainthood. Conservatives persuaded the Vatican to simultaneously beatify Pius IX, a 19th century reactionary. Cardinal Karl Lehmann, head of the German hierarchy, raised the stakes at the weekend by calling for a third Vatican council to discuss collegiality. The Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, cautiously put himself on the reformers' side when being made a cardinal this year. Leading the defence of the status quo is Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the inquisition.",

      "body": "<p>No surprise that Charter88's new pre-election report* should sound grudging. Labour's constitutional reforms are \"impressive\" in addressing the UK's democratic malaise but there are black marks for Blair's retreat on reform of the Lords and Commons, freer information and a written constitution.</p> <p>Proportional representation (PR) is the big one. Voting in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been transformed but Labour also pledged a referendum on how Westminster MPs are elected. The system, according to Charter88's Pam Giddy, focuses attention on the tiny number (168,000 in 1997) who swing things in marginal seats.</p> <p>In October 1998 Lord Jenkins reported in favour of a system known as alternative vote plus (AV+). This aims to keep a personal link between MP and constituency while giving minority parties a look in. Under AV+ voters number their preferences in the constituency section and if no candidate wins more than 50%, votes are redistributed until that happens. A second vote gets cast for a regional list of candidates, giving minorities their chance. So, for example, Scottish socialist Tommy Sheridan gets into the Holyrood parliament on Glasgow's regional list when he would have found it hard to win a constituency.</p> <p>The chart shows how May 1997 would have turned out if the different kinds of PR had been used instead of first past the post. Anoraks say that the alternative vote is not truly proportional. The most radical and complicated form of choice is the single transferable vote, which is used in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. In multi-member constituencies, preference votes are allocated according to a pre-set quota. It is a way of ensuring minority parties are guaranteed a shout.</p> <p>One of the paradoxes of PR - which Charter88 does not discuss - is that it requires disciplined parties. If they were weak and loose, \"top up\" would not work. But parties need proper funding and Charter88's prescription for state support risks locking in the existing distribution of party preferences rather than encouraging a different alignment.</p> <p>Behind all this lies a deeper question, which is what political parties are for in an age when the broad ideological alignments of the last century are dissolving. Parties, like politicians, make an easy punchbag and Charter88 does not hold back. Their selection procedures are unfair and oligarchic. That is true but without them, how is sustainable democratic politics possible? A similar intellectual difficulty has come up in the commission on candidate selection convened by the Electoral Reform Society: imagine what a system comprising 650 different Martin Bells would look like.</p> <p>Are political parties merely instrumental - the vehicles by which an interest group achieves changes to public policies in its favour? This, after all, was the reason why trade unions created a labour representation committee in 1900. Charter88 publishes a list of the constituencies where the black or minority ethnic vote is significant and so could influence the vote - if such voters thought of themselves and acted as a block. But that is to narrow the idea of representativeness. On this page recently Mark Wickham-Jones of Bristol University showed that the better the Tories do in the next election the smaller the proportion of women MPs. Charter88 notes that only three women have been selected in seats where MPs are standing down this year. (They are all Labour.) Lurking behind these anxieties about race and gender representation is a worryingly mechanical idea of politics. Many would be repelled by the idea that women MPs ought to attend to a specifically female agenda.</p> <p>Charter88 is a ginger group. It might argue that to make the case for change in a conservative society such as ours you need to exaggerate and ignore the finer points of debate. For Charter88 each and every addition made to the amount of democratic decision-making in the UK is welcome. But this glorification of head count democracy needs to ask about the kind of decision that is properly made by a majority.</p> <p>People are great activists in theory. When asked by pollsters people say they want to give more power to the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly. Between a third and a half favour elected regional assemblies in the regions of England. Yes, they say, government power is too centralised (60%). Yes, they say, we should have PR for the Commons (53%). But on present evidence few would avail themselves of new opportunities to vote.</p> <p>Take regional government inside England. The Blair government is roasted by Charter88 for ignoring it, at least until recently. But advocates of regional elected bodies need to consider their effect on elective democracy at local level in councils. There are real limits to the public's appetite for ballots.</p> <p>There is also a limit to the public's understanding of and interest in matters constitutional. Charter88 does not resolve a paradox.

      "bodyText": "No surprise that Charter88's new pre-election report* should sound grudging. Labour's constitutional reforms are \"impressive\" in addressing the UK's democratic malaise but there are black marks for Blair's retreat on reform of the Lords and Commons, freer information and a written constitution. Proportional representation (PR) is the big one. Voting in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been transformed but Labour also pledged a referendum on how Westminster MPs are elected. The system, according to Charter88's Pam Giddy, focuses attention on the tiny number (168,000 in 1997) who swing things in marginal seats. In October 1998 Lord Jenkins reported in favour of a system known as alternative vote plus (AV+). This aims to keep a personal link between MP and constituency while giving minority parties a look in. Under AV+ voters number their preferences in the constituency section and if no candidate wins more than 50%, votes are redistributed until that happens. A second vote gets cast for a regional list of candidates, giving minorities their chance. So, for example, Scottish socialist Tommy Sheridan gets into the Holyrood parliament on Glasgow's regional list when he would have found it hard to win a constituency. The chart shows how May 1997 would have turned out if the different kinds of PR had been used instead of first past the post. Anoraks say that the alternative vote is not truly proportional. The most radical and complicated form of choice is the single transferable vote, which is used in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. In multi-member constituencies, preference votes are allocated according to a pre-set quota. It is a way of ensuring minority parties are guaranteed a shout. One of the paradoxes of PR - which Charter88 does not discuss - is that it requires disciplined parties. If they were weak and loose, \"top up\" would not work. But parties need proper funding and Charter88's prescription for state support risks locking in the existing distribution of party preferences rather than encouraging a different alignment. Behind all this lies a deeper question, which is what political parties are for in an age when the broad ideological alignments of the last century are dissolving. Parties, like politicians, make an easy punchbag and Charter88 does not hold back. Their selection procedures are unfair and oligarchic. That is true but without them, how is sustainable democratic politics possible? A similar intellectual difficulty has come up in the commission on candidate selection convened by the Electoral Reform Society: imagine what a system comprising 650 different Martin Bells would look like. Are political parties merely instrumental - the vehicles by which an interest group achieves changes to public policies in its favour? This, after all, was the reason why trade unions created a labour representation committee in 1900. Charter88 publishes a list of the constituencies where the black or minority ethnic vote is significant and so could influence the vote - if such voters thought of themselves and acted as a block. But that is to narrow the idea of representativeness. On this page recently Mark Wickham-Jones of Bristol University showed that the better the Tories do in the next election the smaller the proportion of women MPs. Charter88 notes that only three women have been selected in seats where MPs are standing down this year. (They are all Labour.) Lurking behind these anxieties about race and gender representation is a worryingly mechanical idea of politics. Many would be repelled by the idea that women MPs ought to attend to a specifically female agenda. Charter88 is a ginger group. It might argue that to make the case for change in a conservative society such as ours you need to exaggerate and ignore the finer points of debate. For Charter88 each and every addition made to the amount of democratic decision-making in the UK is welcome. But this glorification of head count democracy needs to ask about the kind of decision that is properly made by a majority. People are great activists in theory. When asked by pollsters people say they want to give more power to the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly. Between a third and a half favour elected regional assemblies in the regions of England. Yes, they say, government power is too centralised (60%). Yes, they say, we should have PR for the Commons (53%). But on present evidence few would avail themselves of new opportunities to vote. Take regional government inside England. The Blair government is roasted by Charter88 for ignoring it, at least until recently. But advocates of regional elected bodies need to consider their effect on elective democracy at local level in councils. There are real limits to the public's appetite for ballots. There is also a limit to the public's understanding of and interest in matters constitutional. Charter88 does not resolve a paradox. It would like change to be based on popular movement. But the public do not take to the streets for fairer voting (which is one reason Mr Blair thinks he can get away with it). Labour's constitutional reform has so far largely been top down. Without resolute and single-minded ministers commanding a parliamentary majority the next tranche of needed change (a second chamber for parliament, PR) will not happen. *Unlocking the policies.

The poet, whose work has been overshadowed by the superstar status of his friend Seamus Heaney, is having a dazzling renaissance, after a 12 year silence in the 1980s when he published no poems. Heaney himself called him \"a keeper of the artistic estate, a custodian of griefs and wonders\". Or as his publishers, Cape, put it yesterday: \"He's really on a roll.\" In January he won the \u00a310,000 TS Eliot prize, for his latest collection, The Weather in Japan. The medal is awarded annually, in recognition of outstanding quality in a living poet, at the nomination of an expert committee currently chaired by the poet laureate, Andrew Motion. The prize has gone to an eclectic list, including Stevie Smith, WH Auden and John Betjeman, since it was created by George V in 1933 at the suggestion of the then laureate, John Masefield. The most recent recipients are the Australian poet Les Murray, the last nomination by laureate Ted Hughes - who won the medal himself in 1973 - and the 80-year-old Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan, the first to be nominated by Andrew Motion. Longley was born in Belfast in 1939, educated in Dublin, and worked as literature officer at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland until 1991. Like Heaney, he became a critically and popularly acclaimed poet in the 1960s, both men writing out of their experience of a life in Northern Ireland frequently overshadowed by the Troubles. Unlike the Nobel prize winning Heaney, Longley's career seemed to have petered out in the 1980s, when he published no new poems. However, he made a spectacular return in 1991 with Gorse Fires, which was nominated for all the major poetry prizes and won the Whitbread award. Last year's collection, The Weather in Japan, won both the TS Eliot and the Hawthornden prizes. The Queen's Medal announcement was made yesterday to mark the 437th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare. The day was also marked, however, by a survey which would humble any poet. It was carried out for Lloyds TSB, and revealed that 25% of respondents could not remember the name of any play by Shakespeare, even though two-thirds insisted they had either seen or read one.

A reverent pause to let a herd of milkers pass Will bring me face to face with grubby parsnips, Cauliflowers that glitter after a sunshower, Then hay rakes, broom handles, gas cylinders. Reflected in the slow sequence of shop windows I shall be part of the action when his wife Draining the potatoes into a steamy sink Calls to the butcher to get ready for dinner And the publican descends to change a barrel. From behind the one locked door for miles around I shall prolong a detailed conversation With the man in the concrete telephone kiosk About where my funeral might be going next. Michael Longley",

      "body": "<p>As the key expert witness in the libel case brought by David Irving, Cambridge historian Richard J Evans faced six and a half days of hostile cross-examination. </p> <p>From the witness box, he could see to the back of the court, where Holocaust survivors hung on his every word, occasionally weeping. </p> <p>In a trial that went far beyond simple slander, Professor Evans felt himself entrusted with proving that the Holocaust took place. On every substantive point, he won. </p> <p>\"It was a serious responsibility. But I showed that historians can use the evidence to make a distinction between falsification and truth. The Holocaust won't be forgotten,\" he said. </p> <p>But being an expert witness had its price. Not only did Professor Evans have to endure the cross-examination, much of it by Irving, but the whole case took nearly three years' work. </p> <p>Academic expert witnesses risk their reputation, time, and the very impartiality of their research. By leaving their ivory tower for the lawyers' den, academics lose not only the security of their own lair, but the conventions and rules of academia. </p> <p>But it is one of the few times when their specialist knowledge influences directly the most important public debates: disasters, murders, miscarriages of justice or even the nature of history. </p> <p>Around 10,000 people act as expert witnesses at some time, according to Brian Thompson, the secretary of the Expert Witness Institute. Nearly three-quarters of court cases involve medical practitioners. Most top academics are only called on in high-profile cases. </p> <p>One of the most experienced expert witnesses around, Professor Peter Vanezis, is a forensic pathologist who has worked with murder trials almost daily since 1974 and with numerous war crimes investigations around the world. </p> <p>He was the pathologist called by the prosecution during the trial of the \"railway killer\" John Duffy, who was jailed in 1988 for two murders and 17 rapes or related offences. </p> <p>The director of Glasgow's department of forensic medicine and science, he argues that court and university are fundamentally different, and that's the way it should be. </p> <p>\"In academia you are looking at truth. In court you are looking at justice. The two are different. In court you will be criticised, but that person might not actually believe what they are saying.\" </p> <p>The gentler debates of academia are a world away from what is required from the expert witness. Vanezis sums it up by saying that shrinking violets need not apply. </p> <p>You have to relish a fight, and woe betide you if you get it wrong. The repercussions of failing to prepare properly for a case can haunt an expert witness. </p> <p>Years ago, Vanezis went to court with a brief about a woman's murder that he had not read thoroughly. When asked about the wounds, he read out \"stabbed incised wounds\". The judge knew that stab wounds and incisions were two different things and admonished him, saying \"you don't give a fig about this case\". </p> <p>Professor Vanezis scurried out of court too quickly to pick up his remittance. </p> <p>Even if your evidence is sound and well researched, the nature of what a court needs is different from a learned journal. Judges, juries and investigators have little time for academic complexities. </p> <p>Dr Charles Woolfson, a reader at Glasgow University and director of the centre for corporate responsibility, was the rail union's main expert witness in Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Paddington train crash of October 1999. He is one of the main proponents of the concept of corporate responsibility, having gained expertise in this area researching the offshore oil industry and the series of disasters within it during the 1980s. </p> <p>Woolfson believes that the involvement of organised workers can improve a company's safety plans, but cannot point to a vast body of research backing him up. </p> <p>He knows he is right, but in the publish-and-response world of academia, he could separate what was known from what was believed. In Lord Cullen's enquiry, he had to stand by the belief alone. </p> <p>Defending the unions in the face of hostile counsel, any admissions of doubt could, potentially, have diluted Lord Cullen's recommendations and Woolfson did not want to be the one to let business off the hook. </p> <p>An expert witness must balance their beliefs with the need to support their side. For example, Woolfson protested that although he was called to the Ladbroke Grove Inquiry by the unions, he also had his own opinions. </p> <p>\"Although I was supportive and stressed the importance of organised workers, I wasn't their mouthpiece. On the issue of corporate killing, while I believe the management needs to be brought to book, so do workers involved in disasters,\" he says. </p> <p>In the best-run cases, these differences of opinions and other doubts are cleared up before a case starts, Vanezis believes. Moreover, if they are serious enough, either the case or the witness should be dropped. The greater danger is that a combative lawyer can lure an academic away from what they actually know and force them to lend \"expert witness\" status to uncertain views. </p> <p>\"It's not infrequent that expert witnesses get asked questions outside of their specialist knowledge. You have to avoid that. For example, lawyers would try to to ask, 'would you call this attack frenzied?'\" says Vanezis. </p> <p>The idea of traipsing through this legal and moral minefield leaves many academics cold, either with fear or annoyance. And yet thousands more choose to do it. </p> <p>It is not just naivety, though Evans admits he had no idea how much time the Irving libel trial would take. Nor is it just the kudos of being the expert in a particular field. </p> <p>There is a more personal reward. Evans was thanked by Holocaust survivors for his work, while Woolfson remembers being congratulated by the families of the Paddington rail crash victims. These are plaudits an academic cannot earn without taking the stand. </p> <p>But there is a principle at the heart of being an expert witness, according to Woolfson. \"As academics, funded by public money to understand a subject, we have a duty to make our knowledge part of the public policy discussion. Even though our credibility is on the line in a way that it never is in academic argument.\" </p> <p>Not being one to walk away from a fight, Woolfson found that facing professional debunkers was actually rather fun. Even though they tried to box him into a corner, painting him as an unregenerated nationaliser, Woolfson said that, in the end, it was quite satisfying being able to respond aggressively to hostile counsel. \"I did the job that I had to do,\" he says.</p>",

From the witness box, he could see to the back of the court, where Holocaust survivors hung on his every word, occasionally weeping. In a trial that went far beyond simple slander, Professor Evans felt himself entrusted with proving that the Holocaust took place. On every substantive point, he won. \"It was a serious responsibility. But I showed that historians can use the evidence to make a distinction between falsification and truth. The Holocaust won't be forgotten,\" he said. But being an expert witness had its price. Not only did Professor Evans have to endure the cross-examination, much of it by Irving, but the whole case took nearly three years' work. Academic expert witnesses risk their reputation, time, and the very impartiality of their research. By leaving their ivory tower for the lawyers' den, academics lose not only the security of their own lair, but the conventions and rules of academia. But it is one of the few times when their specialist knowledge influences directly the most important public debates: disasters, murders, miscarriages of justice or even the nature of history. Around 10,000 people act as expert witnesses at some time, according to Brian Thompson, the secretary of the Expert Witness Institute. Nearly three-quarters of court cases involve medical practitioners. Most top academics are only called on in high-profile cases. One of the most experienced expert witnesses around, Professor Peter Vanezis, is a forensic pathologist who has worked with murder trials almost daily since 1974 and with numerous war crimes investigations around the world. He was the pathologist called by the prosecution during the trial of the \"railway killer\" John Duffy, who was jailed in 1988 for two murders and 17 rapes or related offences. The director of Glasgow's department of forensic medicine and science, he argues that court and university are fundamentally different, and that's the way it should be. \"In academia you are looking at truth. In court you are looking at justice. The two are different. In court you will be criticised, but that person might not actually believe what they are saying.\" The gentler debates of academia are a world away from what is required from the expert witness. Vanezis sums it up by saying that shrinking violets need not apply. You have to relish a fight, and woe betide you if you get it wrong. The repercussions of failing to prepare properly for a case can haunt an expert witness. Years ago, Vanezis went to court with a brief about a woman's murder that he had not read thoroughly. When asked about the wounds, he read out \"stabbed incised wounds\". The judge knew that stab wounds and incisions were two different things and admonished him, saying \"you don't give a fig about this case\". Professor Vanezis scurried out of court too quickly to pick up his remittance. Even if your evidence is sound and well researched, the nature of what a court needs is different from a learned journal. Judges, juries and investigators have little time for academic complexities. Dr Charles Woolfson, a reader at Glasgow University and director of the centre for corporate responsibility, was the rail union's main expert witness in Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Paddington train crash of October 1999. He is one of the main proponents of the concept of corporate responsibility, having gained expertise in this area researching the offshore oil industry and the series of disasters within it during the 1980s. Woolfson believes that the involvement of organised workers can improve a company's safety plans, but cannot point to a vast body of research backing him up. He knows he is right, but in the publish-and-response world of academia, he could separate what was known from what was believed. In Lord Cullen's enquiry, he had to stand by the belief alone. Defending the unions in the face of hostile counsel, any admissions of doubt could, potentially, have diluted Lord Cullen's recommendations and Woolfson did not want to be the one to let business off the hook. An expert witness must balance their beliefs with the need to support their side. For example, Woolfson protested that although he was called to the Ladbroke Grove Inquiry by the unions, he also had his own opinions. \"Although I was supportive and stressed the importance of organised workers, I wasn't their mouthpiece. On the issue of corporate killing, while I believe the management needs to be brought to book, so do workers involved in disasters,\" he says. In the best-run cases, these differences of opinions and other doubts are cleared up before a case starts, Vanezis believes. Moreover, if they are serious enough, either the case or the witness should be dropped. The greater danger is that a combative lawyer can lure an academic away from what they actually know and force them to lend \"expert witness\" status to uncertain views. \"It's not infrequent that expert witnesses get asked questions outside of their specialist knowledge. You have to avoid that. For example, lawyers would try to to ask, 'would you call this attack frenzied?'\" says Vanezis. The idea of traipsing through this legal and moral minefield leaves many academics cold, either with fear or annoyance. And yet thousands more choose to do it. It is not just naivety, though Evans admits he had no idea how much time the Irving libel trial would take. Nor is it just the kudos of being the expert in a particular field. There is a more personal reward. Evans was thanked by Holocaust survivors for his work, while Woolfson remembers being congratulated by the families of the Paddington rail crash victims. These are plaudits an academic cannot earn without taking the stand. But there is a principle at the heart of being an expert witness, according to Woolfson. \"As academics, funded by public money to understand a subject, we have a duty to make our knowledge part of the public policy discussion. Even though our credibility is on the line in a way that it never is in academic argument.\" Not being one to walk away from a fight, Woolfson found that facing professional debunkers was actually rather fun. Even though they tried to box him into a corner, painting him as an unregenerated nationaliser, Woolfson said that, in the end, it was quite satisfying being able to respond aggressively to hostile counsel. \"I did the job that I had to do,\" he says.",

German TV group Kirch and its partner EMTV made the pledge in a bid to prevent Formula One car manufacturers from launching a breakaway circuit. The commitment was made after Kirch's part-owned holding company, SLEC, paid \u00a3219m to the International Automobile Federation for a 100-year extension to its commercial rights to Formula One. The contract was originally to run until 2010. However, the move will not guarantee an end to the car makers' unrest. They want more say in the way the sport is run and are understood to want a stake in SLEC. SLEC is 75% owned by Kirch and EMTV, with Bernie Ecclestone controlling the remaining 25 per cent. In addition, the car manufacturers are only bound to the existing Formula One deal until 2007 by the Concord Agreement. The car makers were worried a transfer to pay TV would limit the sport's audience and therefore shrink sponsorship revenue. Today's placatory move by Kirch was made at an extraordinary meeting in Paris. After the meeting, the International Automobile Federation said: \"SLEC and Kirch Group have confirmed the championship will continue to be shown on free-to-air television.\" Related stories 06.04.2001: Teams force Kirch to crumble on pay TV 05.04.2001: Kirch dismisses F1 threat 01.03.2001: EMTV pledges to keep F1 on free-to-air TV",

It was filed on behalf of the family of slain teacher Dave Sanders and other Columbine victims in federal court. </p> <p>Companies named in the lawsuit include Nintendo of America, Sega of America, Sony Computer Entertainment and Time Warner Inc, which is now AOL Time Warner, and ID Software Inc and GT Interactive Software Corp, creators and publishers of the game Doom. </p> <p>During the investigation into the April 20, 1999 shooting, police found videotape that shows one of the killers with a sawn-off shotgun on his lap.

The suit seeks $5bn in punitive damages from 25 entertainment companies. It was filed on behalf of the family of slain teacher Dave Sanders and other Columbine victims in federal court. Companies named in the lawsuit include Nintendo of America, Sega of America, Sony Computer Entertainment and Time Warner Inc, which is now AOL Time Warner, and ID Software Inc and GT Interactive Software Corp, creators and publishers of the game Doom. During the investigation into the April 20, 1999 shooting, police found videotape that shows one of the killers with a sawn-off shotgun on his lap. He called the gun \"Arlene\" after a character in the Doom video game. Doom is a target shooting game. Other violent video games mentioned in the lawsuit include Quake and Redneck Rampage. The lawsuit also claims Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold looked at sexually violent material on at least two internet sites. \"Absent the combination of extremely violent video games and these boys' incredibly deep involvement, use of and addiction to these games and the boys' basic personalities, these murders and this massacre would not have occurred,\" said the lawsuit filed Thursday, a day before the two-year anniversary of the shootings.

      "bodyText": "Two more suspected cases of human foot and mouth disease are being investigated, the public health laboratory service said today, bringing the total potential cases to three. The new suspect cases were revealed this afternoon and are not from Cumbria where it emerged yesterday that a slaughterman working on the cull was having tests for foot and mouth. The service would not disclose exactly where or who was affected but had earlier stressed how rare it was for humans to contract the disease and revealed that several people had been tested but all had been negative. The only human in the UK to contract the disease previously was during an earlier outbreak in 1966. This morning, a government spokesman described the events leading up to the possible infection of the slaughterman, as health risks to humans came under the spotlight. A spokesman for the prime minister, Tony Blair, said: \"My understanding is that he was moving the decomposing carcass of a cow when that carcass exploded, and the fluid went into his mouth.\" Results are expected by tomorrow evening, but the government stressed that there was no health risk to the general population from the disease, which has flu-like symptoms and causes blisters on the hands and mouth in humans. It is thought not to be serious and poses no long-term threats. The Downing Street spokesman stressed that he was only giving details \"to illustrate how unusual are the circumstances regarding this individual possibly contracting foot and mouth\". He said that the Food Standards Agency had said there were no implications for the human food chain. \"There is no question of any of the meat going into the food chain. Even were it to do so, there is no risk to human health,\" he said. Meanwhile, another area for health concern is the mounting anxiety over cancer-causing dioxins which are being released from the carcass-burning pyres. There have been protests at the giant pyre for 7,000 animals which was ignited on Sunday night at Arscott Farm, near Holsworthy, Devon. Health fears were fuelled after Department of Environment officials confirmed on Sunday that fires lit during the first six weeks of the foot and mouth crisis had released some 63g of cancer-causing dioxins into the atmosphere - some 18% of the UK's average annual emissions. Concern about dioxins is increasing pressure on the Environment Agency to reconsider on-farm burials in an attempt to deal with the growing foot and mouth carcass mountain. There are currently more than 170,000 carcasses awaiting disposal in Devon from animals culled in the battle against the disease, and last week, the National Farmers Union in south west England accused the agency of being too inflexible about on-farm burials. The average number of daily cases is now 16 compared with 43 just over two weeks ago. The total last night was 1,448 cases in Britain and four in Northern Ireland. The government is also expected to announce today the lifting of foot and mouth restrictions on farms in west Wiltshire and part of Essex, near Brentwood.

      "bodyText": "The government is hoping to boost take-up of digital terrestrial TV by doubling the power of the signal from eight transmitters around the country. Media secretary Chris Smith and trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers have written to broadcasters seeking their commitment to the plan, which has been drawn up by the TV industry regulator, the Independent Television Commission. Doubling the power at the eight transmitters, including Crystal Palace in south London, would improve the quality of the digital signal in areas where the service is already available. It would also allow more people in those areas to receive digital TV. \"I do not want to see the progress of digital television hampered by a problem of poor coverage if it can be addressed,\" said Mr Smith. \"I want to see digital television continue to forge ahead and good coverage and reception are a vital part of this.\" Mr Byers added: \"Digital television combined with a phone line can give everyone access to the internet from their living room. \"This plan to boost the reception of digital terrestrial television is a key step in avoiding a digital divide.\" The government wants to implement the plan to boost the digital TV signal around the country within the next six months. Other transmitters lined up for a digital TV signal power boost include Sutton Coldfield in the midlands, Mendip in the west of England and Oxford.

Black people living in my ward are more likely to be the victims of burglary, assault, vehicle theft and robbery than my white constituents, yet 4 or 5 times more likely to stopped and searched by the police. It was against this background that I played a part, as the CRE's parliamentary officer, in persuading William Hague to sign the pledge. His enthusiasm - at the time - stands diametrically opposed to his party's subsequent hostility. The pledge grew out of the Leadership Challenge, a CRE initiative designed to encourage leaders to make a personal commitment to promote race equality within their organisation. William Hague, accompanied by his wife Ffion, signed the Leadership Challenge publicly at a ceremony at the Conservative party conference in October 2000. He even referred proudly to his signing to during a Q&amp;A session on the conference floor the following day. By persuading Mr Hague to sign, the CRE managed to get a foot in the door in winning the confidence of the party to put in process a plan to seriously promote racial equality at every level of its structure. Yet had it not been for the intervention of the party chairman, Michael Ancram and the cultural unit (a body set up by Hague to promote racial diversity within the party), Hague would probably never have signed the Leadership Challenge. He was suspicious - he didn't want the CRE to use his signing as a stick to beat him with at a later date. We assured him this wouldn't happen. It was this gaining of confidence that lead the Tory leader to sign the CRE's pledge, alongside Tony Blair and Charles Kennedy and the leaders of the main nationalist parties on March 14 2001. It was agreed at the time that the parties would make their leaders commitment known to their members. Michael Ancram's letter to party members - now controversial - was simply honouring that obligation. It would have been more appropriate now if the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats followed Ancram's example rather than criticise him for carrying out what was agreed. No matter what Tories say now, it was agreed that individual MPs would be approached to sign up. And this is Hague's problem. It is the Tories, not the CRE, who are using the pledge as a baton with which to beat him. Last year the Stephen Lawrence inquiry challenged parties to look seriously at how their practices, policies and procedures result in unequal outcomes for ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, none of have selected significantly more ethnic minority candidates to stand in winnable seats in the forthcoming election. And in Ferndale, racial inequalities continue irrespective of the national Punch and Judy. I, and my constituents, wish politicians would use the pledge as an opportunity to attack racial inequality - not each other. Those who use race to kick political opponents in the teeth for easy press coverage are not that different from those who use language intended to stir up racism.

The CRE denied Tory claims that it had deliberately set a trap for the party, and alleged the party had damaged its own standing.</p> <p>Robin Banerji, spokesman for the CRE, gave a detailed chronology of how the pledge came about and dealings between the statutory body and party leaders.</p> <p>But senior Tory sources yesterday stuck by their position that they were not told that individual MPs would be asked to sign up until after the party leaders put their names to the compact at a public ceremony on March 14.</p> <p>Party sources said they had \"never expected this to turn into a naming and shaming exercise\" and felt let down by the CRE.</p> <p>William Hague and the CRE chairman, Gurbux Singh, met to discuss the race compact on February 13. Mr Banerji was at the meeting and says Mr Hague and his aides were told that MPs would be invited to add their signatures after the party leaders at a signing ceremony. That ceremony, on March 14, was in dining room A at the House of Commons and the CRE says 100 MPs did sign.</p> <p>Mr Banerji said the CRE had written to all MPs on March 9 inviting them to attend. After the ceremony MPs were contacted to see if they would sign the compact.</p> <p>By last week three Tory MPs had contacted the CRE to say they would not. Newspapers ran stories naming them and, said, Mr Banerji: \"It was better to make the information public about who had or hadn't signed to stop speculation or hunting by the media. If asked, why would we keep that secret?\"</p> <p><b> Hindsight</b><br></p> <p>The CRE is adamant it had no intention of embarrassing anyone, and yesterday the body, charged with policing the 1976 Race Relations Act, was left wondering how it had ended up in the eye of a storm.</p> <p>The pledge on race had surfaced at the 1997 general election, when it was signed by Tony Blair, the then Tory chairman, Brian Mawhinney, and the then Liberal Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown.</p> <p>The aim was to ensure that racism did not enter the heated political debate during the campaign. But the CRE decided that individual MPs should be asked to sign for this year's election. \"That would send out the strongest possible signal to the public that all politicians of all persuasions stood shoulder to shoulder on this issue,\" Mr Banerji said. \"It's not an agreement with the CRE, it's an agreement between the parties.

      "bodyText": "The commission for racial equality hit back yesterday at criticism of its attempts to get every MP to sign up to a pledge to oppose racism in the upcoming general election campaign. The CRE denied Tory claims that it had deliberately set a trap for the party, and alleged the party had damaged its own standing. Robin Banerji, spokesman for the CRE, gave a detailed chronology of how the pledge came about and dealings between the statutory body and party leaders. But senior Tory sources yesterday stuck by their position that they were not told that individual MPs would be asked to sign up until after the party leaders put their names to the compact at a public ceremony on March 14. Party sources said they had \"never expected this to turn into a naming and shaming exercise\" and felt let down by the CRE. William Hague and the CRE chairman, Gurbux Singh, met to discuss the race compact on February 13. Mr Banerji was at the meeting and says Mr Hague and his aides were told that MPs would be invited to add their signatures after the party leaders at a signing ceremony. That ceremony, on March 14, was in dining room A at the House of Commons and the CRE says 100 MPs did sign. Mr Banerji said the CRE had written to all MPs on March 9 inviting them to attend. After the ceremony MPs were contacted to see if they would sign the compact. By last week three Tory MPs had contacted the CRE to say they would not. Newspapers ran stories naming them and, said, Mr Banerji: \"It was better to make the information public about who had or hadn't signed to stop speculation or hunting by the media. If asked, why would we keep that secret?\" Hindsight The CRE is adamant it had no intention of embarrassing anyone, and yesterday the body, charged with policing the 1976 Race Relations Act, was left wondering how it had ended up in the eye of a storm. The pledge on race had surfaced at the 1997 general election, when it was signed by Tony Blair, the then Tory chairman, Brian Mawhinney, and the then Liberal Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown. The aim was to ensure that racism did not enter the heated political debate during the campaign. But the CRE decided that individual MPs should be asked to sign for this year's election. \"That would send out the strongest possible signal to the public that all politicians of all persuasions stood shoulder to shoulder on this issue,\" Mr Banerji said. \"It's not an agreement with the CRE, it's an agreement between the parties. All we did is walk from office to office saying are you happy with this.\" Hugh Harris was deputy chairman of the CRE during the 1997 election. He said that with hindsight it was a mistake to ask individual MPs to sign the compact. \"It probably has backfired, it's allowed the people who want to throw mud at the CRE to do so. \"I don't know what the logic was that led the CRE asking them this time. Because of all the flak coming out, it's unhelpful, but a lot of the flak is unjustified.\" Some on the left believe that the CRE should be merged within a human rights commission covering race, gender and disability. Some ministers believe that under its current powers too often the only way for the CRE to tackle racism is through confrontation such as legal actions and formal inquiries. The CRE has a tightrope to walk. Some Asian and black people accuse it of doing too little, while rightwing Tories believe it should be abolished. Within the organisation there has been a belief that its powers need to be beefed up for it to be more effective. The former chairman Sir Herman Ouseley said running the CRE and navigating it through competing concerns was a nightmare. \"You manage with a lot of difficulty, you feel like topping yourself most of the time, you get no thanks from anyone, you have to live with your conscience.\" He believes the latest row will cause no lasting damage to the CRE.

Dr Raj Chandran, it revealed, \"who was ousted after Labour came to power, claims the CRE has been 'packed with Labour activists and sympathisers' intent on portraying the Conservative party as 'riddled with racists' \".

Perhaps because Chandran is not just any Asian GP, but a member of the tiny, select group of Daily Mail \"race experts\" who pop up whenever such issues arise and proffer an opinion that would have most black and Asian readers choking on their cornflakes. </p> <p>For any readers who haven't realised he's not white, Chandran frequently spells out his ethnic credentials. \"As a Tamil immigrant who came to England to escape racist persecution and discrimination, I have become increasingly disillusioned by the hectoring policies of the CRE,\" he lamented in one recent commentary. </p> <p>In the last 18 months, Chandran has dispensed his surprising views on everything from political correctness in policing to the problems created by foreign doctors in the NHS. On policing in the wake of the Macpherson report, he had this to say: \"Already the demoralised police in London are terrified to use their legitimate powers to stop and search suspected wrongdoers in case they are accused of racism.

A recent favourite is Lola Ayonrinde, a Conservative councillor for the London borough of Wandsworth.

But her appearance created enough waves for her to be signed up by the Mail. Shortly afterwards, under the headline \"Black on black, the race war we can't ignore\", she wrote: \"As a Nigerian immigrant who was for many years a social worker on the estate on which Damilola lived and died, I know that black-on-black violence is destructively commonplace, and that much of it is racially motivated.

In February 1997, the Mail became a major force for racial justice with its front-page headline \"Murderers\" above the pictures of the five suspects in the killing of Stephen Lawrence. This move effectively brought middle England on the side of the campaign for a full inquiry into the investigation. As Khan says: \"They did a very brave thing and some of us thought they were changing, but recently their whole perspective seems to be anti-Asian and anti-black.\" </p> <p>Following the Macpherson report, many media institutions recognised their own institutional discrimination and sought to increase their representation of black and Asian writers.

This move effectively brought middle England on the side of the campaign for a full inquiry into the investigation. As Khan says: \"They did a very brave thing and some of us thought they were changing, but recently their whole perspective seems to be anti-Asian and anti-black.\" Following the Macpherson report, many media institutions recognised their own institutional discrimination and sought to increase their representation of black and Asian writers. The Mail's own recruitment drive, though, will leave some people wishing it hadn't bothered.",

      "body": "<p>Behind the rival hands of race cards that party politicians hold are the facts on the ground. This column is about one of them. As the main parties proclaim their concerns about race, facts are drowning under a Niagara of piety. Yet this particular fact is so startling that it deserves wide study. In an honest society, it would tell you that race, far from being excluded from the election, would be near the forefront of discussion. But since only the Liberal Democrats care about it, and have an honourable record in dealing with it, the conspiracy of self-congratulatory silence is likely to succeed.</p> <p>The fact in question is the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Though William Hague is a slimy cardplayer, Jack Straw, I think, is worse. He, after all, is the minister. He saw the act through. Yesterday, purring sanctimoniously about Labour's superiority in all matters racial, he said this act \"puts on the statute book some of the best anti-discrimination legislation anywhere in the world\". But that is not why it should be famous. Its uniqueness is quite the opposite. It puts on the statute book the bluntest piece of state-sponsored ethnic discrimination in the 35 years since British parliaments started legislating in the field.</p> <p>The act's ostensible purpose was benign. Responding to the Stephen Lawrence tragedy, it extended anti-discrimination law to public authorities, notably the police, previously outside its reach. There were hiccups along the legislative way. Ministers had to be goaded into outlawing indirect, as well as direct, discrimination. What they couldn't be shifted from, however, was a decision to exempt all immigration, nationality and asylum decision-makers from the new law. These are now explicitly permitted to override what were for many years accepted principles: first, that immigration officers must observe the law against racial bias, and second that ethnic groups must at all times be treated as individuals not as a collective.</p> <p>How did this happen? Partly through the reptilian disingenuousness of the Home Office. Mr Straw depicted the specific change as itself benign. Without it, he said, \"ministers would, for example, be unable to authorise special compassionate exercises when necessary for particular ethnic or national groups\". The exemption would have only good purposes. Straw cited the mercy Britain had recently shown to Kosovo Albanians en masse. Discrimination for positive purposes had to be exempted from a new anti-discrimination law.</p> <p>Seldom in the annals of ministerial double-talk was such apparent virtue so swiftly renounced. We know this from the first ministerial instruction to immigration officers that was issued under the act, under cover of near-darkness, which has been operative since early April. This legal document, seen by almost no one, makes clear how the act should be operated not to let needy cases in but to keep national groups, irrespective of individual circumstances, out. Here comes the heightening of authorised official prejudice against national groups. The instruction says these must be examined more rigorously, detained more freely, and refused entry more swiftly if \"there is statistical evidence showing a pattern or trend of breach of the immigration laws by persons of that nationality\".</p> <p>Even supposing the statistics were reliable, this grotesquely offends against natural justice, not to mention the Human Rights Act and several international obligations. \"Statistical evidence\" in the immigration field is hard to verify, and in any case a baseless way of predicting the truth about an individual case.</p> <p>What case is there for punishing a newly arrived Serb merely because previous Serbs have been refused? A society that had kept its legal head would be unhappy answering that question. Yet the sweeping exemption grants officials, through ministers, the power to deport, exclude, refuse leave to enter, withhold exceptional leave to remain, and grant or not grant asylum, not only by reference to the collective record of earlier Nigerians or Chinese or Russians, as nationalities, but on the still more offensive basis of ethnic or national origins.</p> <p>During the act's passage last year, ministers showed themselves aware of the sensitivities this might arouse. When an issue arose about the meaning of \"ethnic\", Straw was quick to say it was unlawful for immigration staff to discriminate on grounds of race or colour. But this was as circular as it was duplicitous, as he surely knew. It was wordplay in the interest of squaring a supposedly progressive conscience with an indisputably aggressive attitude to asylum seekers. How can an immigration officer take ethnic origins into account, as the new law instructs, without this being simultaneously racial? Answer: any problem the officer may have can now be handled by the power the new act confers on ministers to determine when a racial/ethnic decision is \"justified\" or \"necessary\".</p> <p>Searching for a reasoned justification, ministers fell back on racketeering. The main scenario they offered against which these blanket powers were necessary was where criminal gangs organised economic migration from China. People who looked Chinese might on these grounds have to be singled out for attention. Revealingly, Straw's deputy, Mike O'Brien, when challenged with a parallel hypothesis of white economic migrants from eastern Europe, perhaps orchestrated by Russian gangs, shrank from making a similar ethnic generalisation. \"White people are not one homogeneous ethnic group, incapable of being distinguished one from another,\" he said, as if non-white people were somehow other.</p> <p>The truth is that this part of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act is ethnically discriminatory, in a way which such ministerial language only confirms. It is not aimed at scams alone. It's meant to withhold justice from groups of people - unspecified in the law, but in categories open-ended to the whim of ministers - based on their ethnic or national origins, and without a fair chance to answer back. Anyone who doubts this has only to read the final clause in the ministerial directive. It says: \"If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.\"</p> <p>So the net closes on the British reputation for the rule of decent law.

      "bodyText": "Behind the rival hands of race cards that party politicians hold are the facts on the ground. This column is about one of them. As the main parties proclaim their concerns about race, facts are drowning under a Niagara of piety. Yet this particular fact is so startling that it deserves wide study. In an honest society, it would tell you that race, far from being excluded from the election, would be near the forefront of discussion. But since only the Liberal Democrats care about it, and have an honourable record in dealing with it, the conspiracy of self-congratulatory silence is likely to succeed. The fact in question is the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Though William Hague is a slimy cardplayer, Jack Straw, I think, is worse. He, after all, is the minister. He saw the act through. Yesterday, purring sanctimoniously about Labour's superiority in all matters racial, he said this act \"puts on the statute book some of the best anti-discrimination legislation anywhere in the world\". But that is not why it should be famous. Its uniqueness is quite the opposite. It puts on the statute book the bluntest piece of state-sponsored ethnic discrimination in the 35 years since British parliaments started legislating in the field. The act's ostensible purpose was benign. Responding to the Stephen Lawrence tragedy, it extended anti-discrimination law to public authorities, notably the police, previously outside its reach. There were hiccups along the legislative way. Ministers had to be goaded into outlawing indirect, as well as direct, discrimination. What they couldn't be shifted from, however, was a decision to exempt all immigration, nationality and asylum decision-makers from the new law. These are now explicitly permitted to override what were for many years accepted principles: first, that immigration officers must observe the law against racial bias, and second that ethnic groups must at all times be treated as individuals not as a collective. How did this happen? Partly through the reptilian disingenuousness of the Home Office. Mr Straw depicted the specific change as itself benign. Without it, he said, \"ministers would, for example, be unable to authorise special compassionate exercises when necessary for particular ethnic or national groups\". The exemption would have only good purposes. Straw cited the mercy Britain had recently shown to Kosovo Albanians en masse. Discrimination for positive purposes had to be exempted from a new anti-discrimination law. Seldom in the annals of ministerial double-talk was such apparent virtue so swiftly renounced. We know this from the first ministerial instruction to immigration officers that was issued under the act, under cover of near-darkness, which has been operative since early April. This legal document, seen by almost no one, makes clear how the act should be operated not to let needy cases in but to keep national groups, irrespective of individual circumstances, out. Here comes the heightening of authorised official prejudice against national groups. The instruction says these must be examined more rigorously, detained more freely, and refused entry more swiftly if \"there is statistical evidence showing a pattern or trend of breach of the immigration laws by persons of that nationality\". Even supposing the statistics were reliable, this grotesquely offends against natural justice, not to mention the Human Rights Act and several international obligations. \"Statistical evidence\" in the immigration field is hard to verify, and in any case a baseless way of predicting the truth about an individual case. What case is there for punishing a newly arrived Serb merely because previous Serbs have been refused? A society that had kept its legal head would be unhappy answering that question. Yet the sweeping exemption grants officials, through ministers, the power to deport, exclude, refuse leave to enter, withhold exceptional leave to remain, and grant or not grant asylum, not only by reference to the collective record of earlier Nigerians or Chinese or Russians, as nationalities, but on the still more offensive basis of ethnic or national origins. During the act's passage last year, ministers showed themselves aware of the sensitivities this might arouse. When an issue arose about the meaning of \"ethnic\", Straw was quick to say it was unlawful for immigration staff to discriminate on grounds of race or colour. But this was as circular as it was duplicitous, as he surely knew. It was wordplay in the interest of squaring a supposedly progressive conscience with an indisputably aggressive attitude to asylum seekers. How can an immigration officer take ethnic origins into account, as the new law instructs, without this being simultaneously racial? Answer: any problem the officer may have can now be handled by the power the new act confers on ministers to determine when a racial/ethnic decision is \"justified\" or \"necessary\". Searching for a reasoned justification, ministers fell back on racketeering. The main scenario they offered against which these blanket powers were necessary was where criminal gangs organised economic migration from China. People who looked Chinese might on these grounds have to be singled out for attention. Revealingly, Straw's deputy, Mike O'Brien, when challenged with a parallel hypothesis of white economic migrants from eastern Europe, perhaps orchestrated by Russian gangs, shrank from making a similar ethnic generalisation. \"White people are not one homogeneous ethnic group, incapable of being distinguished one from another,\" he said, as if non-white people were somehow other. The truth is that this part of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act is ethnically discriminatory, in a way which such ministerial language only confirms. It is not aimed at scams alone. It's meant to withhold justice from groups of people - unspecified in the law, but in categories open-ended to the whim of ministers - based on their ethnic or national origins, and without a fair chance to answer back. Anyone who doubts this has only to read the final clause in the ministerial directive. It says: \"If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.\" So the net closes on the British reputation for the rule of decent law. Asylum and immigration pose complex problems in the modern age, but they do not need to be addressed by this kind of perversion of the system. Maybe only an optimist would expect it to feature in the election campaign. Even the Lib Dems may hesitate to talk up their record. But behind the smarmy talk about what politicians should say, there's the issue of what they do. What Jack Straw, famous for his anti-racism, has done is write into statute a law of national and ethnic and racial discrimination. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

It emerged that 40 of its clients were not involved in the project, and that CHKS had no intention of naming the 35 trusts clients who failed to reach the list - and which pay the company \u00a35,000 a year for its services. \"I think they should have produced the whole list - it's all very well saying these are the best hospitals but the public has a right to know the worst ones,\" said Mike Stone, director of the Patients Association.

CHKS provides a \"benchmarking\" service to its trust clients which involves analysing performance and comparing it with that of similar hospitals to enable the client identify areas where services can be improved. The \"40 top hospitals\" club members will be awarded a \"specially designed sculpture\" to mark their achievement at an award ceremony hosted and paid for by CHKS this evening.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>TWO CRIMES AND PUNISHMENT</strong></p> <p>Are Chesterfield really as bent as the wonky spire on the city's Parish Church? \"No way!\" mewled the liberal, sandal-eating members of the Football League's disciplinary panel. Two weeks ago they found the club guilty of just two of the 90 charges levelled against them and sent them home with a \u00a320,000 fine, a nine-point penalty, and a packet of chocolate digestives. \"Yes way!\" screamed the Football League's board of directors however. Today they threw out the same nine-point deduction recommended by their disciplinary panel - because they considered the punishment softer than an army-sized pack of Andrex.</p> <p>\"As a result of the findings of guilt by the panel, the board considers that the recommendation to deduct nine points does not sufficiently reflect the damage brought to the integrity of the competition,\" thundered Football League chief executive David Burns in his best borstal-boss voice. \"Accordingly we have asked the panel to reconvene to consider the matter afresh.\" That view was endorsed by sports minister Kate Hoey, who demanded the sort of vengeance that usually earns you a place in George W Bush's cabinet. \"The penalty, which would have still allowed the club to benefit from breaking the rules at the expense of the other clubs who have abided by the rules, is just not right,\" she shrieked, before chanting \"burn them, burn them\" over and over again.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Chesterfield - who are now facing a larger points deduction which could rob them of promotion to the Second Division - have been left bemused by the news. Chief executive John Green admitted to feeling \"extremely disappointed\", while ex-chairman Darren Brown, who resigned after the charges were brought, kept insisting: \"We felt nine points was perhaps too harsh because we had done nothing wrong.\" But the man who summed up the club's torment best was assistant manager Ian Banks. \"We all thought it was done and dusted. We thought that was it - and it just keeps going on,\" he wailed. \"It's another kick in the goolies - and it's not as though we haven't had enough of them this season.\" Indeed, indeed. And unfortunately it's the Spireites long-suffering fans who are feeling the pain more than most.</p> <p><strong>VAN DAMN</strong></p> <p>He may have only just arrived in the country, but already the Fiver doesn't like the look of Ruud van Nistelrooy's face*. There's something about that nose, especially in conjunction with the floppy haircut, that's just too damn Mr Noseybonk**. But if the Imperial Lord Ferg has decided the man is worth \u00a319m of Money Mart's money, then who are we to criticise? Arsenal Wenger on the other hand</p> <p>\"I was surprised at the fee United have paid,\" the Arsene manager told the Evening Standard today. \"But it just shows that the new transfer rules have no influence.\" Which must make anyone who spent \u00a313m on Sylvain Wiltord breathe a sigh of relief. \"Is it too much for a club to pay? It depends on how old the player is and most of it is down to what he does on the pitch.\" Two words: Igor Stepanovs.</p> <p>But then here's another two words: Dwight Yorke. The \u00a312.6m United wastrel is the one widely tipped to make way for van Nistelrooy, but apparently he is no longer a target for Claudio Also-Ranieri's happy Chelsea. It seems United are not too worried about recouping any money just yet, however, as the Newcastle Evening Chronicle suggests they have just had a \u00a315m bid for Kieron Dyer turned down. Like a boomerang made out of gold they'll be back though and, according to sources at St James Park, it could be that \u00a320m is enough to buy United a new right-winger. Transfer gossip, innit brill?!</p> <p> * That's cos he looks like Greg van Rusedski <br> ** Listen, if the BBC can devote entire evenings to childish nostalgia, then we can give it one line.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I have very strong principles about which substances I consume. I have only one body which is the home of my spirit therefore I cherish my body. Because of the importance of this principle it is not always easy for our medical staff to work with me. Sometimes I don't even accept the simplest medical treatment. It is a matter of deep conviction that would lead me to reject a simple glass of wine at dinner or any sort of chocolate bars\" - Edgar Davids, whose positive test for Nandrolone must have been a complete mistake.</p> <p><strong>END OF THE ROAD</strong></p> <p>They're forever building things at Chelsea's of Chelsea. If they're not throwing up a lovely conference hall, they're opening a charming cod-Irish restaurant like Arkles. But is that enough for the swish London boutique? No way! And now that the C's of C Village is officially no longer a money pit, it's time to ask the construction men to get down to some serious work. But what's the first thing they're going to build? Why, it's a great big dual carriageway, of course, which will allow the club's biggest stars to get the hell out of west London as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Vvrrooom! There goes Marcel Desailly, who is well narked off with doing sod all at the Chelse and fancies being put out to pasture at Marseille. \"I had the feeling that I could have been used by [former Marseille manager] Rolland Courbis in 1999,\" he explained as he tested out the tarmac. \"Nothing happened, though. But now, what do they do in Marseille for me? Nothing. But the day they do make some effort, you will hear from me on that subject.\" Which was interesting, as only a few hours later he was turning right while indicating left, and telling his personal website: \"I don't have any doubts about my future, I'm with Chelsea.\"</p> <p>Neeeeooowww! Not far behind M Desailly is Gustavo Poyet. \"I cannot see a bright future for me at Chelsea,\" he bellowed today as he slammed his foot to the floor. \"I want to be given the chance to finish my career at a club where I have a real chance of winning the championship. We have four games left and are playing for a place in [Euro Vase]. That is not good enough for Chelsea and it is not good enough for me.\" So what the Uruguayan will make of Colin Hutchison's attempts to catch him on a trendy C of C's Village scooter is up for debate. \"Gus is an emotional guy and we want him to stay\", panted Hutch. \"Claudio has already made that clear.\" Which must, in some way, be a first.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>AC Milan are preparing a \u00a320m bid for Mark Viduka. \"Everyone at the club knows how much Viduka is wanted,\" said a spokesman. \"There is no desire to sign Beckham or Owen. We want to beat Roma and Internazionale to sign Viduka.\"</p> <p>Arsenal are ready to make a \u00a312m move for Roma's Hideotoshi Nakata.</p> <p>Bayern Munich are prepared to bid around \u00a312m for Hertha Berlin star Sebastian Deisler.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>The pitch at the Millennium Stadium is to be completely relaid ahead of the FA Cup final on May 12. Work is expected to begin on Saturday, with the whole process set to take three or four days. </p> <p>Thierry Henry has said that Arsenal's season will be a failure even if they win the FA Cup final next month. \"Whatever the outcome, we have failed this season\", said Henry on the eve of France's friendly against Portugal. \"When you finish 15 points behind the champions you have to say you didn't live up to expectations. And we can say we have failed this season even if we win the FA Cup.\"</p> <p>Fabien Barthez has claimed the current Manchester United side is the best he has ever played with. \"They are true professionals. It was the first thing which impressed me when I went there,\" Barthez said. \"They just treat you like a grown-up.

      "bodyText": "TWO CRIMES AND PUNISHMENT Are Chesterfield really as bent as the wonky spire on the city's Parish Church? \"No way!\" mewled the liberal, sandal-eating members of the Football League's disciplinary panel. Two weeks ago they found the club guilty of just two of the 90 charges levelled against them and sent them home with a \u00a320,000 fine, a nine-point penalty, and a packet of chocolate digestives. \"Yes way!\" screamed the Football League's board of directors however. Today they threw out the same nine-point deduction recommended by their disciplinary panel - because they considered the punishment softer than an army-sized pack of Andrex. \"As a result of the findings of guilt by the panel, the board considers that the recommendation to deduct nine points does not sufficiently reflect the damage brought to the integrity of the competition,\" thundered Football League chief executive David Burns in his best borstal-boss voice. \"Accordingly we have asked the panel to reconvene to consider the matter afresh.\" That view was endorsed by sports minister Kate Hoey, who demanded the sort of vengeance that usually earns you a place in George W Bush's cabinet. \"The penalty, which would have still allowed the club to benefit from breaking the rules at the expense of the other clubs who have abided by the rules, is just not right,\" she shrieked, before chanting \"burn them, burn them\" over and over again. Not surprisingly, Chesterfield - who are now facing a larger points deduction which could rob them of promotion to the Second Division - have been left bemused by the news. Chief executive John Green admitted to feeling \"extremely disappointed\", while ex-chairman Darren Brown, who resigned after the charges were brought, kept insisting: \"We felt nine points was perhaps too harsh because we had done nothing wrong.\" But the man who summed up the club's torment best was assistant manager Ian Banks. \"We all thought it was done and dusted. We thought that was it - and it just keeps going on,\" he wailed. \"It's another kick in the goolies - and it's not as though we haven't had enough of them this season.\" Indeed, indeed. And unfortunately it's the Spireites long-suffering fans who are feeling the pain more than most. VAN DAMN He may have only just arrived in the country, but already the Fiver doesn't like the look of Ruud van Nistelrooy's face*. There's something about that nose, especially in conjunction with the floppy haircut, that's just too damn Mr Noseybonk**. But if the Imperial Lord Ferg has decided the man is worth \u00a319m of Money Mart's money, then who are we to criticise? Arsenal Wenger on the other hand \"I was surprised at the fee United have paid,\" the Arsene manager told the Evening Standard today. \"But it just shows that the new transfer rules have no influence.\" Which must make anyone who spent \u00a313m on Sylvain Wiltord breathe a sigh of relief. \"Is it too much for a club to pay? It depends on how old the player is and most of it is down to what he does on the pitch.\" Two words: Igor Stepanovs. But then here's another two words: Dwight Yorke. The \u00a312.6m United wastrel is the one widely tipped to make way for van Nistelrooy, but apparently he is no longer a target for Claudio Also-Ranieri's happy Chelsea. It seems United are not too worried about recouping any money just yet, however, as the Newcastle Evening Chronicle suggests they have just had a \u00a315m bid for Kieron Dyer turned down. Like a boomerang made out of gold they'll be back though and, according to sources at St James Park, it could be that \u00a320m is enough to buy United a new right-winger. Transfer gossip, innit brill?! * That's cos he looks like Greg van Rusedski ** Listen, if the BBC can devote entire evenings to childish nostalgia, then we can give it one line. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I have very strong principles about which substances I consume. I have only one body which is the home of my spirit therefore I cherish my body. Because of the importance of this principle it is not always easy for our medical staff to work with me. Sometimes I don't even accept the simplest medical treatment. It is a matter of deep conviction that would lead me to reject a simple glass of wine at dinner or any sort of chocolate bars\" - Edgar Davids, whose positive test for Nandrolone must have been a complete mistake. END OF THE ROAD They're forever building things at Chelsea's of Chelsea. If they're not throwing up a lovely conference hall, they're opening a charming cod-Irish restaurant like Arkles. But is that enough for the swish London boutique? No way! And now that the C's of C Village is officially no longer a money pit, it's time to ask the construction men to get down to some serious work. But what's the first thing they're going to build? Why, it's a great big dual carriageway, of course, which will allow the club's biggest stars to get the hell out of west London as quickly as possible. Vvrrooom! There goes Marcel Desailly, who is well narked off with doing sod all at the Chelse and fancies being put out to pasture at Marseille. \"I had the feeling that I could have been used by [former Marseille manager] Rolland Courbis in 1999,\" he explained as he tested out the tarmac. \"Nothing happened, though. But now, what do they do in Marseille for me? Nothing. But the day they do make some effort, you will hear from me on that subject.\" Which was interesting, as only a few hours later he was turning right while indicating left, and telling his personal website: \"I don't have any doubts about my future, I'm with Chelsea.\" Neeeeooowww! Not far behind M Desailly is Gustavo Poyet. \"I cannot see a bright future for me at Chelsea,\" he bellowed today as he slammed his foot to the floor. \"I want to be given the chance to finish my career at a club where I have a real chance of winning the championship. We have four games left and are playing for a place in [Euro Vase]. That is not good enough for Chelsea and it is not good enough for me.\" So what the Uruguayan will make of Colin Hutchison's attempts to catch him on a trendy C of C's Village scooter is up for debate. \"Gus is an emotional guy and we want him to stay\", panted Hutch. \"Claudio has already made that clear.\" Which must, in some way, be a first. THE RUMOUR MILL AC Milan are preparing a \u00a320m bid for Mark Viduka. \"Everyone at the club knows how much Viduka is wanted,\" said a spokesman. \"There is no desire to sign Beckham or Owen. We want to beat Roma and Internazionale to sign Viduka.\" Arsenal are ready to make a \u00a312m move for Roma's Hideotoshi Nakata. Bayern Munich are prepared to bid around \u00a312m for Hertha Berlin star Sebastian Deisler. NEWS IN BRIEF The pitch at the Millennium Stadium is to be completely relaid ahead of the FA Cup final on May 12. Work is expected to begin on Saturday, with the whole process set to take three or four days. Thierry Henry has said that Arsenal's season will be a failure even if they win the FA Cup final next month. \"Whatever the outcome, we have failed this season\", said Henry on the eve of France's friendly against Portugal. \"When you finish 15 points behind the champions you have to say you didn't live up to expectations. And we can say we have failed this season even if we win the FA Cup.\" Fabien Barthez has claimed the current Manchester United side is the best he has ever played with. \"They are true professionals. It was the first thing which impressed me when I went there,\" Barthez said. \"They just treat you like a grown-up. It's not like in France where coaches and staff always treat you like a kid.\" And Barthez also had kind words for Lord Ferg. \"If you look at what he has achieved has over the last ten years there is not much to criticise. His tactical choices are perfect.\" Yugoslavia captain Sinisa Mihajlovic has called on rival Belgrade fans to put their differences aside for the team's crucial World Cup qualifier against Russia on Wednesday. \"We need their support more than ever. It's a do-or-die match against the toughest opponent in the group,\" Mihajlovic told a news conference on Tuesday. \"It's a disgrace for fans to let club rivalry get the better of their support for the national team,\" he added. Aston Villa midfielder Paul Merson is set to hang up his boots in a maximum of two years. \"I've got two years left at Villa and then probably that will be it,\" he said. Aberdeen manager Ebbe Skovdahl has placed midfielder Andy Dow on the transfer list.

      "bodyText": "Anne Robinson's remarks about the Welsh on the programme Room 101 prompted a vast increase in complaints to the BBC about racism this quarter. The BBC's quarterly complaints bulletin, which details complaints received by the corporation and the responses made, notes that the BBC received 108 complaints about alleged racism, \"almost all of them about Anne Robinson's remarks on the Welsh in Room 101.\" In his report, the director general, Greg Dyke, blames press coverage for distorting the coverage of the incident. \"Together with the large number of calls to the BBC switchboard, a reaction of this scale would normally be a pretty strong indication that the programme had stepped over the line,\" he says. \"But this wasn't a normal case, because of the amount of newspaper coverage it generated.\" He said it was \"difficult to tell how many of the complaints were a spontaneous reaction to the programme, and how many were coloured by the descriptions of it in the press.\" He added that when the programme complaints unit looked at the programme, they noted that they felt the press coverage \"hadn't caught the flavour of it\". Mr Dyke added that in spite of the large number of complaints, the BBC felt that the programme fell \"within the long tradition of banter between the component nations of the UK and didn't cross the line into the kind of hurtful stereotyping or suggestions of inferiority which would have opened it to charges of racism.\" The BBC and the Broadcasting Standards Commission came under a hail of criticism after Ms Robinson appeared on the programme Room 101. On the programme, in which guests are asked to consign certain objects and people to Room 101, Ms Robinson chose the Welsh, on the grounds that they are \"irritating and annoying\". The Broadcasting Standards Commission cleared her of racism, but ruled that her remarks came \"close to the boundary of acceptability\". The BBC is likely to face accusations of a whitewash.

Chairman: Professor Hazel Genn, University College, London Vice Chair: Professor John Eldridge, University of Glasgow Secretary: Mr Chris Caswill, ESRC Aims The ESRC's mission is to fund high quality social science research and training which meets the needs of the users and beneficiaries of research and enhances the UK's competitiveness, quality of life and the effectiveness of its public services and policy. The ESRC's policy for postgraduate training and its portfolio of related activities are designed to help ensure the production of highly skilled social science researchers and professionals for employment in academia, business and the public sector. The budget is targeted to postgraduate training of the highest quality. Background The ESRC is the UK's largest independent funding agency for research and postgraduate training into social and economic issues. It was established by the Royal Charter in 1965. Budget \u00a346m per year is invested by the ESRC in social science research. Top ten beneficiaries Expenditure by Institution 1999-2000 The following shows the major recipients of ESRC funding in 1999-2000: Overall Expenditure on Research and Training 1999-2000 (\u00a3) London School of Economics 4434 Essex 3924 London Institute of Education 3192 Oxford and Colleges 2939 Warwick 2854 Cambridge and Colleges 2731 Manchester 2718 London University College 2492 Bristol 1962 Sussex 1960 For more information click here. Future issues and priorities A new research programme, Science and Society, will get underway this year. The ESRC expect to appoint a Programme Director shortly. The programme aims to develop and refine UK research relevant to the understanding of science, technology and social change, and to enrich the quality of public and policy debate about new scientific and technological developments. The proposed budget is \u00a34.5m over five years. This is expected to buy around 25 projects and fellowships, to be coordinated by a part-time Director.

Collaborative (CASE) Research Studentships Success rate: 540 available. Deadline: Departments must submit nominations by no later than 1 July 2001. Advanced Course Studentships Success rate: 563 available. Deadline: Departments must submit nominations by no later than 1 June 2001. Value of maintenance grants London \u00a38,500 Outside London \u00a36,800 ESRC also pays: \u0095 Disabled students' allowance \u0095 Mature students' incentive Research centres and groups Purpose: to provide long-term research in a particular area of social science. Funding: Centres are normally funded for 10 years (in exceptional cases, this may be extended to 15 years) and research groups for five years. Deadline: New centres and groups are selected through a competition, normally held annually, and are managed by the Research Priorities Board. Research Grants Scheme Purpose: A Research Grant is an award made to an eligible institution to enable an individual or research team to undertake anything from a small project through to a large scale survey. There is also considerable flexibility when it comes to subject area. Funding: Funding decisions are based on four key criteria: scientific quality, timeliness, track record of applicants, and value for money. Applications are considered for awards from \u00a32,000 to \u00a3750,000 in total, with up to a maximum of \u00a3300,000 in annual expenditure. Research grants can be awarded for a period of up to five years and can be for basic, applied or strategic research. Deadline: Applications invited under all areas of the ESRC remit. Applications can be submitted at any time. ESRC/Ministry of Defence (MOD) Joint Scheme Purpose: To stimulate collaboration between research establishments and academic institutes. Funding: 50% of your funding from the MOD. Research Fellowship Scheme Purpose: The Fellowships will be available for research in the full range of social and economic sciences, and will be considered by the Research Grants Board alongside Research Grants. Funding: There is no ringfenced sum for fellowships, therefore it is difficult to give guidance on the likely number of awards. Fellowships will be in competition with applications made under the existing Research Grants scheme. Success rate: In the first year of the scheme's operation, 11 fellowships were funded and there is the possibility of these numbers increasing this year. Deadline: Available to social scientists at all stages of a post-doctoral level career. Applications can be submitted at any time. LINK Eating, Food and Health Purpose: To provide the basis for a better understanding of factors leading to a healthier UK diet. The programme extends over a five year period from 1 June 1998 at a cost of approximately \u00a35m, with \u00a32.5m public sector sponsorship matched by an equal industrial investment. Deadline: Open to applications until May 2003. Outline applications will be received on an open date basis for consideration. The Programme Manager, Dr Richard Shepherd, is available from 1 June 1998 to discuss potential applications.

In a nod to the perpetual state of anger exhibited by WWF contestants and commentators, the teams were given names like Rage, while the players assumed names like Death Blow. Sixteen million people watched the first game on February 3. But somewhere in the awkward crack between football and hype, things began to go wrong. The teams were hurriedly brought together and had very little training, so the quality of play was shoddy. Second, commentators had been brought in from the NFL, but were made to \"get with the programme\" and salivate over the dancing women. One seasoned professional, Matt Vasgersian, could not bring himself to do it. According to the Wall Street Journal, he was supposed to produce some sort of exclamation when the \"cleavage cam\" zoomed in on the dancing women. He was even given handy suggestions like: \"Now that's a cheerleader.\" But Vasgersian could not bring himself to do it and lapsed into silence, with his producer yelling into his earpiece, ordering him to say something. In the end, the commentator laughed nervously and came out with: \"I feel uncomfortable ... Man alive ... All righty then ... Those suits are something else.\" He was demoted the following week, to be replaced by a WWF commentator alongside the tough-talking, ex-wrestling Minnesota governor, Jesse Ventura. More recently, fans have been offered fly-on-the-wall views from inside the cheerleaders' changing rooms. But it turned out that a lack of enthusiasm was not the problem. People had tuned in at first in the hope of watching some exciting football, but all they saw was mediocre sport against a background of overblown hype. And that, thankfully for the future of sports - and possibly of civilisation too - that was not enough.

      "bodyText": "A new magazine launched for young artists and creative people hopes to create a forum for young artistic talent. Mosquito, launched by three graduates from Nottingham with Prince's Trust funding, has attracted over 500 contributions from artists and creative writers through a flyer campaign targeting cities including London, Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham. The magazine's co-founder, Guy Cookson, said the magazine wanted to be more \"inclusive and accessible\" than traditional art magazines, and would feature \"everything from graffiti to fine art\". He said the magazine's primary focus was to allow young, creative people to get their ideas seen and recognised, and the magazine was soliciting contributions from across the world. \"There are so many people out there who want to get their creative ideas across\" he said. The magazine will launch with an initial print run of 15,000, priced \u00a32.75 and will be stocked in Waterstones, Blackwells, independent newsagents, book and record shops.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has today unveiled plans to force young offenders to clean up graffiti and repair damage under a \"community payback\" scheme. The move is meant to make youths aware of the effects of anti-social behaviour on their neighbourhoods, as well as giving communities a sense that justice has been done. The scheme builds on reparation orders, introduced in England and Wales last June, under which young offenders undertake work to repair the damage to their victims and the local community. The government is keen that the courts and multi-agency youth offending teams, which work with young offenders and will run the scheme, make greater use of the orders, especially the community payback element. \"Young offenders take something out of society through their offending. This scheme will allow them to put something back,\" Mr Blair said. The prime minister set out his approach to youth offending, which also includes incentives to encourage good behaviour, in a speech to community leaders in Croydon, south London. Youths on high crime estates who stay out of trouble and are prepared to help their community could be rewarded with clothes and music vouchers. Mr Blair said he wanted to build on 70 youth inclusion programmes already run by the youth justice board, which provide supervised leisure activities and personal development programmes for young people most at risk of offending. A privately sponsored pilot scheme is being set up by the board in London, offering rewards to youngsters - such as vouchers for clothes, music, travel or computer equipment - if they take part in community renewal work. The youth justice board is to issue guidance \"strengthening and broadening\" the orders, according to a spokesman. The new community payback scheme should ensure that, even where a victim does not ask for direct reparation, offenders can be ordered to work for the community removing graffiti, repairing vandalism and clearing up litter. Crime reduction charity Nacro welcomed the prime minister's commitment to the principle of reparation. \"The traditional notion that young offenders can be 'punished out of crime' by a stretch in prison has always been a dubious one,\" said a spokesman. \"If prison worked for young offenders, why do more than three-quarters of them commit more offences on release? \"Our own experience running such schemes shows that giving a young offender the chance to pay back for their offences brings home to them in a much more immediate way the impact of their actions than a spell in prison ever will.\" And local communities would probably appreciate seeing young offenders trying to make up for their crimes in beneficial ways, he said. A spokeswoman for the NSPCC children's charity said it was favour of using community interventions for dealing with minor offences such as graffiti and vandalism. \"We also support the principles of restorative justice which involve healing for both victim and offender to help make good the harm that's been done,\" she said.",

The prime minister said he wanted to introduce new incentives to encourage responsible behaviour among young people with rewards such as music vouchers. At the same time, he said that those youngsters who do get into trouble will be forced to clean up their graffiti and repair damage caused by vandalism as part of a new \"community payback\" scheme. Mr Blair set out his carrot-and-stick approach to youth offending in a speech to community leaders in Croydon, south London, in which he stressed his determination to improve the \"liveability\" of Britain's cities towns and villages. His package of reforms also includes plans to give private sector firms a bigger role in regenerating their local area, through so-called \"business improvement districts\" (Bids). The plans, revealed exclusively by SocietyGuardian.co.uk yesterday, will see businesses voting on whether or not to pay for a package of improvements to their local area, such as more graffiti cleaning or extra police officers. If they vote in favour, businesses will then work in partnership with local authorities to deliver the changes, paying through a supplementary business rate levied by councils. Many of the details of the Bid schemes will be left to local politicians and businesses, including the level of the extra rate to be raised, and which businesses in what areas will pay. Local government leaders, however, appeared unimpressed by Mr Blair's plans for Bids, arguing that a much more extensive reform of local government financing was needed. Sir Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: \"We are calling on the government to deliver a finance system to local authorities that is fair, accountable and makes a real connection between cash raised - and spent - locally.\" As part of the government's drive to clean up streets and parks which had become \"dirty ugly and dangerous\", the prime minister announced a doubling of \"spot fines\" for dog fouling and dropping litter. Councils will also be able to earmark the revenues from specific fines and penalties, for example litter, dog fouling and parking fines, for additional spending on local environmental and quality of life improvements. The prime minister also promised \u00a350m for a street warden programme to crack down on neighbourhood nuisances such as litter and graffiti. And there was \u00a330m over three years to fund new \"home zones\", which aim to ensure that the needs of families in residential areas are taken into account as much as those of motorists. \"Britain needs to feel proud of its public spaces, not ashamed,\" said Mr Blair. \"We need to make it safer for children to walk or cycle to school in safety.

      "bodyText": "Pret a Manger is looking for its first dedicated marketing chief, four months after selling a 33% stake to McDonald's. Marketing is handled by Morag McKay, the company's executive director, but her role has been widened to allow her to focus on international expansion. The head of UK marketing will be charged with building awareness of the Pret a Manger brand beyond London as the chain opens 20 more outlets outside the capital. It already has 30 branches outside London. Although the McDonald's deal netted the chain \u00a326m, a Pret a Manger source said the company had always intended to hire a dedicated marketing chief. Ms McKay is expected to continue handling marketing until the new marketing head comes on board.",

      "bodyText": "Struggling high-speed internet access provider Excite@Home has ended its seven-month search for a leader by hiring telecoms industry veteran Patti Hart as CEO. The announcement coincides with the release of disappointing quarterly results and the news that Excite@Home may sell its media operations and trigger a further round of redundancies. In January the company laid off 250 workers - about 8% of its staff. Although the results were in line with analysts' expectations, the company said its media assets were a huge drain. They cancel out much of the strong growth achieved by the high-speed internet access business. Excite@Home needs \u00a357m to survive this year. This money could be raised by either selling off the portal or parts of its network to the majority shareholder, AT&amp;T. Excite@Home posted losses of \u00a3594m in the first quarter and has lowered its outlook for the second quarter. Its revenue rose 3% year on year to $142.8m. The company's new boss, Ms Hart, 44, was most recently the head of Telocity, a digital telecoms company owned by Hughes Electronics. She recently appeared in Fortune's list of the 50 most powerful women who influence corporate America. Ms Hart replaces George Bell, who resigned as CEO in September and yesterday stepped down as chairman and board member. Mr Bell's decision to leave Excite - after promising he would stay on as chairman - mirrors that of Yahoo!'s Tim Koogle, who last week announced he was leaving the company. Excite@Home was created in 1999 from the merger of internet portal Excite and broadband cable provider @Home. The company was touted initially as a potential threat to AOL and it planned an ambitious expansion into Europe. While the broadband business has been successful - it has signed up 3.2m subscribers - the internet portal has suffered at the hands of the diminishing internet advertising market. In the UK, Excite.co.uk competes with Lycos.co.uk and Yahoo.co.uk but does not appear in any lists of top 10 website. The portal's last reported traffic figures in November were 76m.",

They were made redundant earlier this year by the club superbrand, after its plans to expand its media empire were shelved. Mr Dash confirmed he was in discussions about a new company, but would not be drawn on what form it would take or what type of magazines it would launch. He was recruited by Ministry last year in a bid to spearhead its expansion into other platforms, including a book publishing arm and an Australian-based men's magazine. Ms Jerome, the colourful former editor of John Brown Publishing's lads' magazine, Bizarre, was also recruited to spearhead new magazine launches but was made redundant when Ministry was forced to retrench. Ministry of Sound, set up by James Palumbo in the early 1990s, has become one of the most successful dance music brands. In the mid-1990s it launched Ministry magazine, which has grown to rival Mixmag and Muzik. But the publishing arm has been hit by problems this year amid reports that it has overspent on its internet division. The magazine has made several redundancies over the past weeks.",

      "bodyText": "More than 100 stories have appeared in the national press in the past month alone on the subject of the forthcoming May Day protest - yet virtually every single one breaks the cardinal rule of journalism: to get both sides of the story. Today's briefing from the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and the chief commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir John Stevens, pledging zero tolerance to those intent on committing criminal damage, is the latest in a long line of police briefings which many journalists have reported without seeming to make an effort to contact those behind the protests to get a balanced view. As a recent letter to the Guardian claimed, these special branch briefings serve two purposes: to discredit the anti-capitalist movement, and to acclimatise public opinion for a violent police crackdown. Paradoxically, it is the demonstrators' ability to outwit both police and journalists through disinformation on the internet and emailing campaigns that is the ace up their sleeve, but also creates a void into which any amount of speculative reporting can be filed. The London Evening Standard has led the charge with headlines such as: \u0095 May Day Rioters Train at US Camps \u0095 Anarchists Plot to Halt London on May Day \u0095 May Day \"Zero Tolerance\" \u0095 Capital Chaos Looms In May: Police step up security over riot and terrorist fears \u0095 Anarchists to Loot Oxford Street Stores on May Day \u0095 Wanted: the 24 May Day Anarchists Scotland Yard is Hunting. In fact, the only concrete details about the plans for May 1 are two mass bicycle rides leaving from Marylebone and Liverpool Street stations at 7.30am, to disrupt motor vehicles driving through the capital in rush hour, and a mass convergence of demonstrators at Oxford Circus at 4pm. Indeed, the critical mass bike ride is only an offshoot of the monthly event, where cyclists ride around the capitals of all major European and many US cities to highlight the dominance of the motor car. These events are advertised on the web, but the gap in the schedule has allowed journalists the freedom to speculate that the advertised May Day Monopoly \"Sale of the Century\" will encompass separate attacks on the Square Mile, vandalisation of chainstores such as McDonald's, Starbucks, Gap and Niketown, destruction of the Royal Opera House and even the occupation of a major London landmark. The Observer has also reported that armed guards will be on patrol to disarm demonstrators carrying samurai swords, and the Independent reported that armed police raided a derelict factory in Herne Hill, south London, thought to be occupied by \"the Wombles\" - that is, the White Overall Movement Building Liberation Through Effective Struggle. The factory was empty. Those with slightly longer memories would do well to look at the press coverage through March and April of last year, where scores of stories detailed how \"guerrilla gardeners\" would bring pitchforks and spades into central London, under the guise of digging up Parliament Square, in order to attack police. In fact, the planting of sods of grass on the tarmac around Whitehall was the most peaceful aspect of last year's demonstration and no gardening implements were used against riot police. But why left the facts get in the way of a good story? There is no denying last year's protests were marred by violence, but graffiti on statues and the smashing of McDonald's' windows were, as even the usually conservative Financial Times reported at the time, little more than the usual Friday night events of many provincial English towns.

The campaign, created by Labour's advertising agency TBWA/London, launched this week on poster sites around the country that Labour has been unable to offload. The three main political parties began their campaigns back in January, expecting a May election. Had that gone ahead as planned, this week would have been crucial in the pre-election advertising battle. They now face the challenge of keeping the momentum going without overloading voters with too many different messages. \"Labour has delivered a lot to the British people, but we know there is still much to do, so the work goes on,\" says the Labour party's website.

Although Mr Bush has yet to make a formal announcement, US officials briefing in Washington say the sale is to include four Kidd-class destroyers, a dozen anti-submarine planes and as many as eight diesel-powered submarines.</p> <p>The package could amount to $4bn, the largest chunk of change since Taiwan bought 150 F-16 fighters from the US in 1982.</p> <p>China will feel particularly aggrieved by the sale of so many submarines, as they could take a serious toll of any armada crossing the Taiwan strait should open conflict ever break out.</p> <p>In its initial reaction, China has expressed its \"serious concern\" about the sale, but it got its way on the hardware that really raised hackles. President Bush has decided against the sale of destroyers equipped with ultra-sophisticated Aegis radar system that is supposed to be able to track 100 aircraft and missiles at a time.</p> <p>China objects to any military equipment that goes to Taiwan, but would have been apopletic about the Aegis as it would mark another step towards a regional missile defence system, something it vehemently opposes.</p> <p>The Aegis system featured on Taiwan's wish list, although some Taiwanese defence officials considered overly sophisticated and pricey. China said the Aegis sale would have been provocative yet it is Chinese behaviour that stokes Taiwanese anxieties.</p> <p>China brands Taiwan a renegade province, conducts intimidatory military manoeuvres and builds missiles at the rate of 50 a year, in addition to the 300 it already has. The number may seem puny compared to American numbers, but they look daunting enough to Taiwan, although it has to be said that relations between the two have not all been tough talk.</p> <p>In January, the two countries authorised boats to travel between the mainland and Taiwan's two islands, Quemoy and Matsu, in a little-noticed sign of rapprochement between Beijing and Taipei.</p> <p>Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the US agreed to provide Taiwan with \"such defence articles and defence services\u0085 as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defence capability\".</p> <p>But that runs smack into a 1982 US-China agreement calling on Washington to gradually reduce the quality and quantity of arms sold to the island. With such contradictory pieces of legislation, the White House has plenty of legal leeway, less so diplomatically.</p> <p>The US may feel closer ideologically to the democrats in Taiwan than the autocrats in Beijing, but huge commercial interests invariably trump political empathy.</p> <p>As long as China's vast market beckons, the US will refrain from actions that antagonise Beijing too much.

      "bodyText": "China will grumble and may even recall its ambassador for consultations when the Bush administration today announces the biggest arms sales to Taiwan in almost a decade. Not since the previous Bush administration has the US sold so much weaponry to Taiwan. Although Mr Bush has yet to make a formal announcement, US officials briefing in Washington say the sale is to include four Kidd-class destroyers, a dozen anti-submarine planes and as many as eight diesel-powered submarines. The package could amount to $4bn, the largest chunk of change since Taiwan bought 150 F-16 fighters from the US in 1982. China will feel particularly aggrieved by the sale of so many submarines, as they could take a serious toll of any armada crossing the Taiwan strait should open conflict ever break out. In its initial reaction, China has expressed its \"serious concern\" about the sale, but it got its way on the hardware that really raised hackles. President Bush has decided against the sale of destroyers equipped with ultra-sophisticated Aegis radar system that is supposed to be able to track 100 aircraft and missiles at a time. China objects to any military equipment that goes to Taiwan, but would have been apopletic about the Aegis as it would mark another step towards a regional missile defence system, something it vehemently opposes. The Aegis system featured on Taiwan's wish list, although some Taiwanese defence officials considered overly sophisticated and pricey. China said the Aegis sale would have been provocative yet it is Chinese behaviour that stokes Taiwanese anxieties. China brands Taiwan a renegade province, conducts intimidatory military manoeuvres and builds missiles at the rate of 50 a year, in addition to the 300 it already has. The number may seem puny compared to American numbers, but they look daunting enough to Taiwan, although it has to be said that relations between the two have not all been tough talk. In January, the two countries authorised boats to travel between the mainland and Taiwan's two islands, Quemoy and Matsu, in a little-noticed sign of rapprochement between Beijing and Taipei. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the US agreed to provide Taiwan with \"such defence articles and defence services\u0085 as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defence capability\". But that runs smack into a 1982 US-China agreement calling on Washington to gradually reduce the quality and quantity of arms sold to the island. With such contradictory pieces of legislation, the White House has plenty of legal leeway, less so diplomatically. The US may feel closer ideologically to the democrats in Taiwan than the autocrats in Beijing, but huge commercial interests invariably trump political empathy. As long as China's vast market beckons, the US will refrain from actions that antagonise Beijing too much. The sale of Aegis-equipped warships would have been a defence system too far, especially coming so soon after the row over the collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter. Taiwan's reaction to the proposed sale indicates that it too recognises the political limits of the latest transaction. The defence ministry said any arms sales from Washington were welcome as they helped preserve stability in Asia. While it will not get everything it asked for, Taiwan considers the scale of this package as signalling a new level of support from the US. Under the circumstances, the deal should suit all three parties.

If anything, Mr Brown\u00d5s comments yesterday might have been seen as giving a nudge to the European Central Bank which has, so far, resisted calls for lower eurozone interest rates as part of the battle against global slowdown. The chancellor\u00d5s comments, taken together, would suggest a man who is cautioning that life is likely to get a little tougher - as workers at a number of mobile phone plants round Britain are beginning to find out. But he is also making it clear that any difficulties are down to external factors (ie don\u00d5t blame me) and that his longstanding policies of prudence and stability mean the UK is well placed to cope. Mr Brown may also be gently jogging the prime ministerial elbow; a reminder to Mr Blair that, from an economic perspective, it would be better to have the general election sooner rather than later. Labour\u00d5s economic record will be a central plank of the party\u00d5s campaign as it seeks a second term. Mr Brown \u00d0 and Mr Blair for that matter \u00d0 will not be keen to risk any shadows being cast on their claims for economic competence. The outlook may not get much worse over the coming months but it will not get better. The only danger is in delay.

During the general election campaign, Channel 5 will integrate 5 News with the Wright Stuff, presented by Matthew Wright. Channel 5 has joined other broadcasters today in setting out its programming vision and plans for the first time. The system replaces the Independent Television Commission's annual performance reviews. Under these, the regulator measured broadcasters' performance and adherence to the programming codes.

But he was rejected overwhelmingly in the local primaries, where party members were sensitive to his reputation for mismanaging the economy during his term in office.</p> <p>Initial reaction on the stock market was optimistic. The market was sharply lower early in the day, shedding 200 points, but rallied strongly after the election to finish 27 points - or 0.2% - up.</p> <p>But Mr Koizumi, certain to be formally named prime minister later this week by the LDP-dominated parliament, takes office as Japan is wallowing in a decade-long economic slowdown.</p> <p>Unemployment is high, a hoped-for recovery has fizzled and the financial system is riddled with bad debts.</p> <p>Japan's political system is also in trouble. Mr Koizumi will take over from prime minister Yoshiro Mori, whose dismal year in office has been defined by a string of scandals, political gaffes and support ratings in the single digits.</p> <p>Mr Koizumi, a former health minister known for his shaggy hairstyle, his passion for karaoke love songs and fiery rhetoric, is pushing economic and structural reforms, including the privatisation of Japan's massive postal system, which offers saving accounts and even insurance policies to clients.</p> <p>However, many analysts believe he will have a hard time carrying out the promises of reform that were the focus of his campaign, as his desire for change has little support among the party leadership</p> <p>\"The chances are not low that if he makes compromises with the various party powerbrokers, then there will be little change,\" Takashi Inoguchi, a politics expert at Tokyo University, said. \"But if his performance in parliament is good, then he can achieve a good deal, because he has ideas.\"</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/japan/story/0,7369,476778,00.html\">23.04.2001: Tokyo's karaoke man wins party vote</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,461179,00.html\">22.04.2001, analysis: Bitter pill for ailing Japan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,441471,00.html\">22.02.2001, comment: Another year, another premier</a><br></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/japan/\">Japan</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20010424wo03.htm\" target=\"_new\">Poll: Koizumi said most fit for top job - Daily Yomiuri</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jimin.or.jp/jimin/english/e-index.html\" target=\"_new\">Liberal Democratic party of Japan</a><br></p>",

Mr Koizumi's victory over Ryutaro Hashimoto followed an overwhelming show of support by rank-and-file members of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) in the primaries. The election upset reflected growing public disgust with the political establishment and the sour economy, and the LDP's desperate attempt to revamp its stick-in-the-mud image ahead of upper house parliamentary elections this summer. \"This election was held against an unprecedented headwind,\" Mr Koizumi said in accepting the post. \"I promised to change the party and to change Japan, and fortunately, many party members supported my call.\" The vote comes as a blow for Mr Hashimoto - premier from 1996 to 1998 - who had been expected to win based on his power bloc in the party. But he was rejected overwhelmingly in the local primaries, where party members were sensitive to his reputation for mismanaging the economy during his term in office. Initial reaction on the stock market was optimistic. The market was sharply lower early in the day, shedding 200 points, but rallied strongly after the election to finish 27 points - or 0.2% - up. But Mr Koizumi, certain to be formally named prime minister later this week by the LDP-dominated parliament, takes office as Japan is wallowing in a decade-long economic slowdown. Unemployment is high, a hoped-for recovery has fizzled and the financial system is riddled with bad debts. Japan's political system is also in trouble. Mr Koizumi will take over from prime minister Yoshiro Mori, whose dismal year in office has been defined by a string of scandals, political gaffes and support ratings in the single digits. Mr Koizumi, a former health minister known for his shaggy hairstyle, his passion for karaoke love songs and fiery rhetoric, is pushing economic and structural reforms, including the privatisation of Japan's massive postal system, which offers saving accounts and even insurance policies to clients. However, many analysts believe he will have a hard time carrying out the promises of reform that were the focus of his campaign, as his desire for change has little support among the party leadership \"The chances are not low that if he makes compromises with the various party powerbrokers, then there will be little change,\" Takashi Inoguchi, a politics expert at Tokyo University, said. \"But if his performance in parliament is good, then he can achieve a good deal, because he has ideas.\" Related articles 23.04.2001: Tokyo's karaoke man wins party vote 22.04.2001, analysis: Bitter pill for ailing Japan 22.02.2001, comment: Another year, another premier Related special reports Japan Useful links Poll: Koizumi said most fit for top job - Daily Yomiuri Liberal Democratic party of Japan",

      "bodyText": "ITV has ordered a sitcom pilot about a West Indian family, a drama about a \"significant miscarriage of justice\" and a documentary about child poverty as part of its commitment to original UK programming over the next 18 months. In its first statement of programme policy, ITV is aiming to fill at least 85% of its peaktime (6pm-10.30pm) 2001 schedule with original UK output. The leading commercial channel is also expecting to exceed its current 65% minimum level of original production across all hours this year and to maintain similar levels of original output next year. And at least half of ITV's network commissions are expected to come from outside London. The statement, published as part of the move towards \"lighter touch\" broadcasting regulation, describes home-grown production as \"a central plank of ITV's public service offer\". \"ITV will maintain its current high proportion of original productions for as long as revenue supports the very high level of investment required,\" the document states. Unveiling ITV's first programming statement, David Liddiment, the director of programmes, said: \"As niche and pay TV channels proliferate, I believe ITV's public service role as a mass audience, free-to-air channel will become more rather than less important.\" More than a third of ITV's \u00a3750m 2001 programming budget will be invested in new drama. \"There will be a degree of innovation in form and content, with at least one project in 2001 and 2002 that breaks the mould in mass-appeal drama in some way,\" ITV promises. Two \"risk taking\" pieces are a project written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason as the Dickens character Mr Micawber, and Bob and Rose, a project by Russell T Davies about a gay man's love affair with a woman. Big new \"event\" drama scheduled for the next two years includes an adaptation of the Kingsley Amis novel, Lucky Jim; Beating Jesus, written by Gimme Gimme Gimme creator Jonathan Harvey and starring Sarah Lancashire; and Anybody's Nightmare, a dramatisation of a \"significant miscarriage of justice\" starring Patricia Routledge. In comedy, a pilot has been commissioned from writer Paul McKenzie featuring a West Indian family. ITV has pledged to run an average of 90 minutes of documentary programming each week over the next year. The main single documentary slot will appear after ITV News at Ten at 10.20pm. New factual programmes will include Poor Kerry, a documentary about child poverty; three shows about Hitler's closest working and personal relationships and the British Empire in Colour.

      "body": "<p>Vladimir Gusinsky is eagerly clutching one of his three mobile phones, hanging on to every word spoken by his Spanish lawyer.</p> <p>\"You have the decision in your hand? I can go? Can I get on the plane now? Make sure, please.\"</p> <p>A Spanish sun sparkles on the swimming-pool beyond the plate glass windows of his luxurious villa, El Crucero, in the exclusive Sotogrande resort. Water gurgles from a marble dolphin. Servants and bodyguards slide discreetly through the shadows.</p> <p>But Vladimir Gusinsky, the once-mighty Russian media magnate brought low by President Putin's government, is blind to the luxuries surrounding him. He is savouring freedom. The call means that, for the first time in four months, he can go where he wants.</p> <p>The Spanish judges who refused to extradite him to Russia on fraud charges confirmed yesterday that the three-day appeal period had expired. No longer must he make the humiliating daily trip to report to the local Civil Guard police post. He is finally allowed out of Cadiz province.</p> <p>But it is a hollow victory. The great oligarch, the most powerful man in the Russian media, has lost virtually everything he owned in Moscow.</p> <p>Over the past 10 days control of his Media Most empire has been wrested away. Now he watches helplessly as his television channel, newspaper and magazine - the most professional news outlets in Russia - are dismantled by the state-controlled Gazprom company.</p> <p>Russia's only independent national news organisation is dead. The news reports that told Russians difficult, sometimes horrible, truths about the Chechen wars, the Kursk submarine disaster, or those dying of cold in the eastern provinces, will simply dry up.</p> <p>Mr Gusinsky, 48, a fast-talking former theatre manager, is a betrayed man who now realises he is reaping the bitter rewards for past behaviour.</p> <p>He is convinced that Russia has spawned a new monster, and a threat to global stability, in President Putin. That monster, he says, will pursue him wherever he goes. \"I am absolutely sure Mr Putin and his government will use anything they can to destroy me and my partners,\" he says.</p> <p>The time he has spent trapped inside this gilded cage, and in the harsher surroundings of the Soto del Real jail, has allowed him to work out where it all went wrong.</p> <p>\"I made one big mistake ... when we started to support Yeltsin against the communists in 1996,\" he admits. \"The liberal media worked for several months like the propaganda machine against communism. I am responsible. Now I am paying for it.\"</p> <p>Mr Gusinsky rescued Mr Yeltsin in 1996, swinging the weight of Media Most and its NTV station behind him. His executives took over the ailing Yeltsin campaign and led him to victory.</p> <p>It was a key moment in recent Russian history - when the oligarchs became the new kingmakers in Moscow. It was an operation repeated four years later when his fellow oligarch and sometime enemy Boris Berezovsky pushed Vladimir Putin into power.</p> <p>Now the dog has turned. President Putin does not want millionaire businessmen publicly attacking his stories. Mr Berezovsky is already in self-imposed exile. Mr Gusinsky realises that he has played, even helped invent, the bizarre game of Russian democracy -and now he has lost.</p> <p>Gazprom used its loans to Mr Gusinsky - given partly in recognition of his role in electing Mr Yeltsin - as the weapon. Mr Gusinsky says he could have paid off the $250m (\u00a3180m), but Gazprom would not let him. In any case, Mr Gusinsky's business has run up $800m in losses and Gazprom wanted his companies rather than his money. Last week it got them.</p> <p>These are dangerous days in Moscow, Mr Gusinsky says. Mr Putin may be popular, but he is using that popularity to build a new totalitarian state. \"Any totalitarian regime must produce fear in the country. He must demonstrate to any potential opponent what will happen to him. Business cannot fight him.\"</p> <p>Western countries, meanwhile, look on nervously. Some, Germany and the US fof example, are happy to criticise the attack on Media Most and join the clamour for a free press as an essential ingredient in Russia's new democracy. Others, including Britain and France, are not.</p> <p>Mr Gusinsky says we will all pay the price if western leaders appease President Putin. He likens the situation apocalyptically to the 1930s and the world's treatment of Hitler. Mr Putin's hands, he says, are already red with the blood of murdered Chechens.</p> <p>\"If a Russian president uses his power to destroy human rights and social balance in order to make that power absolute, then that is very serious,\" he says.</p> <p>The west must decide whether to sit by and make friends with Mr Putin or stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.</p> <p>\"Any European leader, including Mr Blair, has a difficult choice,\" he admits.</p> <p>\"I am a Jew. We know what genocide is. That is why I care about Chechnya,\" explains Mr Gusinsky, who also has Israeli nationality and founded the Russian Jewish Congress.</p> <p>In the medium term his future lies in Israel. He already owns one newspaper there and he claims to have made \"several million dollars\" in Israel last year.He said the loss of Media Most by no means meant he was bankrupt.</p> <p>He now urgently needs to unload what is left of his holding in Media Most. CNN's founder, Ted Turner, an earlier mooted buyer, appears to have dropped out.</p> <p>Mr Putin's popularity comes in part from his promise to do away with the oligarchs, a group of 20-odd billionaire businessmen who got rich stripping assets from privatised companies they bought for nothing.</p> <p>But why target Mr Gusinsky? If the oligarchs were bad, and he denies having been one, he was the best of the bunch. He started Media Most from scratch eight years ago, investing and building a com pany in what, to western eyes, was a recognisable way. He took loans and planned to make a profit in the future.</p> <p>In 1998, before Russia's economic crisis spoiled his plans, Media Most was about to float on the Nasdaq for $1.2bn. His media outlets were the most independent and professional in Russia.</p> <p>Mr Gusinsky says his problems come precisely from that. He invested in media, not steel, oil or coal. Other oligarchs are doing very nicely under president Mr Putin. \"Most are being left alone.\"</p> <p>It took remarkably little time to engineer Mr Gusinsky's downfall. The pressure had been building up since armed police raided Media Most offices a year ago. In the end it took Gazprom three days to apply the coup de grace.</p> <p>First it ousted NTV's journalists, who fled en masse to the TV6 channel owned by Mr Berezovsky. Then the daily paper Sevodnya was closed down and the director of the weekly magazine Itogi sacked.</p> <p>Now, Mr Gusinsky alleges, it is the turn of the popular Ekho Moskvy radio station. The days of it's editor, Alexei Venediktovo, are numbered.</p> <p>So what now for Mr Gusinsky? He is certainly not going to Russia. \"That would be a one-way ticket,\" he jokes.</p> <p>The next stage of this saga may well be played out in London. One of his many homes is there. He wants to leave soon.</p> <p>Russian prosecutors say the Interpol arrest warrant is still valid outside Spain. What if the Metropolitan Police were obliged to arrest him?</p> <p>\"I am not afraid,\" he says. But he admits he has lawyers in Britain and the US working out whether he might be jailed, or even extradited. \"We have asked the British authorities for their views.\"</p> <p>He does not want to go back to jail. Last year he spent three nights in Moscow's notorious Butyrka prison. He thought that by coming to Spain he would avoid repeating that experience. Then judges sent him to Soto del Real prison to await the extradition decision.</p> <p>\"Prison is prison. Everybody, rich or poor, is shocked when they get there. But it is worse when you do not understand why you are there. In Russia I was there because I was a government opponent. But in Spain I did not understand why.\"</p> <p>Exile has allowed him to rediscover friendship with Mr Berezovsky, who has since fallen out with Mr Putin \"We have difficult relationship. We are friends, enemies, friends, enemies,\" he admits.</p> <p>In the long-term he would like to found a new Russian media empire. Yesterday he was enjoying the prospect of boarding his Gulfstream jet and flying to Madrid. Afterwards he will go on holiday to Israel.</p> <p>As a last thought I ask him whether he fears for his life. He gives me a quizzical look, one eyebrow lifted over his rimless glasses. \"Can I not answer that question?\"</p> <p><b>How the kingmaker fell from grace</b></p> <p><b> Empire at its peak</b></p> <p>\u0095 Most Bank, a commercial bank set up in 1989.

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Gusinsky is eagerly clutching one of his three mobile phones, hanging on to every word spoken by his Spanish lawyer. \"You have the decision in your hand? I can go? Can I get on the plane now? Make sure, please.\" A Spanish sun sparkles on the swimming-pool beyond the plate glass windows of his luxurious villa, El Crucero, in the exclusive Sotogrande resort. Water gurgles from a marble dolphin. Servants and bodyguards slide discreetly through the shadows. But Vladimir Gusinsky, the once-mighty Russian media magnate brought low by President Putin's government, is blind to the luxuries surrounding him. He is savouring freedom. The call means that, for the first time in four months, he can go where he wants. The Spanish judges who refused to extradite him to Russia on fraud charges confirmed yesterday that the three-day appeal period had expired. No longer must he make the humiliating daily trip to report to the local Civil Guard police post. He is finally allowed out of Cadiz province. But it is a hollow victory. The great oligarch, the most powerful man in the Russian media, has lost virtually everything he owned in Moscow. Over the past 10 days control of his Media Most empire has been wrested away. Now he watches helplessly as his television channel, newspaper and magazine - the most professional news outlets in Russia - are dismantled by the state-controlled Gazprom company. Russia's only independent national news organisation is dead. The news reports that told Russians difficult, sometimes horrible, truths about the Chechen wars, the Kursk submarine disaster, or those dying of cold in the eastern provinces, will simply dry up. Mr Gusinsky, 48, a fast-talking former theatre manager, is a betrayed man who now realises he is reaping the bitter rewards for past behaviour. He is convinced that Russia has spawned a new monster, and a threat to global stability, in President Putin. That monster, he says, will pursue him wherever he goes. \"I am absolutely sure Mr Putin and his government will use anything they can to destroy me and my partners,\" he says. The time he has spent trapped inside this gilded cage, and in the harsher surroundings of the Soto del Real jail, has allowed him to work out where it all went wrong. \"I made one big mistake ... when we started to support Yeltsin against the communists in 1996,\" he admits. \"The liberal media worked for several months like the propaganda machine against communism. I am responsible. Now I am paying for it.\" Mr Gusinsky rescued Mr Yeltsin in 1996, swinging the weight of Media Most and its NTV station behind him. His executives took over the ailing Yeltsin campaign and led him to victory. It was a key moment in recent Russian history - when the oligarchs became the new kingmakers in Moscow. It was an operation repeated four years later when his fellow oligarch and sometime enemy Boris Berezovsky pushed Vladimir Putin into power. Now the dog has turned. President Putin does not want millionaire businessmen publicly attacking his stories. Mr Berezovsky is already in self-imposed exile. Mr Gusinsky realises that he has played, even helped invent, the bizarre game of Russian democracy -and now he has lost. Gazprom used its loans to Mr Gusinsky - given partly in recognition of his role in electing Mr Yeltsin - as the weapon. Mr Gusinsky says he could have paid off the $250m (\u00a3180m), but Gazprom would not let him. In any case, Mr Gusinsky's business has run up $800m in losses and Gazprom wanted his companies rather than his money. Last week it got them. These are dangerous days in Moscow, Mr Gusinsky says. Mr Putin may be popular, but he is using that popularity to build a new totalitarian state. \"Any totalitarian regime must produce fear in the country. He must demonstrate to any potential opponent what will happen to him. Business cannot fight him.\" Western countries, meanwhile, look on nervously. Some, Germany and the US fof example, are happy to criticise the attack on Media Most and join the clamour for a free press as an essential ingredient in Russia's new democracy. Others, including Britain and France, are not. Mr Gusinsky says we will all pay the price if western leaders appease President Putin. He likens the situation apocalyptically to the 1930s and the world's treatment of Hitler. Mr Putin's hands, he says, are already red with the blood of murdered Chechens. \"If a Russian president uses his power to destroy human rights and social balance in order to make that power absolute, then that is very serious,\" he says. The west must decide whether to sit by and make friends with Mr Putin or stand up for human rights and freedom of expression. \"Any European leader, including Mr Blair, has a difficult choice,\" he admits. \"I am a Jew. We know what genocide is. That is why I care about Chechnya,\" explains Mr Gusinsky, who also has Israeli nationality and founded the Russian Jewish Congress. In the medium term his future lies in Israel. He already owns one newspaper there and he claims to have made \"several million dollars\" in Israel last year.He said the loss of Media Most by no means meant he was bankrupt. He now urgently needs to unload what is left of his holding in Media Most. CNN's founder, Ted Turner, an earlier mooted buyer, appears to have dropped out. Mr Putin's popularity comes in part from his promise to do away with the oligarchs, a group of 20-odd billionaire businessmen who got rich stripping assets from privatised companies they bought for nothing. But why target Mr Gusinsky? If the oligarchs were bad, and he denies having been one, he was the best of the bunch. He started Media Most from scratch eight years ago, investing and building a com pany in what, to western eyes, was a recognisable way. He took loans and planned to make a profit in the future. In 1998, before Russia's economic crisis spoiled his plans, Media Most was about to float on the Nasdaq for $1.2bn. His media outlets were the most independent and professional in Russia. Mr Gusinsky says his problems come precisely from that. He invested in media, not steel, oil or coal. Other oligarchs are doing very nicely under president Mr Putin. \"Most are being left alone.\" It took remarkably little time to engineer Mr Gusinsky's downfall. The pressure had been building up since armed police raided Media Most offices a year ago. In the end it took Gazprom three days to apply the coup de grace. First it ousted NTV's journalists, who fled en masse to the TV6 channel owned by Mr Berezovsky. Then the daily paper Sevodnya was closed down and the director of the weekly magazine Itogi sacked. Now, Mr Gusinsky alleges, it is the turn of the popular Ekho Moskvy radio station. The days of it's editor, Alexei Venediktovo, are numbered. So what now for Mr Gusinsky? He is certainly not going to Russia. \"That would be a one-way ticket,\" he jokes. The next stage of this saga may well be played out in London. One of his many homes is there. He wants to leave soon. Russian prosecutors say the Interpol arrest warrant is still valid outside Spain. What if the Metropolitan Police were obliged to arrest him? \"I am not afraid,\" he says. But he admits he has lawyers in Britain and the US working out whether he might be jailed, or even extradited. \"We have asked the British authorities for their views.\" He does not want to go back to jail. Last year he spent three nights in Moscow's notorious Butyrka prison. He thought that by coming to Spain he would avoid repeating that experience. Then judges sent him to Soto del Real prison to await the extradition decision. \"Prison is prison. Everybody, rich or poor, is shocked when they get there. But it is worse when you do not understand why you are there. In Russia I was there because I was a government opponent. But in Spain I did not understand why.\" Exile has allowed him to rediscover friendship with Mr Berezovsky, who has since fallen out with Mr Putin \"We have difficult relationship. We are friends, enemies, friends, enemies,\" he admits. In the long-term he would like to found a new Russian media empire. Yesterday he was enjoying the prospect of boarding his Gulfstream jet and flying to Madrid. Afterwards he will go on holiday to Israel. As a last thought I ask him whether he fears for his life. He gives me a quizzical look, one eyebrow lifted over his rimless glasses. \"Can I not answer that question?\" How the kingmaker fell from grace Empire at its peak \u0095 Most Bank, a commercial bank set up in 1989. Gusinsky claims to have introduced credit cards in Russia. \u0095 Most Group (1992) involves dozens of trade, property, insurance and investment businesses. Gusinsky made a fortune through property deals in early 1990s. \u0095 Privately trained 1,100-strong security force; a fleet of bullet-proof cars. Several properties abroad. \u0095 Media Most holding (Valued at \u00a3700m before 1998 rouble collapse). Group built a stable of media outlets with Gusinsky having the controlling stake, including: NTV: Russia's sole national, independent TV channel, with respected news and current affairs, but also dramas, entertainment. NTV-plus: satellite network bringing world TV to Russia. TNT: a regional network, focusing on entertainment. Ekho Moskvy: talk-radio station with serious news. Sem Dnei: publishers of Sevodnya, a leading liberal broadsheet, and Itogi, weekly current affairs magazine produced with Newsweek. Empire today \u0095 Gave up presidency of Most Bank and renounced role at Most Group to focus on media group. Bank sold. Now in process of forced closure. \u0095 1998 financial crisis, the waning advertising market, and the loss-making NTV-plus project, put Media Most in a critical state. Russia's state gas monopoly, Gazprom, offered new loans in return for large stakes. \u0095 Gazprom's attempts to call in debts led to seizure of NTV's offices on April 14. Gusinky and aides have been removed from the station's board and replaced by Gazprom-appointed executives. \u0095 Gusinsky loses control of Sem Dnei publishing house. On April 16, Sevodnya closed. On April 17, Itogi's editor dismissed. \u0095 Still controls TNT and Ekho Moskvy, although TNT executives complain of harassment by tax police.",

But it's going to be 48 hours until we find out whether the slaughterman with the symptoms has it. A Guardian/ICM poll shows there is overwhelming public support for a vaccination, and that 40% of the public wants to call a halt to the mass culling of animals. The Daily Telegraph The slaughterman with symptoms gives new life to the coverage of foot and mouth - also back on the front page of the Telegraph. Page ten then goes on to talk about the anger ignited by the toxic fumes of the animal pyres. Total number of animals slaughtered so far: almost 1.9m. The Independent The Independent is the only broadsheet that splashes with foot-and-mouth and the health risks involved in burning cattle. The Times The Times suggests there's nothing to worry about, as 40 people have already caught it before, and the disease disappears after two months. The Mirror and the Sun Both papers support the napalming of animal carcasses. Apparently napalm will cut air pollution and dispose of carcasses in 60 minutes, compared to pyres that take three days.

Apart from the eight positives, a further 30% of players tested this season have shown borderline results just creeping under the legal limits.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>There are plenty of theories.

It's an argument backed by team doctors from Italian clubs, who say the players singled out so far are guilty of nothing more than hard work. Fifa conducted their own tests two years ago, and the IOC (who regulate doping standards worldwide) say they're confident their legal levels allow enough room for this possibility. Still, in France, the Olympique Marseille forward Christophe Dugarry did overturn a ban after demonstrating that his body produced the incriminating chemical itself.</p> <p>There's another theory though; that despite the denials, the players involved in Italy are all guilty. Consider: last season the FA's dope commission practised strict blood and urine tests on players right through the championship. However, this summer, the commission was suddenly disbanded and the blood tests discontinued. Did club doctors or players take this as a cue for more dope activity than Dr Dre? If not, how come eight (and rising) have fallen foul of the tests?</p> <p>Cue the third view: the players are taking it, but without knowing - probably laced into \"integrators\" imported from America. It's an idea which is causing terror among Italy's footballers, who complain they've mostly no idea what they're being given. Perugia keeper Andrea Mazzantini has missed one fixture after refusing injections from his team medic, and the recent Lazio-Parma fixture saw several players hit by cramps - after cutting all their pre-match \"supplements\".</p> <p>Says Alessandro Nesta of Lazio and Italy: \"We need a solution, and soon.\" (Is he talking to us or his team doctor?) \"Players should have clarity and certainty over what they're being fed on.\"</p> <p>Who'd argue with that? After all, decades of \"vitamin supplements\" are now being blamed for a variety of ills among ex-footballers. Right now, though, it's the spectre of 16 months off games that's most on players' minds. As a result, the FA has undertaken to analyse all integrators available on the Italian market. They're also hearing an appeal from the Perugia pair, and are about to receive a mighty legal challenge from Lazio on Couto's behalf.</p> <p>Finally, to handle the current crisis, they've also announced a brand new doping commission. Huzzah! Note that among the 20 officials elected at first was a Sardinian doctor previously caught offering to provide a urine sample for an athlete due for testing. That's taking the pee all right. Here's to some explanations, and some less positive performances in the future.</p>",

If not, how come eight (and rising) have fallen foul of the tests? Cue the third view: the players are taking it, but without knowing - probably laced into \"integrators\" imported from America. It's an idea which is causing terror among Italy's footballers, who complain they've mostly no idea what they're being given. Perugia keeper Andrea Mazzantini has missed one fixture after refusing injections from his team medic, and the recent Lazio-Parma fixture saw several players hit by cramps - after cutting all their pre-match \"supplements\". Says Alessandro Nesta of Lazio and Italy: \"We need a solution, and soon.\" (Is he talking to us or his team doctor?) \"Players should have clarity and certainty over what they're being fed on.\" Who'd argue with that? After all, decades of \"vitamin supplements\" are now being blamed for a variety of ills among ex-footballers. Right now, though, it's the spectre of 16 months off games that's most on players' minds. As a result, the FA has undertaken to analyse all integrators available on the Italian market. They're also hearing an appeal from the Perugia pair, and are about to receive a mighty legal challenge from Lazio on Couto's behalf. Finally, to handle the current crisis, they've also announced a brand new doping commission. Huzzah! Note that among the 20 officials elected at first was a Sardinian doctor previously caught offering to provide a urine sample for an athlete due for testing. That's taking the pee all right. Here's to some explanations, and some less positive performances in the future.",

      "bodyText": "The contentious issue of BBC regulation may be reopened in the summer after the general election. Sources say the draft communications bill has been virtually agreed in principle but there is still major \"contention\" about three areas - the role of the BBC board of governors, the structure of Ofcom and media ownership. Some senior industry executives now believe the government could heed the widespread call from commercial broadcasters for the BBC governors to be made accountable to the new communications regulator, Ofcom, and revisit an issue that was initially dealt with in last year's communications white paper. \"I think there will be a subtle shift, with a bigger advisory role for Ofcom,\" said one public affairs executive. The culture secretary, Chris Smith, has already said he thinks BBC regulation should be left alone until parliament gets round to considering the renewal of the BBC Charter The current charter runs to 2006 and the parliamentary review is likely to begin in 2003 or 2004. The communications white paper published in December proposed maintaining the \"legal responsibility and authority of the BBC governors for delivering the BBC's remit\". But in the media select committee hearings that followed, commercial broadcasters including ITV, Channel 4 and BSkyB called for this proposal to be revised so the BBC governors would be more directly accountable to Ofcom. The committee's chairman, Gerald Kaufman, described the decision to exclude BBC governance from Ofcom's responsibilities as \"utterly anomalous\" when launching the subsequent report on the white paper. Sources say there is still no consensus on the structure of Ofcom. However, the most talked about option is a body headed by a chairman - possibly the former BBC director general, Lord Birt - and a chief executive - possibly the ITC chief executive, Patricia Hodgson. Beneath this would lie three individual divisions. One division would manage the spectrum, controlling telecoms, TV and radio licensing - a job currently done by the Radio Communications Authority at the DTI and Oftel. A second division would be responsible for content and editorial, taking over the responsibilities of the ITC, BSC, and the Radio Authority. The third division would handle all issues of \"carriage and infrastructure\". It is thought the issue of competition would cut across all three of these internal Ofcom divisions. There is also a growing consensus among the five existing regulators that a \"content panel\" or \"board\" should be created to sit below the main Ofcom board. Membership of this panel would reflect the UK's regional and ethnic diversity in order to head off possible criticism of Ofcom becoming too London-centric. It is thought the proposed content board would take over responsibility for programme complaint processing and audience research from the Independent Television Commission and Broadcasting Standards Council. A spokeswoman from the department of culture, media and sport confirmed that there \"may be more consultation on some of the 'greener' bits of the communications white paper, including probably media ownership\". The spokeswoman did not rule out further consultation on the role of the BBC governors. \"The policy on the BBC was set out in the white paper and we are considering the responses at the moment,\" she said. The joint department of culture, media and sport and department of trade and industry team working flat out to draft the communications bill is aiming to have all the non-contentious elements ready for publication immediately after the expected June 7 general election. But there could be some further consultation on media ownership and BBC regulation in July. The next couple of weeks is regarded as crucial, as it will be the last chance the civil servants drafting the bill have to run options past the relevant government ministers before the election is called. Media lobbyists will be watching the Queen's Speech following the election to see if the communications bill is included in the legislation to be passed during the first session of the new Parliament.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the last years of her life, the great American reporter Martha Gellhorn became aware of a writer trying to muckrake down among her most personal history. For someone so very public yet so very private, the idea was appalling. She told her friend, the journalist John Simpson: \"There's some wretched little man who's gone around digging out material about me, and he's just waiting till I die to bring it out.\" That man was Carl Rollyson. Last week his finished product, Beautiful Exile, The Life of Martha Gellhorn, was published, three years after her death. </p> <p>The woman who changed the face of war reporting, giving accounts of the suffering of real people, was right to be worried. Rollyson - who in 1990 published a previous edition of the book in the US but was forced to remove certain sections after a legal battle with Gellhorn - writes in his introduction: \"She knew how important sex was for most men, and she used it not only to please men but to get good stories. She slept with generals; she had one-night stands with ordinary soldiers who might not survive the next day. She dressed elegantly, used make-up skilfully, flirted and coaxed men to do her bidding.\" </p> <p>A picture emerges of a woman who \"smoked, drank and travelled with abandon\"; she is castigated for her beauty, her \"wheat coloured hair\", for wearing Saks Fifth Avenue slacks while reporting on the horrors of war. She is portrayed as a user of men and is said to have tired of her adopted son - a notion he has fiercely rejected. </p> <p>In her final years in London, perched in a sixth-floor flat in Cadogan Square, Gellhorn had visits from a host of great war reporters and other journalists who had become friends. Most are disgusted by the book. </p> <p>As the journalist John Pilger says: \"The problem Martha Gellhorn still presents to the jealous, envious and scandalmongers is that she was brave, beautiful and clever, and had passionately held political principles. Worse, she was a woman who was decades ahead of her time in pushing the boundaries of her gender. Salacious demolition jobs on remarkable human beings after their death are not new; and they are as craven as ever.\" </p> <p>Since she walked out on Ernest Hemingway in 1943, after five years of marriage, Gellhorn had refused to talk much about him.

      "bodyText": "In the last years of her life, the great American reporter Martha Gellhorn became aware of a writer trying to muckrake down among her most personal history. For someone so very public yet so very private, the idea was appalling. She told her friend, the journalist John Simpson: \"There's some wretched little man who's gone around digging out material about me, and he's just waiting till I die to bring it out.\" That man was Carl Rollyson. Last week his finished product, Beautiful Exile, The Life of Martha Gellhorn, was published, three years after her death. The woman who changed the face of war reporting, giving accounts of the suffering of real people, was right to be worried. Rollyson - who in 1990 published a previous edition of the book in the US but was forced to remove certain sections after a legal battle with Gellhorn - writes in his introduction: \"She knew how important sex was for most men, and she used it not only to please men but to get good stories. She slept with generals; she had one-night stands with ordinary soldiers who might not survive the next day. She dressed elegantly, used make-up skilfully, flirted and coaxed men to do her bidding.\" A picture emerges of a woman who \"smoked, drank and travelled with abandon\"; she is castigated for her beauty, her \"wheat coloured hair\", for wearing Saks Fifth Avenue slacks while reporting on the horrors of war. She is portrayed as a user of men and is said to have tired of her adopted son - a notion he has fiercely rejected. In her final years in London, perched in a sixth-floor flat in Cadogan Square, Gellhorn had visits from a host of great war reporters and other journalists who had become friends. Most are disgusted by the book. As the journalist John Pilger says: \"The problem Martha Gellhorn still presents to the jealous, envious and scandalmongers is that she was brave, beautiful and clever, and had passionately held political principles. Worse, she was a woman who was decades ahead of her time in pushing the boundaries of her gender. Salacious demolition jobs on remarkable human beings after their death are not new; and they are as craven as ever.\" Since she walked out on Ernest Hemingway in 1943, after five years of marriage, Gellhorn had refused to talk much about him. She was a writer in her own right, a woman who had covered the heaviest of wars, and she wished to be remembered for that. Yet all people recalled was the marriage. Beautiful Exile makes it apparent why Gellhorn was so reticent to talk about the man who would eventually shoot himself. For the first time, her friends have learned that, jealously, he tried to destroy her reputation, dehumanising her as an \"operative\" during their years working together and trying to turn her into his property. The book contains extracts from ferocious letters Hemingway wrote to Gellhorn after she walked off to war and out of their marriage. He called her a \"career bulldozer\", a \"product of beauticians\" and a \"phoney and pretentious bitch\". Rosie Boycott was friends with Gellhorn from the early 70s when Boycott founded Spare Rib and Gellhorn told her the women's movement was \"bunk\". Boycott helped her find a lawyer to oppose publication of Rollyson's original biography and recalls \"quite a nasty fight.

She will make her debut on Sir Trevor's Tonight show this Thursday, fronting a 20-minute investigation into obesity. And senior executives say they hope to persuade her to become an occasional reporter on the show. \"She comes across as warm and interested. And she has now got quite a lot of experience from her work on American television,\" said one source on the show. Obesity is a subject familiar to the duchess, who for years was dubbed the \"Duchess of Pork\" because of her ballooning figure. She has become an ambassador for Weightwatchers in the US, earning \u00a31m a year, and claimed the company's diet regime helped her lose three stone. However, the duchess has also been criticised after revealing she encouraged her daughters - Eugenie,12, and Beatrice, 10 - to calculate the calories and fat content of their food. Insiders on Tonight are keen to sign her up - they know the duchess is \"box office\" but have yet to open negotiations with her. \"It will be a matter of establishing how much work she can fit into her schedule and what kind of issues we want her to report on,\" said a source. It is understood the duchess has not been paid for her appearance on Thursday's Tonight. A long-term deal will be a significant entree to mainstream British television, coming at a time when the royals' business interests are coming under intense scrutiny. However, the duchess's activities will not come under the Lord Chamberlain's review of royals as she is now deemed an \"ordinary person\". Her ITV debut comes two years after her Sky TV chatshow was axed after pulling in a meagre 12,000 viewers. The much heralded Sarah - Surviving Life survived just one 10-show series on Sky and was a critical disaster. One critic branded it \"the most embarrassing 60 minutes in chatshow history\". Since then, however, she has gone on to front the biggest chatshow in the world, America's Larry King show. Americans claim to like her candour and ballsy style. \"I've had first-hand knowledge of what it's like to be overweight and have the media spotlight on me,\" the duchess says in her Tonight show. \"I think I understand the depression and despair people face when they are trying to lose weight.

The leaflet, which prominently states that asylum seekers are costing each UK household \u00a334 annually, includes a quiz to win the prize of a \"bottle of English wine\" featuring the question \"What is the percentage of asylum applications that are unjustified?\" Kingston and Surbiton Lib Dem MP Ed Davey said: \"Voters will see this scaremongering for what it is, both distasteful and irresponsible.\" The former home secretary Michael Howard yesterday denied using inflammatory language in an advert revealed in yesterday's Guardian highlighting the Tories' record on asylum seekers. The advert, in the local paper in the MP's Folkstone and Hythe constituency, asked: \"What matters most to you? Bogus asylum seekers? Conservatives reduced the number before. We will do so again.\" Mr Howard insisted: \"I do not see what in this advertisement could possibly be regarded as objectionable.\" Mr Blair's official spokesman said asylum issues had to be separated from arguments about racism - a response to Tory accusations that the government is running away from a debate on asylum. \"Our complaint about the opposition is not that they have raised the issue of asylum It is a perfectly fair, legitimate thing to do. Our complaint is that they have opposed the measures we have put in place to deal with that.\" Mr Straw will today make a speech to the Foreign Press Association defending the government's asylum policy. The government is now likely to stick to policy issues and steer clear of mudslinging over alleged racism within the Conservative party, since its accusations have led campaigners to question its own record on race matters. A speech by Robin Cook, foreign secretary, praising Britain's multicultural identity and its love of chicken tikka masala was widely seen as patronising.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Behind the rival hands of race cards that party politicians hold are the facts on the ground. This column is about one of them. As the main parties proclaim their concerns about race, facts are drowning under a Niagara of piety. Yet this particular fact is so startling that it deserves wide study. In an honest society, it would tell you that race, far from being excluded from the election, would be near the forefront of discussion. But since only the Liberal Democrats care about it, and have an honourable record in dealing with it, the conspiracy of self-congratulatory silence is likely to succeed. </p> <p>The fact in question is the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Though William Hague is a slimy cardplayer, Jack Straw, I think, is worse. He, after all, is the minister. He saw the act through. Yesterday, purring sanctimoniously about Labour's superiority in all matters racial, he said this act \"puts on the statute book some of the best anti-discrimination legislation anywhere in the world\". But that is not why it should be famous. Its uniqueness is quite the opposite. It puts on the statute book the bluntest piece of state-sponsored ethnic discrimination in the 35 years since British parliaments started legislating in the field. </p> <p>The act's ostensible purpose was benign. Responding to the Stephen Lawrence tragedy, it extended anti-discrimination law to public authorities, notably the police, previously outside its reach. There were hiccups along the legislative way. Ministers had to be goaded into outlawing indirect, as well as direct, discrimination. What they couldn't be shifted from, however, was a decision to exempt all immigration, nationality and asylum decision-makers from the new law. These are now explicitly permitted to override what were for many years accepted principles: first, that immigration officers must observe the law against racial bias, and second that ethnic groups must at all times be treated as individuals not as a collective. </p> <p>How did this happen? Partly through the reptilian disingenuousness of the Home Office. Mr Straw depicted the specific change as itself benign. Without it, he said, \"ministers would, for example, be unable to authorise special compassionate exercises when necessary for particular ethnic or national groups\". The exemption would have only good purposes. Straw cited the mercy Britain had recently shown to Kosovo Albanians en masse. Discrimination for positive purposes had to be exempted from a new anti-discrimination law. </p> <p>Seldom in the annals of ministerial double-talk was such apparent virtue so swiftly renounced. We know this from the first ministerial instruction to immigration officers that was issued under the act, under cover of near-darkness, which has been operative since early April. This legal document, seen by almost no one, makes clear how the act should be operated not to let needy cases in but to keep national groups, irrespective of individual circumstances, out. Here comes the heightening of authorised official prejudice against national groups. The instruction says these must be examined more rigorously, detained more freely, and refused entry more swiftly if \"there is statistical evidence showing a pattern or trend of breach of the immigration laws by persons of that nationality\". </p> <p>Even supposing the statistics were reliable, this grotesquely offends against natural justice, not to mention the Human Rights Act and several international obligations. \"Statistical evidence\" in the immigration field is hard to verify, and in any case a baseless way of predicting the truth about an individual case. </p> <p> What case is there for punishing a newly arrived Serb merely because previous Serbs have been refused? A society that had kept its legal head would be unhappy answering that question. Yet the sweeping exemption grants officials, through ministers, the power to deport, exclude, refuse leave to enter, withhold exceptional leave to remain, and grant or not grant asylum, not only by reference to the collective record of earlier Nigerians or Chinese or Russians, as nationalities, but on the still more offensive basis of ethnic or national origins. </p> <p>During the act's passage last year, ministers showed themselves aware of the sensitivities this might arouse. When an issue arose about the meaning of \"ethnic\", Straw was quick to say it was unlawful for immigration staff to discriminate on grounds of race or colour. But this was as circular as it was duplicitous, as he surely knew. It was wordplay in the interest of squaring a supposedly progressive conscience with an indisputably aggressive attitude to asylum seekers. How can an immigration officer take ethnic origins into account, as the new law instructs, without this being simultaneously racial? Answer: any problem the officer may have can now be handled by the power the new act confers on ministers to determine when a racial/ethnic decision is \"justified\" or \"necessary\". </p> <p>Searching for a reasoned justification, ministers fell back on racketeering. The main scenario they offered against which these blanket powers were necessary was where criminal gangs organised economic migration from China. People who looked Chinese might on these grounds have to be singled out for attention. Revealingly, Straw's deputy, Mike O'Brien, when challenged with a parallel hypothesis of white economic migrants from eastern Europe, perhaps orchestrated by Russian gangs, shrank from making a similar ethnic generalisation. \"White people are not one homogeneous ethnic group, incapable of being distinguished one from another,\" he said, as if non-white people were somehow other. </p> <p>The truth is that this part of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act is ethnically discriminatory, in a way which such ministerial language only confirms. It is not aimed at scams alone. It's meant to withhold justice from groups of people - unspecified in the law, but in categories open-ended to the whim of ministers - based on their ethnic or national origins, and without a fair chance to answer back. Anyone who doubts this has only to read the final clause in the ministerial directive. It says: \"If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.\" </p> <p>So the net closes on the British reputation for the rule of decent law.

      "bodyText": "Behind the rival hands of race cards that party politicians hold are the facts on the ground. This column is about one of them. As the main parties proclaim their concerns about race, facts are drowning under a Niagara of piety. Yet this particular fact is so startling that it deserves wide study. In an honest society, it would tell you that race, far from being excluded from the election, would be near the forefront of discussion. But since only the Liberal Democrats care about it, and have an honourable record in dealing with it, the conspiracy of self-congratulatory silence is likely to succeed. The fact in question is the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Though William Hague is a slimy cardplayer, Jack Straw, I think, is worse. He, after all, is the minister. He saw the act through. Yesterday, purring sanctimoniously about Labour's superiority in all matters racial, he said this act \"puts on the statute book some of the best anti-discrimination legislation anywhere in the world\". But that is not why it should be famous. Its uniqueness is quite the opposite. It puts on the statute book the bluntest piece of state-sponsored ethnic discrimination in the 35 years since British parliaments started legislating in the field. The act's ostensible purpose was benign. Responding to the Stephen Lawrence tragedy, it extended anti-discrimination law to public authorities, notably the police, previously outside its reach. There were hiccups along the legislative way. Ministers had to be goaded into outlawing indirect, as well as direct, discrimination. What they couldn't be shifted from, however, was a decision to exempt all immigration, nationality and asylum decision-makers from the new law. These are now explicitly permitted to override what were for many years accepted principles: first, that immigration officers must observe the law against racial bias, and second that ethnic groups must at all times be treated as individuals not as a collective. How did this happen? Partly through the reptilian disingenuousness of the Home Office. Mr Straw depicted the specific change as itself benign. Without it, he said, \"ministers would, for example, be unable to authorise special compassionate exercises when necessary for particular ethnic or national groups\". The exemption would have only good purposes. Straw cited the mercy Britain had recently shown to Kosovo Albanians en masse. Discrimination for positive purposes had to be exempted from a new anti-discrimination law. Seldom in the annals of ministerial double-talk was such apparent virtue so swiftly renounced. We know this from the first ministerial instruction to immigration officers that was issued under the act, under cover of near-darkness, which has been operative since early April. This legal document, seen by almost no one, makes clear how the act should be operated not to let needy cases in but to keep national groups, irrespective of individual circumstances, out. Here comes the heightening of authorised official prejudice against national groups. The instruction says these must be examined more rigorously, detained more freely, and refused entry more swiftly if \"there is statistical evidence showing a pattern or trend of breach of the immigration laws by persons of that nationality\". Even supposing the statistics were reliable, this grotesquely offends against natural justice, not to mention the Human Rights Act and several international obligations. \"Statistical evidence\" in the immigration field is hard to verify, and in any case a baseless way of predicting the truth about an individual case. What case is there for punishing a newly arrived Serb merely because previous Serbs have been refused? A society that had kept its legal head would be unhappy answering that question. Yet the sweeping exemption grants officials, through ministers, the power to deport, exclude, refuse leave to enter, withhold exceptional leave to remain, and grant or not grant asylum, not only by reference to the collective record of earlier Nigerians or Chinese or Russians, as nationalities, but on the still more offensive basis of ethnic or national origins. During the act's passage last year, ministers showed themselves aware of the sensitivities this might arouse. When an issue arose about the meaning of \"ethnic\", Straw was quick to say it was unlawful for immigration staff to discriminate on grounds of race or colour. But this was as circular as it was duplicitous, as he surely knew. It was wordplay in the interest of squaring a supposedly progressive conscience with an indisputably aggressive attitude to asylum seekers. How can an immigration officer take ethnic origins into account, as the new law instructs, without this being simultaneously racial? Answer: any problem the officer may have can now be handled by the power the new act confers on ministers to determine when a racial/ethnic decision is \"justified\" or \"necessary\". Searching for a reasoned justification, ministers fell back on racketeering. The main scenario they offered against which these blanket powers were necessary was where criminal gangs organised economic migration from China. People who looked Chinese might on these grounds have to be singled out for attention. Revealingly, Straw's deputy, Mike O'Brien, when challenged with a parallel hypothesis of white economic migrants from eastern Europe, perhaps orchestrated by Russian gangs, shrank from making a similar ethnic generalisation. \"White people are not one homogeneous ethnic group, incapable of being distinguished one from another,\" he said, as if non-white people were somehow other. The truth is that this part of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act is ethnically discriminatory, in a way which such ministerial language only confirms. It is not aimed at scams alone. It's meant to withhold justice from groups of people - unspecified in the law, but in categories open-ended to the whim of ministers - based on their ethnic or national origins, and without a fair chance to answer back. Anyone who doubts this has only to read the final clause in the ministerial directive. It says: \"If the information [needed to pursue an application to enter] is not available in a language which the person understands, it is not necessary to provide the information in a language which he does understand.\" So the net closes on the British reputation for the rule of decent law. Asylum and immigration pose complex problems in the modern age, but they do not need to be addressed by this kind of perversion of the system. Maybe only an optimist would expect it to feature in the election campaign. Even the Lib Dems may hesitate to talk up their record. But behind the smarmy talk about what politicians should say, there's the issue of what they do. What Jack Straw, famous for his anti-racism, has done is write into statute a law of national and ethnic and racial discrimination.",

The blaze, described as \"severe\" by the fire brigade, was reported in the seven-story Moathouse hotel in the early hours of this morning. Hotel staff evacuated most of the 128 guests as fire took hold on the third floor and heavy smoke filled the floors immediately above and below. Windows were smashed at the height of the blaze but as 50 fire fighters attempted to bring the flames under control it became clear \"several people were unaccounted for\", a spokesman said. A team of 20 firefighters wearing breathing apparatus began a search of the hotel and found a man and a woman in a corridor on the third floor. They were given first aid at the scene and rushed by ambulance to the Royal Bolton hospital where they were pronounced dead. Two more people suffering from smoke inhalation were also taken to hospital, but later released. The spokesman said a full investigation had been launched into the fire. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said emergency services were alerted to the blaze just before 1am. \"The fire was in a residential area.

      "body": "<p>A yellowish grey cloud of stinking smoke stretched over the empty fields like dirty cotton wool. The wind blew it away from the north Devon town of Holsworthy less than a mile away, but in the town anger had grown that it was nearly 24 hours before scientists started monitoring for pollution after the lighting of the Arscott farm pyre of 4,000 sheep and cattle.</p> <p>Sampling for dioxins, the most toxic of the chemicals produced, had not begun by yesterday evening. The monitoring station, in a trailer next to the community hospital, was sampling for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and particulates. Analysis for dioxins is more complex and could not be carried out with the equipment in the trailer, the contractors said yesterday.</p> <p>Daryn Bray, president of Holsworthy chamber of commerce, said: \"The first 24 hours are supposedly the worst, and I feel they have to monitor it from the start, not a day in to the burn ... it appears typical of the way the whole thing has been handled.\"</p> <p>Fierce protest forced Maff to amend its plans to burn 13,000 sheep and 1,000 cattle at Arscott, and to aim for only 4,000 animals. But Mike Childs, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"It's disturbing that local people may have been exposed to the pollution before finding out if there were emissions causing ill health. One is suspicious that this monitoring exercise is only trying to prove the government is right to say all is safe.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment denied accusations of incompetence. But in Holsworthy a giant board was chalked with the words \"Air pollution 24 hours by Ministry Against Family Feelings\". The mayor, John Allen, said: \"We feel this site is just too near the town.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Welsh assembly ministers yesterday decided against burning up to 180,000 sheep high in Brecon Beacons national park.

      "bodyText": "A yellowish grey cloud of stinking smoke stretched over the empty fields like dirty cotton wool. The wind blew it away from the north Devon town of Holsworthy less than a mile away, but in the town anger had grown that it was nearly 24 hours before scientists started monitoring for pollution after the lighting of the Arscott farm pyre of 4,000 sheep and cattle. Sampling for dioxins, the most toxic of the chemicals produced, had not begun by yesterday evening. The monitoring station, in a trailer next to the community hospital, was sampling for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and particulates. Analysis for dioxins is more complex and could not be carried out with the equipment in the trailer, the contractors said yesterday. Daryn Bray, president of Holsworthy chamber of commerce, said: \"The first 24 hours are supposedly the worst, and I feel they have to monitor it from the start, not a day in to the burn ... it appears typical of the way the whole thing has been handled.\" Fierce protest forced Maff to amend its plans to burn 13,000 sheep and 1,000 cattle at Arscott, and to aim for only 4,000 animals. But Mike Childs, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"It's disturbing that local people may have been exposed to the pollution before finding out if there were emissions causing ill health. One is suspicious that this monitoring exercise is only trying to prove the government is right to say all is safe.\" A spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment denied accusations of incompetence. But in Holsworthy a giant board was chalked with the words \"Air pollution 24 hours by Ministry Against Family Feelings\". The mayor, John Allen, said: \"We feel this site is just too near the town.\" \u0095 Welsh assembly ministers yesterday decided against burning up to 180,000 sheep high in Brecon Beacons national park. Trecastle and Sennybridge residents claimed the burning and burials were abandoned because of water and smoke pollution, not because the disposal backlog had eased. Some have complained of sore throats from previous pyres' smoke, and say the rivers Usk and Towy will be contaminated. Michael Bogdanov, the theatre director, who lives near a pyre at Epynt, said: \"Only a madman would think of burying up to 180,000 sheep in unlined pits 1,500ft [up] and think that it won't affect the water table.

      "bodyText": "There is overwhelming public support for the introduction of a selective vaccination policy to deal with the foot and mouth crisis, according to the findings of this month's Guardian/ICM opinion poll. It also finds that a substantial minority, some 40% of the public, want to call a halt to the policy of culling animals on farms next to sites where the disease has been detected and to use vaccination instead. It reveals a gender split on the issue with men being more inclined to back a continuing cull while women generally prefer to see the introduction of mass vaccination. A surprisingly large proportion of the public - 58% - also say they would be happy to buy meat that had come from a vaccinated animal, removing one of the major fears raised over the adoption of such a policy. Some 65% of men say they would be happy to eat vaccinated meat, compared with just 50% of women. The poll shows that 9% of the population say they do not eat meat - splitting 10% of women and 7% of men. The government says it would be happy to introduce a selective vaccination policy but will not do it without the support of farmers. The responses to the question of whether voters approve or disapprove of the government's handling of the foot and mouth crisis show that the electorate has not been impressed by Labour's performance, with a majority (56%) giving a negative verdict. But these figures have remained unchanged over the past three weeks, bearing out Labour's calculation that as the daily number of new cases falls so the political damage to the government will be contained. Replies to the question about which party has the best policies for dealing with foot and mouth reveal the full extent to which the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have failed to capitalise on the situation.

      "bodyText": "Labour spent less on building and repairing the fabric of Britain's public infrastructure in each of its four years in power than the Conservatives spent in their final 12 months in office, the government admitted yesterday. Despite a last-minute surge in spending by Whitehall departments, investment by Gordon Brown in transport, schools and hospitals amounted to just \u00a34.3bn in the latest financial year, compared to \u00a34.7bn when Kenneth Clarke was chancellor in the run-up to the 1997 election. The spending figures - a legacy of Labour's hard-line approach to the public finances in its first two years in power - coincide with the heftiest surplus in the state finances on record, and will be seized upon by the opposition parties in the general election campaign next month. The Conservatives have been running a campaign aimed at linking tax increases with the state of public services, while the Liberal Democrats will make higher investment in health and education the centrepiece of their strategy. Figures released jointly by the Treasury and the office for national statistics yesterday showed that public sector net investment stood at \u00a31,366m in March, the highest monthly figure for the 2000-01 financial year. The total for the year was the highest of Labour's four years in power, but fell well short of the chancellor's target of \u00a37bn. Mr Brown believes that the anti-spending culture among officials in government departments rather than a lack of funds is to blame for the failure to invest, and he will argue during the election campaign that investment will rise strongly in a second Labour term. According to the government's three-year spending plan, capital investment will rise to \u00a317.3bn by 2003-04, the highest since the mid-1970s, when the International Monetary Fund forced cuts on the Callaghan government during the sterling crisis. However, Labour's opponents claim that the failure of Labour to deliver on its spending promises calls into question its ability to invest the sums allocated for the next three years. Capital spending, taking into account depreciation, stood at \u00a311bn in Mrs Thatcher's last full year in power, but fell sharply from the mid-1990s onwards. Under Labour, spending was \u00a33.8bn in 1997-8, \u00a34.1bn in 1998-9 and \u00a33.5bn in 1999-2000. During the past four years, spending on infrastructure has averaged less than 0.5% of gross domestic product each year, compared to more than 1% a year during the 1980s. Yesterday's figures showed that high tax receipts and low spending resulted in a record budget surplus for the government of \u00a316.5bn last year, up on the 1999-2000 surplus of \u00a315.5bn, and \u00a31.5bn higher than Mr Brown estimated in his Budget forecast as recently as early March. During the past 12 months the Treasury has also secured \u00a322.5bn from the auction of third-generation mobile phone licences, the proceeds of which will be used to pay off the national debt. City analysts believe that slower growth and the belated increases in spending, which are now coming through, will dent the size of the surplus in the current financial year, but that it may still reach \u00a310bn-\u00a312bn.",

      "body": "<p>Every school day Morag Wood, her brother Craig and a clutch of other teenagers cross the old sandstone bridge over the Tweed for lessons in another country. For rural children, the trek from the family's Northumberland cottage to a school bus in the frontier town of Coldstream might seem unremarkable. But in educational terms, the gap is much wider than the deceptively narrow Anglo-Scottish boundary astride a salmon river.</p> <p>Parents, like Richard and Carol Wood, are voting with their children's feet for a better education in a nation which boasts much higher public spending in almost every area, from schools to hospitals, roads to housing and - significantly, in the foot and mouth crisis - agriculture.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, 14-year-old Morag and Craig, aged 17, from Moneylees, near Cornhill, live within the catchment area of Berwick upon Tweed community high school, ten miles to the east in England. \"But if we had to send them there I would move back to Scotland,\" says Richard Wood, a farm stockman who was born north of the border. \"They're at a fantastic place. The schooling is much better in Scotland - they put a much higher value on education there.\"</p> <p>Berwickshire High, in the small town of Duns 12 miles north, might have a similar name to its English rival - but that's where the comparison ends. With more staff - now benefiting from a salary hike the envy of teachers in England - classes are much smaller, the exam curriculum is generally broader and, unlike its hard-pressed English equivalent, the Scottish school does not seem strapped for cash.</p> <p>\"The two systems are certainly different,\" says Ian Ross, depute rector of Berwickshire High, which has 750 pupils (including almost 20 from England) and 50 full-time staff. \"We have certain advantages. Class sizes are regulated in subjects like science to a maximum of 20 and we are under 30 for non-practical subjects. Our rule of thumb is to keep classes to 25 if we can. I do not believe this exists south of the border.\" His average pupil-teacher ratio is 13.5.</p> <p>At Berwick community high, which has 800 pupils and 47 full-time staff, head teacher Steve Quinlan looks despairingly northwards as he grapples with a school deficit of \u00a3140,000. \"Our funding levels are appalling,\" he says and ponders an \"official\" ratio of over 22 pupils per teacher. \"In reality it is more than 30.\"</p> <p>While unhappy with the perception that schooling is better in Scotland, Mr Quinlan admits: \"The most important thing is that parents think they are getting a higher quality education across the border whereas we have the capacity and everything pupils need and have a good record of getting them to university.\"</p> <p><b> Conscience</b><br></p> <p>A native of Kent, Mr Quinlan admires Scotland's political system since the creation of an Edinburgh parliament two years ago. \"They have still got a social conscience and, to their credit, they have retained an ethos that social investment is as important as private investment...\".</p> <p>His worry, however, is that with big pay rises for Scottish teachers - a 24%, three-year package - his staff (six are Scots) will increasingly look over the border for work. Already he is finding it difficult to fill three vacancies in information technology, maths and learning support.</p> <p>Fifty miles west at Lochinvar high school, in the Cumbrian border village of Longtown, it is a similar story. Scott Wylie, who teaches geography, RE and information technology, lives in Scotland but travels to England each day for work. He believes it will be difficult for English schools to hang on to staff, let alone recruit new teachers. \"Every day as I travel to work I see Scotland doing things much better - from decent roads to handling the foot and mouth crisis more efficiently.\"</p> <p>Politically, the nations of a union created almost 300 years ago are drawing apart. First the Scottish parliament parted company with Westminster by abolishing tuition fees for higher education. Then it decided to give old people free central heating installation while offering the prospect of free residential care.

      "bodyText": "Every school day Morag Wood, her brother Craig and a clutch of other teenagers cross the old sandstone bridge over the Tweed for lessons in another country. For rural children, the trek from the family's Northumberland cottage to a school bus in the frontier town of Coldstream might seem unremarkable. But in educational terms, the gap is much wider than the deceptively narrow Anglo-Scottish boundary astride a salmon river. Parents, like Richard and Carol Wood, are voting with their children's feet for a better education in a nation which boasts much higher public spending in almost every area, from schools to hospitals, roads to housing and - significantly, in the foot and mouth crisis - agriculture. Strictly speaking, 14-year-old Morag and Craig, aged 17, from Moneylees, near Cornhill, live within the catchment area of Berwick upon Tweed community high school, ten miles to the east in England. \"But if we had to send them there I would move back to Scotland,\" says Richard Wood, a farm stockman who was born north of the border. \"They're at a fantastic place. The schooling is much better in Scotland - they put a much higher value on education there.\" Berwickshire High, in the small town of Duns 12 miles north, might have a similar name to its English rival - but that's where the comparison ends. With more staff - now benefiting from a salary hike the envy of teachers in England - classes are much smaller, the exam curriculum is generally broader and, unlike its hard-pressed English equivalent, the Scottish school does not seem strapped for cash. \"The two systems are certainly different,\" says Ian Ross, depute rector of Berwickshire High, which has 750 pupils (including almost 20 from England) and 50 full-time staff. \"We have certain advantages. Class sizes are regulated in subjects like science to a maximum of 20 and we are under 30 for non-practical subjects. Our rule of thumb is to keep classes to 25 if we can. I do not believe this exists south of the border.\" His average pupil-teacher ratio is 13.5. At Berwick community high, which has 800 pupils and 47 full-time staff, head teacher Steve Quinlan looks despairingly northwards as he grapples with a school deficit of \u00a3140,000. \"Our funding levels are appalling,\" he says and ponders an \"official\" ratio of over 22 pupils per teacher. \"In reality it is more than 30.\" While unhappy with the perception that schooling is better in Scotland, Mr Quinlan admits: \"The most important thing is that parents think they are getting a higher quality education across the border whereas we have the capacity and everything pupils need and have a good record of getting them to university.\" Conscience A native of Kent, Mr Quinlan admires Scotland's political system since the creation of an Edinburgh parliament two years ago. \"They have still got a social conscience and, to their credit, they have retained an ethos that social investment is as important as private investment...\". His worry, however, is that with big pay rises for Scottish teachers - a 24%, three-year package - his staff (six are Scots) will increasingly look over the border for work. Already he is finding it difficult to fill three vacancies in information technology, maths and learning support. Fifty miles west at Lochinvar high school, in the Cumbrian border village of Longtown, it is a similar story. Scott Wylie, who teaches geography, RE and information technology, lives in Scotland but travels to England each day for work. He believes it will be difficult for English schools to hang on to staff, let alone recruit new teachers. \"Every day as I travel to work I see Scotland doing things much better - from decent roads to handling the foot and mouth crisis more efficiently.\" Politically, the nations of a union created almost 300 years ago are drawing apart. First the Scottish parliament parted company with Westminster by abolishing tuition fees for higher education. Then it decided to give old people free central heating installation while offering the prospect of free residential care. A big hike in teachers' pay followed, with Scotland's Department of Rural Affairs showing it was far more attuned to the foot and mouth crisis than its English equivalent. Increasingly, Anglo-Scottish divisions are widening, priorities diverging. And the people in England's border country are restless. Like countless others in Northumber land and Cumbria, Mr Wood, who lives three miles inside England, looks north of the border for better public services. Buoyed by new Treasury figures showing that public spending per head in Scotland is still almost a quarter above the English average, Mr Wood sees no reason to apologise for sending his two children to Berwickshire High. \"Living right on the border, we seem to be a forgotten lot - roads are appalling, the health service is not that good, and everything seems to much better a mile or so north.\" When he needed an operation last year, he opted for the ultra-modern Borders general hospital, at Melrose, rather than an inferior hospital in Northumberland.

Cross the border and you instantly see the difference.\" The town certainly has an identity crisis; once a pawn in the power game between England and Scotland, it changed hands 13 times between 1147 and 1482. Now, while quite definitely English, it is trying to get a little more independence by becoming the first town outside London to hold a referendum on having an elected mayor. A poll, likely on June 7 will evoke memories of a 16th century mayor who presided over what Edward IV and Mary Queen of Scots declared to be a \"free state\" between the two countries. Invidious Some argue that the \u00a325,000 cost of the exercise is a waste of money. But almost everyone believes the area gets a raw deal from the government. Bill Ferguson, the Liberal Democrat who leads Berwick-upon-Tweed district council, estimates that the Scottish Borders Council, which serves the south east of Scotland two miles northwards, spends about \u00a3800 a year more on each of its people than Northumberland councils. According to Alan Beith, MP for Berwick and deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, it is all down to an invidious Whitehall public spending formula which penalises Northumberland and - despite numerous protests - gives Scotland 23% more per head than the English average, according to latest Treasury figures. Based on this, estimates by the Campaign for the English Regions (CFER), an increasingly vocal pressure group, show that the north-east of England alone would need an extra \u00a31.1bn annually to catch up with Scotland. For the moment the Wood family, and a handful of other English taxpayers locked into Scottish education, are happy.

At the time, Scotland was poorer than many parts of Britain, although its level of wealth is now considerably higher than many English regions. Lord Barnett now says it has outlived its usefulness and discriminates against England. Mr Prescott predicted \"one hell of a debate\" as the government moved to examine spending throughout the town halls, regions and nations of the UK. With a string of ministers pressing Downing Street to answer the English question by moving to create elected re gional assemblies where there is demand, the deputy prime minister said it was time to consider new financial structures. He wants the prime minister, Tony Blair, to include plans for regional referendums to test the mood for elected assemblies in the first Queen's Speech of the next parliament. Stressing that English regionalism should form the centrepiece of constitutional reform in Labour's second term, he said: \"I don't think it will be at all credible not to have referendums in the next parliament.\" He said that the government had no plans to abolish county councils to make way for regional assemblies.

      "body": "<p>Outspoken entrepreneur Dan Wagner is understood to be exploring the possibility of breaking up his Bright Station technology business in a move that would lead to him taking a step back from the public company arena. </p> <p>Mr Wagner, Bright Station's chief executive and a 10% shareholder, is thought to be working on a plan that would see non-core businesses sold or closed and its knowledge management software division, Smartlogik, emerge as the focus of the new business. </p> <p>Smartlogik would run by its chief executive, Steve Hill - one of the founders of highly regarded US software firm Inktomi - and former National Grid chairman David Jefferies. </p> <p>Mr Wagner, who has endured a difficult relationship with the City, is then expected to quit as a director of the public company after many years of arguing that it is undervalued. Shares in Bright Station are trading close to a record low of 17p after having touched 220p a year ago. </p> <p>Mr Wagner might also use his resignation as an opportunity to make an offer to take private the non-core Bright Station businesses that he believes have long been undervalued by investors. </p> <p>Those include Sparza, an infrastructure business built around technology bought from collapsed e-tailer Boo.com and the remains of Bright Station's previous incarnation, Dialog. </p> <p>Smartlogik is seen as the firm's brightest prospect and had been lined up for a stock market flotation of its own in the early part of this year. However, market conditions turned against Bright Station, leaving the company with a dilemma on how best to extract value and visibility from it. </p> <p>Selling off Bright Station's other assets, leaving Smartlogik as a pure-play technology firm, would make it easier for analysts to value. Mr Wagner believes it could one day be as big as Autonomy, Britain's largest listed knowledge management firm. </p> <p>At the end of the year to December, Bright Station had about \u00a316m in the bank which the company says is enough to take it through to profitability. However, that cash would have to be spread across several different divisions and technologies, preventing star performers like Smartlogik from securing the investment that some insiders believe they need to allow them to fulfil their potential. </p> <p>Mr Wagner has struggled to win the City over ever since Dialog saddled itself with massive debts after buying the database arm of US newspaper group Knight Ridder. The firm was nicknamed \"Dial-a-dog\" and Mr Wagner was slated in the press. </p> <p>A spokesman for Bright Station last night refused to comment.</p>",

Mr Wagner, Bright Station's chief executive and a 10% shareholder, is thought to be working on a plan that would see non-core businesses sold or closed and its knowledge management software division, Smartlogik, emerge as the focus of the new business. Smartlogik would run by its chief executive, Steve Hill - one of the founders of highly regarded US software firm Inktomi - and former National Grid chairman David Jefferies. Mr Wagner, who has endured a difficult relationship with the City, is then expected to quit as a director of the public company after many years of arguing that it is undervalued. Shares in Bright Station are trading close to a record low of 17p after having touched 220p a year ago. Mr Wagner might also use his resignation as an opportunity to make an offer to take private the non-core Bright Station businesses that he believes have long been undervalued by investors. Those include Sparza, an infrastructure business built around technology bought from collapsed e-tailer Boo.com and the remains of Bright Station's previous incarnation, Dialog. Smartlogik is seen as the firm's brightest prospect and had been lined up for a stock market flotation of its own in the early part of this year. However, market conditions turned against Bright Station, leaving the company with a dilemma on how best to extract value and visibility from it. Selling off Bright Station's other assets, leaving Smartlogik as a pure-play technology firm, would make it easier for analysts to value. Mr Wagner believes it could one day be as big as Autonomy, Britain's largest listed knowledge management firm. At the end of the year to December, Bright Station had about \u00a316m in the bank which the company says is enough to take it through to profitability. However, that cash would have to be spread across several different divisions and technologies, preventing star performers like Smartlogik from securing the investment that some insiders believe they need to allow them to fulfil their potential. Mr Wagner has struggled to win the City over ever since Dialog saddled itself with massive debts after buying the database arm of US newspaper group Knight Ridder. The firm was nicknamed \"Dial-a-dog\" and Mr Wagner was slated in the press. A spokesman for Bright Station last night refused to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Blair, is today expected to swing the government behind a radical US-style regeneration scheme that will give the private sector a greater role in improving run-down towns and cities. The business improvement district scheme (Bids) is a new attempt by ministers to harness private sector money and expertise to work aimed at turning around run-down areas. Whitehall insiders say that private sector firms will be asked to vote on a package of specific improvements to their local area, such as new CCTV cameras or extra police officers. The council would then levy a charge on businesses to pay for the improvements. The policy was mooted in last year's local government finance green paper, in which ministers suggested creating Bids along three models. These included funding the improvement district through a supplementary business rate levied on some parts of an authority area, rather than all. Bids already exist on a voluntary basis, but the prime minister is set to promise legislation to give the arrangements a statutory basis as part of a major regeneration speech today. Local Government Association (LGA) policy officer Tony Rich said: \"We'd be in favour of more long-term funding for town improvement and town centre management. If this offers a way of doing that, it's a good thing.\" The proposals appear to be a partial repackaging of the government's plan to hand councils wider powers to levy a supplementary business rate, worth up to an extra 5%. Ministers appear to have dropped those plans in favour of Bids under strong pressue from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which believes the supplementary rate would have cost business some \u00a3750m. CBI chief Digby Jones said earlier this year that he backed moves to improve relationships between business and local government, but added: \"The government needs to recognise that bureaucracy and compulsion are not typical characteristics of successful partnerships.\" The CBI was unavailable for comment on whether it felt Bids would be more acceptable. Bids have been extremely successful in the United States, where they have helped to revitalise areas such as New York's Grand Central Station and Times Square. In US cities, however, the scheme is essentially corporate-led, with businesses generating their own proposals, which often involve cosmetic improvements, such as cleaning up graffiti, or security improvements. It is not yet clear to what extent business will lead UK schemes. There are 130 Bids in New York alone, and more than 1,000 across the US.",

We believe that a strong, developed and efficient telecoms infra structure is critical to ireland's competitive position and attraction as a business location.\" The consortium is believed to be considering an offer of about \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a31.7bn), compared with the \u20ac2.4bn offer eIsland is reported to have made. Eircom declined to comment although it is reported to look more sympathetically onMr O'Reilly's bid. His consortium said discussions with Eircom management were at an early stage. All three offers are conditional on the sale of Eircom's mobile phone division, Eircell, to Vodafone for about \u00a32.1bn. Shareholders meet to approve the sale next month. Mr O'Reilly, 64 and holder of an honorary British knight hood, is reportedly worth \u00a31.2bn. He ranked as Ireland's second-richest man in this year's Sunday Times rich list. Mr Desmond, 50, was fourth with \u00a3466m and Mr O'Brien, 42, ninth with \u00a3261m. Telia and KPN, the Swedish and Dutch telecoms firms, which together own 35% of Eircom through holding company Comsource, have said they are keen to sell. A buyer would need to convince Eircom's employees who hold 15% of the shares. Another 30% is held by institutional shareholders and 20% by retail investors who bought shares when the business was floated in 1999. Eircom shares climbed almost 4% yesterday to \u20ac2.69.",

As we hurtle towards a general election, the silly season will come early and Darwinian theory will be rewritten as what I call \"survival of the shrillest\". Or, at its worst, \"origin of the specious\". To be noticed by the media, let alone to be quoted, requires something truly new, fresh and interesting - or something very shrill. This latter point is especially true of political debate. The row over the Commission for Racial Equality's pledge rumbles on, pushing aside foot and mouth, China and the Middle East. The story isn't feeding off the many balanced and sensible responses but off the few shrill, accusatory and indignant voices on both sides of the argument. Any politician making a thoughtful weekend speech on this, or any issue of national or local importance, will find it difficult to be reported without eliciting some spicy prose. A shrill soundbite may come back to haunt them and maybe their party and it would almost certainly hijack any thought and hard work the politician put into the rest of the speech.

If you have some real, innovative news, the media will pick up on it if it is presented professionally.

Steve Fowler, the editor of What Car? said: \"We've been inundated with requests for further details of our Target Price and we expect to see a boost in magazine circulation - all for a fraction of the cost of a major advertising campaign.\" What then about being shrill and the \"origin of the specious\"?

      "body": "<p>An article in the London Evening Standard in 1953 launched the career of the television pioneer Doreen Stephens, who has died aged 88. Headlined \"They seek her here, they seek her there\", it described the fruitless search by the BBC to find an editor for its women's programmes department. </p> <p>\"There you are,\" said Doreen's husband, Dr Jack Gorsky, \"there's your career.\" At first, she did not take him seriously, but, on the basis of her involvement with women's issues in the 1940s and 50s, she was persuaded to apply. She started the job on her 41st birthday. </p> <p>Ten years later, Doreen was head of BBC Television's family programmes, and one of the first women to hold an executive position in the corporation. She spearheaded programmes which introduced cookery guru Fanny Cradock and keep- fit expert Eileen Fowler to viewers, as well as bringing in Playschool and Dougall in The Magic Roundabout for children. For two years, she was also president of the Women's Press Club. </p> <p>Early in the spring of 1967, she was invited by David Frost to join the new ITV company, London Weekend Television, at twice her BBC salary. At LWT, she had command of religious programmes, as well as those for children and women. She recalled that when Frost told her she would be responsible for religion, she clapped her hand to her head and said, \"Oh, God!\" \"Yes,\" Frost replied, \"you'll have to come to terms with Him.\" </p> <p>Doreen always said that her time at LWT was the best of her life, but it was cut short after only two years when she became involved in a dispute between the LWT board and its managing director Michael Peacock over the station's direction. Doreen was among the senior staff, including Frank Muir, who stood behind Peacock and resigned in protest at his departure. </p> <p>Doreen Stephens was born into a middle-class family in Hammersmith, west London. Family holidays were spent in France, where her father enjoyed the casinos. She was educated at a private boarding school in Folkestone, before attending finishing schools in Brussels and Wimbledon. </p> <p>In 1933, at the age of 19, she married a stockbroker, Richard Holden, with whom she had two children, though after five years she and Holden divorced. During the second world war, she worked as a medical assistant in the Red Cross, and, while helping in an underground air-raid shelter in London, met her second husband, Jacob \"Jack\" Gorsky. Enthralled by her personality and her fine collection of cigars - she loved to smoke them because of the smell - he proposed, and they married in 1942. </p> <p>With Gorsky's encouragement, Doreen took a diploma in social studies at London University, winning the Goldchrist Medal for her thesis on the national health service. She joined the Liberal party in 1944, and stood as a candidate in North Hackney in the general election the following year. Although not elected, she was one of the few Liberals who did not lose their deposit. </p> <p>The same year she became involved in two organisations working for women's equality: the Married Women's Association, which argued for women's opportunities outside the domestic sphere, and the Equal-Pay-For-Equal Work Organisation, run by Thelma Cazalet. For the next seven years, Doreen campaigned for women's equality, writing magazine and newspaper articles, and giving talks around the world. In 1950, she became president of the Women's Liberal Federation. </p> <p>Following her departure from LWT, she ran television training courses for religious personalities, and, in 1976, organised the first world conference on religious television, in Jerusalem. In the mid-1970s, she became vice-chair of the board of governors at Raynes Park high school for boys. </p> <p>Doreen Stephens was a woman ahead of her time. Everyone who knew her talked of her zest for life and sense of fun, an attitude shared by her husband. Once, when shown a photograph of himself with \"Miss Stephens\" - Doreen always used her maiden name at work - he replied: \"Oh yes, I sleep with her occasionally.\" </p> <p>Doreen's final years were clouded by dementia, but she fought it more than most and continued to frequent her favourite restaurants in a wheelchair. Her husband died in 1961; she is survived by her son and daughter. </p> <p>\u0095 Doreen Marjorie Gorsky (n\u00e9e Stephens), television executive, born October 12 1912; died March 20 2001</p>",

Enthralled by her personality and her fine collection of cigars - she loved to smoke them because of the smell - he proposed, and they married in 1942. With Gorsky's encouragement, Doreen took a diploma in social studies at London University, winning the Goldchrist Medal for her thesis on the national health service. She joined the Liberal party in 1944, and stood as a candidate in North Hackney in the general election the following year. Although not elected, she was one of the few Liberals who did not lose their deposit. The same year she became involved in two organisations working for women's equality: the Married Women's Association, which argued for women's opportunities outside the domestic sphere, and the Equal-Pay-For-Equal Work Organisation, run by Thelma Cazalet. For the next seven years, Doreen campaigned for women's equality, writing magazine and newspaper articles, and giving talks around the world. In 1950, she became president of the Women's Liberal Federation. Following her departure from LWT, she ran television training courses for religious personalities, and, in 1976, organised the first world conference on religious television, in Jerusalem. In the mid-1970s, she became vice-chair of the board of governors at Raynes Park high school for boys. Doreen Stephens was a woman ahead of her time. Everyone who knew her talked of her zest for life and sense of fun, an attitude shared by her husband. Once, when shown a photograph of himself with \"Miss Stephens\" - Doreen always used her maiden name at work - he replied: \"Oh yes, I sleep with her occasionally.\" Doreen's final years were clouded by dementia, but she fought it more than most and continued to frequent her favourite restaurants in a wheelchair. Her husband died in 1961; she is survived by her son and daughter. \u0095 Doreen Marjorie Gorsky (n\u00e9e Stephens), television executive, born October 12 1912; died March 20 2001",

      "bodyText": "William Hague's personal popularity has fallen sharply among Conservative supporters in the past three weeks despite his attempts to make capital out of the foot and mouth crisis. The April Guardian/ICM poll published today shows that the Tory leader's personal support among Conservative voters has fallen 11 points since the end of March - a devastating blow, particularly on the eve of a general election campaign. The combination of a race row in which the Tories have been seen as a party out of control and continuing speculation over its future leadership have badly damaged Mr Hague's standing. Three weeks ago, 60% of Tory voters named Mr Hague as the best prime minister for Britain in the last Guardian/ICM poll. But that has fallen to 49%. Most Conservatives now say that if they vote for the party, it will be despite William Hague's leadership. The scale of the problem facing the Conservative leader is underlined by the ICM poll finding that Labour has emerged politically unscathed by the foot and mouth outbreak. The 14 point lead, which Tony Blair enjoyed before the farm crisis, has remained intact. Today's ICM survey puts Labour on 47% (down 2), the Conservatives on 33 (down 1) and the Liberal Democrats on 14 (up 1). Using the ICM \"variometer\" which takes account of regional swings in voting patterns, these figures would give Labour an overall majority of 165 if there were a general election tomorrow with Labour on 412 seats, the Tories picking up seats from the Liberal Democrats with an estimated 192 MPs and Charles Kennedy's party down from 47 MPs to only 25. This continuing evidence of such a solid and substantial Labour lead begs the question of why should Tony Blair delay calling the general election much longer. The principal virtue of June 7 is that it will be on the same day as the delayed local government elections. Mr Blair's commanding position among Labour voters with 82% naming him as the best prime minister for Britain contrasts sharply with William Hague's stark lack of support among his party's voters. Charles Kennedy's position among Liberal Democrat voters is even weaker with 27% naming Tony Blair as their preferred prime minister - the same proportion who think Mr Kennedy would do the best job. Even among Conservative voters, 16% are say they think Mr Blair makes the best prime minister. The resilience of the Labour vote is also shown by the polling data on specific questions about the foot and mouth crisis. Although 56% of voters are unimpressed by the government's performance in the crisis, the Tories and Liberal Democrats failed to make any greater impression on the voters. Conservative voters show a distinct lack of faith in the Tories' performance on foot and mouth, with only 49% of Tory voters saying it is the best party to deal with the problem. Only 19% of Liberal Democrat voters named their party as the best to deal with the issue. Although Mr Kennedy's party, with its targeted seats strategy, is expected to outperform its opinon poll ratings, these figures show the foot and mouth crisis may have been very damaging as so many of its 47 seats are in the affected areas in the south west, mid-Wales and the Scottish borders. ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,005 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between April 20 - 22. Interviews were conducted across the country and have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

The doctors' organisation also warned that the hardening of attitudes towards asylum seekers and the introduction of the dispersal system and voucher scheme have exacerbated their health problems in Britain. A BMA handbook, the Medical Profession and Human Rights, published yesterday says the rise in the number of asylum seekers coming to Britain means that doctors are having to treat torture victims for the first time. More than 5,000 torture victims entered the country last year. Although initial problems of GPs refusing to put asylum seekers on to their lists by turning away people with very poor English or only taking them as temporary patients have diminished, asylum seekers have been cut off from support and advice from existing refugee community groups. Doctors have struggled to cope with the needs of \"vulnerable people arriving without warning, planning or language support services\", says the BMA report. The doctors are concerned, with the increase of highly infectious diseases such as drug resistant tuberculosis, about the risk to public health if those coming into the country do not receive adequate health screening when they arrive. \"Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding and insufficient staff in UK port medical units, this examination may only be cursory, thereby undermining its effectiveness,\" the report says. It urges that every refugee and asylum seeker should undergo a thorough medical examination on arrival. \"The individual's consent should be sought and the examinee should also be aware that the purpose of the medical assessment is primarily for the protection of the public,\" says the report. Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA's head of health policy and research, said screening was \"very patchy\" and there was a separate ethical issue of asylum seekers being given HIV tests without their consent. The report highlights difficulties faced by torture victims who are dispersed outside London getting the specialist treatment they need. It says that the voucher system leads asylum seekers to bulk buy and rely on tinned, processed foods, which has damaged their health. Some even fail to get enough food as the vouchers provided are worth only 70% of income support levels. The doctors also raised concerns about the health of the increasing number of asylum seekers detained in prisons.",

      "bodyText": "Plans to separate Montenegro from Yugoslavia were set back yesterday by general election results showing the pro and anti-independence groups neck and neck. President Milo Djukanovic's coalition emerged from the polls on Sunday with a three-seat majority in parliament but too small a share of the popular vote for a convincing win in the referendum on the country's future status it proposed during the election campaign. The result brought an immediate resumption of pressure from the international community for Montenegro to stay in the federal republic. The officials results showed that the \"Victory belongs to Montenegro\" coalition had won just over 42% of the vote. Its opponents, who fought under the banner \"Together for Yugoslavia\", confounded the opinion polls by coming just 2% behind. Some polls had suggested that it would get just over a quarter of vote. Supporters of both groups claimed victory and were celebrating on the streets of the capital, Podgorica, into the early hours ofyesterday, waving flags and firing guns in the air. The election was fought entirely on the issue of independence. Montenegro and Serbia are the last remaining states in the present-day Yugoslav federation. The result has forced Mr Djukanovic's partners to reconsider their plans to hold a referendum on independence as soon as possible. \"We need some more time. Some of our calculations have proved wrong, there is a victory for the independence, but it is not very convincing,\" said Dragisa Burzan, the former deputy prime minister. Nevertheless the referendum, initially planned for July, may go ahead, because the partner Mr Djukanovic's party needs to form a government, the Liberal Alliance, is committed to breaking away from Yugoslavia as soon as possible. Without its support the coalition will not have a working majority in parliament. Foreign diplomats used the results to warn the govern ment against holding a referendum so soon, and urged it to resume a dialogue with Serbia about their relationship in the Yugoslav federation. Gerard Stoudman, representing the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe, said: \"What is sure, what we find is ... there is no clear mandate for or against [independence].\" \"There is a very clear split. This should be understood as a clear message to both those that who want to rush to independence as well as Belgrade. There is a need for a serious discussion in good faith to resolve the outstanding issues.\" . That message is likely to be reinforced by the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who is visiting Podgorica tomorrow. Western diplomats fear that Montenegro's pursuit of inde pendence will give added impetus to other separatists in the region, most notably in Kosovo. Mr Stoudman warned that it would also increase tension in Montenegro itself. \"The risk is that there will be a very heated campaign, and that people will be frustrated whatever the results.\" He suggested that by focusing on independence Mr Djukanovic had neglected the voters' real concerns. \"They did not implement much of what they had promised when they were last elected. People are fed up with corruption. This was a vote of no confidence in the present coalition.\" Sweden, as president of the EU, also urged the resumption of talks with Belgrade.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Our attention is drawn to an intriguing entry on the latest list of Britain's 50 \"least loved\" public companies, drawn up by accountants RSM Robson Rhodes. Topping the table of stockmarket ugly ducklings - firms that have failed to attract investor interest despite posting astonishing earnings growth - is marketing group Incepta, owner of financial PR firm Citigate. Concerned for the future of our good friends the City spin doctors, we call and inquire why investors have been spurning Incepta. If a company's share price remains sluggish while revenues rocket, we ask (mentioning no names, so as not to cause upset), surely it would be childish and unfair to point the finger of blame at those responsible for the firm's PR? Alas, we are wrong. \"If that was the case,\" insists Citigate's Patrick Donovan (who, by happy coincidence, used to write on these pages), \"questions would have to be asked: Are there things that are not being explained to the analysts? Or not getting through to the financial media?\" Questions which may yet come back to haunt him. </p> <p>\u0095 By way of a postscript to the unseemly parading of Croesus-like wealth through the pages of the Sunday Times' rich list supplement at the weekend, we note a largely overlooked press release from Gold Group International. While others privileged to receive a ranking continue to maintain the charade that they would rather die than actively draw attention their beloved bank balances, Gold Group chairman David Gold offers a refreshingly candid approach. \"Champagne will be popping on publication of this year's list,\" promises the release. \"David started his working life selling buttons on a stall outside his East End home ... Last year he was placed 78th on the list - where will he be this year?\" (Joint 82nd, it transpires). Gold is \"easily worth over \u00a3370m with brother Ralph,\" we are told, and now resides in one of Surrey's \"premier mansions, set in 50 acres of park land\". Nor, it appears, does Gold care to mask the nature of his business interests - in 1981 his tired mail order \"adult entertainment\" business was revitalised after his daughter Jacqueline persuaded him to back her Ann Summers chain. Let us hope some of the rich list's more reserved entrants learn a promotional trick or two from Gold next year. </p> <p>\u0095 Our campaign to raise the profile of Noel Edmond's video-conferencing firm VMC continues to founder. Last week, you may recall, the former leviathan of light entertainment wrote to us insisting he would be \"delighted to unashamedly promote VMC\" through the Guardian - an offer we graciously accepted. After giving the project much thought over the weekend, an ingenious promotional extravaganza came to us in the small hours of Sunday night - and yesterday we rang Devon to tell Nicky, Noel's personal assistant, the news. \"She's in with Noel at the moment,\" says a woman called Sue. \"Can she call you back?\" We can wait, Noel, but can VMC afford to? We shall return to this tomorrow. </p> <p>\u0095 So to the promised extract from the Harvard Business Review website. HBR, you will recall, offers \"an elite corps of top managers\" advice on \"honing your leadership skills ... how to lead when there is no one to ask ... and the difference between 'leaders' and 'managers'.\" Our chosen vignette is a short but perceptive piece, entitled Ego Makes the Leader - part of HBR's excellent series of Breakthrough Ideas for Today's Business Agenda. \"By looking deeply into executives' psyches, we are beginning to unlock the enigma of leadership,\" HBR reveals. \"While there will never be a single recipe for successful corporate stewardship, an understanding of the human ego can shed light on leadership's most fundamental components.\" Marvellous stuff.

For further insight, an annual subscription to HBR costs just $165. simon.bowers@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Shareholders and directors arriving for insurance group CGNU's annual meeting today will be confronted with images of South Africans suffering from asbestos-related illnesses in the latest example of activists targeting a high-profile institutional investor. CGNU's Norwich Union arm is being targeted because it is a big shareholder in Cape plc, a UK-based company which mined asbestos in South Africa during the apartheid era and is involved in a long-running legal battle over compensation claims from miners and residents. Campaign group Action for Southern Africa (Actsa) is calling on Norwich Union to exercise its shareholder muscle by publicly calling on Cape to end the legal wrangle and swiftly settle the claims. Members of the London-based campaign group will be joined by representatives from the South African National Union of Mineworkers, and plan to hold a demonstration at the Barbican in London today during which they will \"line the route\" with protesters holding up giant-size photographs of South African asbestos victims and the \"devastation\" they claim was caused by Cape's operations. To mark an international memorial day for asbestos workers, shareholders will also be handed flowers in remembrance of the South Africans who have died, said a spokeswoman for the group. As shareholders, Actsa and the South African NUM representatives plan to question the Norwich board at the annual meeting. Norwich Union holds about 2% of Uxbridge-based Cape's shares. The company ceased asbestos mining in South Africa in 1979 and has been involved in a legal battle which was taken up by more than 3,000 South African miners and residents claiming asbestos poisoning. Last summer the former employees of Cape won the right to sue for damages in the British courts when the House of Lords overturned a court of appeal decision against them. Actsa said that as a \"socially responsible investor\" it expected Norwich Union \"to take a bolder position than other institutional shareholders and join the campaign to see justice delivered\". The group is likely to highlight a pledge made by CGNU earlier this year that it would bring ethical criteria to the fore across the entire \u00a3200bn that it manages.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It must be hard being a \"legendary improviser\". How do you reconcile a life devoted to the avoidance of repetition with a 50-year career and back catalogue? \"I've always treated what I do as a work in progress,\" says Sonny Rollins, the 70-year-old saxophonist who makes a rare appearance in Britain on Saturday. </p> <p>Yet a legend Rollins undoubtedly is, and for good reasons. Just one of the true stories to have become Rollins folklore concerns his tendency to improvise unaccompanied on the tenor sax for an hour or more without preparation, written music, repetition or pauses for breath any longer than the minimum necessary to sustain life. </p> <p>As an aside to his music, yet also an intimate part of it, Rollins has at times been given to all manner of sartorial and theatrical detours, including playing nightclub gigs in dangling-cork outback hats, raincoats and Mohican haircuts, stepping out of cabs and into venues while already playing, or continuing to blow into the small hours to long-departed audiences. Summoned to Britain in the 1960s to compose the score for the movie Alfie, Rollins arrived with a single stave of written music. When Ronnie Scott asked how the musicians should treat the work, Rollins replied, \"Lightly.\" </p> <p>Try as you might, it's hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about Rollins, and his modesty is as renowned as his achievements. One British publicist who accompanied him on an earlier trip here was astonished to discover that he refused meals in upmarket restaurants, talked mainly about his steady home life (he lives on a farm in Germantown, outside New York, with his wife, Lucille) and displayed an unexpectedly intimate familiarity with the plotline of EastEnders. </p> <p>Some more of the stuff of legend: Rollins grew up with Thelonious Monk for a childhood friend, Miles Davis for one of his first bandleaders, and John Coltrane for a tenor-sax sparring partner. And though he no longer plays nightclubs or experiments as impulsively with his wardrobe, Rollins still produces a glow of awe with his worldwide performances. Now in his 70s, he will still play furious two-hour sets, whirling impulsively in and out of old songs he hasn't played for years. He has a perfect memory for music he has heard, however far back, and can haul it - intact or in bits - into the most headlong improvisations on the fly. </p> <p>He was raised Theodore Walter Rollins in Harlem and its environs in the 1930s, with the most successful black musicians of the day - including Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins - living around the corner. Monk gave him lessons in harmony and unorthodox melody (by osmosis rather than formal instruction), and Davis was a regular partner between 1949 and 1954. From the late 1950s onwards, Rollins has almost always run his own show. </p> <p>\"I was the youngest of my siblings,\" he recalls of his Harlem childhood, in his deep, creaking drawl, \"and I would often stay with my uncle and his girlfriend. She was from Georgia, so she liked all those country blues guys like Arthur Crudup and Lonnie Johnson - mostly guitar and vocals. But she also liked Louis Jordan. My older brother was a classical violinist and my sister played piano in church. But I liked jazz.\" </p> <p>Jordan, a popular 1940s alto saxophonist influenced by jazz and rhythm and blues, is widely credited as a vital element in the chemistry that led to rock'n' roll. \"I consider myself fortunate to have been born in Harlem then,\" Rollins says, \"because it was always jumping with music. I remember Jordan performing in a venue on my way to elementary school. I implored my mother to get me a saxophone - I guess I was about nine. Then we moved to a more affluent area, Sugar Hill. It was where a lot of the successful black musicians and showbusiness people lived - Hawkins and Ellington, Jimmy Rushing, Red Allen. You saw them in the street, very glamorous people. They made a big impact on us.\" </p> <p>In high school, Rollins led a group that included the fiery alto player Jackie McLean, pianist Kenny Drew and drummer Art Taylor. It was the kind of talented circle of enthusiastic young musicians that was bound to go places and, by the late 1940s, all of them were working with celebrities they had idolised from a distance such a short while before. Rollins rehearsed with his pianist neighbours Monk and Bud Powell during 1948, toying with new harmonic and structural ideas, and the following year began to work in clubs with Davis. He was starting to develop a characteristic sound: a mixture of the stately weightiness of Hawkins, the intensity and speed of Parker and the lyrical whimsicality of Lester Young. </p> <p>But Rollins was also picking up some darker habits from the New York jazz scene - and, like Davis at much the same time, a blossoming career was suspended by the need to find the time, space and mental energy to combat the bebop scene's familiar temptation: hard drugs. \"When I wanted to play jazz music as a little kid in Harlem, I didn't know anything about drugs,\" Rollins says. \"I just had this spark to play from really early on, and I'm fortunate that I've never lost it. Writers like to associate drugs with the jazz scene, but that's nothing to do with it really. Drugs are part of the things we all have to deal with, the booby traps of living. If you take drugs or you drink whisky in the hope of elevating yourself, it may seem to be relevant to who you really are, but it isn't.\" </p> <p> Rollins has wrestled with physical temptations a good deal in his life, and, from the 1960s tried to take exercise, control his eating and avoid the hellraising after-hours agenda of the stereo typical touring musician. He has also subjected himself to several long layoffs from music - to take on personal demons, study ways of becoming a better improviser, sidestep music-industry pressures and, for a while in the late 1960s, study Buddhism in the far east. </p> <p>Rollins says these layoffs were, more often than not, \"brought about by things in my life that weren't to do with music, about trying to survive as a human being. Underneath, they were all tied to the creative musical thing, of course. But when I studied in the east for two years around 1969, which was part of trying to deal with what seemed to me a hostile environment, I found it illuminated the real meaning of my musical life. I found I could see that part of myself much more clearly.\" </p> <p>What does he mean by \"hostile environment\"? \"Tribalism, competition. And of course, though I hate to always bring in race - and it can be overdone to the point where it doesn't mean anything - it's very hard growing up in a minority, an untouchable caste. You go through life wrapped in the skin of an untouchable, and you have to find some way to come to terms with it. I don't want to overstate this ...\" (Rollins becomes briefly uncomfortable, as if he has overstepped some boundary related to his relaxed, freewheeling, onstage creative status.) </p> <p>\"I've been lucky enough to travel all over the world in my work and discover how much we all have in common. And the racial thing has perhaps prepared me to fight other demons. Being able to get away from my habits - drinking, smoking, overeating - prepared me in a sense for the colossal struggle of life. Music is my way of living - but I'm still striving for complete enlightenment, and getting to be a better person. That seems to me what life is about. We're not put here to eat ice cream, compete with each other, and then die. Life is a struggle. And when people ask if my social and class status as I was growing up were a handicap, I say they helped me. I believe in reincarnation. I've lived through other times and maybe it's helped me know certain things about right and wrong I didn't know in earlier lives.\" </p> <p>Of all the famous jazz musicians who have preceded him, Rollins counts the troubled, ethereally gifted saxophonist Lester Young as perhaps the most affecting and significant of his idols. It becomes clear that Young's inner struggles, as well as his method of improvising, based on lighting endless new melodies on the fag-ends of preceding ones, are among the reasons for this empathy. </p> <p>\"To use one of his own expressions,\" Rollins says, \"Lester Young was 'bruised by life'. Others were more like ordinary guys. Hawkins was very self-assured, but it didn't make him any less an artist. And some people show more bravado, although that isn't necessarily how they feel. People made a lot of Miles's habit of turning his back on the audience and all that, called it arrogant - but it came from shyness.\" </p> <p>Who does he feel more akin to? \"Lester Young,\" comes the answer after a pause. \"There's a fine line between sensitivity and vulnerability, and a lot of people tread it, but for artists that's where their work comes from. But I don't want to make too much of this. If you have a conscience, and a consciousness, what you do is like a task, governed by that golden rule - do unto others as you would have them do unto you. </p> <p>\"I hope it's reflected in my music. I've never thought of music as a straight line: it's something ... else. It's an ideal out there, beyond you. Gee, Sonny's playing a long time, people sometimes say. But to me it just means there's something out there, and I know I have to find it. But it's just what I do. We're all footsoldiers, but it's never a drudgery to me. It's my joy.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It must be hard being a \"legendary improviser\". How do you reconcile a life devoted to the avoidance of repetition with a 50-year career and back catalogue? \"I've always treated what I do as a work in progress,\" says Sonny Rollins, the 70-year-old saxophonist who makes a rare appearance in Britain on Saturday. Yet a legend Rollins undoubtedly is, and for good reasons. Just one of the true stories to have become Rollins folklore concerns his tendency to improvise unaccompanied on the tenor sax for an hour or more without preparation, written music, repetition or pauses for breath any longer than the minimum necessary to sustain life. As an aside to his music, yet also an intimate part of it, Rollins has at times been given to all manner of sartorial and theatrical detours, including playing nightclub gigs in dangling-cork outback hats, raincoats and Mohican haircuts, stepping out of cabs and into venues while already playing, or continuing to blow into the small hours to long-departed audiences. Summoned to Britain in the 1960s to compose the score for the movie Alfie, Rollins arrived with a single stave of written music. When Ronnie Scott asked how the musicians should treat the work, Rollins replied, \"Lightly.\" Try as you might, it's hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about Rollins, and his modesty is as renowned as his achievements. One British publicist who accompanied him on an earlier trip here was astonished to discover that he refused meals in upmarket restaurants, talked mainly about his steady home life (he lives on a farm in Germantown, outside New York, with his wife, Lucille) and displayed an unexpectedly intimate familiarity with the plotline of EastEnders. Some more of the stuff of legend: Rollins grew up with Thelonious Monk for a childhood friend, Miles Davis for one of his first bandleaders, and John Coltrane for a tenor-sax sparring partner. And though he no longer plays nightclubs or experiments as impulsively with his wardrobe, Rollins still produces a glow of awe with his worldwide performances. Now in his 70s, he will still play furious two-hour sets, whirling impulsively in and out of old songs he hasn't played for years. He has a perfect memory for music he has heard, however far back, and can haul it - intact or in bits - into the most headlong improvisations on the fly. He was raised Theodore Walter Rollins in Harlem and its environs in the 1930s, with the most successful black musicians of the day - including Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins - living around the corner. Monk gave him lessons in harmony and unorthodox melody (by osmosis rather than formal instruction), and Davis was a regular partner between 1949 and 1954. From the late 1950s onwards, Rollins has almost always run his own show. \"I was the youngest of my siblings,\" he recalls of his Harlem childhood, in his deep, creaking drawl, \"and I would often stay with my uncle and his girlfriend. She was from Georgia, so she liked all those country blues guys like Arthur Crudup and Lonnie Johnson - mostly guitar and vocals. But she also liked Louis Jordan. My older brother was a classical violinist and my sister played piano in church. But I liked jazz.\" Jordan, a popular 1940s alto saxophonist influenced by jazz and rhythm and blues, is widely credited as a vital element in the chemistry that led to rock'n' roll. \"I consider myself fortunate to have been born in Harlem then,\" Rollins says, \"because it was always jumping with music. I remember Jordan performing in a venue on my way to elementary school. I implored my mother to get me a saxophone - I guess I was about nine. Then we moved to a more affluent area, Sugar Hill. It was where a lot of the successful black musicians and showbusiness people lived - Hawkins and Ellington, Jimmy Rushing, Red Allen. You saw them in the street, very glamorous people. They made a big impact on us.\" In high school, Rollins led a group that included the fiery alto player Jackie McLean, pianist Kenny Drew and drummer Art Taylor. It was the kind of talented circle of enthusiastic young musicians that was bound to go places and, by the late 1940s, all of them were working with celebrities they had idolised from a distance such a short while before. Rollins rehearsed with his pianist neighbours Monk and Bud Powell during 1948, toying with new harmonic and structural ideas, and the following year began to work in clubs with Davis. He was starting to develop a characteristic sound: a mixture of the stately weightiness of Hawkins, the intensity and speed of Parker and the lyrical whimsicality of Lester Young. But Rollins was also picking up some darker habits from the New York jazz scene - and, like Davis at much the same time, a blossoming career was suspended by the need to find the time, space and mental energy to combat the bebop scene's familiar temptation: hard drugs. \"When I wanted to play jazz music as a little kid in Harlem, I didn't know anything about drugs,\" Rollins says. \"I just had this spark to play from really early on, and I'm fortunate that I've never lost it. Writers like to associate drugs with the jazz scene, but that's nothing to do with it really. Drugs are part of the things we all have to deal with, the booby traps of living. If you take drugs or you drink whisky in the hope of elevating yourself, it may seem to be relevant to who you really are, but it isn't.\" Rollins has wrestled with physical temptations a good deal in his life, and, from the 1960s tried to take exercise, control his eating and avoid the hellraising after-hours agenda of the stereo typical touring musician. He has also subjected himself to several long layoffs from music - to take on personal demons, study ways of becoming a better improviser, sidestep music-industry pressures and, for a while in the late 1960s, study Buddhism in the far east. Rollins says these layoffs were, more often than not, \"brought about by things in my life that weren't to do with music, about trying to survive as a human being. Underneath, they were all tied to the creative musical thing, of course. But when I studied in the east for two years around 1969, which was part of trying to deal with what seemed to me a hostile environment, I found it illuminated the real meaning of my musical life. I found I could see that part of myself much more clearly.\" What does he mean by \"hostile environment\"? \"Tribalism, competition. And of course, though I hate to always bring in race - and it can be overdone to the point where it doesn't mean anything - it's very hard growing up in a minority, an untouchable caste. You go through life wrapped in the skin of an untouchable, and you have to find some way to come to terms with it. I don't want to overstate this ...\" (Rollins becomes briefly uncomfortable, as if he has overstepped some boundary related to his relaxed, freewheeling, onstage creative status.) \"I've been lucky enough to travel all over the world in my work and discover how much we all have in common. And the racial thing has perhaps prepared me to fight other demons. Being able to get away from my habits - drinking, smoking, overeating - prepared me in a sense for the colossal struggle of life. Music is my way of living - but I'm still striving for complete enlightenment, and getting to be a better person. That seems to me what life is about. We're not put here to eat ice cream, compete with each other, and then die. Life is a struggle. And when people ask if my social and class status as I was growing up were a handicap, I say they helped me. I believe in reincarnation. I've lived through other times and maybe it's helped me know certain things about right and wrong I didn't know in earlier lives.\" Of all the famous jazz musicians who have preceded him, Rollins counts the troubled, ethereally gifted saxophonist Lester Young as perhaps the most affecting and significant of his idols. It becomes clear that Young's inner struggles, as well as his method of improvising, based on lighting endless new melodies on the fag-ends of preceding ones, are among the reasons for this empathy. \"To use one of his own expressions,\" Rollins says, \"Lester Young was 'bruised by life'. Others were more like ordinary guys. Hawkins was very self-assured, but it didn't make him any less an artist. And some people show more bravado, although that isn't necessarily how they feel. People made a lot of Miles's habit of turning his back on the audience and all that, called it arrogant - but it came from shyness.\" Who does he feel more akin to? \"Lester Young,\" comes the answer after a pause. \"There's a fine line between sensitivity and vulnerability, and a lot of people tread it, but for artists that's where their work comes from. But I don't want to make too much of this. If you have a conscience, and a consciousness, what you do is like a task, governed by that golden rule - do unto others as you would have them do unto you. \"I hope it's reflected in my music. I've never thought of music as a straight line: it's something ... else. It's an ideal out there, beyond you. Gee, Sonny's playing a long time, people sometimes say. But to me it just means there's something out there, and I know I have to find it. But it's just what I do. We're all footsoldiers, but it's never a drudgery to me. It's my joy.\"",

      "bodyText": "Israel is facing punitive measures from the EU because of hardening and widening opposition to its policies towards the Palestinians, diplomats said last night. Violence continued yesterday with a Palestinian boy killed at a funeral in Gaza and four injured in a car bomb explosion in Israel. EU member states, including Britain, are now actively debating changing their approach to the Jewish state, with decisions expected at two key foreign ministers' meetings next month. France is leading a campaign to suspend Israel's prized association agreement with the EU, which gives it preferential trade terms worth millions of dollars. A more likely result will be a crackdown on Israel's flouting of EU \"rules of origin\" under which goods produced in occupied territories have been illegally benefiting from duty free access. The EU is also likely to cold -shoulder Israeli attempts to secure enhanced cooperation in science and technology. In the latest in a series of signals that it cannot be business as usual with the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, Brussels last week issued an angry condemnation of Israeli attacks on both Syria and Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has insisted that the statement was one-sided, and warned that the EU is in danger of losing what little influence it has. Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, and Chris Patten, external relations commissioner, are being targeted by Israel to persuade them to adopt a softer line. In the past Israel has been defended in the EU by traditional friends such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain, but it now has few defenders left, even in Germany, where public opinion wants to see action. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, yesterday met the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in the West Bank town, Ramallah. Mr Michel, whose government is next in line for the European presidency, angered the Israeli government two months ago by threatening EU sanctions. In a significant development, Mr Arafat said afterwards: \"I want to be very clear. We are against any operation targeting civilians, whether they are Israelis or Palestinians.\" Israeli army radio said it had been the first condemnation by the Palestinian leader since the uprising began in September. The Israeli government also took a tentative step towards renewing the peace process, but there was little optimism on either side. Mr Sharon's government yesterday said it was still considering a Jordanian-Egyptian peace plan under which Israel would lift its economic embargo of the West Bank and Gaza in return for the Palestinians ending their attacks on Israel and Jewish settlements. The 12-year-old Palestinian killed yesterday, Muhanad Muhareb, died at a funeral near the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. The funeral was of a Palestinian security man killed in fighting with the Israelis last week. Palestinian witnesses said that as the body was being lowered to the ground, Palestinian gunmen fired a 21-gun salute, prompting fire either from an Israeli army outpost or the Jewish settlement it was guarding.

      "bodyText": "Ukraine's worst political crisis since independence seems certain to lead to the collapse of Viktor Yushchenko's government this week. After a week of backroom plotting, MPs said yesterday that they would call for a vote of no-confidence in the government today. Since a resolution condemning the government's policies was was carried by 283 votes to 65 last week, there is little doubt that the MPs will vote to bring down Mr Yushchenko, despite his public popularity. But President Leonid Kuchma told reporters during a visit to Lithuania yesterday that he would do what he could to help work out a compromise between the government and parliament. For the past six months Ukraine has been rocked by street protests, violence, and political sackings as President Kuchma confronted allegations that he ordered the murder of an opposition journalist, Georgiy Gongadze, and rigged elections. As the crisis has deepened, Mr Yushchenko, who was appointed by Mr Kuchma and was once his ally, has emerged as a potential rival for the presidency should Mr Kuchma ultimately bow to the pressure and resign. Mr Yushchenko and the former deputy prime minister Yuliya Tymoshenko are becoming the most formidable alternatives to the hardline Mr Kuchma. Ms Tymoshenko was sacked in January and investigated for embezzlement, and has spent weeks alternating between hospital and prison, turning her into an anti-Kuchma martyr. Mr Yushchenko, a former central banker, is the sole remaining figure of substance in Kiev to enjoy the support of the west, and his departure will be taken as a strong signal that Ukraine, after years of seeking to edge out of the post-Soviet orbit and into Nato's central European embrace, is sidling back into a Moscow alliance. In recent months Mr Kuchma and President Vladimir Putin of Russia have intensified contacts and increased cooperation. The EU's foreign policy supremos, Chris Patten and Javier Solana, have been alarmed by the situation in Ukraine during recent visits to Kiev, and frustrated in their attempts to bring pressure to bear on Mr Kuchma. Later this week the Council of Europe, whose human rights committee has denounced political repression and persistent human rights abuses in Ukraine, will debate the committee's call for its expulsion. If carried, it will be the first expulsion in the council's 51-year history, and a blow to Ukrainian pride. Mr Kuchma has hitherto distanced himself from the battle to decide Mr Yushchenko's fate, leaving it to the communists who dominate parliament and oppose Mr Yushchenko's reforms to call the no-confidence vote. Mr Yushchenko's dismissal has the support of several smaller parties run by influential industrialists who, like their Russian counterparts, have become immensely rich and fear that Mr Yushchenko's economic reforms will jeopardise their control of key industries. The vote could bring further street clashes between the security forces and the tens of thousands calling for the president's resignation or impeachment for Gongadze's murder. Clandestine recordings of conversations in the presidential office, tapes which Mr Kuchma says have been doctored, show the president requesting action against Gongadze and ordering close aides to deliver the vote in the poll for his second term. About 3,000 protesters rallied outside parliament last week in support of Mr Yushchenko, and bigger protests are expected this week. The prime minister appears to be calculating that his political prospects will be enhanced by cutting his ties with the Kuchma regime and spearheading the opposition.",

But finally the net is beginning to tighten around the man they call the Accountant.  <B>Rory Carroll</B>  reports.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For a supposedly stupid man, Bernardo Provenzano chose a fine day to go on the run. He vanished into hills baked brown and hard, perfect for hiking, with a breeze to cool the sun. There was the occasional shepherd to break the loneliness among citrus trees and olive groves. It was September 18 1963.</p> <p>Dozens of people were being shot, bludgeoned, strangled, sliced and drowned in the mafia war ravaging Sicily. In Corleone the graveyard was smack in the centre of town, and Provenzano did his bit to fill it. Wherever he passed, people were cut down - so they called him the Tractor.</p> <p>\"He shoots like an angel but has the brains of a chicken,\" said his boss, and Provenzano seemed to fit the bill: a peasant's son who had left school aged 10, he was chunky, taciturn and slow. Some said he killed too many, others that he killed not enough. Either way, there were enough enemies made and left alive to threaten Provenzano, so he fled.</p> <p>To survive on the run required cunning, as betrayal came with a smile. Many Corleone fugitives never returned from the hills. Their bones would turn up, if at all, years later under a plough. It seemed only a matter of time before Provenzano's corpse became a footnote in the history of Cosa Nostra. But now, 37 years later, the police are still looking for him.</p> <p>In the meantime, Bernardo Provenzano has come far. While eluding an army of pursuers, Italy's most wanted man has climbed to the top of the Cosa Nostra. He is still in the hills, which now bristle with electronic listening equipment, roadblocks and spies. Helicopters, dawn raids of farmhouses, reward money: the state has tried them all, and failed.</p> <p>Beneath the concrete arches at the entrance to Palermo's justice ministry lounge Carabinieri police officers. Submachine guns dangle from shoulders, eyes swivel at newcomers passing through electronic scanners. From this fortress, magistrates have battled the mafia for decades. In theory, they are safe here from assassins' bombs and bullets.</p> <p>By 9pm corridors are deserted, but behind oak doors some magistrates remain, hunched over documents and computers, murmuring into phones and filling ashtrays. They feel close to success. They think the near-mythical godfather, the strategist who rescued the mafia from catastrophe and rebuilt it in his image, is near capture.</p> <p>One by one, Provenzano's lieutenants have been snared in recent months and Pier Luigi Vigna, Italy's national anti-mafia prosecutor, is bullish: \"We are close to the capture of Provenzano.\"</p> <p>The country hopes so. Under Provenzano, now 68, the mafia has become leaner, fitter and slyer, returning to its roots while innovating new crimes. Belatedly, the penny has dropped: the Tractor is highly intelligent, shrewd and calculating. He has a new nickname - il Ragioniere - the Accountant.</p> <p>The last-known photo was taken in 1959: a serious youth with brilliantined hair wearing a suit for a saint's festival. Today, say informers, he is frail and bald, save for white tufts above his ears. They say his skin is the colour of milk from consecutive months in boltholes.</p> <p>\"Provenzano is extremely powerful and extremely dangerous. He is in contact with all the clans and calls the shots,\" says Giuseppe Cipriani, the mayor of Corleone. Police believe he spends most of his time in western and central Sicily, flitting to safe houses in an endless game of cat and mouse.</p> <p>From some snow-capped peaks, ferries can be seen trailing foam from the capital, Palermo. Provenzano - known as Binnu to friends - shuns telephones and faxes as too risky. His empire is run through cryptic, handwritten notes transported by key aides. There are occasional visits and very occasional summits with clan leaders, but otherwise the godfather is a hermit. Or a ghost. So low did he lie that for years investigators thought he was dead.</p> <p>The one fixed reference point is his family. After several years abroad, thought to be Germany or Switzerland, his wife, Saveria, and sons Angelo, 25, and Paolo, 20, moved back to Corleone in April 1992.</p> <p>Four letters to the godfather were intercepted by police in January, yielding gossip about business, health, relationships and advice to wash socks in cold water. \"My beloved sweetheart,\" Saveria called him. She also promised to send a fleece jacket and snow trousers. Cue a police stampede to the frozen slopes of Mount Cammarata. No Binnu.</p> <p>Ever since it gave its name to Mario Puzo's fictional godfather, fact and fiction have collided in the cobbled alleys of Corleone. Perched high, 60km south of Palermo, it is from here that the Cosa Nostra spread mayhem and bloodlust across Sicily.</p> <p>It is not difficult to find Saveria, now in her late 50s. She lives in a four-storey block above a car dealer's shop. Below the bell, in small black letters: Provenzano. Beside the bell: an entryphone. There is a long pause before the adult female voice answers. \"You want a chat?\" I ask. Laughter. \"No, no, nothing to say. Bye bye.\" Another three rings elicit only silence.</p> <p>Less than a mile away, in Piazza Santa Maria, is the family's latest enterprise: a launderette named Splend-Or. The last two letters are in gold, a pun since or is Italian for gold. Fiddling the switches of a giant red washer-drier is a tubby, handsome man wearing rimless glasses, jeans, jumper and check shirt: Angelo. He looks astonished to be asked for an interview, but recovers swiftly. \"Thanks but no thanks, I'm not interested.\" Pressed, he repeats the formula three times.</p> <p>In one of the intercepted letters, he complained of the laundry business being slack. According to a group of teenage girls, that was because he charged twice that of his only rival, Pinguini. \"A pity, he's very cute,\" said one.</p> <p>Provenzano's rise is encrusted with myth, but some things are known. Born to peasants, he and his friend Toto Riina became assassins for a rising boss, Luciano Liggio. Pumping 112 bullets into the black Fiat containing, Michele Navarra, a rival in Corleone, established them as the trinity of terror by 1958. They then moved down the valley to take on the Palermo clans, unleashing a war of extermination in which Provenzano was convicted in absentia of multiple murders.</p> <p>By the 80s, Riina was the undisputed boss of bosses, with Provenzano as his deputy. It was a path to dictatorship paved with 800 corpses, and very much a double-act, says Roberto Scarpinato, a leading anti-mafia magistrate. \"Riina was the military boss, Provenzano the businessman.\"</p> <p>A skilled mediator, Provenzano persuaded clans to restructure, ditching a pyramidal hierarchy for a cell-type system where no one was to know more than two other mobsters. When someone was arrested, or turned informer, the damage could be contained. \"Binnu was the tugboat who towed us to safety,\" one informer reportedly said.</p> <p>Strategy was changed. Cosa Nostra melted back into the shadows, resolving internal disputes peacefully, where possible, and no longer challenging the state. It concentrated on infiltrating public-work contracts, racketeering and smuggling. The result was quiet, lucrative days for the mafia, said the former mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando.</p> <p>The Accountant has approved forays into electronic and internet fraud. Profits are recycled into legitimate ventures, especially construction, waste-disposal and retailing. But according to Lucio Violante, speaker of the senate, the biggest scam is yet to come. \"In the next six years there will be L16,600bn (\u00a35.3bn) invested in the Sicilian region. Do we want a Sicily in which the economic power ends up in the hands of Cosa Nostra?\"</p> <p>Hundreds of police, sometimes thousands, comb an area no bigger than 200sq miles. They cannot pass through the smallest hamlet without being noted by a Provenzano spy. Sting after sting has failed, for their prey is said to have the instincts of a wild animal. \"He can smell danger,\" said one detective.</p> <p>The godfather sends lieutenants to appointments and drops in on colleagues when not expected. His self-discipline is said to be awesome. \"He can stay in a room for six months without poking his nose out,\" said the detective.</p> <p>Botched operations have been blamed on squabbling between law-enforcement agencies. Some suspect Provenzano has an informer of his own. Generations of police officers have come and gone, predicting his imminent capture. But his time may be running out. Jailed bosses, desperate to improve harsh conditions, are negotiating with prosecutors. Handing over Binnu could be an ace.</p> <p>Provenzano has become dispensable, a liability even. Under his command, a new generation of university-educated, sophisticated bosses have emerged. Power is devolved. \"Provenzano is no dictator; he is a mediator. He builds consensus, but he doesn't control everything,\" says Scarpinato.</p> <p>Thanks to Provenzano's reforms, Cosa Nostra is flexible and versatile. Though he is still the boss, the organisation's future is no longer entwined with his. Were he to be caught tonight, it would sail on, say magistrates.</p> <p>Italy's fascination with the Accountant, and the government's decision to stake credibility on catching him, risks pushing the mafia back into the limelight. His arrest would suit everyone. The odds are turning against him, and now we will find out just how smart is Bernardo Provenzano.</p>",

The most common chorus at the end of last year's games, sung to the tune of an old grandfather clock chiming the hour, went very simply like this: \"PAS-TOR-EL-LO, VAF-FAN-CU-LO.\" </p> <p>\"When I bought the team we were in Serie B,\" Pastorello says shaking his head. \"The following year we won the division. Last season we finish 10th in Serie A. Why should they hate me?\" </p> <p>I field a few ideas: because he tends to get players on loan for a year rather than buy them. The fans feel they have no loyalty to the club. Because when he does own a good player he sells him the moment some other team shows interest. </p> <p>Pastorello sighs. \"These are the realities of provincial football. The big seven clubs run a deficit ranging from 50 to 130bn lire a year. I can't afford to do that. I can't put success on the pitch before a healthy balance sheet. The fans can't hate me for that.\" </p> <p>But they do hate him. </p> <p>\"I loath Pastorello,\" someone calling himself Lo Scaligero writes to the Hellas website, \"almost as much as I hate the Neapolitans.\" These are strong words. The Scaligeri were the family who ruled an independent and prosperous Verona in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. To call yourself Lo Scaligero is nostalgia on a grand scale. It was a time when Neapolitans weren't even known to be loathed. </p> <p>Pastorello's disastrous relationship with the Verona fans came to a head at the end of last season. With huge banners telling him to fuck off, he decided to do just that. The club had finished the season with the right to play for a place in Europe. Il presidente renounced that right, sold half the team and put the club up for sale. \"I'd had enough,\" he tells me, \"I couldn't bear it.\" </p> <p>Again the move didn't win him any friends. The greatest of the Scaligeri family was the so-called Can de la Scala - Dog of the Ladder. Though he died in 1329, in early September of 2000 his namesake was alive and well and writing to Hellas Verona: \"Hellas isn't your (shitty) company, Pastorello. It's us who suffer every time the Bentegodi's gates swing open. Hellas is a feeling, it's a faith. Not a cheque to stick in your filthy wallet.\" </p> <p>The nicknames and the rhetoric suggest the truth of the matter. For the fans, football is a re-enactment of medieval rival ries, city against city, Scaligeri versus Visconti, Medici versus Sforza. It's a scenario that puts the presidente in a role unimaginable in British football. For what the fans demand of Agnelli in Turin, Berlusconi in Milan, and even of Pastorello in Verona, is that they play the part of Can de la Scala, or Lorenzo the Magnificent. And these great men didn't sell out their dynasties from one day to the next. </p> <p>But nor did Pastorello sell Hellas Verona. For it soon turned out that nobody wanted to buy it.

      "body": "<p>In New Zealand, few sportsmen have been mourned as will be Bert Sutcliffe, who has died of emphysema, aged 77. With his neat built and golden, wavy hair - and invariably capless - he was the embodiment of class, and, for a decade or more after the war, gave his country's cricket a star player, just when it was suffering a crisis of credibility.</p> <p>The first name of Bert, chosen by parents who had emigrated from Lancashire, was a touch too artisan for his world-class talents. Like many left-handers, his strokes seemed to glitter, but he was also among the most reliable of opening batsmen, a virtue based not only on technique but also on a temperament often described as \"sunny\". There was great artistry, and an absence of artistic temperament. He was unaffected by success, good-humoured and reliable. His countrymen were enchanted.</p> <p>Another formidable New Zealand left-hander, Martin Donnelly (Obituary, October 26 1999), once said: \"If I had to pick a team from all the players I saw, my openers would be Hutton and Bert Sutcliffe. He was the one player we had who could truly be compared to Bradman.\"</p> <p>In fact, it was the great English batsman Wally Hammond, who made 227 and 336 in just two Test innings in New Zealand in 1933, that kindled the ambition of the 10-year-old Sutcliffe. Fourteen years later, a 1946 Test at Christchurch marked the last Test for one, and the first for the other. Hammond made 79, Sutcliffe 58 - the debutant contributing to a 133-run opening stand that ensured a more than honorable draw.</p> <p>That was a relief for New Zealanders, following a thrashing the year before, when Australia dismissed them for 42 and 54. Thus, Sutcliffe became a central figure in his country's rehabilitation. When New Zealand toured England in 1949, the visitors contributed strongly to a batsmen-dominant series, Sutcliffe finishing with a remarkable tour tally of 2,627 and an average of nigh-on 60.</p> <p>A PE instructor by profession, he was blessed with a fitness that seems to have come easily to those who played their cricket in another age. Perhaps it came from a more balanced life. That was demonstrated in his biggest innings, in 1952. Not out 215 on the Saturday, he enjoyed - as always - an evening at the piano, leading the singing. On the Sunday, a rest day, he played two and half rounds of golf - 45 holes. Back to cricket on Monday, he went on to reach 380. Even now, it is the 10th biggest score ever made.</p> <p>Sutcliffe scored 44 centuries in all, averaging 47 in first-class cricket and 40 in Test matches. More memorable still was his central role in one of Test cricket's most dramatic episodes. On Boxing Day 1953, at Johannesburg's Ellis Park, hostile bowling on a grassy wicket caused all of New Zealand's batsmen to be hit - none more badly than Sutcliffe, who, yet to score, ducked into a bouncer. He collapsed on the pitch, and again after reaching hospital.</p> <p>Against all expectation, he returned, with the score at 81 for six. Head swathed in bandages, his face described as being \"like parchment\", he immediately went on the attack, and rapidly scored 80 (out of 112), including seven sixes and four fours. Drama was piled on drama when the last man, the fast bowler Bob Blair, made an unexpected appearance; overnight, his fianc\u00e9e had died in New Zealand's biggest rail disaster.</p> <p>He too hit a six, adding to three from Sutcliffe in a single over from Hugh Tayfield which cost 25. The crowd was in joyful turmoil until Blair fell, stumped, and the two departed the field arm-in-arm.</p> <p>It was said that Sutcliffe never again played fast bowling with quite the same confidence. But there was no diminution of his authority against spin. In India in 1955-56, he made an undefeated 230 - his highest Test score - and, in that series, he scored 611 runs at an average of 87.</p> <p>Ten years later, he was picked for another tour to India; his experience, it was felt, was needed in a young and inexperienced party. He had not played Test cricket for six years, but, at Calcutta, he batted for a day and a half to make 151. To younger players, the conditions were decidedly foreign, with temperatures around 100 degrees - and a very noisy crowd. But Bert was imperturbable, at 41. And affable. But for that, his young teammates would have held him in even greater awe.</p> <p>He leaves his wife Norma, a son and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Bert Sutcliffe, cricketer, born November 17 1923; died April 20 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "In New Zealand, few sportsmen have been mourned as will be Bert Sutcliffe, who has died of emphysema, aged 77. With his neat built and golden, wavy hair - and invariably capless - he was the embodiment of class, and, for a decade or more after the war, gave his country's cricket a star player, just when it was suffering a crisis of credibility. The first name of Bert, chosen by parents who had emigrated from Lancashire, was a touch too artisan for his world-class talents. Like many left-handers, his strokes seemed to glitter, but he was also among the most reliable of opening batsmen, a virtue based not only on technique but also on a temperament often described as \"sunny\". There was great artistry, and an absence of artistic temperament. He was unaffected by success, good-humoured and reliable. His countrymen were enchanted. Another formidable New Zealand left-hander, Martin Donnelly (Obituary, October 26 1999), once said: \"If I had to pick a team from all the players I saw, my openers would be Hutton and Bert Sutcliffe. He was the one player we had who could truly be compared to Bradman.\" In fact, it was the great English batsman Wally Hammond, who made 227 and 336 in just two Test innings in New Zealand in 1933, that kindled the ambition of the 10-year-old Sutcliffe. Fourteen years later, a 1946 Test at Christchurch marked the last Test for one, and the first for the other. Hammond made 79, Sutcliffe 58 - the debutant contributing to a 133-run opening stand that ensured a more than honorable draw. That was a relief for New Zealanders, following a thrashing the year before, when Australia dismissed them for 42 and 54. Thus, Sutcliffe became a central figure in his country's rehabilitation. When New Zealand toured England in 1949, the visitors contributed strongly to a batsmen-dominant series, Sutcliffe finishing with a remarkable tour tally of 2,627 and an average of nigh-on 60. A PE instructor by profession, he was blessed with a fitness that seems to have come easily to those who played their cricket in another age. Perhaps it came from a more balanced life. That was demonstrated in his biggest innings, in 1952. Not out 215 on the Saturday, he enjoyed - as always - an evening at the piano, leading the singing. On the Sunday, a rest day, he played two and half rounds of golf - 45 holes. Back to cricket on Monday, he went on to reach 380. Even now, it is the 10th biggest score ever made. Sutcliffe scored 44 centuries in all, averaging 47 in first-class cricket and 40 in Test matches. More memorable still was his central role in one of Test cricket's most dramatic episodes. On Boxing Day 1953, at Johannesburg's Ellis Park, hostile bowling on a grassy wicket caused all of New Zealand's batsmen to be hit - none more badly than Sutcliffe, who, yet to score, ducked into a bouncer. He collapsed on the pitch, and again after reaching hospital. Against all expectation, he returned, with the score at 81 for six. Head swathed in bandages, his face described as being \"like parchment\", he immediately went on the attack, and rapidly scored 80 (out of 112), including seven sixes and four fours. Drama was piled on drama when the last man, the fast bowler Bob Blair, made an unexpected appearance; overnight, his fianc\u00e9e had died in New Zealand's biggest rail disaster. He too hit a six, adding to three from Sutcliffe in a single over from Hugh Tayfield which cost 25. The crowd was in joyful turmoil until Blair fell, stumped, and the two departed the field arm-in-arm. It was said that Sutcliffe never again played fast bowling with quite the same confidence. But there was no diminution of his authority against spin. In India in 1955-56, he made an undefeated 230 - his highest Test score - and, in that series, he scored 611 runs at an average of 87. Ten years later, he was picked for another tour to India; his experience, it was felt, was needed in a young and inexperienced party. He had not played Test cricket for six years, but, at Calcutta, he batted for a day and a half to make 151. To younger players, the conditions were decidedly foreign, with temperatures around 100 degrees - and a very noisy crowd. But Bert was imperturbable, at 41. And affable. But for that, his young teammates would have held him in even greater awe. He leaves his wife Norma, a son and two daughters. \u0095 Bert Sutcliffe, cricketer, born November 17 1923; died April 20 2001",

Jane Andrews hit Thomas Cressman, a businessman, on the head with a cricket bat and stabbed him through the chest with a kitchen knife in the bedroom of their west London flat, the Old Bailey heard. Andrews, 34, was alleged to be angry after discovering that Mr Cressman, 39, had been exchanging suggestive emails with a woman in Las Vegas.

My polls indicate that these issues - that a fragmented system would be less safe, less efficient and more expensive - have been communicated successfully, with two out of three Londoners opposing the government's plan to break up the system. After Hatfield and other tragedies on the national railways, the public regards the differences between Bob Kiley and the government over unified management of the system as anything but \"arcane\". Your claim that last year I \"as good as condoned violence\" on the May Day protests is also totally false. I spent the three weeks before May Day urging people not to go on the anarchist protests for the same reasons as I am urging people not to go this year. I am urging everyone who has the slightest sympathy with any of the stated objectives of the May Day Monopoly protesters not to attend the action on May 1. You assume that I harbour ambitions for national office. Far from harbouring other ambitions, I am standing down from parliament at the election. I am more than happy occupying an office with the largest electorate in Europe, other than the presidents of France and Portugal! Ken Livingstone Mayor of London",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Two-year-old Liam Stephen Blood nestles into his mother's shoulder. \"Sit on mummy's knee,\" he murmurs. It's tea time and he's tired out after an afternoon of serious play with his doting grandma. Liam loves to be read bedtime stories before he dozes off in his bright blue nursery. But he's still too young to be told the dramatic tale of his mother's extraordinary fight for the right to bear him and the obstacles she had to overcome to bring him into the world.</p> <p>In February 1995, Diane Blood's husband, Stephen, contracted bacterial meningitis. He quickly fell into a coma and was put on a life support machine. The couple, who had been sweethearts since their teens and married for four years, had started trying for a baby and Diane thought - mistakenly, as it happened - that she might be pregnant already. But, taking no chances, she asked doctors if sperm could be taken from her 30-year-old husband before the life support machine was switched off, and they agreed. Just months before, she said, the couple had come across a magazine article about a widow impregnated with her dead husband's sperm, and he had told her that he wanted her to have his baby if she was ever in the same situation.</p> <p>Four days after he was stricken with meningitis he was dead. But for his shocked and grieving young widow there was a new blow: the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates artificial insemination services in Britain, refused to allow her to try to conceive a child with Stephen's sperm. He hadn't given written consent and hadn't had the opportunity to be counselled, as required by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.</p> <p>In 1996, Diane remortgaged the modest, comfortable bungalow in Worksop that she had shared with Stephen to finance a high court battle against the HFEA. After the Guardian broke her story, opinion polls revealed that nine out of 10 people supported her case, and many sent cheques to her fighting fund. But the legal ground was uncharted and if she lost the bill would be huge. She was to spend the next two years on an emotional rollercoaster of successes and setbacks before finally winning through against daunting odds.</p> <p>Naturally private and reticent, she found it hard to lay bare the intimate details of her relationship with Stephen, and gratefully stepped out of the limelight after the appeal court ruled that, under European law, she could take his sperm to Belgium for IVF treatment. For more than two years after her son's birth no journalist was allowed to cross her threshold. Only now, with a new crusade to fight, has she has moved reluctantly back into the public arena.</p> <p>On Liam's birth certificate a line is drawn through the space for his father's name, as if his paternity was unknown. Because the toddler was conceived after his father's death, the law will not allow Stephen to be named on his birth certificate. Tomorrow a private member's bill to change the law will reach its committee stage in the Commons. It will still have to have to pass its third reading and report stages there and go through the Lords before parliament prorogues for the election. Diane has no reason to think that the bill, which has government support, will meet opposition, but she is anxious about the limited time remaining for it to reach the statute book.</p> <p>Critics accused her of trying to re-create her dead husband, but Liam is himself and resembles neither parent. (\"Except he's got Stephen's eyes, or at least his eyelashes,\" notes his mother. \"Stephen had lovely, lovely long eyelashes.\") Clearly a secure and confident child with both sets of grandparents actively involved in his life, he seems in little danger of the maternal suffocation that some predicted for him.</p> <p>With plenty of family help, Diane carries on her small advertising and PR business, mainly working from home. At 34, she has not ruled out remarriage, but says she still \"feels the warmth\" of her relationship with Stephen. Enough sperm was taken to make it \"medically possible\" to give Liam a brother or sister. Will she have another go? \"My thoughts on that, one way or the other, are private. But I'm not pregnant,\" she quickly adds.</p> <p>The last time round, she was fighting implacable opposition from the HFEA. She initially lost her case in the high court, which ruled that she could not lawfully be inseminated in Britain. Her hopes were raised when the authority agreed to reconsider exercising its discretion to let her take the sperm to another country. But a letter from the British Medical Association's ethics committee chairman urged it to stand firm, and her hopes were dashed again.</p> <p>She ultimately won in the court of appeal, though the ruling established that the storage of sperm taken without the man's written consent is illegal. Diane just squeezed through the door, but others are barred from the route she took.</p> <p>\"The one thing that's different this time is no one's opposing me,\" she says. \"The opposition to this bill is apathy. That's why I'm speaking now - no other reason.\" The government accepted last year that the law should be changed to allow a father's name to appear on the birth certificate of a child conceived after his death. Tony Clarke, the Labour MP for Northampton South, was encouraged to take forward a private member's bill. Unusually for UK legislation, the change will be retrospective, benefiting around 30 children conceived in Britain after their fathers' deaths. The other fathers had agreed in writing that their sperm could be frozen for future use by their partners.</p> <p>Diane and Liam, along with another mother and child, were at the Commons last month when the bill received its second reading with only six minutes to spare, and she knows the timetable is tight. \"The government made us the promise that we would have the law this term. If for some reason it wasn't fulfilled I would be totally devastated, not least because of the emotional highs and lows I have gone through just to get this far. All of that would have been for nothing.\" Clarke gives the bill a 60% chance of getting through this time.</p> <p>Diane's aim is to ensure that the law is passed before Liam is old enough to ask why his birth certificate shows his father as unknown. He points to photographs of Stephen and says, \"That's Daddy,\" but at the moment he seems to have only a vague idea what a father is. \"He knows what other people's daddies are. He has looked at our wedding album with most interest and he knows that's Mummy and Daddy.

      "bodyText": "Two-year-old Liam Stephen Blood nestles into his mother's shoulder. \"Sit on mummy's knee,\" he murmurs. It's tea time and he's tired out after an afternoon of serious play with his doting grandma. Liam loves to be read bedtime stories before he dozes off in his bright blue nursery. But he's still too young to be told the dramatic tale of his mother's extraordinary fight for the right to bear him and the obstacles she had to overcome to bring him into the world. In February 1995, Diane Blood's husband, Stephen, contracted bacterial meningitis. He quickly fell into a coma and was put on a life support machine. The couple, who had been sweethearts since their teens and married for four years, had started trying for a baby and Diane thought - mistakenly, as it happened - that she might be pregnant already. But, taking no chances, she asked doctors if sperm could be taken from her 30-year-old husband before the life support machine was switched off, and they agreed. Just months before, she said, the couple had come across a magazine article about a widow impregnated with her dead husband's sperm, and he had told her that he wanted her to have his baby if she was ever in the same situation. Four days after he was stricken with meningitis he was dead. But for his shocked and grieving young widow there was a new blow: the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates artificial insemination services in Britain, refused to allow her to try to conceive a child with Stephen's sperm. He hadn't given written consent and hadn't had the opportunity to be counselled, as required by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. In 1996, Diane remortgaged the modest, comfortable bungalow in Worksop that she had shared with Stephen to finance a high court battle against the HFEA. After the Guardian broke her story, opinion polls revealed that nine out of 10 people supported her case, and many sent cheques to her fighting fund. But the legal ground was uncharted and if she lost the bill would be huge. She was to spend the next two years on an emotional rollercoaster of successes and setbacks before finally winning through against daunting odds. Naturally private and reticent, she found it hard to lay bare the intimate details of her relationship with Stephen, and gratefully stepped out of the limelight after the appeal court ruled that, under European law, she could take his sperm to Belgium for IVF treatment. For more than two years after her son's birth no journalist was allowed to cross her threshold. Only now, with a new crusade to fight, has she has moved reluctantly back into the public arena. On Liam's birth certificate a line is drawn through the space for his father's name, as if his paternity was unknown. Because the toddler was conceived after his father's death, the law will not allow Stephen to be named on his birth certificate. Tomorrow a private member's bill to change the law will reach its committee stage in the Commons. It will still have to have to pass its third reading and report stages there and go through the Lords before parliament prorogues for the election. Diane has no reason to think that the bill, which has government support, will meet opposition, but she is anxious about the limited time remaining for it to reach the statute book. Critics accused her of trying to re-create her dead husband, but Liam is himself and resembles neither parent. (\"Except he's got Stephen's eyes, or at least his eyelashes,\" notes his mother. \"Stephen had lovely, lovely long eyelashes.\") Clearly a secure and confident child with both sets of grandparents actively involved in his life, he seems in little danger of the maternal suffocation that some predicted for him. With plenty of family help, Diane carries on her small advertising and PR business, mainly working from home. At 34, she has not ruled out remarriage, but says she still \"feels the warmth\" of her relationship with Stephen. Enough sperm was taken to make it \"medically possible\" to give Liam a brother or sister. Will she have another go? \"My thoughts on that, one way or the other, are private. But I'm not pregnant,\" she quickly adds. The last time round, she was fighting implacable opposition from the HFEA. She initially lost her case in the high court, which ruled that she could not lawfully be inseminated in Britain. Her hopes were raised when the authority agreed to reconsider exercising its discretion to let her take the sperm to another country. But a letter from the British Medical Association's ethics committee chairman urged it to stand firm, and her hopes were dashed again. She ultimately won in the court of appeal, though the ruling established that the storage of sperm taken without the man's written consent is illegal. Diane just squeezed through the door, but others are barred from the route she took. \"The one thing that's different this time is no one's opposing me,\" she says. \"The opposition to this bill is apathy. That's why I'm speaking now - no other reason.\" The government accepted last year that the law should be changed to allow a father's name to appear on the birth certificate of a child conceived after his death. Tony Clarke, the Labour MP for Northampton South, was encouraged to take forward a private member's bill. Unusually for UK legislation, the change will be retrospective, benefiting around 30 children conceived in Britain after their fathers' deaths. The other fathers had agreed in writing that their sperm could be frozen for future use by their partners. Diane and Liam, along with another mother and child, were at the Commons last month when the bill received its second reading with only six minutes to spare, and she knows the timetable is tight. \"The government made us the promise that we would have the law this term. If for some reason it wasn't fulfilled I would be totally devastated, not least because of the emotional highs and lows I have gone through just to get this far. All of that would have been for nothing.\" Clarke gives the bill a 60% chance of getting through this time. Diane's aim is to ensure that the law is passed before Liam is old enough to ask why his birth certificate shows his father as unknown. He points to photographs of Stephen and says, \"That's Daddy,\" but at the moment he seems to have only a vague idea what a father is. \"He knows what other people's daddies are. He has looked at our wedding album with most interest and he knows that's Mummy and Daddy. But who knows what's in the mind of a two-year-old?\" says Diane. \"I applied for a passport for him and you had to fill in the father's details. Because you have to send it accompanied by the birth certificate, I had to put that his father was unknown, so I was asked to lie. \"I was told that at one school in Worksop the mothers were asked to bring the birth certificates to school on the first day because there have been problems when mothers have tried to put their children into school early. Imagine how I'd feel if I was told I had to send Liam on his first day of school with his birth certificate. \"This situation he's in is something I took on board before he was born, but he didn't. It's now why I feel it ought to be fought for, because it's for him and I realised it might be important for him. Is it the government putting some kind of rubber stamp on what I did? My answer to that is that it doesn't matter what you think of what I did. How can you penalise my son because you happen to think that what I did was wrong?\" When Stephen died, the chances that Diane would ever hold his son or daughter in her arms looked small, but luck and her own determination were on her side. \"The odds were certainly very remote, particularly when you divided all the probabilities: were they going to be able to get the sperm successfully, would the sperm be OK, were we going to win the court case, and then was I going to be medically successful, because the chances were only 20%.\" When Liam was born prematurely, there was more trauma to endure. He was unable to breathe on his own and had to go into intensive care. A few months later, Diane wrote: \"I am painfully aware that few people can be as lucky as me to hold the title 'mother'.\" What made her so determined? \"I had to know that I'd done everything I possibly could. In what I took on there was no way I could lose, because even if I'd lost the legal case I'd have still done everything I could possibly do. To me the only way to lose is to give up. The alternative was going through the rest of my life thinking that if I'd gone this route or if I'd done that, would we have won?\"",
