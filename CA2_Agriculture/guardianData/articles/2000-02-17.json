It was disappointing for it all to end as it did, and I would have loved to have carried on, but I can be philosophical. The memories are still there.\" </p> <p>Taylor says he was merely a victim of Howard Wilkinson's desire, as the FA's technical director, to reform the structure of the English game and exert more control over the under-21s. \"I've got a lot of respect for Howard [Wilkinson],\" he says. \"The under-21s fell under his brief and he had his own plans for how he wanted things to progress.

      "body": "<p>This week marks the first anniversary of the publication of the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, whose murderers were never brought to justice. What progress has been made in implementing the report's 70 recommendations? Sadly, the picture is a grim one, littered with broken promises, inaction and reticence.</p> <p>Sir William Macpherson and his inquiry panel stated \"we hope and expect that implementation of our recommendations will ensure that the opportunity for radical thinking and root and branch action is seized. Nothing less will satisfy us, and all those who so passionately spoke to us during our hearings\".</p> <p>But there has been very little feedback from the government about what steps they are taking towards implementation. There are working parties, advisory groups and, even for that matter, a task force involved. Yet so far, no public report has been issued. Surely, at very least, the public is entitled to know how many targets have so far been achieved?</p> <p>The core finding of the Macpherson report was that of \"institutional racism\" defined as \"unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people\". The commissioner of the metropolitan police, Sir Paul Condon, staunchly and steadfastly resisted this conclusion .</p> <p>But on the back of this finding the inquiry recommended \"that the full force of the race relations legislation should apply to all police officers\".</p> <p>The panel plainly wanted the \"full force\" to apply to indirect systemic racism as much as to direct, overt racism. The race relations amendment bill, however, did not do this until the very day on which the home secretary was faced with defeat in the House of Lords. The government's attitude thus far does not sit well with all its heartfelt declarations about race.</p> <p>Daily policing too remains largely untouched: Stephen Lawrence's father, Neville, and his cousin were subsequently stopped by police and questioned about their car. And one of the Lawrence inquiry panelists, Bishop John Sentanu, was stopped and ordered to open the boot of his car. There was no good reason for suspecting the bishop of committing any offence.</p> <p>In 1998 and 1999 black people were six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people (compared to five times in 1998). This disparity resulted in specific recommendations in the Macpherson report. If implemented, number 61 would have entitled the bishop to a copy of the record of why he was stopped and searched.</p> <p>There is still an unwillingness to recognise the existence and incidence of racial crime. This attitude is perhaps exemplified in the first investigation into the murder of Michael Menson, the initial investigation into the death of Ricky Reel and, currently, it would appear, the racial harassment surrounding the McGowan hangings.</p> <p>Other specific and far-reaching Macpherson recommendations included : \"Victims or victims' families should be allowed to become civil parties to criminal proceedings, to facilitate and to ensure the provision of all relevant information to victims or their families.\" This is currently the position in France.</p> <p>Moreover, it was suggested that the crown prosecution service ensure that a victim or victim's family should be kept informed of any proposal to discontinue proceedings, that decisions to discontinue any prosecution should be carefully and fully recorded in writing, and that normally decisions should be disclosable to the family. At all times the family should be personally informed with speed and sensitivity.</p> <p>In the matter of inquests, the report suggested that there should be advance disclosure of evidence and documents, as of right, to parties and that consideration should be given to extending legal aid to victims, or their families. Importantly, it was also suggested that police complaints authority reports could be disclosed to complainants, subject only to a \"substantial harm\" test.</p> <p>Yet one year on and we are no nearer the implementation of even these proposals.</p> <p>The most crucial aspect concerning any police investigation is freedom of information. The home secretary has not incorporated into the FoI bill the obvious and clear recommendation put forward by Macpherson that any such act should apply to all areas of policing, both operational and administrative, subject only to the \"substantial harm\" test for withholding disclosure.</p> <p>Not only has this test been watered down to merely \"causing prejudice\", and Jack Straw, needless to say without consultation, has recently added a new power to ban the release of any public documents; but also clauses 28 and 29 expressly exempt the police and law enforcement agencies. Therefore, Doreen and Neville Lawrence would face very similar difficulties today in their hunt for the truth as they had to face in the past.</p> <p>It is perhaps ironic that the only proposal that has been actively and positively pursued by the government in the last year is one that was not, in fact, proposed by any of the parties to the Lawrence inquiry and that did not receive detailed examination and debate. Sir William Macpherson did, however, suggest that consideration be given to ending the double jeopardy rule to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is presented.</p> <p>In the circumstances of the Lawrence case where the original investigation was so dilatory and defective, and where five suspects have behaved in public with arrogance and aggression, it is perfectly understandable that the panel would feel an urgent desire to enable the prosecuting authorities to pursue those responsible. Yet we must be extremely careful to guard against letting emotion sweep away some of the basic tenets of criminal jurisprudence .</p> <p>If an investigating authority is allowed a \"second bite of the cherry\" we run the risk that, in order to obtain convictions, the police may resort to the activities that bedevilled so many of the miscarriage of justice cases of the 1980's. For example \"confession evidence\" may be said to have been discovered for the first time after an acquittal, relating either to conversations with cell-mates, prison officers or, perhaps, passing police officers. Or evidence \"overlooked\" at the scene of a crime may suddenly emerge for the first time. So, with the exception of this one flawed proposal, the excellent framework so assiduously laid out in the Macpherson Report remains to be implemented. No doubt the government hopes that if enough time passes the detail will be lost in the wash.</p> <p>Yet a groundswell of public opinion demands action. Victims of racial crime, and their families, must be confident that they will be acknowledged, respected and consulted throughout the dark days of their grief. A failure to act betrays them as much as it betrays the memory of Stephen.</p> <p>\u0095 Michael Mansfield QC is president of the National Civil Rights Movement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week marks the first anniversary of the publication of the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, whose murderers were never brought to justice. What progress has been made in implementing the report's 70 recommendations? Sadly, the picture is a grim one, littered with broken promises, inaction and reticence. Sir William Macpherson and his inquiry panel stated \"we hope and expect that implementation of our recommendations will ensure that the opportunity for radical thinking and root and branch action is seized. Nothing less will satisfy us, and all those who so passionately spoke to us during our hearings\". But there has been very little feedback from the government about what steps they are taking towards implementation. There are working parties, advisory groups and, even for that matter, a task force involved. Yet so far, no public report has been issued. Surely, at very least, the public is entitled to know how many targets have so far been achieved? The core finding of the Macpherson report was that of \"institutional racism\" defined as \"unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people\". The commissioner of the metropolitan police, Sir Paul Condon, staunchly and steadfastly resisted this conclusion . But on the back of this finding the inquiry recommended \"that the full force of the race relations legislation should apply to all police officers\". The panel plainly wanted the \"full force\" to apply to indirect systemic racism as much as to direct, overt racism. The race relations amendment bill, however, did not do this until the very day on which the home secretary was faced with defeat in the House of Lords. The government's attitude thus far does not sit well with all its heartfelt declarations about race. Daily policing too remains largely untouched: Stephen Lawrence's father, Neville, and his cousin were subsequently stopped by police and questioned about their car. And one of the Lawrence inquiry panelists, Bishop John Sentanu, was stopped and ordered to open the boot of his car. There was no good reason for suspecting the bishop of committing any offence. In 1998 and 1999 black people were six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people (compared to five times in 1998). This disparity resulted in specific recommendations in the Macpherson report. If implemented, number 61 would have entitled the bishop to a copy of the record of why he was stopped and searched. There is still an unwillingness to recognise the existence and incidence of racial crime. This attitude is perhaps exemplified in the first investigation into the murder of Michael Menson, the initial investigation into the death of Ricky Reel and, currently, it would appear, the racial harassment surrounding the McGowan hangings. Other specific and far-reaching Macpherson recommendations included : \"Victims or victims' families should be allowed to become civil parties to criminal proceedings, to facilitate and to ensure the provision of all relevant information to victims or their families.\" This is currently the position in France. Moreover, it was suggested that the crown prosecution service ensure that a victim or victim's family should be kept informed of any proposal to discontinue proceedings, that decisions to discontinue any prosecution should be carefully and fully recorded in writing, and that normally decisions should be disclosable to the family. At all times the family should be personally informed with speed and sensitivity. In the matter of inquests, the report suggested that there should be advance disclosure of evidence and documents, as of right, to parties and that consideration should be given to extending legal aid to victims, or their families. Importantly, it was also suggested that police complaints authority reports could be disclosed to complainants, subject only to a \"substantial harm\" test. Yet one year on and we are no nearer the implementation of even these proposals. The most crucial aspect concerning any police investigation is freedom of information. The home secretary has not incorporated into the FoI bill the obvious and clear recommendation put forward by Macpherson that any such act should apply to all areas of policing, both operational and administrative, subject only to the \"substantial harm\" test for withholding disclosure. Not only has this test been watered down to merely \"causing prejudice\", and Jack Straw, needless to say without consultation, has recently added a new power to ban the release of any public documents; but also clauses 28 and 29 expressly exempt the police and law enforcement agencies. Therefore, Doreen and Neville Lawrence would face very similar difficulties today in their hunt for the truth as they had to face in the past. It is perhaps ironic that the only proposal that has been actively and positively pursued by the government in the last year is one that was not, in fact, proposed by any of the parties to the Lawrence inquiry and that did not receive detailed examination and debate. Sir William Macpherson did, however, suggest that consideration be given to ending the double jeopardy rule to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is presented. In the circumstances of the Lawrence case where the original investigation was so dilatory and defective, and where five suspects have behaved in public with arrogance and aggression, it is perfectly understandable that the panel would feel an urgent desire to enable the prosecuting authorities to pursue those responsible. Yet we must be extremely careful to guard against letting emotion sweep away some of the basic tenets of criminal jurisprudence . If an investigating authority is allowed a \"second bite of the cherry\" we run the risk that, in order to obtain convictions, the police may resort to the activities that bedevilled so many of the miscarriage of justice cases of the 1980's. For example \"confession evidence\" may be said to have been discovered for the first time after an acquittal, relating either to conversations with cell-mates, prison officers or, perhaps, passing police officers. Or evidence \"overlooked\" at the scene of a crime may suddenly emerge for the first time. So, with the exception of this one flawed proposal, the excellent framework so assiduously laid out in the Macpherson Report remains to be implemented. No doubt the government hopes that if enough time passes the detail will be lost in the wash. Yet a groundswell of public opinion demands action. Victims of racial crime, and their families, must be confident that they will be acknowledged, respected and consulted throughout the dark days of their grief. A failure to act betrays them as much as it betrays the memory of Stephen. \u0095 Michael Mansfield QC is president of the National Civil Rights Movement.",

      "bodyText": "JUSTICE - FOXY STYLE Martin O'Neill knew it, you see. You don't get to be manager of the Foxy Foxes without having something of the vulpine about you, and Mart knew that Stanley Victor Collymore would get in trouble at some point. \"I always felt when he came here that there would probably be an incident,\" he said today. Mart knew it alright - just couldn't do anything about stopping it, that's all. Stanley has been fined two week's wages, the maximum allowed under PFA rules, and warned as to his future conduct after Tuesday night's rumpus in the La Manga football resort (it's got a great driving range too! - K Dalglish). He will also be asked to perform some community service, but O'Neill claims he had no intention of kicking the former bedroom dweller out of Filbert Street. \"Unless an incident had been incredibly serious I had no intention of sacking Stan,\" he told a press conference. \"I still think it is a warning. This, in footballing parlance, is a yellow card.\" Spot the occasional Match of the Day pundit. But O'Neill did not restrict his censure to Stanley, forcing his players to pay for the entire trip including a \u00a3700 bill for damage to the hotel. He also claimed, \"My annoyance stems from a party of us representing the club not behaving properly. In terms of behaviour, I don't believe it's acceptable, especially in the current climate when players' behaviour is under scrutiny.\" O'Neill in no way defended his players, but he didn't appear to be too chuffed with the star of La Manga Uncovered, managing director Tony Coles either. \"I have spoken to Mr Coles this morning and he admits a couple of things written did not happen,\" O'Neill revealed in an understated fashion. \"It was said players were stood on their chairs,\" he said, \"One player stood on a chair and was told to sit down by one of my staff and he did.\" Send 'em home! What, they have already? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I've got a nice present for him when he comes back.\" - The venerable Bobby Robson Esq. on his Peruvian winger Nolberto Solano who went to the Gold Cup against his manager's wishes, and is coming back injured. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NAMING NAMES The Fiver reckons you've got to put your faith in youth.

      "body": "<p>\"Busy?\" says author Tanyia Maxted-Frost when I ask whether the organic baby business has been good recently. \"Busy? We are flat out trying to keep up with demand.\" She has already written The Organic Baby Book and is about to publish The Organic Baby Cook Book; business is booming.</p> <p>Michelle Riley, who started her organic baby business so she could work from home, has been so successful that she is preparing to open a shop, Little Green Earthlets, in Putney, South London. \"I wanted to work from home to be with my daughter, so in that respect I have totally failed.\"</p> <p>Then there is Nigel Dawson, who gave up banking to set up a wooden toys and games business. He also reports strong demand.</p> <p>Babies may not care what we make them wear or eat, as long as it doesn't have nasty tight elastic or taste too horrible. But grown-ups seem to care, and quite a lot. In Japan the market for environmentally con scious businesses is expected to grow by 58% over the next decade. In Germany organic baby food accounts for more than 90% of the baby-food market. In Britain, Lizzie Vann, of Organix, says that organic baby food is the only area of the baby food market which is showing any growth at all. A year-on-year growth of 80% means that last year it took 25% of the baby food market.</p> <p>The advantages of organic baby food have been well rehearsed by its advocates. \"Babies and children are most at risk from pesticide residues,\" says Maxted-Frost, \"and if they do react to them and get an upset stomach, it's a much bigger problem than it is for an adult.\" And in many cases, it is no more expensive than conventional baby food: for example, a 125g pot of Heinz creamed potato with broccoli is only 5p less than a similar product from HIPP but has higher levels of fat, sugar and salt.</p> <p>In her book, she cites evidence that every non-organic apple has been dosed approximately 40 times with up to 100 chemicals before you eat it. She also examines theories that the dramatic decrease in fertility in the west is linked to pesticides, antibiotics and hormones in food.</p> <p>But is there a good reason to buy organic nappies and toys and clothes as well as food? Barbara Griggs, who has been writing about alternative health for 20 years, has long been a champion of organic food (although she has concerns about the speed with which the availability is spreading: are all those cartons of organic milk genuine?). \"But organic clothes are different,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I feel a little sceptical about them because some people buying them may think they're making a decision about their health.</p> <p>\"In fact, it's really nothing to do with your health: it's to do with helping reduce the amount of pesticides used in producing cotton. As long as people realise that, it's all right; but you have to understand that you're paying quite a lot more for an essentially altruistic gesture.\"</p> <p>The green toy market falls into the same category: playthings made out of wood from replenishable sources do nothing extra for your child - but you could argue that you are doing your bit to save the planet.</p> <p>The same applies to nappies made from organic cotton. Reusable nappies are considered by some to be as wasteful, in terms of the electricity and water it takes to wash and dry them, as disposables.</p> <p>The argument has raged for so long that the National Association of Nappy Services commissioned a comparison study by Landbank Consultancy. Using figures produced by Procter &amp; Gamble, the study measured impact per infant per year and found that disposable nappies (Britons use nine million a day) use 3.5 times more energy than cotton washables, 2.3 times more waste water, 8.3 times more non-regenerative materials, 90 times more renewable materials, and 4-30 times more land for raw materials. But you may wonder whether doing your bit for the environment is worth the extra effort.</p> <p>Many cities and towns now have nappy laundries but if even the prospect of keeping that smelly bucket of soiled squares until the van comes to collect them is too much, you can also buy eco-disposables which biodegrade rather than lingering for decades in a landfill site.</p> <p>The range of clothes and toys available in the growing green market means that you no longer need to buy organically produced goods just to salve your conscience. This particular consumer revolution has been all about creating options. You've heard all the arguments, now make up your mind whether the saving to the environment is worth the extra cost to you.</p> <p><b> Toys</b><br></p> <p><b> Dawson &amp; Son Wooden Toys and Games. </b> Tel: 01799 526 611; www. dawson-and-son.com.

      "bodyText": "\"Busy?\" says author Tanyia Maxted-Frost when I ask whether the organic baby business has been good recently. \"Busy? We are flat out trying to keep up with demand.\" She has already written The Organic Baby Book and is about to publish The Organic Baby Cook Book; business is booming. Michelle Riley, who started her organic baby business so she could work from home, has been so successful that she is preparing to open a shop, Little Green Earthlets, in Putney, South London. \"I wanted to work from home to be with my daughter, so in that respect I have totally failed.\" Then there is Nigel Dawson, who gave up banking to set up a wooden toys and games business. He also reports strong demand. Babies may not care what we make them wear or eat, as long as it doesn't have nasty tight elastic or taste too horrible. But grown-ups seem to care, and quite a lot. In Japan the market for environmentally con scious businesses is expected to grow by 58% over the next decade. In Germany organic baby food accounts for more than 90% of the baby-food market. In Britain, Lizzie Vann, of Organix, says that organic baby food is the only area of the baby food market which is showing any growth at all. A year-on-year growth of 80% means that last year it took 25% of the baby food market. The advantages of organic baby food have been well rehearsed by its advocates. \"Babies and children are most at risk from pesticide residues,\" says Maxted-Frost, \"and if they do react to them and get an upset stomach, it's a much bigger problem than it is for an adult.\" And in many cases, it is no more expensive than conventional baby food: for example, a 125g pot of Heinz creamed potato with broccoli is only 5p less than a similar product from HIPP but has higher levels of fat, sugar and salt. In her book, she cites evidence that every non-organic apple has been dosed approximately 40 times with up to 100 chemicals before you eat it. She also examines theories that the dramatic decrease in fertility in the west is linked to pesticides, antibiotics and hormones in food. But is there a good reason to buy organic nappies and toys and clothes as well as food? Barbara Griggs, who has been writing about alternative health for 20 years, has long been a champion of organic food (although she has concerns about the speed with which the availability is spreading: are all those cartons of organic milk genuine?). \"But organic clothes are different,\" she says. \"I feel a little sceptical about them because some people buying them may think they're making a decision about their health. \"In fact, it's really nothing to do with your health: it's to do with helping reduce the amount of pesticides used in producing cotton. As long as people realise that, it's all right; but you have to understand that you're paying quite a lot more for an essentially altruistic gesture.\" The green toy market falls into the same category: playthings made out of wood from replenishable sources do nothing extra for your child - but you could argue that you are doing your bit to save the planet. The same applies to nappies made from organic cotton. Reusable nappies are considered by some to be as wasteful, in terms of the electricity and water it takes to wash and dry them, as disposables. The argument has raged for so long that the National Association of Nappy Services commissioned a comparison study by Landbank Consultancy. Using figures produced by Procter &amp; Gamble, the study measured impact per infant per year and found that disposable nappies (Britons use nine million a day) use 3.5 times more energy than cotton washables, 2.3 times more waste water, 8.3 times more non-regenerative materials, 90 times more renewable materials, and 4-30 times more land for raw materials. But you may wonder whether doing your bit for the environment is worth the extra effort. Many cities and towns now have nappy laundries but if even the prospect of keeping that smelly bucket of soiled squares until the van comes to collect them is too much, you can also buy eco-disposables which biodegrade rather than lingering for decades in a landfill site. The range of clothes and toys available in the growing green market means that you no longer need to buy organically produced goods just to salve your conscience. This particular consumer revolution has been all about creating options. You've heard all the arguments, now make up your mind whether the saving to the environment is worth the extra cost to you.

We are the Borg.\" Professor Mark Cutkosky is elaborately easing his hand into a glove complete with hooks, wires, and flashing lights that looks as if it belongs on a Star Trek set rather than in a laboratory at Stanford University, California. </p> <p>Even more Trekian, the glove controls a robot called Marvin situated on the other side of the lab. Cutkosky flexes his hand; in response Marvin roots around in some dried peas and picks up a tennis ball. One day, Marvin might pick up something a little more useful - a Martian rock perhaps, while whoever wears the gloves remains firmly back on earth. </p> <p>Marvin, to describe him fully, is a tele-operated robot hand with two fingers. Each finger has force and tactile sensors embedded within it. The glove also contains sensors, and an algorithm generated by an attached computer \"translates\" the forces \"felt\" by the robot to the glove so that the wearer receives a realistic sensation of touch. The glove registers the position of the wearer's fingers, and these signals are also sent via the computer to the robot. </p> <p>For demonstration purposes, Cutkosky has built a mini seabed. With its dried peas for the sea floor, a plastic fish and a block of salvage with radioactive stripes, it looks like something a toddler might construct. Nevertheless, Cutkosky shows how the robot fingers can pick up and manipulate the block. </p> <p>\"I can come in and grasp this block,\" says Cutkosky, \"and as soon as I do, I can feel the block's weight, and how hard I'm squeezing, so it's very much like I have a block between my own fingers.\" </p> <p>If the sensors are turned off, the relationship between Mark and Marvin is less amicable. \"I feel like a four month old infant,\" says Cutkosky, dropping the block on the sea bed. </p> <p>The technology developed at Stanford could be used for computer games to make interactions in a virtual world more plausible; it might even transform shopping on the internet into a more pleasurable experience by allowing users to feel their potential purchases, from the texture of fabric to the ripeness of a peach. Another application would be to use the robot in a remote or hostile environment. </p> <p>\"A couple of years ago when there was that crash of the airliner in the Florida everglades there was a quote from one of the divers - they were groping around in mucky water, they couldn't see what they were doing, they wanted to know if they had grabbed hold of a root or part of an airplane,\" says Cutkosky, \"and it occurred to me that this would be a lovely environment to have a robot in instead of people.\" </p> <p>Recently Cutkosky's team has concentrated on sending Marvin to Mars. For inspiration, they turned to an expert on touch. Professor Geerat Vermeij, from the university of Davis, California, is a palaeontologist who has been blind since he was three. He specialises in classifying fossil shells and has travelled globally in pursuit of his passion. Vermeij believes that parts of the visual cortex in his brain have now become devoted to his sense of touch. </p> <p>His hunch is backed up partly by brain scans on other blind people showing this very phenomenon, and partly because of the rapidity and accuracy of his tactile ability. Once in Guam he accidentally unearthed a stonefish. These fish can kill. The moment they are touched their spines become erect and they inject a potent nerve toxin into the victim. Geerat, realising it was a stonefish, reacted so swiftly the creature didn't have time to sting him. </p> <p>Cutkosky's colleague, Michael Costa, spoke to Vermeij at length about his sensation of touch and how best to replicate it in a robot. Vermeij explained that for him there are three scales of dexterity: the first is the whole hand scale where he feels the overall shape of an object like a shell. It is for this reason that he doesn't like traditional sculpture. A Rodin, he claims, is an object to be viewed, not felt: it's cold to the touch and it's impossible to grasp its overall coherence using one's hands. Secondly he feels more minute details with the tip of his fingers or his nails, and finally he uses a needle to probe for ridges and indentations, thus picking up traits in fossil species that sighted palaeontologists sometimes overlook. </p> <p>Armed with this information, Costa and Cutkosky developed a simpler version of Marvin - a robot probe that acts like Vermeij's needle. The 3GM, as it's known, is a probe that transmits the vibrations of objects. By programming in the different vibrational frequencies of materials, the user can now touch virtual blocks of wood, aluminium and rubber in a computer while holding the probe and feeling a realistic sensation as if he or she were tapping real objects with a 3GM. The idea is that the next robot to explore Mars will be armed with the 3GM. </p> <p>A geologist on earth will control the robot's probing and feel what it feels. The technology to enable geologists to see and feel in space is being developed by Ted Blackmon and Daryl Rasmussen in conjunction with Nasa. </p> <p>The robot will have \"eyes\" - two separate video cameras which will send images back to earth via the Deep Space Network - three landbased antenna that pick up radio waves. The pictures will then be processed at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab and sent to the geologist who will be able to view them in 3D by wearing a set of virtual reality goggles. The tactile data from the probe will also be sent in a similar fashion. The lag time is estimated to be 15 minutes. </p> <p>However, Costa admits that because the data is being converted in this way, anyone using the 3GM on earth will only feel a simulation of what space really feels like. </p> <p>Moreover, Vermeij might use a needle to extract secrets from shells, but he also uses his finger tips and hands. </p> <p>As Cutkosky says: \"It'll feel like you're probing the world with a wooden spoon.\"</p>",

Dressmart caters for the \"money-rich, time-poor\" businessman. It sells Jermyn Street-type brands (Thomas Pink, Charles Tyrwhitt, Eton). Send an email, giving three possible dates, and a Gieves &amp; Hawkes tailor will pop round and measure you up in the office. Made-to-measure suits start at \u00a3595. You won't find the same level of sophistication at swerve.co.uk, which claims to be the cheapest UK-based online retailer of designer wear, but it does have amazing discounts - up to 80% on ends of ranges. Zercon.com, on the other hand, does designer discounts with considerably more style. If you can't afford Marc Jacobs' latest corduroy creations, try the Boss jeans in soft-ribbed fabric (aka cord) for only \u00a346.99. The Tommy Hilfiger hooded sailing jacket may lack the latest tartan trim, but is perfect for those slightly more energetic weekends. La Redoute is the place to go for surfwear.

The university of Manchester's Jodrell bank observatory in Cheshire has joined in an attempt to contact Nasa's missing Mars polar lander (MPL) spacecraft. </p> <p>The MPL was launched from Cape Canaveral on January 3, 1999 for an 11-month flight to the red planet. The lander was designed to touch down near the planet's south pole and study the Martian surface and climate history. But as it hurtled through the Martian atmosphere on December 3, flight controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California lost radio contact. After repeated attempts to contact the lander, they concluded the main antenna on the probe had been damaged during the landing. </p> <p>There are two radio systems on the MPL. The first, a high-power system, is the one normally used for two-way communication between earth and Mars and is the one probably damaged on arrival. The other, a low power UHF transmitter, was to be used to relay the probe's scientific data to earth via other spacecraft orbiting Mars. Unfortunately, this link with the Mars lander is \"one-way\" and cannot be used to tell the stricken probe what to do. </p> <p>Since the lander's arrival on Mars, Nasa engineers have been transmitting commands to the probe telling it to switch on its low-power UHF transmitter. They are hopeful that, although the probe cannot communicate directly with earth, it can still pick up commands through its damaged antenna. But since they can't confirm the relay satellite orbiting Mars is working properly, they have used a 150ft dish antenna at Stanford university, California, to listen for the faint signals from the missing mission. </p> <p>The spacecraft's UHF transmissions are extremely weak. As one Nasa scientist put it: \"It's like trying to see a single Christmas tree light on Mars\". Finding such a faint signal amongst all the background noise requires many days of careful analysis of the data. </p> <p>Recently Nasa announced it had found a signal that seemed to match expectations. It was certainly artificial but it could have originated on or near Earth. Several radio observatories around the world have since offered Nasa their assistance in finding the missing probe. </p> <p>The university of Manchester's huge Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank is ideally suited to this kind of search. Its 250ft dish makes it about three times more sensitive than the dish at Stanford university. In 1993, Nasa called on Jodrell Bank to help in an attempt to contact its ill-fated Mars Observer spacecraft and the Jodrell Bank scientists were more than willing to lend a hand searching for the latest vagrant probe. Jodrell Bank and other radio telescopes in the Netherlands and Italy have since been on the lookout for the signals. </p> <p>The early results of the experiment have shown no obvious signs of the lander. Some very faint signals were found but they did not appear at each telescope at the same time. This suggests they were not of Martian origin, although the final results of these attempts won't be known for some weeks. </p> <p>Scientists admit there may be several reasons for their continued failure to detect the probe. It may not be in the state they assume and may not have executed the command to transmit. There is now speculation that the probe's batteries or solar panels are damaged and the transmitter doesn't have the required power.

Customs and Excise reports seizing an all-time record 82.5 metric tonnes of cannabis in the United Kingdom in 1997,\" says the report. The trade was often carried out by air rather than through the ports. And Colombia - traditionally one of Britain's top suppliers of cocaine - has recently become a big supplier for traditional strength marijuana. \"In a relatively short period of time Colombia has become an important marijuna source country for the UK.\" Most of the cannabis was imported by ship rather than by air. Yesterday customs and excise made it clear that cannabis was still a top target. \"I think the figures speak for themselves,\" said a spokeswoman. Stuart Crookshank, deputy head of anti-smuggling operations at customs and excise, said: \"We are aware and alert to the risk posed by nederweed and all cannabis derivatives.\"",

      "bodyText": "Traffic-choked Trafalgar Square, in London, is to be transformed under plans unveiled today by the Minister for London, Keith Hill, and the architect Lord Foster. Vehicles are to be barred from the north side of the square, opening up more space for pedestrians, and it is proposed that a new central staircase will link the National Gallery and the square itself. The changes, set to cost \u00a323m, will mean that pedestrians will only have to negotiate one major road crossing between Soho and the South Bank. Crossing Trafalgar Square from north to south currently takes an average of nine minutes on foot. The plans are part of the World Squares for All masterplan, which extends as far as Whitehall and Parliament Square. Lord Foster said: \"Our proposals will create a new heart for London by improving the balance between pedestrians and vehicles. The new pedestrian piazza in St Martin's Place [part of Trafalgar Square] will become a focus for the great cultural institutions around it.\" Closing off the north side of the square will increase traffic journey times across central London by about 5% for taxis and under 3% for buses.

      "body": "<p>The chancellor's welcome plans for reforming family benefits would gain even more from a humbler measure, affecting a world of which many netsurfers may scarcely know. The visionary sweep of the tax changes reaches its point of delivery for most of those in greatest need at the sub-post office. And that is a feature of the British landscape in genuine danger of extinction.</p> <p>The issue has been the subject of debates in the Commons this week, with the opposition unusually invigorated by the strength of concern, especially in the countryside. Across north Yorkshire, for instance, a modest piece of petition gathering has bandwagoned into 30,000 signatures, and there is equal concern in Wales where Plaid Cymru's victory in the Ceredigion byelection, Simon Thomas, made sub-post offices the subject of his eloquent maiden speech.</p> <p>The part played by the little buildings as a lifeline for rural communities, with their sidelines of groceries or newspaper deliveries, is at least comparatively well known. It pulls at some powerful, thatched cottage, roses-round-the-door, English heartstrings. But their much more important role in big cities' peripheral council estates, and other centres of the dispossessed which are the absolute target of Gordon Brown's benefit reforms, is much less highlighted.</p> <p>This is not a world of bank accounts into which the proposed new \"seamless system of support for children\" can be electronically transferred. It is the place where the electric, gas and TV licence are paid for by weekly stamps and the elderly queue on Thursdays for their pensions.</p> <p>It is the local bank, too; a business wholly absent from most socially excluded areas and often beyond the reach of anyone doddering, or encumbered with a pushchair plus toddler, in a swathe of less obviously deprived parts of town. It is not a bank in terms of ISAs and leaflets about wonderful borrowing schemes and credit extensions, but simply a place - the only place locally - where those on low incomes can get actual money.</p> <p>All manner of other transactions take place across the counter, of course, from driving licence and vehicle tax applications to the first step in the bureaucratic marathon of getting a passport. But it is the readies, the greenbacks, the child credit, pensions and income support which make sub-post offices so vital.</p> <p>The government justifies its drive to shift benefit to bank transfer by 2003 on straightforward cost grounds, saving Mr Brown's exchequer some \u00a3400m a year. Leaving aside the fact that this sum is a minnow in public spending terms (it would run the department of social security for less than a week), it ignores the far greater costs which lie in store when the issue arises of how to make bank transfers to people who don't want accounts and haven't got a local bank anyway.</p> <p>The postal services bill's other measure, a \u00a3480m scheme to increase computer use in sub-post offices, is the wiser way to use IT's huge potential, cutting the extraordinary number of forms and die-stamps over which sub-postmasters and mistresses puzzle. With that in place, direct electronic transfer and its savings will in due course follow naturally. The other way round, and there will be few, if any, sub-post offices left in the places which need them most.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/country\">Countryside in crisis: special report</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.ukpo.com/\" target=\"new\">The Post Office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmbills/054/2000054.htm\" target=\"new\">Text of the postal services bill</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,137409,00.html\">Guardian leader: Fighting the giant Want</a></p> <p><a name=\"post\"><b>Name a stone</b></a></p> <p>Anyone who has tramped the lovely, heather-covered wilderness of the North York Moors will know Fat Betty, Ralph Cross and Blue Man-i-th-Moss. Not quaint local characters, they are standing stones from the misty past which guide you along the Lyke Wake Walk between the Cleveland escarpment and the North Sea.</p> <p>Two days ago, with much grunting and the clanking of a mobile crane, a new obelisk was levered into place on Danby High Moor, after 10,000 years of lying underground on a neighbouring hillside. The five-tonne sandstone monolith is a millennium marker - three millennia after Fat Betty and one-and-a-half after Ralph Cross - and a welcome new recruit to the tradition.</p> <p>It needs one thing, though: an appropriately colourful name of its own, and preferably before May 6 when everyone interested is invited to walk to the site for a dedication service.

And that is a feature of the British landscape in genuine danger of extinction. The issue has been the subject of debates in the Commons this week, with the opposition unusually invigorated by the strength of concern, especially in the countryside. Across north Yorkshire, for instance, a modest piece of petition gathering has bandwagoned into 30,000 signatures, and there is equal concern in Wales where Plaid Cymru's victory in the Ceredigion byelection, Simon Thomas, made sub-post offices the subject of his eloquent maiden speech. The part played by the little buildings as a lifeline for rural communities, with their sidelines of groceries or newspaper deliveries, is at least comparatively well known. It pulls at some powerful, thatched cottage, roses-round-the-door, English heartstrings. But their much more important role in big cities' peripheral council estates, and other centres of the dispossessed which are the absolute target of Gordon Brown's benefit reforms, is much less highlighted. This is not a world of bank accounts into which the proposed new \"seamless system of support for children\" can be electronically transferred. It is the place where the electric, gas and TV licence are paid for by weekly stamps and the elderly queue on Thursdays for their pensions. It is the local bank, too; a business wholly absent from most socially excluded areas and often beyond the reach of anyone doddering, or encumbered with a pushchair plus toddler, in a swathe of less obviously deprived parts of town. It is not a bank in terms of ISAs and leaflets about wonderful borrowing schemes and credit extensions, but simply a place - the only place locally - where those on low incomes can get actual money. All manner of other transactions take place across the counter, of course, from driving licence and vehicle tax applications to the first step in the bureaucratic marathon of getting a passport. But it is the readies, the greenbacks, the child credit, pensions and income support which make sub-post offices so vital. The government justifies its drive to shift benefit to bank transfer by 2003 on straightforward cost grounds, saving Mr Brown's exchequer some \u00a3400m a year. Leaving aside the fact that this sum is a minnow in public spending terms (it would run the department of social security for less than a week), it ignores the far greater costs which lie in store when the issue arises of how to make bank transfers to people who don't want accounts and haven't got a local bank anyway. The postal services bill's other measure, a \u00a3480m scheme to increase computer use in sub-post offices, is the wiser way to use IT's huge potential, cutting the extraordinary number of forms and die-stamps over which sub-postmasters and mistresses puzzle. With that in place, direct electronic transfer and its savings will in due course follow naturally. The other way round, and there will be few, if any, sub-post offices left in the places which need them most. Useful links Countryside in crisis: special report The Post Office Text of the postal services bill Guardian leader: Fighting the giant Want Name a stone Anyone who has tramped the lovely, heather-covered wilderness of the North York Moors will know Fat Betty, Ralph Cross and Blue Man-i-th-Moss. Not quaint local characters, they are standing stones from the misty past which guide you along the Lyke Wake Walk between the Cleveland escarpment and the North Sea. Two days ago, with much grunting and the clanking of a mobile crane, a new obelisk was levered into place on Danby High Moor, after 10,000 years of lying underground on a neighbouring hillside. The five-tonne sandstone monolith is a millennium marker - three millennia after Fat Betty and one-and-a-half after Ralph Cross - and a welcome new recruit to the tradition. It needs one thing, though: an appropriately colourful name of its own, and preferably before May 6 when everyone interested is invited to walk to the site for a dedication service.

But the sell-off plan, part of the transport bill going through parliament, has run into heavy flak. The British Airline Pilots Association and some Labour MPs, including the former transport minister Gavin Strang, have attacked the idea.</p> <p>The committee said that if the government wrote off NATS' debt of \u00a3300m, the expected \u00a3350m proceeds from the proposed sale would result in revenue of \"only \u00a320m\" after \u00a330mcosts. It is also anticipated that some of the public shares would not have voting rights which would, in effect, pass \"operational control\" of the organisation into private hands.</p> <p>The committee agreed that making no change to NATS was not an option because it was already operating ''close to the limit of its capacity\", but it urged the government to consider making NATS an independent trust.</p> <p>\"In no other country is a public-private partnership like that proposed for the UK planned,\" it noted. The committee pointed to the success of Canada's NavCanada, funded by a bonds issue and governed by 15 directors, including five from the aviation industry, two from the unions and three from the government.</p> <p>The committee said the trust model would free NATS to borrow on the private market, and separate the company more clearly from its regulator, the civil aviation authority. It argued: \"Since customers, staff and the government would all be involved in the provision of air traffic services, the trust model answers concerns about rising charges, lower safety standards, national security considerations, and the future development of air navigation services.\"</p> <p>The committee also warned that private investors would want to increase revenues from NATS by raising charges to its customers, putting airlines and airports in the United Kingdom at a competitive disadvantage.</p>",

NATS argued that the sale would allow the investment it needed - estimated at \u00a31.3bn over the next 10 years - to cope with a forecasted 43% rise in air traffic by 2010. But the sell-off plan, part of the transport bill going through parliament, has run into heavy flak. The British Airline Pilots Association and some Labour MPs, including the former transport minister Gavin Strang, have attacked the idea. The committee said that if the government wrote off NATS' debt of \u00a3300m, the expected \u00a3350m proceeds from the proposed sale would result in revenue of \"only \u00a320m\" after \u00a330mcosts. It is also anticipated that some of the public shares would not have voting rights which would, in effect, pass \"operational control\" of the organisation into private hands. The committee agreed that making no change to NATS was not an option because it was already operating ''close to the limit of its capacity\", but it urged the government to consider making NATS an independent trust. \"In no other country is a public-private partnership like that proposed for the UK planned,\" it noted. The committee pointed to the success of Canada's NavCanada, funded by a bonds issue and governed by 15 directors, including five from the aviation industry, two from the unions and three from the government. The committee said the trust model would free NATS to borrow on the private market, and separate the company more clearly from its regulator, the civil aviation authority. It argued: \"Since customers, staff and the government would all be involved in the provision of air traffic services, the trust model answers concerns about rising charges, lower safety standards, national security considerations, and the future development of air navigation services.\" The committee also warned that private investors would want to increase revenues from NATS by raising charges to its customers, putting airlines and airports in the United Kingdom at a competitive disadvantage.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Offer you can refuse </strong><br> </p> <p> A number of readers may have been cold-called by a company offering a \u00a323.70 first-aid kit and promising that a third of the proceeds will go to charity. Worse, they may have found an unsolicited kit on the door step, along with an invoice listing eight charities, including the British Red Cross and Mencap, as beneficiaries. But there's a catch. None of these charities has authorised the campaign or has a legal contract with the telesales company as required under the charities act 1992. Royal Consulting, which is based in the Netherlands, has admitted sending out up to 8,000 kits to British householders. In November, it promised to stop mentioning the charities in its promotions but, says the Red Cross, this hasn't happened. </p> <p>In Holland, Don Brouwers, managing director of Royal Consulting, giggles awkwardly when Consumer calls. \"A few call-centre sales agents in the UK were misusing the information we gave them and naming charities,\" he says. The three rogue agents have now been fired and, he says, there is \"no possibility\" that the charities' names are being taken in vain. \"We still give 34% of the profits to charities but we don't name them.\" So how much has he given so far? \"We don't have exact figures yet and we didn't have much net profit last year because we're still investing, but we will be giving a third this year. I'm trying to find a way to prove that to people so they'll believe me.\" </p> <p>The office of fair trading has received complaints and alerted Dutch authorities, but is powerless because Royal Consulting is based abroad. If you receive unsolicited goods and an invoice, don't be intimidated. It's the responsibility of the sender to arrange collection. If you write to the firm explaining that you reject them, the goods become yours if there's no reply within 30 days. If you don't write (and don't use them), they're yours after six months.</p> <p><strong> Cover story</strong><br> </p> <p> Often it seems that all you get for your money from an insurance product is the decorative policy document. Michael Flack of Milton Keynes didn't even get that. Last June he took out car insurance with Gladiator Insurance in Cardiff, paid a deposit and set up a direct debit. The \u00a3169.50 was deducted and Flack received two temporary cover notes, but by November he still hadn't received a certificate. He rang customer services to discover that Gladiator had not taken payments for two months. Another department had cancelled the policy, leaving Flack without cover. His attempts to investigate failed - he was cut off each time customer services put him on hold. A letter of complaint went unanswered. </p> <p>Gladiator's explanation highlights the joys of modern technology. \"When the cover began we needed Mr Flack to return documentation to us,\" explains a spokesman. \"He returned it, but it was sent from us to the insurer in paper form rather than electronically, which meant it was never registered as received. Normally a seven-day notice of cancellation would be sent if the insurer had not set up the policy. On this occasion the letter was not sent, but the policy was still cancelled.\" Flack is to be refunded and will be get \u00a350 compensation. </p> <p><strong> Trouble with gas</strong><br> </p> <p> Check the fine print of wondrous new offers. SafeGas, a Leeds-based company offering gas service contracts, made a price rise look like a concession when it told consumers that in the interests of customer choice its full breakdown and boiler replacement cover had been reduced to \u00a389. The odd thing was that MG Crowhurst of Leeds had paid \u00a399 the previous year for a package which included an annual service, a perk deleted from the new offer. Nor was there any evidence of increased choice, except, says Crowhurst, \"whether or not to take an annual service at an additional charge of \u00a329, making the overall package a total of \u00a3118 - a \u00a319 increase on last year.\" </p> <p>SafeGas says it wanted to give the customer choice by separating service charges from the package and denies its boasts of a price decrease are misleading. \"The price would have gone up anyway, so this new deal can be seen as a reduction.\" </p> <p><strong> C&amp;W: Calls still queueing</strong><br> </p> <p> Mark Thomas tried to get a C&amp;W phone and cable connection last autumn.

      "bodyText": "Offer you can refuse A number of readers may have been cold-called by a company offering a \u00a323.70 first-aid kit and promising that a third of the proceeds will go to charity. Worse, they may have found an unsolicited kit on the door step, along with an invoice listing eight charities, including the British Red Cross and Mencap, as beneficiaries. But there's a catch. None of these charities has authorised the campaign or has a legal contract with the telesales company as required under the charities act 1992. Royal Consulting, which is based in the Netherlands, has admitted sending out up to 8,000 kits to British householders. In November, it promised to stop mentioning the charities in its promotions but, says the Red Cross, this hasn't happened. In Holland, Don Brouwers, managing director of Royal Consulting, giggles awkwardly when Consumer calls. \"A few call-centre sales agents in the UK were misusing the information we gave them and naming charities,\" he says. The three rogue agents have now been fired and, he says, there is \"no possibility\" that the charities' names are being taken in vain. \"We still give 34% of the profits to charities but we don't name them.\" So how much has he given so far? \"We don't have exact figures yet and we didn't have much net profit last year because we're still investing, but we will be giving a third this year. I'm trying to find a way to prove that to people so they'll believe me.\" The office of fair trading has received complaints and alerted Dutch authorities, but is powerless because Royal Consulting is based abroad. If you receive unsolicited goods and an invoice, don't be intimidated. It's the responsibility of the sender to arrange collection. If you write to the firm explaining that you reject them, the goods become yours if there's no reply within 30 days. If you don't write (and don't use them), they're yours after six months. Cover story Often it seems that all you get for your money from an insurance product is the decorative policy document. Michael Flack of Milton Keynes didn't even get that. Last June he took out car insurance with Gladiator Insurance in Cardiff, paid a deposit and set up a direct debit. The \u00a3169.50 was deducted and Flack received two temporary cover notes, but by November he still hadn't received a certificate. He rang customer services to discover that Gladiator had not taken payments for two months. Another department had cancelled the policy, leaving Flack without cover. His attempts to investigate failed - he was cut off each time customer services put him on hold. A letter of complaint went unanswered. Gladiator's explanation highlights the joys of modern technology. \"When the cover began we needed Mr Flack to return documentation to us,\" explains a spokesman. \"He returned it, but it was sent from us to the insurer in paper form rather than electronically, which meant it was never registered as received. Normally a seven-day notice of cancellation would be sent if the insurer had not set up the policy. On this occasion the letter was not sent, but the policy was still cancelled.\" Flack is to be refunded and will be get \u00a350 compensation. Trouble with gas Check the fine print of wondrous new offers. SafeGas, a Leeds-based company offering gas service contracts, made a price rise look like a concession when it told consumers that in the interests of customer choice its full breakdown and boiler replacement cover had been reduced to \u00a389. The odd thing was that MG Crowhurst of Leeds had paid \u00a399 the previous year for a package which included an annual service, a perk deleted from the new offer. Nor was there any evidence of increased choice, except, says Crowhurst, \"whether or not to take an annual service at an additional charge of \u00a329, making the overall package a total of \u00a3118 - a \u00a319 increase on last year.\" SafeGas says it wanted to give the customer choice by separating service charges from the package and denies its boasts of a price decrease are misleading. \"The price would have gone up anyway, so this new deal can be seen as a reduction.\" C&amp;W: Calls still queueing Mark Thomas tried to get a C&amp;W phone and cable connection last autumn. First he was told the \"box\" in the road wasn't big enough and it would take six to eight weeks to sort out. After six weeks he waited 20 minutes on the helpline to be told it would be eight weeks. Later still, he was told it couldn't be done. He demanded that the contract be cancelled and was told it would be sorted out. That was December and he's still waiting. \u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 0171-713 4731, send a fax on 0171-239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com",

He was nearly beaten to it by his brother Mark, who needed to reach three figures against Zimbabwe in October - but he was out for 90. It should be borne in mind that only in recent years has it been possible to play against so many different teams - Sri Lanka played their first Tests in 1981-82 and Zimbabwe in 1992-93, the year after South Africa returned to the international fold. Don Bradman, for example, played 37 of his 52 Tests against England - and five each against South Africa, West Indies and India. </p> <p> <strong>A friend of mine remembers listening to the commentary from Headingley, as Bob Willis bowled out the Australians in 1981, while watching a county game.

He also made 99 against England at Wellington in 1983-84 - more than England managed in either innings. They were shot out for 82 and 93, and New Zealand won easily.

He can muster billions of dollars in the space of a few phone calls. </p> <p>Almost overnight PCCW became valued at $29bn (\u00a318bn), the sixth biggest company on the Hong Kong stock exchange. As investment bankers and institutional shareholders wait months to get a meeting with Mr Li, it is Cable &amp; Wireless's chief executive, Graham Wallace who has gained the young Hong Kong tycoon's attention. </p> <p>Mr Li's company wants a slice of C&amp;W's 54% owned Hong Kong operation that has become peripheral to its parent's strategy but not to its bottom line as it accounts for almost two-thirds of the British telecoms group's operating profit. </p> <p>Its rich seam of cash has ensured that Mr Wallace must carefully structure a deal that will see C&amp;W exit part or all of its shareholding in its Hong Kong division with the best price for its shareholders. Mr Wallace has let it be know he wants a deal in cash or cash and shares. </p> <p>C&amp;W's appetite for funds is underpinning its rapid restructuring and expansion into a business telecommunications and data network company. It had begun negotiations with the state-owned SingTel with which it was proposing to merge its Hong Kong operations to create a new company worth \u00a337bn by June. </p> <p>The British group was planning to own about 27% after taking out cash. But the emergence of Mr Li and his new empire has spoiled plans by the Singaporean government to cement itself as the new telecommunications and, more importantly, internet hub for Asia, through the deal with Cable &amp; Wireless HKT. SingTel said its talks were still ongoing but declined to comment further. </p> <p>It is all good news for C&amp;W. As one observer put it: \"Wallace is sitting at the dinner table and the more options on the menu the merrier.\" The speculation on potential bidders, which grows daily to include Vodafone, AT&amp;T and even Deutsche Telekom, has seen HKT's market capitalisation soar to over $40bn. </p> <p>One theory is that Mr Li will join a consortium of bidders that will include the wealthy partner Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate controlled by his father. Mr Li's advisers, Bank of China, have been reported as saying that PCCW is raising as much as $1bn in a share sale to help it fund a merger with HKT. Peter Allen, chief financial officer and director at Pacific Century, has also built up expectations confirming that Warburg Dillon Read and Bank of China International are there \"to assist in assessing all alternatives including possible investment in HKT\". </p> <p>While it appears to be going C&amp;W's way, the 7% shareholding by China Telecom in HKT may prove a bone of contention. \"China is not interested in merger and acquisitions, it is interested in what is in China's commercial defence,\" said one insider. </p> <p>What this could mean is that China Telecom, the operational arm of China's ministry of post and telecommunications, may force a swing in C&amp;W's thinking and see the deal go to PCCW. It would cer tainly weaken any chance of Singapore dominating telecommunications in Asia. </p> <p>A deal linking HKT and PCCW, now Asia's largest internet group outside Japan, would also offer significant opportunities in the Chinese communications market. </p> <p>Tressan MacCarthy European telecommunications analyst at Credit Lyonnais said: \"The Credit Lyonnais view is that a preferred outcome is Pacific Century Cyberworks fronting some sort of consortium that gives Cable &amp; Wireless HKT the most opportunities in China.\" Ms MacCarthy said the British ownership of HKT may have hindered such expansion. </p> <p>\"Graham Wallace's strategy on global operations has been business to business telecoms, data and internet service providers and that means not being in everything. I think what will happen is that Cable &amp; Wireless will not continue as a majority shareholder of HKT. In terms of group strategy, Europe, the US and Japan where Cable &amp; Wireless is, account for 80% of the global telecoms market. Hong Kong adds something like 0.6% to that,\" she said. </p> <p>PCCW investments in satellite, digital and internet technology in Asia means HKT could give it a digital broadband network in Hong Kong and access to half a million internet subscribers, cashflow and access to China where its real aspirations lie. </p> <p>PCCW is understood to want to have its satellite broadband connecting China, India and Japan. </p> <p>An announcement on HKT's future was expected next month. The timetable may be blown out by the longer list of suitors joining Mr Wallace's dinner party. </p> <p>The outcome may surprise those expecting a PCCW win.

      "bodyText": "Alan Donnelly, who unexpectedly quit as a Labour MEP in December, was yesterday sitting on a paper profit of almost \u00a33m, seven weeks after investing \u00a31,250 in an unquoted cash shell. Mr Donnelly's 1.2m shares in Just2Clicks, which has transformed itself into an operator of vertical business-to-business trading communities on the internet, were valued at just under \u00a33m after its first day on the stock market. The shares, which were placed at 150p, touched 295p before closing at 244p, valuing the company at more than \u00a3200m. Karl Watkin, chief executive, said Just2Clicks was merely a cash shell with ideas and ambition when Mr Donnelly was appointed a non-executive director. Acquisitions had transformed the value of the company. City interest in business-to-business internet companies had grown dramatically since then, he added. Just2Clicks is expected to spend some of the \u00a350m the float raised to expand its trading communities to include the automotive industry. The company will draw on Mr Donnelly's expertise in the area if that happens. Before resigning as MEP for Tyne and Wear, Mr Donnelly was European Parliamentary spokesman on the automotive industry. Just2Clicks operates trading communities in the pulp and paper, electric power and road transport industries. Figures released yesterday by Gartner Group predicted worldwide business-to-business e-commerce will pass $7.29 trillion by 2004.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, will step up the \"war on child poverty\" in next month's budget, unveiling an integrated system which aims to lift more than a million of Britain's poorest children out of hardship. Labour insiders hope the move - once spoken of as an aspiration but now brought forward as a firm policy - will placate disaffected activists in the party's heartlands. It will be billed as a radical restucturing of the welfare state - and a key step on the way to achieving the government's proclaimed mission: halving child poverty in 10 years and eradicating it in 20. Under the plan, child benefit will remain separate and distinct but the current raft of state allowances for children will be brought under a single banner, \"the integrated child credit\". By next year, even before the new machinery is in place, the poorest families should be receiving \u00a345 weekly for each child, which government officials insist amounts to the most generous state help for children ever. Hinting at a release of fresh money in the March 21 budget, treasury sources made clear that help for poor children will form the centrepiece of the chancellor's speech. In what is clearly designed as a public-relations offensive to win over Labour's increasingly disillusioned supporters, advisers to Mr Brown say that the chancellor has now cracked the problem of implementing the change - allowing him to bring in the streamlined system much earlier than he previously thought possible. Labour aims to be able to offer it to voters at the next election as a concrete achievement - not just a manifesto pledge. Mr Brown will argue that the trebling of child poverty in the past 20 years is \"the biggest single problem\" facing the country. Four in 10 children born in Britain are born into low-income households, according to ministers. \"If in the next 10 years this huge problem - which is dividing society - is not addressed, then we will have failed,\" said one source close the chancellor. Anxious to be seen by Labour activists as a redistributive chancellor, Mr Brown plans to draw attention to the new drive with a tour later this month of Britain's hardest-pressed regions. In tow will be the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, the education secretary, David Blunkett, and the DTI's Stephen Byers. They and the chancellor will visit the \"pockets of poverty\" which have missed out on the prosperity of south-east England. But the tour, which will seek to drum up investment and enterprise in deprived areas, will also be seen as an attempt to reassure the old Labour faithful that the government is not solely concerned with affluent middle England. Other headline-grabbing measures known to be under discussion include a stay-at-home credit for new mothers on low incomes, enabling them to raise newborn children without having to return early to work. A leading advocate of the move is the former social security secretary, Harriet Harman, who remains close to Mr Brown. She argues that while women have the legal right to remain home for up to six months without losing their jobs, statutory maternity pay lasting only 18 weeks causes many to leave their babies sooner than they would like. A \"baby premium\" - conceivably of up to \u00a370 a week - added to the working families' tax credit could mean that families already qualifying for the WFTC receive enough extra income to allow the mother to take her six-month leave. Mr Brown is likely to use his budget speech to rally the Labour troops in what is almost certainly the last full year before the general election. After the resignation in late January of the Blairite loyalist Peter Kilfoyle - who accused the government of lavishing too much attention on middle England - MPs want to hear a clear statement of purpose. Mr Brown will tell them that they are achieving Labour's highest purpose: having lifted 800,000 children out of poverty, the government aims to aid a million more. The chancellor also intends to announce more money for the Sure Start scheme, which helps nursery-age children, and launch a Children's Fund, to support local and charity projects that work with children. But the heart of the strategy seeks to be \"a seamless system of support for children\", bringing the children's tax credit and the portion of either income support or working families' tax credit currently allocated for a child into a single package.",

The two and half year inquiry enjoys semi-official status with home secretary Jack Straw who, after rejecting calls for a royal commission into drugs, said he would wait for the federation report before considering if any change is needed to Britain's 30-year-old drug laws. Although the popularity of ecstasy and other amphetamine derivatives peaked in 1996 when police forces seized some 5.75m doses, they have started to make a comeback - the seizure of 2m doses in 1998 was the second highest figure ever recorded.

It would also be sure to spark a fierce reaction from anti-drug campaigners and the families of ecstasy victims such as the Essex teenager Leah Betts.

But he insisted that he had not hurt Mr Danielson, saying they had become friends during the ordeal. He told jurors he wanted other prisoners - including one he labelled \"Hannibal the Cannibal\" - to speak on his behalf. But the judge had ruled that their evidence would be irrelevant.

      "body": "<p>Not so long ago the cult novelist Douglas Coupland introduced us to Generation X. Over-educated, disaffected and unable to find satisfying jobs, these alienated twenty somethings drifted aimlessly across the bleak rolling deserts of California.</p> <p> Now the UK internet industry has discovered Generation Y. This e-marketing buzzword is a direct reference to the large number of UK teenagers who have grown up in a world of exploding technology and for whom being wired up is as natural as having electricity.</p> <p> \"Their bedrooms are usually filled with a computer, a scanner, a mobile phone, a pager, a stereo and their PlayStation. They are using all the latest technology to empower themselves. It's part of their life,\" explains the Cartoon Network's head of content, Dorenna Newton. \"Their bedroom is like a virtual world. They have a social life out of their bedroom. They do not know a world without technology.\" </p> <p> According to the online industry's latest estimates, more than one in four UK teenagers regularly accesses the web, and the average 14- to 16-year-old has an annual disposable income, based on pocket money and part-time jobs, of \u00a3600. </p> <p> To win the loyalty of Generation Y, new services to encourage teenagers to spend online are being launched; a flurry of student portals have gone live; the BBC is planning to introduce a new online teenage service in the spring, and consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble has just announced it is teaming up with Excite, the internet portal company, to create a major new teenage lifestyle site. </p> <p> \"The level of penetration among teenagers is growing higher and higher,\" says the director of BBC Online, Nigel Chapman. \"They are very technology savvy. They are going to be large consumers of net material. They are the next generation and they are increasingly going to want to buy things online.\"</p> <p> The BBC foresees TV viewing habits declining among teenagers due to the competing and powerful influences of new technologies, and realises that if it is to survive the corporation has to build relationships with teenagers over the internet. </p> <p> Similarly, e-entrepreneurs have picked up on the fact that teenagers are often the key drivers of the purchase of hi-tech goods within British households. With computers being introduced into schools, technology is becoming a completely normal part of their culture. \"The big barrier has been that you can get teenagers to surf but you cannot get them to buy because they are under age for having credit cards,\" explains director of Fletcher Research, Neil Bradford. This has been frustrating for e-marketeers because they know parents have been buying for teenagers but they have not been able to capitalise on the growing online teenage market.</p> <p> But all this is about to change. New forms of internet payments and dedicated teenage shopping sites are being brought to the market. But, as usual, the UK internet industry is simply following in the footsteps of its US counterparts, who have already introduced specific teenage shopping sites such as DoughNet.com, ICanbuy.com and the wittily-named Cybermoola.com, to name but a few. In a direct pitch for Generation Y, a major teenage shopping service has been launched in the UK called Y-creds (www.Y-creds.co.uk).</p> <p> Billing itself as the ultimate online high street for Generation Y, the site allows teenagers to shop online without a credit card. Y-creds operate like traditional offline book vouchers or record tokens. Parents buy Y-creds for their teenagers and set up online accounts for them. The Y-creds site is linked to various online retailers, and through a control menu parents can designate which shops their offspring can buy from. They cannot access their children's accounts: they are informed when a transaction has occurred but are not told what has been bought. Each Y-cred is worth a modest penny and they can be bought in units of 500 costing parents a fiver.</p> <p> Goods for sale at this online high street are age-restricted so, for example, a 13-year old Madonna fan would not be allowed to buy 15-cert videos. Like most canny new online services, Y-creds has gone for a low key launch to avoid serious media scrutiny until the product has proved itself. The company is likely to begin seriously hyping itself at key commercial times such as summer holidays and half terms, as and when more retailers come on board. \"I would like to see Y-creds being used by as many different retailers as possible across the UK, empowering teenagers to shop online with their parents' permission,\" says founder Kevin Sefton. </p> <p> On the Y-creds web site, teenagers are encouraged to get their parents to \"load up\" their accounts so they can start spending, but Sefton denies he is whipping up online pester power to burn holes in the wallets of hard-working parents.</p> <p> \"I would say that parents will welcome Y-creds. They encourage financial responsibility. We are not advertising particular products. Instead we are providing mechanisms for paying for them.\" Sefton says many parents worry about how their teenagers spend money when they go shopping outdoors, and he feels Y-creds will put parents more in control and eradicate any fears of their children's pockets being picked. The long term plan, if Y-creds take off, is to create an online teenage bank. </p> <p>Already Sefton is talking to potential online banking partners who will doubtless be keen to start a relationship with potential customers of the future. Once, high street banks used to attend freshers' fairs at universities to win new accounts. Now they are taking part in virtual ones being organised by the new crop of student portal sites such as student pages (www.studentpages.com). </p> <p>Here students can visit online stalls of banks such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and click through to other sites to take advantage of specially-tailored discount deals. Students might have a reputation for spending most of their time and grant (what's left of it) boozing and eating Pot Noodles, but online marketeers know these older teenagers will be the architects of future consumer spending patterns.</p> <p> One of the leading new student sites, NowNet (www.nownet.co.uk) has tied up with consumer brands such as Tango to run treasure hunt games across its site. There is also a virtual NowNet bar and once you've clicked on the 3D bouncer at the door you enter an environment which is like a film set. In the best traditions of Tinseltown, product placement is finding a home on the student portals. In NowNet's bar students can click on a book which just happens to be lying around, and then go straight through to Waterstone's site where they can buy books. Many of the new student sites are ISPs as well, and offer free email addresses. </p> <p>The strategy is to hold on to students after they have graduated so they take their email addresses with them into the real world of work. Then the dial-up ISPs still continue to make money out of them. </p> <p> The majority of student sites are positioned as entertainment zones and go all out to get on the side of the students, which underlines the importance of appropriate content. Getting the right image for its teenage service in the spring is preoccupying BBC Online at the moment.</p> <p> \"Our teenage service has the potential to have credibility with teenagers,\" explains Chapman, who has two teenage daughters of his own. \"But we have to be very mindful of tone and be very contemporary. It is not going to be po-faced.\" Carving out its own public service niche against fierce competition from the e-entrepreneurs, BBC Online hopes to offer quality, trusted content for teenagers about issues such as drugs and health.</p> <p> But it won't be easy. What's more, the scramble to colonise the emerging online teenage audience is being waged across all platforms. Interactive TV is in the sights of most of the new teenage shopping sites and student portals. But the key gateway to teenagers is the mobile phone.</p> <p> The Cartoon Network is planning to introduce online cartoons and MP3 music files this year, and will be providing content through mobile phone companies as well. Asked about the importance of mobile phones for targeting teenagers, Cartoon Network's Dorenna Newton replies: \"Enormous. Enormous. Enormous. They will be huge. Last Christmas was a mobile Christmas.\"</p> <p>Techniques for profiling and marketing to teenagers are likely to become far more sophisticated this year. Traditionally, when a middle-aged parent bought a present for one of their children it was impossible to build up a profile of that child. But as teenagers part with their email addresses to join new teenage shopping sites, they can expect targeted offers (virtual mail shots) to automatically appear on their computer screens or phones when they log on. </p> <p> Huge amounts of creative effort are going into understanding the online behaviour of teenagers. For the non-digital generation who are currently in charge of teenage online businesses, this is hard work. The Cartoon Network finds teenage focus groups wearying. \"They always look pissed off, wearing their Nike caps the wrong way round and chewing gum,\" laughs Newton. </p> <p>But she says they come alive when they are given the chance to start testing computer games. Games are a key way to generate affection for an online brand. But there are plenty of other ways. The Cartoon Network has a Scooby Doo web cam on its site. They took a life-sized stuffed Scooby Doo toy around London and filmed it to keep their online teenage audience amused. While they are logged on, laughing at Scooby, teenagers are also being encouraged to consume advertisers' messages for cereals and chocolate bars. Sometimes e-marketing to teenagers sounds fun. But don't kid yourself. Online teenagers are commercial gold dust. These e-entrepreneurs are not playing around. It's a war out there.</p>",

To win the loyalty of Generation Y, new services to encourage teenagers to spend online are being launched; a flurry of student portals have gone live; the BBC is planning to introduce a new online teenage service in the spring, and consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble has just announced it is teaming up with Excite, the internet portal company, to create a major new teenage lifestyle site. \"The level of penetration among teenagers is growing higher and higher,\" says the director of BBC Online, Nigel Chapman. \"They are very technology savvy. They are going to be large consumers of net material. They are the next generation and they are increasingly going to want to buy things online.\" The BBC foresees TV viewing habits declining among teenagers due to the competing and powerful influences of new technologies, and realises that if it is to survive the corporation has to build relationships with teenagers over the internet. Similarly, e-entrepreneurs have picked up on the fact that teenagers are often the key drivers of the purchase of hi-tech goods within British households. With computers being introduced into schools, technology is becoming a completely normal part of their culture. \"The big barrier has been that you can get teenagers to surf but you cannot get them to buy because they are under age for having credit cards,\" explains director of Fletcher Research, Neil Bradford. This has been frustrating for e-marketeers because they know parents have been buying for teenagers but they have not been able to capitalise on the growing online teenage market. But all this is about to change. New forms of internet payments and dedicated teenage shopping sites are being brought to the market. But, as usual, the UK internet industry is simply following in the footsteps of its US counterparts, who have already introduced specific teenage shopping sites such as DoughNet.com, ICanbuy.com and the wittily-named Cybermoola.com, to name but a few. In a direct pitch for Generation Y, a major teenage shopping service has been launched in the UK called Y-creds (www.Y-creds.co.uk). Billing itself as the ultimate online high street for Generation Y, the site allows teenagers to shop online without a credit card. Y-creds operate like traditional offline book vouchers or record tokens. Parents buy Y-creds for their teenagers and set up online accounts for them. The Y-creds site is linked to various online retailers, and through a control menu parents can designate which shops their offspring can buy from. They cannot access their children's accounts: they are informed when a transaction has occurred but are not told what has been bought. Each Y-cred is worth a modest penny and they can be bought in units of 500 costing parents a fiver. Goods for sale at this online high street are age-restricted so, for example, a 13-year old Madonna fan would not be allowed to buy 15-cert videos. Like most canny new online services, Y-creds has gone for a low key launch to avoid serious media scrutiny until the product has proved itself. The company is likely to begin seriously hyping itself at key commercial times such as summer holidays and half terms, as and when more retailers come on board. \"I would like to see Y-creds being used by as many different retailers as possible across the UK, empowering teenagers to shop online with their parents' permission,\" says founder Kevin Sefton. On the Y-creds web site, teenagers are encouraged to get their parents to \"load up\" their accounts so they can start spending, but Sefton denies he is whipping up online pester power to burn holes in the wallets of hard-working parents. \"I would say that parents will welcome Y-creds. They encourage financial responsibility. We are not advertising particular products. Instead we are providing mechanisms for paying for them.\" Sefton says many parents worry about how their teenagers spend money when they go shopping outdoors, and he feels Y-creds will put parents more in control and eradicate any fears of their children's pockets being picked. The long term plan, if Y-creds take off, is to create an online teenage bank. Already Sefton is talking to potential online banking partners who will doubtless be keen to start a relationship with potential customers of the future. Once, high street banks used to attend freshers' fairs at universities to win new accounts. Now they are taking part in virtual ones being organised by the new crop of student portal sites such as student pages (www.studentpages.com). Here students can visit online stalls of banks such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and click through to other sites to take advantage of specially-tailored discount deals. Students might have a reputation for spending most of their time and grant (what's left of it) boozing and eating Pot Noodles, but online marketeers know these older teenagers will be the architects of future consumer spending patterns. One of the leading new student sites, NowNet (www.nownet.co.uk) has tied up with consumer brands such as Tango to run treasure hunt games across its site. There is also a virtual NowNet bar and once you've clicked on the 3D bouncer at the door you enter an environment which is like a film set. In the best traditions of Tinseltown, product placement is finding a home on the student portals. In NowNet's bar students can click on a book which just happens to be lying around, and then go straight through to Waterstone's site where they can buy books. Many of the new student sites are ISPs as well, and offer free email addresses. The strategy is to hold on to students after they have graduated so they take their email addresses with them into the real world of work. Then the dial-up ISPs still continue to make money out of them. The majority of student sites are positioned as entertainment zones and go all out to get on the side of the students, which underlines the importance of appropriate content. Getting the right image for its teenage service in the spring is preoccupying BBC Online at the moment. \"Our teenage service has the potential to have credibility with teenagers,\" explains Chapman, who has two teenage daughters of his own. \"But we have to be very mindful of tone and be very contemporary. It is not going to be po-faced.\" Carving out its own public service niche against fierce competition from the e-entrepreneurs, BBC Online hopes to offer quality, trusted content for teenagers about issues such as drugs and health. But it won't be easy. What's more, the scramble to colonise the emerging online teenage audience is being waged across all platforms. Interactive TV is in the sights of most of the new teenage shopping sites and student portals. But the key gateway to teenagers is the mobile phone. The Cartoon Network is planning to introduce online cartoons and MP3 music files this year, and will be providing content through mobile phone companies as well. Asked about the importance of mobile phones for targeting teenagers, Cartoon Network's Dorenna Newton replies: \"Enormous. Enormous. Enormous. They will be huge. Last Christmas was a mobile Christmas.\" Techniques for profiling and marketing to teenagers are likely to become far more sophisticated this year. Traditionally, when a middle-aged parent bought a present for one of their children it was impossible to build up a profile of that child. But as teenagers part with their email addresses to join new teenage shopping sites, they can expect targeted offers (virtual mail shots) to automatically appear on their computer screens or phones when they log on. Huge amounts of creative effort are going into understanding the online behaviour of teenagers. For the non-digital generation who are currently in charge of teenage online businesses, this is hard work. The Cartoon Network finds teenage focus groups wearying. \"They always look pissed off, wearing their Nike caps the wrong way round and chewing gum,\" laughs Newton. But she says they come alive when they are given the chance to start testing computer games. Games are a key way to generate affection for an online brand. But there are plenty of other ways. The Cartoon Network has a Scooby Doo web cam on its site. They took a life-sized stuffed Scooby Doo toy around London and filmed it to keep their online teenage audience amused. While they are logged on, laughing at Scooby, teenagers are also being encouraged to consume advertisers' messages for cereals and chocolate bars. Sometimes e-marketing to teenagers sounds fun. But don't kid yourself. Online teenagers are commercial gold dust. These e-entrepreneurs are not playing around. It's a war out there.",

      "body": "<p>Germany's scandal-ravaged conservatives were last night bracing themselves for a leadership struggle that will decide whether their party lives or dies as an effective force at the heart of European politics.</p> <p>The leader of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, had earlier given up a month-long struggle to hold on to power - his authority devastated by an overnight party rebellion.</p> <p>At a hastily convened press conference in Berlin, Mr Sch\u00e4uble suggested the point had been reached at which the future of German democracy itself was in play. \"The CDU's crisis must not be allowed to become a crisis for democracy,\" he said. \"This goal overrides all others.\"</p> <p>For almost four months, the public has watched in stupefaction as a scandal over the funding of the Christian Democrats has ripped through the right, wrecking the reputations of its former leader, Helmut Kohl, and many of his erstwhile aides. The authority of Mr Sch\u00e4uble, a Kohl loyalist who repeatedly changed the story of his own role in the affair, was left in ruins.</p> <p>He said he was making way for a younger leader, untainted by the shady practices of the Kohl era: \"I have become convinced that the [Christian Democrat] Union cannot free itself from the clutches of this crisis without a visible new start at the top.\"</p> <p>A party which has shown reluctance to cut itself free of the past will need to act boldly to salvage the situation. Recent polls have shown the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, holding on to barely a quarter of the national vote.</p> <p>Yet the timetable is comparatively leisurely. Mr Sch\u00e4uble will be replaced as head of the parliamentary party next week. But the CDU is not due to elect a new leader until a conference in April.</p> <p>In the meantime, it faces the prospect of a string of further revelations, as the origin of most of its undeclared financing is still unknown. It also looks set for electoral humiliation in the state of Schleswig-Holstein where voters go to the polls to choose a new government in 10 days' time.</p> <p>It was the threat of yet more punishment in the May elections in North Rhine-Westphalia which sealed Mr Sch\u00e4uble's fate. MPs from the area led a surprise revolt against the party leader at a meeting of the parliamentary group on Tuesday, held shortly after the Christian Democrats learned that they would have to forfeit some \u00a314m in state subsidies as a penalty for past misdemeanours. The general secretary of the ruling Social Democrats, Franz M\u00fcntefering, claimed: \"Panic broke out.\"</p> <p>Mr Sch\u00e4uble's credibility was already in doubt. Last month, he survived as leader despite admitting what he had earlier omitted to tell parliament - that he had accepted an anonymous cash donation from Karlheinz Schreiber, the German-Canadian businessman whose disclosures set off the scandal. He blamed the then party treasurer for failing to declare the gift as required by law.</p> <p>But last weekend, the former treasurer, Brigitte Baumeister, swore an affidavit contradicting Mr Sch\u00e4uble's version of events, and her account was backed by Mr Schreiber. Though a majority of senior party officials sided with Mr Sch\u00e4uble, few were ready for a confrontation between him and Ms Baumeister.</p> <p>There has also been growing concern over the creation of a vacuum on the right that could be filled by a populist demagogue. The entry into government of J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party in Austria underscored the danger.</p> <p>Mr Sch\u00e4uble did not answer any questions after reading a statement yesterday. He left open the question of who should succeed him. The CDU was expected to split the posts of party leader, which he took over from Helmut Kohl in 1998, from that of head of the party's parliamentary group, which he has held since 1991.</p> <p>Mr Kohl remains at the centre of the affair. He has admitted accepting \u00a3670,000 in secret funds, but refuses to identify the source of the money, saying he gave his word of honour not to do so.</p> <p>But the contributions he handled are dwarfed by others known or alleged to have been made during the 25 years he held the party leadership.</p> <p>The biggest single amount, which the former chancellor hotly denies receiving, was allegedly paid by the French state under President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. It is claimed that the money was skimmed from the price of an East German refinery sold to the oil company Elf Aquitaine.</p> <p>The current administration has said that documents relating to the sale have gone missing and the Christian Democrats face further embarrassment today when a public hearing by an all-party parliamentary commission of inquiry will start looking into their disappearance.</p> <p><b>The candidates for a tarnished crown</b></p> <p><b>Volker R\u00fche </b><br></p> <p>Post-war Germany's longest serving defence minister. Able and forceful, but handicapped by his long record of loyalty to the now discredited former chancellor, the 47-year-old Mr Ruhe's career has also brought him uncomfortably close to the course of the present scandal. He was general secretary when much of the money was flowing through slush funds</p> <p><b>Bernhard Vogel </b><br></p> <p>First choice if the party opts for an elder statesman as stop-gap leader. He is a 67-year-old westerner who runs the eastern region of Th\u00fcringen. He lectured at Heidelberg before embarking on a career that brought him the leadership of of the regional government in Rhineland-Palatinate, the speakership of the upper house and the chairmanship of Germany's second public broadcasting network, ZDF</p> <p><b> Friedrich Merz</b><br></p> <p>The Christian Democrats' budgetary expert. A 44-year-old Roman Catholic lawyer from Cologne, he has also been tipped to take over the parliamentary party if the leadership is split. When Angela Merkel became the first party official to distance herself from Helmut Kohl last December, Mr Merz was one of the few MPs to back her publicly</p> <p>The CDU candidate to lead the government of North Rhine-Westphalia, epicentre of the revolt which yesterday toppled Mr Sch\u00e4uble. The 48-year-old Mr R\u00fcttgers used to hold the education and research portfolio in Mr Kohl's cabinet - a job which earned him the nickname \"minister for the future\". This past could hold him back now, though he is younger than Mr R\u00fche and less closely linked to the Kohl era</p> <p><b> Angela Merkel</b><br></p> <p>As general secretary, she has been the public face of the CDU since the crisis broke. Though she was a Kohl protege after reunification in 1990, there is no evidence Ms Merkel, a former East German dissident, knew of his shadier dealings.

      "bodyText": "Germany's scandal-ravaged conservatives were last night bracing themselves for a leadership struggle that will decide whether their party lives or dies as an effective force at the heart of European politics. The leader of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, had earlier given up a month-long struggle to hold on to power - his authority devastated by an overnight party rebellion. At a hastily convened press conference in Berlin, Mr Sch\u00e4uble suggested the point had been reached at which the future of German democracy itself was in play. \"The CDU's crisis must not be allowed to become a crisis for democracy,\" he said. \"This goal overrides all others.\" For almost four months, the public has watched in stupefaction as a scandal over the funding of the Christian Democrats has ripped through the right, wrecking the reputations of its former leader, Helmut Kohl, and many of his erstwhile aides. The authority of Mr Sch\u00e4uble, a Kohl loyalist who repeatedly changed the story of his own role in the affair, was left in ruins. He said he was making way for a younger leader, untainted by the shady practices of the Kohl era: \"I have become convinced that the [Christian Democrat] Union cannot free itself from the clutches of this crisis without a visible new start at the top.\" A party which has shown reluctance to cut itself free of the past will need to act boldly to salvage the situation. Recent polls have shown the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, holding on to barely a quarter of the national vote. Yet the timetable is comparatively leisurely. Mr Sch\u00e4uble will be replaced as head of the parliamentary party next week. But the CDU is not due to elect a new leader until a conference in April. In the meantime, it faces the prospect of a string of further revelations, as the origin of most of its undeclared financing is still unknown. It also looks set for electoral humiliation in the state of Schleswig-Holstein where voters go to the polls to choose a new government in 10 days' time. It was the threat of yet more punishment in the May elections in North Rhine-Westphalia which sealed Mr Sch\u00e4uble's fate. MPs from the area led a surprise revolt against the party leader at a meeting of the parliamentary group on Tuesday, held shortly after the Christian Democrats learned that they would have to forfeit some \u00a314m in state subsidies as a penalty for past misdemeanours. The general secretary of the ruling Social Democrats, Franz M\u00fcntefering, claimed: \"Panic broke out.\" Mr Sch\u00e4uble's credibility was already in doubt. Last month, he survived as leader despite admitting what he had earlier omitted to tell parliament - that he had accepted an anonymous cash donation from Karlheinz Schreiber, the German-Canadian businessman whose disclosures set off the scandal. He blamed the then party treasurer for failing to declare the gift as required by law. But last weekend, the former treasurer, Brigitte Baumeister, swore an affidavit contradicting Mr Sch\u00e4uble's version of events, and her account was backed by Mr Schreiber. Though a majority of senior party officials sided with Mr Sch\u00e4uble, few were ready for a confrontation between him and Ms Baumeister. There has also been growing concern over the creation of a vacuum on the right that could be filled by a populist demagogue. The entry into government of J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party in Austria underscored the danger. Mr Sch\u00e4uble did not answer any questions after reading a statement yesterday. He left open the question of who should succeed him. The CDU was expected to split the posts of party leader, which he took over from Helmut Kohl in 1998, from that of head of the party's parliamentary group, which he has held since 1991. Mr Kohl remains at the centre of the affair. He has admitted accepting \u00a3670,000 in secret funds, but refuses to identify the source of the money, saying he gave his word of honour not to do so. But the contributions he handled are dwarfed by others known or alleged to have been made during the 25 years he held the party leadership. The biggest single amount, which the former chancellor hotly denies receiving, was allegedly paid by the French state under President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. It is claimed that the money was skimmed from the price of an East German refinery sold to the oil company Elf Aquitaine. The current administration has said that documents relating to the sale have gone missing and the Christian Democrats face further embarrassment today when a public hearing by an all-party parliamentary commission of inquiry will start looking into their disappearance. The candidates for a tarnished crown Volker R\u00fche Post-war Germany's longest serving defence minister. Able and forceful, but handicapped by his long record of loyalty to the now discredited former chancellor, the 47-year-old Mr Ruhe's career has also brought him uncomfortably close to the course of the present scandal. He was general secretary when much of the money was flowing through slush funds Bernhard Vogel First choice if the party opts for an elder statesman as stop-gap leader. He is a 67-year-old westerner who runs the eastern region of Th\u00fcringen. He lectured at Heidelberg before embarking on a career that brought him the leadership of of the regional government in Rhineland-Palatinate, the speakership of the upper house and the chairmanship of Germany's second public broadcasting network, ZDF Friedrich Merz The Christian Democrats' budgetary expert. A 44-year-old Roman Catholic lawyer from Cologne, he has also been tipped to take over the parliamentary party if the leadership is split. When Angela Merkel became the first party official to distance herself from Helmut Kohl last December, Mr Merz was one of the few MPs to back her publicly The CDU candidate to lead the government of North Rhine-Westphalia, epicentre of the revolt which yesterday toppled Mr Sch\u00e4uble. The 48-year-old Mr R\u00fcttgers used to hold the education and research portfolio in Mr Kohl's cabinet - a job which earned him the nickname \"minister for the future\". This past could hold him back now, though he is younger than Mr R\u00fche and less closely linked to the Kohl era Angela Merkel As general secretary, she has been the public face of the CDU since the crisis broke. Though she was a Kohl protege after reunification in 1990, there is no evidence Ms Merkel, a former East German dissident, knew of his shadier dealings. At 45, she is young enough to represent a clean start",

      "body": "<p>Camilla Carr is sweeping through her photograph album. \"Ah, there it is. I'm so glad I've found this picture.\" A woman is slumped against a man. The woman looks transparent, bloodless, malnourished, her mind long gone. She appears to be wearing a symbolic crown, but it is just a doodle in the background. She could be the craziest of Ophelias.</p> <p>\"That was taken when we were in captivity.\" The photograph is of Carr and her boyfriend, Jon James, who is now her husband, They were kidnapped in Grozny, Chechnya, on July 4 1997, and released 14 months later. Today, Carr looks strong and healthy, a good 20 years younger, and is back campaigning for the children of Chechnya.</p> <p>Carr and James left Britain to work in a children's community centre in April 1997. She was an art and tai chi teacher, he was a builder who had worked with disabled kids. They bought a Lada for \u00a3500, stuffed it with paints and modelling clay and footballs and set off for the breakaway republic. The aid agency, the Centre for Peacemaking and Community Development, had asked them if they fancied spending six months developing a programme for The Little Star Centre. \"It was just one of those occasions when you know it feels right, when your heart leaps.\"</p> <p>It was always going to be an adventure as well as a mission. But as soon as they arrived, they realised they had made the right decision. \"It was worth it, I tell you. They had nothing, literally nothing.\" The neediest children had been picked by local psychologists, and Carr and James set to work. \"The main aim was to make them relax, start smiling again, to get them playing like children again. A lot of them had forgotten how to.\"</p> <p>Carr flicks through the photo album to the pictures of the kids grinning through their face paint, dancing for joy, mastering silly walks.</p> <p>The couple knew there were dangers in Grozny - it was already regarded as the kidnap capital of the world. They needed a guard and their building had bars on the windows. For two months, the scheme went brilliantly. Then they were abducted in the middle of the night.</p> <p>Carr is now living with James at her mother's house in Bath. The broadcaster and former hostage John McCarthy once said it takes as long a time as you were kidnapped to return to normality. Carr says she's beginning to feel she's got there. She left Britain unknown, a slightly hippie-dippie free spirit, and returned a tortured cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre . She had a great few weeks sucking in the fresh air, glowing in the natural light, talking to all the friends she had missed, hugging her son. Then she collapsed. \"We were much more exhausted than we realised. I just went dizzy, and that was it. I was very weepy, had to lie in bed for three weeks. It was just like letting it all go.\"</p> <p>Around that time, three British engineers who had been abducted in Grozny were found beheaded. Carr says that hit her as hard as anything, and she made a conscious decision to distance herself from that particular horror, to stop herself going under.</p> <p>There was a great deal Carr and James had to let go of. They had been held captive in a cell four metres by three, with only a tiny drain for ventilation.The temperature at times was more than 38C (100F), at other times it was freezing, Carr was raped regularly over a six-week period by one kidnapper. James was threatened with a knife at his throat and beaten.</p> <p>After a couple of months, James proposed. \"We had had a really bad day . . . mental torture, threats. That night they said they were going to take Jon away. They were trying to make us admit we were spies. There would be two of them going on and on, 'Who d'you work for? Who d'you work for?' And saying 'I don't believe you, whatever you say.' \" At times, Carr was tempted to say MI6, to give them what they wanted, even though it wasn't true. She giggles at the memory. Could she laugh at the time? \"No. It was hell.\"</p> <p>Carr has a lovely way with understatement. She says things were so much harder for James, what with the knife to the throat \"and the odd punch to the chest\". Even when she talks about the rapes, she says how awful it was for James, how brilliant he was about it. While she felt mainly grief, he felt anger. \"He was manacled in another room. Impotent. He couldn't do anything. There were a couple of times when Jon could have overcome this guard who was raping me, and we decided not to because it could have made it worse.\"</p> <p>Did they actually talk specifically about the rapes? Suddenly she loses her words. \"No. Yes. No . . . after the first time . . . I hate using the word rape.\" She looks towards the photo album on the floor. \"I didn't want to think I had been. I didn't want to use that word. But now I've got used to it. If I'd held it inside without talking about it, it would have become like a disease.\" Carr resisted the first time, and after that decided it would be pointless and painful. \"Jon was brilliant,\" she repeats. \"He didn't react, didn't get angry. He prayed a lot.\" Are they religious? \"No, spiritual.\"</p> <p>What was her main sense of grief? \"The family. We've both got sons, and my son, Ashok, was 11 when I was kidnapped. In the end you have to imagine they're OK. They might have had a car accident, you just don't know. You hold them in your mind all the time.\"</p> <p>Carr, 42, is now writing a book about her ordeal, which she thinks may be useful to people, not necessarily hostages. In their tiny space, she and James created room for yoga and tai chi. Like the Beirut hostages, Carr closed her eyes and took day trips to the beach. For a while they shared a cell with Valentin Vlasov, the Russian presidential envoy. Carr said that when he arrived he was tense and angry. He asked how they managed to survive.

Carr asks, bewildered, why or how the Russians can refuse to let boys over 10 and men under 60 to leave the country, how they can put them into filtration camps that are really concentration camps. \"I think they need a scapegoat because Russia is in such a bad state economically . . .

      "bodyText": "Camilla Carr is sweeping through her photograph album. \"Ah, there it is. I'm so glad I've found this picture.\" A woman is slumped against a man. The woman looks transparent, bloodless, malnourished, her mind long gone. She appears to be wearing a symbolic crown, but it is just a doodle in the background. She could be the craziest of Ophelias. \"That was taken when we were in captivity.\" The photograph is of Carr and her boyfriend, Jon James, who is now her husband, They were kidnapped in Grozny, Chechnya, on July 4 1997, and released 14 months later. Today, Carr looks strong and healthy, a good 20 years younger, and is back campaigning for the children of Chechnya. Carr and James left Britain to work in a children's community centre in April 1997. She was an art and tai chi teacher, he was a builder who had worked with disabled kids. They bought a Lada for \u00a3500, stuffed it with paints and modelling clay and footballs and set off for the breakaway republic. The aid agency, the Centre for Peacemaking and Community Development, had asked them if they fancied spending six months developing a programme for The Little Star Centre. \"It was just one of those occasions when you know it feels right, when your heart leaps.\" It was always going to be an adventure as well as a mission. But as soon as they arrived, they realised they had made the right decision. \"It was worth it, I tell you. They had nothing, literally nothing.\" The neediest children had been picked by local psychologists, and Carr and James set to work. \"The main aim was to make them relax, start smiling again, to get them playing like children again. A lot of them had forgotten how to.\" Carr flicks through the photo album to the pictures of the kids grinning through their face paint, dancing for joy, mastering silly walks. The couple knew there were dangers in Grozny - it was already regarded as the kidnap capital of the world. They needed a guard and their building had bars on the windows. For two months, the scheme went brilliantly. Then they were abducted in the middle of the night. Carr is now living with James at her mother's house in Bath. The broadcaster and former hostage John McCarthy once said it takes as long a time as you were kidnapped to return to normality. Carr says she's beginning to feel she's got there. She left Britain unknown, a slightly hippie-dippie free spirit, and returned a tortured cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre . She had a great few weeks sucking in the fresh air, glowing in the natural light, talking to all the friends she had missed, hugging her son. Then she collapsed. \"We were much more exhausted than we realised. I just went dizzy, and that was it. I was very weepy, had to lie in bed for three weeks. It was just like letting it all go.\" Around that time, three British engineers who had been abducted in Grozny were found beheaded. Carr says that hit her as hard as anything, and she made a conscious decision to distance herself from that particular horror, to stop herself going under. There was a great deal Carr and James had to let go of. They had been held captive in a cell four metres by three, with only a tiny drain for ventilation.The temperature at times was more than 38C (100F), at other times it was freezing, Carr was raped regularly over a six-week period by one kidnapper. James was threatened with a knife at his throat and beaten. After a couple of months, James proposed. \"We had had a really bad day . . . mental torture, threats. That night they said they were going to take Jon away. They were trying to make us admit we were spies. There would be two of them going on and on, 'Who d'you work for? Who d'you work for?' And saying 'I don't believe you, whatever you say.' \" At times, Carr was tempted to say MI6, to give them what they wanted, even though it wasn't true. She giggles at the memory. Could she laugh at the time? \"No. It was hell.\" Carr has a lovely way with understatement. She says things were so much harder for James, what with the knife to the throat \"and the odd punch to the chest\". Even when she talks about the rapes, she says how awful it was for James, how brilliant he was about it. While she felt mainly grief, he felt anger. \"He was manacled in another room. Impotent. He couldn't do anything. There were a couple of times when Jon could have overcome this guard who was raping me, and we decided not to because it could have made it worse.\" Did they actually talk specifically about the rapes? Suddenly she loses her words. \"No. Yes. No . . . after the first time . . . I hate using the word rape.\" She looks towards the photo album on the floor. \"I didn't want to think I had been. I didn't want to use that word. But now I've got used to it. If I'd held it inside without talking about it, it would have become like a disease.\" Carr resisted the first time, and after that decided it would be pointless and painful. \"Jon was brilliant,\" she repeats. \"He didn't react, didn't get angry. He prayed a lot.\" Are they religious? \"No, spiritual.\" What was her main sense of grief? \"The family. We've both got sons, and my son, Ashok, was 11 when I was kidnapped. In the end you have to imagine they're OK. They might have had a car accident, you just don't know. You hold them in your mind all the time.\" Carr, 42, is now writing a book about her ordeal, which she thinks may be useful to people, not necessarily hostages. In their tiny space, she and James created room for yoga and tai chi. Like the Beirut hostages, Carr closed her eyes and took day trips to the beach. For a while they shared a cell with Valentin Vlasov, the Russian presidential envoy. Carr said that when he arrived he was tense and angry. He asked how they managed to survive. So they taught him breathing exercises, foot massage, how to smile through your whole body. And that was enough to keep her from despair? \"No. I was really fearful of being physically tortured, of not being able to take the pain. Mental torture I could work with to a certain extent, but physical torture . . . So I used to think how I could cope with that, and I had this belief that I could shut down all my body functions just by using my mind. I'd just shut off so I'd die.\" For the first seven months she considered this option as well as a more traditional means of suicide - there was often broken glass strewn around the cell. But for the last seven months they were not tortured and they became mentally stronger, resolute. They began to talk to their kidnappers and discovered that three of them had lived in Russia and that each had had relatives killed. By night they fought in the mountains and then ran back 20 miles before dawn every day to resume family life. I say that also sounds like a form of torture. \"Yes. It made me extremely sad. It made me understand how war destroys a balanced mind. Once you get an unbalanced mind, desperation sets in. You can't tell how anybody would react whose been a victim of war, whose wife or children have been killed, whose houses have been bombed. In a way it helped me feel sympathy towards the kidnappers. They've been through it. It didn't justify what they did to us, but it makes me wish I could do more to change how things happen in the world. You know . . . there are other ways of solving problems without having to resort to violence and conflict.\" The kidnap of the British couple had enormous consequences for Chechnya and became a valuable PR tool for Russia. When asked why they were so intent on reclaiming or destroying the republic, Russian leaders pointed to the kidnappings and said this was a land of criminals. Law and order had to be seen to triumph.

      "body": "<p>The Church of England is so strapped for cash, the Guardian reported on Tuesday, that it may have to seek corporate sponsorship for students training to enter the priesthood. My friend Clive, who's in marketing, says this sort of development makes him despair of the poor old C of E. Why on earth, he demands, has it taken them till the opening years of the 21st century to catch up with techniques which have been commonplace everywhere else for decades?</p> <p>I must say I could see what he meant when we turned up the other day for evensong at Salisbury Cathedral. It is always instructive to see a familiar world through the eyes of a seasoned pro, and I expected we might be in for some powerful innovative thinking as I heard Clive chuntering away to himself through the Nunc Dimittis . Where you and I might see only a church, people like Clive see a howling great commercial opportunity going to waste. The raiment, for instance. The bishop wasn't on duty that Sunday but we were both deeply impressed by all the various uniforms worn by the other functionaries, especially their vibrant colours. I had never previously realised that each cathedral has its own colour scheme. But as Clive pointed out with characteristic asperity, the church has failed to cash in on the implications. \"Every time I turn on the TV\" he grumbled \"I hear someone saying football is the new religion. So why can't religion become the new football?\"</p> <p>Sure enough, the cathedral shop, though choc-a-bloc with commemorative tea towels and mugs, had not a single replica surplice on offer. You'd have thought, as I said to Clive, that in this day and age you'd be able to buy a full set of home kits, through from number one, the bishop, to 35, the verger, with a change strip for any occasion when Salisbury clergy visit another cathedral which sports the same colours. And, as Clive observed with his usual percipience, what an opportunity they are missing for sponsorship! \"Just think Man United and Vodafone!\" he exploded. \"Talk about low-hanging fruit! Imagine the impact of having \"Interflora\" or \"Dunkin' Donuts\" displayed on the chests of the dean and chapter! Could bring in millions.\"</p> <p>I put it to Clive that some worshippers might find this kind of approach a little bit mercenary, but he told me this was off message. Take the parable of the Good Samaritan, he said: as Margaret Thatcher had once pointed out, he wouldn't have had the wherewithal to assist the needy if he hadn't made his mint first. And then there was the parable of the talents. Hadn't I noticed it was those who exploited their assets to the fullest commercial advantage who came out of the story best? Yet the C of E, Clive complained, had incomparable assets whose potential they never realised. Take cathedrals. If George Carey had any sense, he would get the cathedrals sponsored. Maybe \"Carling Canterbury Cathedral\" might be considered a trifle over the top, but something a bit more decorous - \"Canterbury Cathedral, sponsored by Axa\" for instance - would be a win-win situation. Also, when the government wanted a dome, why hadn't George had the nous to offer St Paul's on lease for a year, thus diverting a chunk of the \u00a3758m wasted at Greenwich into C of E funds?</p> <p>\"What's more, they still haven't even begun to think global\" he raged as we walked round the cloister. \"Just look at the way the clubs have made the premiership so much more glamourous by buying in foreign stars. It's time we learned to think of our bishops as the premiership of the church. Just imagine how the takings would rise if Salisbury appointed someone like David Ginola, with his mazy ball skills and smouldering good looks! That would soon fill the pews, I can tell you. The RCs, by the way, are no better. Just look at this fellow they've picked to succeed Basil Hume at Westminster. Sixty-seven-years-old - and he's double-barrelled. I ask you: is that really the sort of image a kid can wear on a t-shirt?\"</p> <p>I must say my friend Clive, who, as I think I have said, is in marketing, helps you see the world in a much more practical way. Driving back across Salisbury Plain I noticed that most of the fields were used in ways which totally failed to exploit their potential. Here and there you could spot the odd sheep or pig or a crop of some kind or other, but the real money-spinning opportunities were going to waste. Instead of whingeing to Tony Blair and clamouring for additional subsidy, why don't farmers exploit the commercial value of so many roadside sites? In my youth you used while riding in railway trains to see effigies in the fields representing two men carrying boards with legends like \"Charrington's Coal\" and \"Hall's Paints\". But never today. What on earth is wrong with this country?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Church of England is so strapped for cash, the Guardian reported on Tuesday, that it may have to seek corporate sponsorship for students training to enter the priesthood. My friend Clive, who's in marketing, says this sort of development makes him despair of the poor old C of E. Why on earth, he demands, has it taken them till the opening years of the 21st century to catch up with techniques which have been commonplace everywhere else for decades? I must say I could see what he meant when we turned up the other day for evensong at Salisbury Cathedral. It is always instructive to see a familiar world through the eyes of a seasoned pro, and I expected we might be in for some powerful innovative thinking as I heard Clive chuntering away to himself through the Nunc Dimittis . Where you and I might see only a church, people like Clive see a howling great commercial opportunity going to waste. The raiment, for instance. The bishop wasn't on duty that Sunday but we were both deeply impressed by all the various uniforms worn by the other functionaries, especially their vibrant colours. I had never previously realised that each cathedral has its own colour scheme. But as Clive pointed out with characteristic asperity, the church has failed to cash in on the implications. \"Every time I turn on the TV\" he grumbled \"I hear someone saying football is the new religion. So why can't religion become the new football?\" Sure enough, the cathedral shop, though choc-a-bloc with commemorative tea towels and mugs, had not a single replica surplice on offer. You'd have thought, as I said to Clive, that in this day and age you'd be able to buy a full set of home kits, through from number one, the bishop, to 35, the verger, with a change strip for any occasion when Salisbury clergy visit another cathedral which sports the same colours. And, as Clive observed with his usual percipience, what an opportunity they are missing for sponsorship! \"Just think Man United and Vodafone!\" he exploded. \"Talk about low-hanging fruit! Imagine the impact of having \"Interflora\" or \"Dunkin' Donuts\" displayed on the chests of the dean and chapter! Could bring in millions.\" I put it to Clive that some worshippers might find this kind of approach a little bit mercenary, but he told me this was off message. Take the parable of the Good Samaritan, he said: as Margaret Thatcher had once pointed out, he wouldn't have had the wherewithal to assist the needy if he hadn't made his mint first. And then there was the parable of the talents. Hadn't I noticed it was those who exploited their assets to the fullest commercial advantage who came out of the story best? Yet the C of E, Clive complained, had incomparable assets whose potential they never realised. Take cathedrals. If George Carey had any sense, he would get the cathedrals sponsored. Maybe \"Carling Canterbury Cathedral\" might be considered a trifle over the top, but something a bit more decorous - \"Canterbury Cathedral, sponsored by Axa\" for instance - would be a win-win situation. Also, when the government wanted a dome, why hadn't George had the nous to offer St Paul's on lease for a year, thus diverting a chunk of the \u00a3758m wasted at Greenwich into C of E funds? \"What's more, they still haven't even begun to think global\" he raged as we walked round the cloister. \"Just look at the way the clubs have made the premiership so much more glamourous by buying in foreign stars. It's time we learned to think of our bishops as the premiership of the church. Just imagine how the takings would rise if Salisbury appointed someone like David Ginola, with his mazy ball skills and smouldering good looks! That would soon fill the pews, I can tell you. The RCs, by the way, are no better. Just look at this fellow they've picked to succeed Basil Hume at Westminster. Sixty-seven-years-old - and he's double-barrelled. I ask you: is that really the sort of image a kid can wear on a t-shirt?\" I must say my friend Clive, who, as I think I have said, is in marketing, helps you see the world in a much more practical way. Driving back across Salisbury Plain I noticed that most of the fields were used in ways which totally failed to exploit their potential. Here and there you could spot the odd sheep or pig or a crop of some kind or other, but the real money-spinning opportunities were going to waste. Instead of whingeing to Tony Blair and clamouring for additional subsidy, why don't farmers exploit the commercial value of so many roadside sites? In my youth you used while riding in railway trains to see effigies in the fields representing two men carrying boards with legends like \"Charrington's Coal\" and \"Hall's Paints\". But never today. What on earth is wrong with this country?",

Of all the grins, his is the closest replica of the leader's own: same angle, same fakery, same unease, same eyebrows quizzically raised. These are political brothers, we learn.

His greatest quality is resilience, a negative attribute. Even No 10 can't forbear to marvel, genuinely. Hague has the indestructible public confidence of the truly insensitive performer. Because he has read all the texts, he knows how leaders should behave, and duly plays the rule-book which says he must always come up smiling. His capacity for embarrassment is cauterised. Which is just as well, since there is much for Tories to be embarrassed about, starting with their inability to exploit a single one of the government's recent failures.</p> <p>But in a leader resilience is not enough. At his best, Hague's cheeky-chappy wit in the Commons can seem to be issuing from the ghost of Harold Wilson. Unfortunately, Tony Blair is not Alec Douglas-Home, the dying fall-guy of an ancien regime. However each man might struggle to conceal it, Hague is less credible than Portillo. He just is. It's the difference between a man who was Welsh secretary and one who was employment secretary, defence secretary and chief secretary. But there are other angles too. Where Hague is simple, Portillo is mysterious: Hague exposed, Portillo menacing: Hague slight, Portillo heavy: Hague quietly desperate, Portillo apparently serene.</p> <p>Portillo acquires this from being the hero-in-waiting. He has every reason to be loyal, because the last thing he wants is for Hague to slip, this side of an election. But it is axiomatic that he awaits the crown.

Merely by being there, he keeps the Hague issue alive. He is the bigger man, yet he could be double trouble. An army of infatuated party bloods gathers round him, while out in the country the ridicule for Hague is matched, perhaps exceeded, by the hatred for Portillo. He's the living face, the only one anyone remembers that's still extant, of the Major years. Two television series, offered free, gratis and for nothing for self-promotion, seem not to have eradicated the connection. Portillo is still unloved by the nation whose sovereignty he and Hague make it their prime business to defend - as it increasingly sounds, forever - against the European enemy.</p> <p>Their first outing on the truck, to make this case, turned into a farce. The truck was a phony. Hague didn't arrive in it, leave in it, or speak from it. But more important, the issue turned out to be a non-event. Despite the massive publicity surrounding the anti-euro case, and the seething passions said to be at large in the uncontrollably Eurosceptic soul of the British people, it was hard to find a single free citizen of St Albans turning up to listen to Hague, among the small multitudes of media people and press-ganged local Tories. Here was the great Tory election issue - the conspiratorial fate from which this party alone will save the pound and the people - having its first formal outing on the campaign trail, and an entire town had better things to do.</p> <p>This wasn't just Hague's farce, however. It was a Hague-Portillo event. The hero darkly lurking is drawn to the front of the stage. That is probably the point of Hague's manoeuvre to promote him. He handed a poisoned chalice to the man already designated as his future nemesis. By giving him complete command over Tory economic policy, he may have made a surrender which no other leader in the history of parties anywhere has ever done. But it brings his rival into the frame of culpability when Gordon Brown's economic record has proved too strong to induce enough voters to desert the Labour ticket. While Portillo's presence encourages daily turmoil in the output of spinners and speculators, at the same time it is guaranteed to diminish his value after the defeat.</p> <p>This is not, in short, a partnership made in heaven. There's no such thing as reliable political brotherhood. Ultimately, all politicians, the higher they get, are rivals and therefore loners. The complex Blair-Brown entanglements are testimony to that. But when parties are running strong, these human frailties do not matter much. When parties struggle under neurosis and impending failure, they cannot possibly afford the kind of combat - inexplicit and unwanted, but inescapable and lethal - that's in the baggage accompanying Portillo's return to the top.</p> <p>Nor is that the worst of it, for the Tories. Their agenda, like their truck, shows no sign of breaking out of the bunker occupied by voters already signed up for the semi-hard right. That seems to be the audience they're still addressing, even though there is barely a year to go before the election campaign could well be entering its final stage. Something more than saving the pound is necessary to reach that segment of voters. Having affirmed the pledge to lower taxes over the life of one parliament whatever the economic situation, a decision reached after some dithering, the Portillo-Hague leadership has cut off a major route towards them.</p> <p>One person no doubt watching this with increased dismay is Kenneth Clarke. He may no longer speak for many Tories. But he thinks like at least as many voters as William Hague himself. Hague-Portillo has written off Clarke-Heseltine as a Conservative irrelevance. Even if that's an accurate judgment in party terms, these people have not ceased to exist. The Tory left has not died at Hague's command. It has merely faded from power. It still has a voice which, if it spoke, could do great electoral damage to the party that gave itself to an inadequate man.

      "body": "<p>How do we make welfare so popular that people are happy to pay for it? That was the challenge thrown down by Tony Blair in his Toynbee Hall lecture last year and now taken up by Gordon Brown with his pledge to introduce an integrated child credit which we report today - a pledge which, although there are no figures attached to it yet because of conventional budget secrecy, will, according to treasury sources, lift the next million children out of poverty. As the prime minister noted, \"if people lose faith in welfare's ability to deliver, the politicians have an impossible job of persuading hard-pressed taxpayers that their money should go on a system that is not working.\" The job of persuasion, it has to be said, might be easier if Mr Blair gave up complaining about social security taking too much of the government's budget. But we also applaud his commitment to the historic goal of abolishing child poverty within 20 years. If he delivers that, public respect for the welfare programme is sure to increase.</p> <p>Measures already announced by Gordon Brown are due to lift 800,000 children (plus 550,000 parents) out of poverty by the end of this parliament. The mechanisms include the biggest ever increase in child benefit (from \u00a311.45 in April 1998 for first children, to \u00a315 this April), a large increase in the children allowances for people on income support (from \u00a316.90 in 1997 to \u00a324.90 in October 1999), the new national minimum wage lifting 300,000 workers and their children out of poverty, the new working family tax credit (WFTC) and the children's tax credit (\u00a38 for all standard rate taxpayers) that starts in April 2001.</p> <p>This, though very commendable, is only a start. It has lifted the income of families in the two poorest tenths of our society by 9.2% and 7% respectively compared to the average family's 5%. But it is only one sixth of the way towards abolishing child poverty. It would still leave 3.9m children living in poverty by the end of this parliament. Shamefully, child poverty - defined as living on less than half average income - tripled under the Thatcher and Major governments. An almost unbelievable one out of three of our 13m children were living in poverty when this government was elected. We know from cycle of deprivation studies that this means these children are far more likely to leave school without qualifications, suffer more bad health and unemployment, and die earlier. Middle income earners in comfortable suburbs live seven years longer than poor people in inner cities.</p> <p>We still cannot be sure how Labour is going to lift the other five-sixths of children out of poverty, but our front page story today on the decision to push ahead with an integrated child credit is another advance. The idea is to provide a seamless and transparent system of support for children, helping parents to understand what they could expect to receive, and promoting public debate about the present level of support. Three different benefits for children (the child element of WFTC, child allowances of income support, and the children's tax credit) will be brought together to create an integrated child credit. The new benefit , in line with child benefit, will be paid direct to the carer, which should help women. Child benefit will remain a separate benefit. The new benefit will be adjusted for income for those in work, ensuring the poor get more, but providing a portable and secure bridge spanning welfare and work. And the chances of shifting the public's response from resentment to satisfaction at money well spent should be greatly enhanced.</p>",

Measures already announced by Gordon Brown are due to lift 800,000 children (plus 550,000 parents) out of poverty by the end of this parliament. The mechanisms include the biggest ever increase in child benefit (from \u00a311.45 in April 1998 for first children, to \u00a315 this April), a large increase in the children allowances for people on income support (from \u00a316.90 in 1997 to \u00a324.90 in October 1999), the new national minimum wage lifting 300,000 workers and their children out of poverty, the new working family tax credit (WFTC) and the children's tax credit (\u00a38 for all standard rate taxpayers) that starts in April 2001. This, though very commendable, is only a start. It has lifted the income of families in the two poorest tenths of our society by 9.2% and 7% respectively compared to the average family's 5%. But it is only one sixth of the way towards abolishing child poverty. It would still leave 3.9m children living in poverty by the end of this parliament. Shamefully, child poverty - defined as living on less than half average income - tripled under the Thatcher and Major governments. An almost unbelievable one out of three of our 13m children were living in poverty when this government was elected. We know from cycle of deprivation studies that this means these children are far more likely to leave school without qualifications, suffer more bad health and unemployment, and die earlier. Middle income earners in comfortable suburbs live seven years longer than poor people in inner cities. We still cannot be sure how Labour is going to lift the other five-sixths of children out of poverty, but our front page story today on the decision to push ahead with an integrated child credit is another advance. The idea is to provide a seamless and transparent system of support for children, helping parents to understand what they could expect to receive, and promoting public debate about the present level of support. Three different benefits for children (the child element of WFTC, child allowances of income support, and the children's tax credit) will be brought together to create an integrated child credit. The new benefit , in line with child benefit, will be paid direct to the carer, which should help women. Child benefit will remain a separate benefit. The new benefit will be adjusted for income for those in work, ensuring the poor get more, but providing a portable and secure bridge spanning welfare and work. And the chances of shifting the public's response from resentment to satisfaction at money well spent should be greatly enhanced.",

The bold move paid off: most reports of her \"understated\" ensemble were highly favourable. No one even minded that her hair was in a bun.</p> <p>But God, what a fuss they made about her decision to attend alone. When queried about this shocking lapse, she was characteristically good-natured. Instead of saying: \"What year are we in - 2000 or 1867?\" she replied that it was even worse than they thought.

But you still have to ask why she can't even walk down a receiving line alone without people acting as if half of her is missing.</p> <p>The question they ought to have asked her is: \"If you had appeared with a man in tow, how do you think that man would have been treated?\" Her answer could well have revealed the crux of the mystery. If a woman happens to be linked with a man who is her social or professional equal - or, better yet, if he is in the same business but higher up the ladder - then he can appear with her and still get the respect to which he is accustomed. But if he works in a different business or if, God forbid, his social standing is lower than hers, he can expect to be ignored and dismissed. And if he doesn't like it, if he thinks he's worth more than that, she can expect to be attending the next party alone.</p> <p>It's not just the tabloids that are keeping the old double standards alive. We all do it. Even if all they are doing is going to a charity benefit or a Saturday night work do, women can still expect to raise eyebrows if they arrive on their own. It is not that everyone they meet will give them a hard time, but everyone does notice and there will always be at least one person who asks: \"And where is ..?\"</p> <p>There is always a tinge of pity in the eye of the enquirer. You might think this shouldn't matter, but it does matter to a lot of women I know, even women who started companies worth 14 million after covering 19 wars in Southeast Asia, women who see nothing strange in spending two months hitchhiking around New Zealand with a baby in a backpack. Even very resourceful, independent women mind the leading questions at public functions because they feel they are being judged. The implication is that while they might be successes in the male world, they have failed as women. And as wives.</p> <p>Remember the fuss Diana caused in 1992 when she visited the Taj Mahal alone? \"Solo Diana visits monument to love\" was how one paper put it. Charles later admitted he had been \"a fool not to be by her side\". When she visited Cairo alone later that same year, the headline was: \"Postcards from the edge of unhappiness.\" The accompanying photograph of Diana at Giza was \"the picture that captured front pages around the world. The beautiful young princess starkly alone against a backdrop of pyramids.\"</p> <p>The underlying concern was made clear in comments about an earlier trip she took to Pakistan at the invitation of Benazir Bhutto: \"Advisers fear that travelling without Charles in the Islamic republic may upset fundamentalists.\" As it turned out, it upset \"fundamentalists\" in Britain far more.</p> <p>Does it matter, though, what people think? Well, it does if it bothers you so much that you stay at home instead. Certainly it bothered me a great deal just after I got divorced. I was shocked at the sudden change in the way many married friends and colleagues behaved from the moment they heard about the decree nisi. I would go to a weekend party alone and I was red meat to the men and dead meat to the women if I so much as laughed at their husbands' jokes. Somehow, the very fact that I was single was a threat to their marriages.</p> <p>It was never this way, though, at the functions I continued to attend on week nights in connection with work. At these, I was a person in my own right; my marital status was not an issue because almost everyone else would be alone, too. The first few minutes in a room full of strangers were still hard to negotiate, but gradually I worked out how to get through them and even enjoy them. Eventually I came to look back on the years of being part of a couple as a pleasant but puzzling aberration.</p> <p>When I settled down again, it never crossed my mind to ask my partner to be my constant companion. I like it when we can go out together, but because I enjoy going out a good deal more than he does, I still go out alone all the time.</p> <p>But it isn't always easy to be the lone woman in a room full of couples. People still make comments about empty chairs or rush around in search of a \"spare man\" to \"even out the numbers\". Despite all that \"rapid social change\" they will often spend all evening talking about, their mental images of social balance remain sacrosanct.</p> <p>How long would these images last if people stopped conforming to them? If more women said: \"What the hell, I'm going anyway, it doesn't matter if I get a comment or two, and so what if no one will come with me.\" At the very least, they'd have other lone females to talk to when they got there. Outnumbered, the couples might no longer want to see lone females as symbols of social decay. So go on, Gwyneth, set a trend.</p>",

The implication is that while they might be successes in the male world, they have failed as women. And as wives. Remember the fuss Diana caused in 1992 when she visited the Taj Mahal alone? \"Solo Diana visits monument to love\" was how one paper put it. Charles later admitted he had been \"a fool not to be by her side\". When she visited Cairo alone later that same year, the headline was: \"Postcards from the edge of unhappiness.\" The accompanying photograph of Diana at Giza was \"the picture that captured front pages around the world. The beautiful young princess starkly alone against a backdrop of pyramids.\" The underlying concern was made clear in comments about an earlier trip she took to Pakistan at the invitation of Benazir Bhutto: \"Advisers fear that travelling without Charles in the Islamic republic may upset fundamentalists.\" As it turned out, it upset \"fundamentalists\" in Britain far more. Does it matter, though, what people think? Well, it does if it bothers you so much that you stay at home instead. Certainly it bothered me a great deal just after I got divorced. I was shocked at the sudden change in the way many married friends and colleagues behaved from the moment they heard about the decree nisi. I would go to a weekend party alone and I was red meat to the men and dead meat to the women if I so much as laughed at their husbands' jokes. Somehow, the very fact that I was single was a threat to their marriages. It was never this way, though, at the functions I continued to attend on week nights in connection with work. At these, I was a person in my own right; my marital status was not an issue because almost everyone else would be alone, too. The first few minutes in a room full of strangers were still hard to negotiate, but gradually I worked out how to get through them and even enjoy them. Eventually I came to look back on the years of being part of a couple as a pleasant but puzzling aberration. When I settled down again, it never crossed my mind to ask my partner to be my constant companion. I like it when we can go out together, but because I enjoy going out a good deal more than he does, I still go out alone all the time. But it isn't always easy to be the lone woman in a room full of couples. People still make comments about empty chairs or rush around in search of a \"spare man\" to \"even out the numbers\". Despite all that \"rapid social change\" they will often spend all evening talking about, their mental images of social balance remain sacrosanct. How long would these images last if people stopped conforming to them? If more women said: \"What the hell, I'm going anyway, it doesn't matter if I get a comment or two, and so what if no one will come with me.\" At the very least, they'd have other lone females to talk to when they got there. Outnumbered, the couples might no longer want to see lone females as symbols of social decay. So go on, Gwyneth, set a trend.",

Nothing like it has come up at auction before. The expert who spotted it, Sotheby's director Richard Charlton-Jones, said he was left weak at the knees when he spotted the lost work by the 13th century Italian painter Cimabue - tutor of Giotto - whose work is now known only from a handful of surviving pieces. The Madonna and Child Enthroned With Angels is the only Cimabue known to remain in private ownership. Mr Charlton-Jones described it as \"a picture of the very greatest rarity and beauty.\" Experts are guessing that it will sell for at least \u00a32m at a Sotheby's old masters auction in London in July. The picture was among the contents of Benacre Hall, a country house near Lowestoft in Suffolk. It is being sold after the death of the last direct heir of the Gooch family, whose pedigree can be traced back to the 12th century. The picture, on a hardback book sized wooden panel, survived a fire which gutted Benacre Hall in the 1920s, when servants dragged furniture, books, carpets and pictures out of the blaze on to the lawn. The picture is said to be in remarkably good condition. The last heir, Sir John Gooch, 12th baronet, a bachelor who died last year aged 69, was a passionate art collector, but may never have realised what a treasure he owned. After Mr Charlton-Jones spotted the picture, it was taken to the National Gallery, and then to New York for comparison with another Cimabue work. Sotheby's believes it was bought by Sir Edward Sherlock Gooch, the 6th baronet, while he was in Florence on the grand tour in the early 19th century. It is regarded as the most important early Italian work to come on the open market since 1976, when a panel from a Duccio crucifixion sold for \u00a31m.",

The book, The NHS: Facing the Future, said people's expectations of health care rose as its availability rose.

The two were awarded \u00a325,000 costs.</p> <p>The court found that the prosecution had withheld significant evidence without telling the judge at the trial and without asking him to rule on whether the step was justified.</p> <p>It was only last year that the defence learned that a key witness was a paid informer who had received a \u00a310,300 reward and done a deal with police to avoid prosecution for involvement in the crimes himself.</p> <p>The prosecution withheld the information under \"public interest immunity\" rules, which allow so-called sensitive material, including anything that might put a witness at risk of intimidation or assault, to be kept from the defence. Since the trial the law has changed, and relevant evidence cannot be withheld without a judge's ruling.</p> <p>Before the appeal in 1993, the appeal court ruled, on the basis of submissions from the prosecution only, that the evidence should not be disclosed. The appeal was turned down.</p> <p>The case was referred back to the appeal court last year by the criminal cases review commission, and a new appeal is scheduled next June.</p> <p>But James Nichol, Rowe's solicitor, wrote to the crown prosecution service yesterday asking it to concede the appeal. \"What the judges have said is that there was an unfair trial, an unfair appeal and it was entirely the fault of the crown.\"</p> <p>The CPS said it would study the judgment before deciding whether to oppose an application from the men's lawyers for them to be freed on bail.</p> <p>The Strasbourg judges said that if the trial judge had known of the information, he could have kept the question of disclosure under review during the trial. With the material, the defence might have been able through cross-examination seriously to undermine the credibility of key witnesses.</p> <p>At the appeal, the judges had to rely on the transcripts of the original crown court case, and on the prosecution, for their understanding of the relevant facts, \"and may even, to a certain extent, have unconsciously been influenced by the jury's verdict of guilty into underestimating the significance of the undisclosed evidence.\"</p> <p>The three, from Sydenham, south London, were convicted of the murder in Warlingham, Surrey, of Peter Hurburgh, who was dragged with his homosexual lover from his car at gunpoint, tied up, beaten and doused with petrol when he refused to hand over his keys. Mr Hurburgh had a weak heart and the assault caused a fatal heart attack.</p> <p>Later the same night men broke into the home of a retired businessman in Oxted and stabbed his 40-year-old son. The next attack took place in a house in Fetcham where a couple were tied up as their home was ransacked.</p> <p>The initial description of the perpetrators, given to police by victims and issued to the public, was of a gang of two white men and a black man. One victim described one of the gang as being fair-haired and blue-eyed. However, the three men arrested and eventually convicted were all black.</p> <p>Rowe and Davis always believed a deal had been struck with the original white suspects in the case in which they offered to provide information in return for cash and protection from prosecution.</p> <p>John Wadham, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said: \"The European court of human rights in Strasbourg has raised substantial questions about the fairness of the secret procedures in the criminal justice system.\" The men's convictions should be quashed.</p>",

The unanimous ruling by 17 judges brought immediate calls by Rowe's lawyer for his release from prison. The two were awarded \u00a325,000 costs. The court found that the prosecution had withheld significant evidence without telling the judge at the trial and without asking him to rule on whether the step was justified. It was only last year that the defence learned that a key witness was a paid informer who had received a \u00a310,300 reward and done a deal with police to avoid prosecution for involvement in the crimes himself. The prosecution withheld the information under \"public interest immunity\" rules, which allow so-called sensitive material, including anything that might put a witness at risk of intimidation or assault, to be kept from the defence. Since the trial the law has changed, and relevant evidence cannot be withheld without a judge's ruling. Before the appeal in 1993, the appeal court ruled, on the basis of submissions from the prosecution only, that the evidence should not be disclosed. The appeal was turned down. The case was referred back to the appeal court last year by the criminal cases review commission, and a new appeal is scheduled next June. But James Nichol, Rowe's solicitor, wrote to the crown prosecution service yesterday asking it to concede the appeal. \"What the judges have said is that there was an unfair trial, an unfair appeal and it was entirely the fault of the crown.\" The CPS said it would study the judgment before deciding whether to oppose an application from the men's lawyers for them to be freed on bail. The Strasbourg judges said that if the trial judge had known of the information, he could have kept the question of disclosure under review during the trial. With the material, the defence might have been able through cross-examination seriously to undermine the credibility of key witnesses. At the appeal, the judges had to rely on the transcripts of the original crown court case, and on the prosecution, for their understanding of the relevant facts, \"and may even, to a certain extent, have unconsciously been influenced by the jury's verdict of guilty into underestimating the significance of the undisclosed evidence.\" The three, from Sydenham, south London, were convicted of the murder in Warlingham, Surrey, of Peter Hurburgh, who was dragged with his homosexual lover from his car at gunpoint, tied up, beaten and doused with petrol when he refused to hand over his keys. Mr Hurburgh had a weak heart and the assault caused a fatal heart attack. Later the same night men broke into the home of a retired businessman in Oxted and stabbed his 40-year-old son. The next attack took place in a house in Fetcham where a couple were tied up as their home was ransacked. The initial description of the perpetrators, given to police by victims and issued to the public, was of a gang of two white men and a black man. One victim described one of the gang as being fair-haired and blue-eyed. However, the three men arrested and eventually convicted were all black. Rowe and Davis always believed a deal had been struck with the original white suspects in the case in which they offered to provide information in return for cash and protection from prosecution. John Wadham, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said: \"The European court of human rights in Strasbourg has raised substantial questions about the fairness of the secret procedures in the criminal justice system.\" The men's convictions should be quashed.",

Rachel Gwilliam, of Drybrook, Gloucestershire, was injected with a growth hormone from the age of seven to 16. But the hormone was contaminated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease commonly associated with BSE, or mad cow disease. Rachel's parents, Brenda and Roger Preece, said yesterday after an inquest into her death: \"We in ignorance sentenced our daughter to death. We are left with nothing except guilt that we agreed to the treatment.\" Seth Lane, a professor and CJD specialist from Frenchay hospital in Bristol told Gloucester coroner's court that Rachel was one of just tens of cases to have contracted the rare strain. Rachel's family are seeking compensation from the department of health. Prof Lane told the hearing the growth hormone Rachel was given from 1973 to 1982 was extracted from people who had died. He said: \"It needs just someone who had undiagnosed CJD to pass on the disease. It was not the human growth hormone that was the problem, it was the contaminant. \"The relative number of deaths that might have been occasioned by this is tens of cases.\" The Preeces' lawyer, Jonathan Glasson, told the hearing he knew of 35 similar cases including a series of eight in Edinburgh and one in Southampton.

As a one-year-old, Rachel weighed just 15lbs, despite weighing a healthy 6lb 7oz when she was born. After consulting a paediatrician, Rachel was put on a growth hormone treatment in 1973. Mrs Preece told the hearing she injected the treatment herself at six month intervals. But she claimed the only side effect she was told about was the possibility of Rachel becoming infertile. \"I cannot remember being made aware of any other risk,\" said Mrs Preece Rachel made trips for scans and x-rays at Great Ormond Street hospital in London. She carried on the treatment until 1982 when she was 5ft 2ins tall, the hearing heard.

A serious heroin user needed to find \u00a350 in cash each day and so turned to crime, mainly shoplifting, selling drugs and burglary. The report noted that nationally about a third of all crime was geared to the purchase of heroin, cocaine or crack.</p> <p>The officers insisted that most drug users did not commit significant amounts of crime and their only offence was to choose to use a drug which was technically illegal.</p> <p>\"The best example of this is cannabis - the UK has the highest rate of cannabis use in Europe, higher even than in the Netherlands which has a tolerance policy.\"</p> <p>The Cleveland police policy paper said that overwhelming health reasons added to the reasons for considering changes in legalisation. It said the illegal nature of the trade caused further unnecessary risk to drug users because of uncertainty over the quality and purity. Heroin might be cut with additives as wide ranging as chalk dust, quinine, lactose, boric acid and talcum powder.</p> <p>\"Legalisation and regulation of currently banned drugs has never been tried properly anywhere in the world so there is little hard evidence available,\" it said, adding that the experiment in Netherlands in tolerating the personal use of cannabis had resulted in a lower rate of use than in the UK. Some European cities, such as Geneva, were experimenting with issuing heroin under prescription to addicts with results showing some startling reductions in crime.</p> <p>It concluded by saying that the evidence strongly suggested that prohibition had not been effective in reducing availability of, or demand for, controlled drugs, and might even be counter-productive.</p> <p>\"If prohibition does not work, then either the consequences of this have to be accepted, or an alternative approach must be found,\" said the report. \"The most obvious alternative approach is the legalisation and subsequent regulation of some or all drugs.\"</p> <p>Ken Walker, the chairman of Cleveland police authority, which endorsed the report, said it was a serious, sensible and constructive approach. \"No one wants to rush into legalising some or all of the drugs proscribed because there are so many serious and complex social implications.

A modern western democracy, based on policing by consent and the rule of law may find itself powerless to prevent illegal activity - in this case the importation and use of controlled drugs.\" The Cleveland police said there was a strong link between crime and drugs but added that was a product of prices remaining high because drugs are illegal. A serious heroin user needed to find \u00a350 in cash each day and so turned to crime, mainly shoplifting, selling drugs and burglary. The report noted that nationally about a third of all crime was geared to the purchase of heroin, cocaine or crack. The officers insisted that most drug users did not commit significant amounts of crime and their only offence was to choose to use a drug which was technically illegal. \"The best example of this is cannabis - the UK has the highest rate of cannabis use in Europe, higher even than in the Netherlands which has a tolerance policy.\" The Cleveland police policy paper said that overwhelming health reasons added to the reasons for considering changes in legalisation. It said the illegal nature of the trade caused further unnecessary risk to drug users because of uncertainty over the quality and purity. Heroin might be cut with additives as wide ranging as chalk dust, quinine, lactose, boric acid and talcum powder. \"Legalisation and regulation of currently banned drugs has never been tried properly anywhere in the world so there is little hard evidence available,\" it said, adding that the experiment in Netherlands in tolerating the personal use of cannabis had resulted in a lower rate of use than in the UK. Some European cities, such as Geneva, were experimenting with issuing heroin under prescription to addicts with results showing some startling reductions in crime. It concluded by saying that the evidence strongly suggested that prohibition had not been effective in reducing availability of, or demand for, controlled drugs, and might even be counter-productive. \"If prohibition does not work, then either the consequences of this have to be accepted, or an alternative approach must be found,\" said the report. \"The most obvious alternative approach is the legalisation and subsequent regulation of some or all drugs.\" Ken Walker, the chairman of Cleveland police authority, which endorsed the report, said it was a serious, sensible and constructive approach. \"No one wants to rush into legalising some or all of the drugs proscribed because there are so many serious and complex social implications. But we have to face reality and open up the debate about all the options.\" Battles the law won 1998 drug seizures and offender statistics \u0095 Total number of drug seizures increased by 8% to 149,000; 76% involved cannabis. \u0095 Cannabis seizures increased by 7%, but the quantities seized dropped by 28%. \u0095 The number of heroin seizures went up by 19%, but quantity seized fell by 40%. \u0095 Number and quantity of cocaine (including crack) seizures increased, by 36% and 25% respectively. \u0095 Quantities of ecstasy type drugs went up by 9%; the number of seizures fell by 7%. \u0095 Drug offenders up by 13% to 127,900; 90% possession cases, mainly cannabis. \u0095 Cocaine offenders up 32% (excluding crack); a 30% rise in heroin offenders; and a rise of 13% in cannabis offenders. \u0095 47% of offenders were cautioned, 23% were fined and 8% sentenced to immediate custody.",

However, Portman had some good news after taking the best movie actress title for her role as the child queen. Readers showed how much affection they had for the original films in the space saga by voting Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back at numbers one and two of their top movies of all time, with Return Of The Jedi at number 10. SFX editor Dave Golder said: \"The Phantom Menace may now be the biggest grossing film of all time, but it seems that only the really juvenile audience liked it. \"Fans who have been championing the Star Wars films for over 20 years felt betrayed by what they saw as a kids movie. \"The real proof of its success or failure may only be measured when Episode Two comes out - audiences may be more wary now they've seen how poor the prequel was.\" BBC2 show Buffy The Vampire Slayer was one of the major success stories of the poll. Star Sarah Michelle Gellar was voted best TV actress and sexiest woman for her role as the feisty heroine in the series. Her co-star David Boreanaz was sexiest man and show colleague Anthony Head - former Gold Blend commercial actor - was runner-up, beating stars like Keanu Reeves and David Duchovny. Buffy was voted best TV show of the year and of all time. Councils to pioneer electronic voting Chris Mead, PA News Touch key electronic voting will be used for the first time in British elections in the May 4 council contests, it was disclosed today. The Home Office named 35 authorities given the go-ahead to carry out experiments in poll procedures in a bid to boost flagging turnout. Electronic voting will be tried out at Bury, Salford, Stratford-on-Avon and Warrington. Polling in Watford, Hertfordshire, will be on Saturday May 6 and Sunday May 7 instead of the traditional Thursday. Watford is also being allowed to provide a free election address delivery for parties. The absence of such a facility in the capital has threatened the contests for London's Mayor and Assembly with Tories and Liberal Democrats threatening to block crucial election rules as a protest in the Lords next week. A number of areas, in addition to London, will be opening polling stations before May 4 to allow those unable to make it on the day to vote early. Also in the capital and some other areas traditional ballot papers will be used but they will be counted electronically in a bid to speed the process. Labour's Sir Jeremy Beecham, Local Government Association chairman, commented: \"We are delighted local authorities are taking the initiative with a variety of schemes which we hope will encourage more people to vote. \"Increasing turnout at local elections is crucial if we are to promote the value and importance of local democracy so that more people are involved in shaping the future of their communities.\" Some of the experiments cover the whole council area while others only apply to some wards. Authorities taking part in experiments - subject to passage of the Representation of the People Bill currently before Parliament - are: \u0095 Electronic voting: Bury, Salford, Stratford-on-Avon, Warrington. \u0095 Early Voting: Blackburn and Darwen, Blackpool, Chester, Coventry, Kingston-upon-Hull, Knowsley, Manchester, Norwich, Pendle, Plymouth, Redditch, St Helens, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Telford and Wrekin and Watford. \u0095 Electronic counting: Broxbourne, Bury and Three Rivers. \u0095 Extending postal vote entitlement: Amber Valley, Eastleigh, Gloucester and Milton Keynes. \u0095 All postal ballot: Bolton, Doncaster, Gateshead, Norwich, Salford, Stevenage, Swindon and Wigan. \u0095 Extending voting hours: Leeds and Mole Valley. \u0095 Mobile voting facility: Norwich, Sunderland, Watford and Windsor and Maidenhead. \u0095 Weekend voting: Watford. \u0095 Freepost delivery of election addresses: Watford.",

The prosecution involving a hydro-electric dam project in Lesotho in southern Africa follows the arrest of its chief executive after allegations that he accepted \u00a31.2m in bribes over a decade from firms building the scheme. One British company, Gibb Ltd - formerly Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners - based in Reading, has been charged with bribery and corruption. Two others, Balfour Beatty and Kier International, have been charged as members of two consortiums, the Lesotho Highlands Project Contractors and the Highlands Water Venture, which built the scheme. All three companies strenuously deny the charges. A spokesman for Balfour Beatty said yesterday that the lead finance company in its consortiums was run by the French company, Spie Batignolles. \"We and all the contractors in the consortium on the scheme strenuously deny any involvement in this.

This is opposed by the Arab League, human rights groups and environmentalists, as well as three cabinet colleagues. Balfour Beatty was also named last week by the department of environment as part of a consortium for reconstruction contracts after the Turkish earthquakes last year. Sixteen bribery and corruption charges have been laid against the companies in the court action which followed the seizure of Swiss bank records. These were handed over to Lesotho's director of public prosecutions by the Swiss authorities to pursue criminal charges against Masupha Sole, former chief executive officer of the project. The companies charged are Acrtes International (Canadian); Coyne et Bellier, Sogreah, Spie Batignolles and Dumez International (all French); ABB and Lahmeyer International (German); Abb (Swedish); Universal Development Corporation and Electro Power Corporation (Panamanian); Associated Consultants and Project Managers (Lesotho) and Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (British). Highland Water Venture and Lesotho Highlands Project Contractors were also charged. They include British firms. The World Bank, which has a \u00a3100m stake in the project, and the European Union have agreed to part-finance the prosecution of the companies - which face being barred from World Bank projects if found guilty. Charges against Mr Sole alleged he took bribes in French francs, Canadian dollars, deutschmarks and South African rand. The disclosure of the charges against the companies yesterday was an embarrassment to Vivien Brown, chief executive of the department of trade and industry's export credit guarantee department, which underwrote the British companies behind the project.

      "bodyText": "British former prisoners of war are to sue a Japanese multinational firm for millions of pounds in compensation over their suffering as slave labourers more than 50 years ago. Campaigners disclosed yesterday that they are exploiting a new Californian law which for the first time allows victims to sue industrial conglomerates with holdings in the state. Lawyers for the ex-prisoners will fly to Los Angeles today. They will be joined on Saturday by Arthur Titherington, 78, of the Japanese Labour Camps Survivors Association, who worked for three years in a Japanese copper mine. Nearly 430 out of the 523 British military personnel at the mine, operated by Nippon Mining, died from ill-treatment. Eighteen other survivors are believed to be still alive. The action - due to open next week - is against Nippon's successor, the Tokyo-based Japan Energy Corporation. The campaigners' British lawyers are confident they can prove Californian courts have jurisdiction over the company. The action draws on the precedent of last year's announcement by the German government and a group of the country's largest companies of a \u00a33.2bn compensation package for civilian victims of second world war labour camps. With 210 subsidiaries and 92 affiliates, Japan Energy is one of Asia's biggest companies. It had 1998 sales of \u00a39bn across sectors from petrochemicals to pharmaceuticals. Its link with Nippon is detailed on a company website. Mr Titherington said British PoWs endured punishment beatings for failing to fulfill production quotas. He said: \"We worked a 14-hour day in cramped, horrible conditions and had to climb 2,000 steps at the end of it. Men took their own lives. We starved and we were beaten to provide profits for this company. Japan Energy is directly responsible for systematically torturing hundreds of men and profiting from their labour. This is perhaps our last chance to bring them to book.\"",

      "bodyText": "The home office last night demanded an explanation from the Spanish government into how General Augusto Pinochet's confidential medical report was leaked to newspapers in Spain and Chile. The report concludes that the former Chilean dictator suffers from brain damage brought on by multiple strokes and is unfit to stand trial on charges of human rights abuses. It was released to two Spanish newspapers by the foreign ministry of Spain within hours of it being delivered. A newspaper in the Chilean capital of Santiago reported that it had been given extracts by the Chilean government. Chile was not an official recipient of the report, prompting sources close to the case to suggest that \"supposed friends of the general's may be playing games\". The panel of British doctors who examined the former dictator in London last month said in part: \"It is our view that Senator Pinochet would not at the present be mentally capable of meaningful participation in a trial. We base this opinion on: \u0095 Memory deficit for both recent and remote events \u0095Limited ability to understand complex sentences and questions owing to memory impairment, and consequent inability to process verbal information appropriately \u0095Impaired ability to express himself audibly, succinctly and relevantly \u0095 Easy fatiguability.\" His condition has appreciably worsened during his time in Britain, and he has suffered a number of falls in the garden of the house on the Wentworth estate in Surrey where he has been under house arrest since being detained in London 16 months ago for possible extradition after a Spanish court issued a warrant alleging human rights violations during his 1973-90 rule in Chile. While the general is homesick and bored, the doctors' report says he is not currently depressed and that his sense of humour \"remains intact\". In a statement the home office said it had asked the Spanish authorities, through the crown prosecution service, their legal representatives, for information regarding how the conclusions of the report came to be disclosed. The general's lawyers have written to the home secretary and the attorney general requesting an investigation into the leak, a potential contempt of court. Earlier this week the high court ruled that the four states with outstanding extradition warrants against the general, Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland, were entitled to see the report, which carries the conclusions of the three doctors who examined the general last month. The report, ordered by home secretary Jack Straw to determine whether the general was fit to be extradited to Spain, was sent to Madrid in strict confidence and then passed to the investigating magistrate who first ordered the general's arrest, Baltasar Garzon. The judge sent a letter yesterday to the national court in Madrid denying that had anything to do with a leak. \"It was a case of the foreign ministry leaking it before Garzon had a chance to do so,\" said one source. Many of the documents in the Pinochet case have found their way into Spanish newspapers. An official at Belgium's foreign ministry, which initiated the hearing that led to the release of the medical papers, said last night his ministry \"regretted\" the breach of confidentiality. He said a doctor appointed by a Belgian judge to examine the medical findings would report to the foreign ministry within days. The four countries have until Tuesday to pass comments to Mr Straw. Human rights groups appeared split. \"If the conclusions are correct then Gen Pinochet should not stand trial and should be returned to Chile,\" said Reid Brody of Human Rights Watch. But other doctors might produce different conclusions: \"We would hope that the states study the actual results of the tests and determine whether the proper legal standards have been applied.\" Amnesty International demanded that a final decision on the general's fitness to stand trial be made in court.",

It could now be responsible for the re-invention of the sequel genre as a full-bodied cinema treat. </p> <p>Plus the market is changing: the direct-to-video genre is dead, squeezing out the funding for cheap action films and other exploitation titles. That points the way to getting a franchise and building it up. </p> <p>\"Already in the last 12 months we've heard talk about Blade 2, Under Siege 3, The Mummy 2, American Pie 2, Total Recall 2, Jurassic Park 3 even another Nutty Professor\", says Ed Nicholson, Ladbrokes' entertainment odds compiler. \"But looking at films that haven't even been released, and trying to work out if they are going to be successful is tricky\", he adds. </p> <p>\"Spiderman has potential with Sam Raimi at the helm. He's already displayed his sequel prowess, having done five films for the Hercules franchise and two Evil Deads. He has the form. The word is that Sony are looking for more franchise films, so Spiderman could go the same way as the Batman films.\" </p> <p>\"Another with form is Eddie Murphy - he's used to playing screen characters more than once. In Shrinking Man he plays Fred Wolf in this remake of the 1957 flick. An interesting contender.\" </p> <p>\"There's certainly some hype surrounding Wonder Woman. I think that if Sandra Bullock plays her, she will make it big! And those famous star-spangled outfits will stay on our screens\", he adds. </p> <p>\"Mystery Men has good breeding for this sort of thing. Directed by award-winning commercial director Kinka Usher, it includes Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, and two more nominees, Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) and William H. Macy (Fargo).\" </p>",

      "bodyText": "Spiderman 1/7 Wonder Woman 2/7 The Incredible Shrinking Man 2/5 Mystery Men 2/5 The third (and final) chapter in the slasher series Scream has been a box-office hit in the US. It even has a chance to out-gross (no pun intended) its predecessors. It could now be responsible for the re-invention of the sequel genre as a full-bodied cinema treat. Plus the market is changing: the direct-to-video genre is dead, squeezing out the funding for cheap action films and other exploitation titles. That points the way to getting a franchise and building it up. \"Already in the last 12 months we've heard talk about Blade 2, Under Siege 3, The Mummy 2, American Pie 2, Total Recall 2, Jurassic Park 3 even another Nutty Professor\", says Ed Nicholson, Ladbrokes' entertainment odds compiler. \"But looking at films that haven't even been released, and trying to work out if they are going to be successful is tricky\", he adds. \"Spiderman has potential with Sam Raimi at the helm. He's already displayed his sequel prowess, having done five films for the Hercules franchise and two Evil Deads. He has the form. The word is that Sony are looking for more franchise films, so Spiderman could go the same way as the Batman films.\" \"Another with form is Eddie Murphy - he's used to playing screen characters more than once. In Shrinking Man he plays Fred Wolf in this remake of the 1957 flick. An interesting contender.\" \"There's certainly some hype surrounding Wonder Woman. I think that if Sandra Bullock plays her, she will make it big! And those famous star-spangled outfits will stay on our screens\", he adds. \"Mystery Men has good breeding for this sort of thing. Directed by award-winning commercial director Kinka Usher, it includes Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, and two more nominees, Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) and William H. Macy (Fargo).\"",

I can generate such an outcome by doctoring the results of an actual sequence of 600 throws, and the resulting sequence will be random according to Kolmogorov's definition, but it won't be random. Incidentally, an outcome that is too close to the mathematical probabilities is the red flag that has alerted authorities to a number of cases of data falsification in scientific and medical research. </p> <p>As American mathematician William Dembski points out in a recent book, no entirely mathematical approach will tell you that a particular outcome is the result of chance.

I show you a piece of paper with six numbers written on it, and I offer you a side bet that these numbers will agree with the winning sequence with at most one number different. After the draw is completed, you find that, apart from the final number, my sequence is exactly the same as the one we just saw drawn on the television. Do you pay up? Or do you suspect a rat? I am sure you will conclude that what you just saw was a videotape of the lottery, which I had recorded moments before you arrived, and that I had copied the first five numbers in my sequence directly from the television screen. In other words, you will conclude that the numbers on my paper-although they undoubtedly constitute a random sequence of numbers-are the result not of chance, but design. </p> <p>Dembski proposes that we forget the exclusively mathematical approach and adopt a hybrid method that combines mathematics with plain old- fashioned common sense. He starts out by stating a basic principle, which he calls the Law of Small Probability (LSP): \"Specified events of small probability do not occur by chance.\" </p> <p>The outcome of a process, such as repeatedly rolling a die, is specified, Dembski says, if its pattern can be determined in a fashion independent of the process itself.

Thus, by the LSP it cannot occur by chance. </p> <p>Deciding whether an event is specified often comes down to a matter of human judgment. If you can find a suitable description, you know the event is specified. But you can never be sure that an event is unspecified. The fact that you have not (yet!) found a specification does not mean none exists.

We are not interested in cobbling together a formula that enables this to stagger on for a week or two. We want this sorted out once and for all.\" Downing Street did its best to paper over the chasm between the republicans and unionists caused by Mr Mandelson's tactics on Friday. They each said they want a short and focused review, but that seemed unlikely yesterday. Mr Blair, after his meetings with Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, and the three main pro-agreement parties, said: \"It's been a set back. I'm not going to pretend that this is not a difficult situation because it is. None of us wanted to suspend the institutions. None of us want to let them stay suspended a moment longer than they need to.\" Gen de Chastelain's report, which said that the IRA had indicated the \"context\" in which it would disarm, had been a \"huge advance\" but greater clarity was needed as to what was meant. \"We have come such a long way I simply cannot believe that we are going to let this chance slip away,\" he said. \"The one thing I am sure of having met all the parties is that none of them really wants to see this agreement fall. All of them know it is the only way forward.\" \"There is no other way it has got to be done and we are going to make sure it is done,\" he said. Mr Ahern agreed: \"I don't see any reason why we cannot achieve that.\"",

      "bodyText": "Both frontrunners in Labour's mayoral race claimed to be confident of victory after the polls closed last night, though officials at the party's Millbank headquarters insisted there would be no formal announcement of the result until next Sunday. That decision was attacked by Ken Livingstone as a \"recipe for endless speculation about fraud and days of debate in the media about who has won\", while his main rival Frank Dobson called on candidates and party members to unite after a bruising campaign. \"It has not been an easy time for any of us in the Labour party,\" Mr Dobson said, promising to work for Mr Livingstone's election if his rival won the selection contest. \"Now we must all work to ensure that the discussion and debate surrounding the selection doesn't have a lasting divisive effect.\" Mr Livingstone received a new boost to his campaign, when the Graphical Paper and Media Union yesterday announced that its London membership had given the former Greater London council leader an 87% endorsement in the latest selection ballot in the affiliated section of Labour's electoral college. Mr Livingstone beat Mr Dobson by a margin of 14 to one in the print union ballot, polling 1,129 to the former health secretary's 84. Former transport minister Glenda Jackson, the third of the London mayoral hopefuls, attracted 81 votes. The scale of Mr Livingstone's victory - which gives him another 0.8% of the electoral college and brings his declared share up to 9.45% - follows a similar pattern of results in all the unions to have balloted and announced their results to date. That could affect the overall result when unions such as the GMB general union - which is splitting its share of the electoral college according to how its members vote, rather than giving the whole percentage to the winner - announces its results, probably today. The government appears to have hardened its resistance to the demand from the opposition for free postal delivery of election material in the London mayoral poll in May. London minister Keith Hill told the commons early yesterday that if its proposed regulations for the poll - without any free delivery provisions - were defeated by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats next week in the House of Lords, \"there would be no London elections at all\". At the weekend, ministers were suggesting that a Lords defeat would mean the mayoral poll could be held under local government regulations. But the idea seems now to have been dropped.",

Will it change what the Guardian is? Probably, if fewer of you choose to access it in a medium that allows easy navigation of long and complex articles. But for the moment, as the techno-world moves rapidly on, it seems that you want your news to move with you. \u0095 David Rowan is editor of Guardian Unlimited",

And if this makes the track sound overcrowded, there could be several million more would-be racing aces sharing the German's cockpit. </p> <p>The millions of drivers won't physically be present, but they will be immersed in the experience via their computers and simulation software. These \"virtual\" drivers will be racing in real time on a graphical representation of the track, thanks to positional information sent to their PCs via the internet. When the real Schumi brakes or swerves, his virtual rivals will have to take evasive action - though not, fortunately, vice versa. </p> <p>The online gaming system is the work of Jacques Levasseur and G\u00e9rard Benkel, founders of a small French company called Sportners. </p> <p>Last week, Sportners announced a deal with the Bordeaux-based games developer Kalisto Entertainment, creator of Ultim@te Race and Ultim@te Race Pro, which will use its \"advanced 3D racing engine\" to create the software to simulate live sporting events. </p> <p>Levasseur says: \"Sportners is a concept, it's not a game. It can be adapted to almost any type of sport - motorbike racing, car racing, yachting, maybe skiing - except team sports.\" </p> <p>The company is talking to numerous event organisers about using the system, and the first game could be a yachting simulation. No announcements have been made, but Levasseur hopes something will be launched by the end of the year. </p> <p>\"We are very happy to make this deal with Kalisto,\" he says: \"it's a little victory for us after long years of hard work, when we had to go it alone. </p> <p>\"I had the idea 10 years ago, with my friend G\u00e9rard, when we were watching Grand Prix racing on television. We thought maybe it would be possible to put some kind of chip on a vehicle and send the data in real time to different computers around the world, so anyone could participate from their home. That's the concept. But everyone said 'No, no, no, it's not possible'!\" </p> <p>That was before \"telemetry\". Today's racing cars are full of sensors that record almost every detail, and send data back to the pits every lap. Similar sensors could be used with other sports. The technology is finally ready, although sending data over the internet could be a problem, because it wasn't designed for real time applications. </p> <p> Levasseur says the amount of data has been minimised: given the co-ordinates of a car 26 times a second, a computer can calculate its speed and acceleration. Nonetheless, the best results will be achieved by sending data by a broadband (high capacity) route such as satellite or cable, while using a phone line and modem to collect data from virtual players. </p> <p>Kalisto has developed an online version of Ultim@te Race that uses a broadband connection, and demonstrated it last year with Skybridge's satellite system. </p> <p>The virtual players won't be able to see each other, but they will be able to compete against one another. At the end of a race, for example, the 100 or 1,000 best race times could be listed, with the best virtual players over a season winning a virtual championship. </p> <p>But simulating live events involves far more than tracking cars, bikes, boats or planes. What if a Grand Prix's organisers change the track by adding, say, a chicane made out of tyre walls? What if it starts raining heavily, perhaps on just one part of the circuit? What happens when there's a crash and the pace car comes out to slow everyone down? All these things and more will have to be reflected in the software simulation in real time. </p> <p>If virtual players want to drive a transparent \"ghost car\" to match themselves against real racing drivers, this should be relatively easy to program. </p> <p>But in simulation mode, they will want to overtake opponents, and in this case, reality will give way to game-play. In other words, the trajectory of the real car in the simulation will differ from the trajectory of the real car on the track. However, the AI (artificial intelligence) routines controlling the simulated car will be allowed a certain time to get the simulated car back onto the real car's trajectory. This \"recuperation time\", as Sportners calls it, can be set by the player. The shorter it is, the closer the simulation will be to the real race. </p> <p>Developing the software will be a challenge for Kalisto Entertainment, but founder and president Nicolas Gaume is unperturbed. \"The trick is to make sure you've analysed the course that Mr Schumacher or Mr Alessi would take, and stored that in a database. Then we can extrapolate from where the actual car is what someone would do if you were to overtake him. </p> <p>\"It's like a parallel reality. We create a virtual world which matches the real world with some alterations,\" says Gaume. \"It's all about making sure that the alterations sustain the gameplay experience, so that you enjoy it.\" </p> <p>If it works, the Sportners system will give players the most realistic and most immersive gameplay to date. But if it isn't fun, it won't attract enough players to cover the costs.</p>",

What if it starts raining heavily, perhaps on just one part of the circuit? What happens when there's a crash and the pace car comes out to slow everyone down? All these things and more will have to be reflected in the software simulation in real time. If virtual players want to drive a transparent \"ghost car\" to match themselves against real racing drivers, this should be relatively easy to program. But in simulation mode, they will want to overtake opponents, and in this case, reality will give way to game-play. In other words, the trajectory of the real car in the simulation will differ from the trajectory of the real car on the track. However, the AI (artificial intelligence) routines controlling the simulated car will be allowed a certain time to get the simulated car back onto the real car's trajectory. This \"recuperation time\", as Sportners calls it, can be set by the player. The shorter it is, the closer the simulation will be to the real race. Developing the software will be a challenge for Kalisto Entertainment, but founder and president Nicolas Gaume is unperturbed. \"The trick is to make sure you've analysed the course that Mr Schumacher or Mr Alessi would take, and stored that in a database. Then we can extrapolate from where the actual car is what someone would do if you were to overtake him. \"It's like a parallel reality. We create a virtual world which matches the real world with some alterations,\" says Gaume. \"It's all about making sure that the alterations sustain the gameplay experience, so that you enjoy it.\" If it works, the Sportners system will give players the most realistic and most immersive gameplay to date. But if it isn't fun, it won't attract enough players to cover the costs.",

Sixty years ago, his dancing beat spurred on an unknown saxophonist, Charlie Parker, when the fledgling \"Bird\" took flight from Kansas City.</p> <p>Johnson grew up in Dallas, where he played in a school band with trombonist Henry Coker who, like him, would later find fame with Count Basie. Both men would grow into tall, substantial figures, but then, in the drummer's words, they were \"little old stringbean somethings\". He took the obligatory piano lessons, but soon switched to drums, finding work before reaching his teens. At a Houston theatre he played for silent films, still wearing short trousers, and turned professional while still at school. Like other black Texans then, he gravitated into the territory bands, rugged hard-touring units that played for dancing.</p> <p>Then, in 1938, he hooked up with Jay McShann's band in Kansas City, Charlie Parker joining soon after. With Parker's unofficial guardian Gene Ramey on bass, the band played throughout the mid-west before travelling to New York in 1941. At the Savoy Ballroom, with Parker playing the blues and \"swinging like crazy\", McShann vanquished the likes of Lucky Millinder in fabulous band-battles, the stuff of legend.</p> <p>In 1943, Johnson joined an army band. On his discharge he moved to Chicago, where he played with popular leaders Eddie \"Cleanhead\" Vinson and Cootie Williams, and became part of the famous Earl Hines big band that nurtured a generation of be-boppers. Then he joined Count Basie, his favourite band.</p> <p>To Basie's drum chair he brought his accumulated percussive wisdom, but he was also a musical progressive, making him the ideal replacement for his predecessor Jo Jones, in a period of change in African-American music. Thus, when economics forced Basie to switch to a smaller unit, Johnson was equipped for the requirements of a frontline comprising modernists such as trumpeter Clark Terry, saxophonists Wandell Gray and Serge Challoff, and the clarinettist Buddy de Franco. When Basie expanded again, Johnson remained a driving force in the band's important Dance Session recordings of the early 1950s and an assertive figure until he left to undergo an appendectomy.</p> <p>In 1955 he began working with singers, setting the standard to which other drummer-accompanists would aspire. He stayed the course with Lena Horne, but it was his nine years as Ella Fitzgerald's drummer that made him internationally familiar. Understated but always dependable, his playing with brushes behind her ballad singing was particularly noteworthy.</p> <p>Johnson, whose discography began with the Ink Spots vocal group, had the adaptability that made him ideal for studio work. Interestingly, although a reliable, out-and-out swinger, both he and his old McShann colleague Gene Ramey were noted for their forays into bebop, backing modernists who had themselves cut their teeth in an earlier era. So Johnson worked often with baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and recorded with Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Woody Herman and others, while remaining a regular in the Basie-flavoured groups led by trumpeter Buck Clayton. He was equally comfortable with the superficially insouciant Stan Getz, although in later years the more conventional World's Greatest Jazz Band had first call on his services. In 1973 he settled in Denver, that band's headquarters, recording and touring Europe with them on several occasions.</p> <p>Johnson was one of the first musicians I ever interviewed, encouraged by the jazz-loving editor of a new black publication called Tropic. I was still at college when I visited his Mayfair hotel, but was welcomed as if I were one of Fleet Street's finest. Friendly and humorous, he smoked gold-tipped black Sobranies and kept up a string of witty remarks, while protesting that he was \"not a talking man\". His modesty - \"drums,\" he said, \"are strictly for time, to make a band swing.

Theologians, scientists, politicians, anarchists and atheists will gather at the Rome vegetable market where he was burned at the stake in 1600, and, in a move which is likely to make the Vatican squirm, hail him a martyr to free thought. Bruno, a Dominican monk who travelled Europe preaching a blend of rationalism, pantheism and magic, was killed in 1600 after he refused to recant his beliefs during the anti-science backlash of the counter-reformation. Pope John Paul II will next month strive to cleanse the church's soul by apologising for the execution, but he has ignored the clamour to fully rehabilitate Bruno. Thousands of anarchists are expected to mobilise at a statue of the Dominican priest in the Piazzo Campo dei Fiori - the site of his execution for heresy - to reclaim his legacy. \"He's a symbol of the temporal powers of the church that we want to fight,\" said Giorgio Villella, of the Union of Rationalist Atheists and and Agnostics. This week the former European Union commissioner Emma Bonino and members of Italy's Radical party have joined the throngs leaving roses at Bruno's statue, which has become a secular shrine since being erected amid controversy in 1887. A separate gathering of international scholars will mark the official anniversary of his execution, which has spawned books, debates and acclaim for a maverick who in his brief life infuriated and insulted Protestants, kings and Oxford university professors. Bruno was born in Naples in 1548 and was ordained a priest, although he quickly fell out with the church on dogma. In addition to challenging the eucharist, immaculate conception and church authority, Bruno championed natural magic and endorsed Copernicus's correct but shocking claim that the earth orbited the sun, not vice versa. He also claimed that the earth was only one of an infinite number of inhabited worlds. In 1576 he came to the attention of the Inquisition and fled abroad. While in England between 1583 and 1585, he trained Queen Elizabeth's court in the art of memory before moving to Oxford university. He left there in disgust after claiming the professors knew more about beer than Greek. Lured back to Italy in 1591, he was arrested and put on trial for his heretical views. Unlike Galileo he refused to recant and was executed in February 17, 1600, also a holy year. Cardinal Paul Poupard, president of the Vatican's pontifical culture council, has galvanised Bruno's supporters by saying his ideas were incompatible with Christian thought. \"I don't think you can talk about 'rehabilitation' in the Bruno case, since there are no grounds for it,\" he said. The pope will apologise only for the execution, not the intellectual rejection of Bruno's ideas. The apology will be part of a sweeping mea culpa to mark the Vatican's holy year which forms an official apology for persecution and errors committed by Christians over the past 2,000 years. Gervaise Rosser, an Oxford professor of history, said: \"The sad thing about Bruno's reputation in England is that he's remembered, if at all, either as a prophet of modern science or as a weirdo.\" But hailing Bruno as a figurehead for science was a mistake, he added. \"He used science to look back, not forward. He believed that Copernicus's insight was the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy.\"",

In the final chapter of a bizarre espionage scandal that has dragged on for almost four years, the long-awaited trial of Platon Obukhov, a second secretary at the Russian foreign ministry, threatens to cause the British intelligence service considerable embarrassment. Mr Obukhov, 30, was arrested in April 1996 by the federal security service (FSB), allegedly while broadcasting classified information \"of a political and strategic defence character\" to MI6's headquarters in London. The Moscow Times identified his controller as Norman MacSween, who was listed as a counsellor in the British embassy in Moscow. If found guilty, Mr Obukhov faces up to 20 more years' mprisonment. The British government has never denied that he was in contact with MI6. Mr Obukhov's father, Alexei, is a former Soviet deputy foreign minister and senior disarmament negotiator. The arrest prompted the worst spy row between London and Moscow since the end of the cold war, with Britain and Russia each expelling four diplomats.

      "bodyText": "Nato and Russia took the first step yesterday towards ending the year-long freeze in relations caused by the Kosovo war. The Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, said in Moscow: \"We've moved from permafrost into slightly softer ground.\" The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, concurred: \"We discussed relations between Russia and Nato and decided that we will resume contacts.\" A Russian diplomatic source said the development did not amount to a full restoration of ties, but it was a beginning. Friction between the two had seen a return to cold war rhetoric, exacerbated by the Chechnya conflict, in which Nato accused Moscow of using excessive force. Russia, which signed an agreement with Nato in 1997 to establish close dialogue on security issues, became increasingly suspicious of the west after strikes on Iraq in 1998, followed by the bombing of Serbia. Moscow feared that Russia could eventually be the target of a similar unilateral action and was especially angry about the bombing of Serbia, with which it has historical ties. In spite of yesterday's thaw, relations will be strained if the US president, Bill Clinton, approves in July the creation of a new anti-ballistic missile system, which Moscow would interpret as an aggressive move Lord Robertson, the former British defence secretary who took over the Nato post last year, held meetings yesterday with the acting Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, and Mr Ivanov. Afterwards, Lord Robertson, making his first visit to Moscow, said: \"Today was a good day for resuming the dialogue and discussion that forms part of the Nato-Russia relationship.\" But the Russian side was less effusive. Mr Putin said the relationship between Russia and Nato was \"rather complicated\", harking back to Serbia and Chechnya. Nevertheless, Nato saw it as hugely important in symbolic terms that Mr Putin, who is often portrayed as anti-western, had joined in the talks and had approved the resumption of ties. Russia broke off almost all ties with Nato and effectively shut down the permanent joint council - in which Nato and Russian officials consulted on a wide variety of security issues - soon after the first strikes on Belgrade. Russia protested it had not been consulted before the bombardments began. Lord Robertson said Nato's position on Chechnya had not changed, though it understood the threat of terrorism and the other problems Russia faced there. \"We don't believe [the Chechen war] is right in principle, nor do we believe that this is right in practice, simply sowing the seeds for future conflicts,\" Lord Robertson said. \"We have had five hours of very frank and sometimes blunt discussions.\" A joint communique issued at the end of the talks said: \"Nato and Russia will work to intensify their dialogue in the permanent joint council. They agreed [to] pursue a vigorous dialogue on a wide range of security issues that will enable Nato and Russia to make their mutual cooperation a cornerstone of European security.\" The former Russian prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, said Moscow had no choice but to talk to Nato. \"This does not mean that we should quickly change our stance and return to the permanent council,\" Mr Primakov said. \"But we have to talk, as Nato is a real force and this should be taken into account.\"",

The firm takes DNA samples from old or dying dogs and cats and stores them in anticipation of the day when they can be cloned. And that day could come within a year, it seems. \"It's a major scientific challenge, but the team is 90% there,\" said Mark Westhusin, a Texas A&amp;M university veterinary physiologist, who is heading the project. \"We have just received so many calls from people wanting this.

Yesterday, police drained wells and combed rubbish dumps for Manuela's missing newborn baby, Martin. The facts would be chilling enough on their own, but the killings were the latest of nearly 30 child murders. All were murdered in their own homes during the past five years, 14 of them since 1998. Most of the victims lived comfortably in typical rural backwaters or in small provincial towns. But these atrocities were not the work of deranged serial murderers; the common factor was that no outsiders were involved. A mixture of boredom, conjugal tension or administrative problems caused their parents' nerves to crack, usually just as a long winter edged towards spring. However, the murders in Flavin could prove an exception as police have released the father, Patrice Moulinier, 43, without charge following 36 hours in custody. No one else has been arrested, but the tragedy had the hallmarks of the killings that appear to have made life more dangerous for children in the country than in the cities, and made the streets safer than some of their own homes. Police have been unable to explain the motive for the execution of Manuela Moulinier, 36. She was shot in the back of the head as she lay in bed feeding her month-old baby. Her stepdaughter Morgane probably saw the killer; a bullet passed through her hand before hitting her in the face. The husband, a refrigerator maintenance worker, ran screaming from the house after finding the two bodies when he went home for lunch. Police in the rural department of the Aveyron said he had been unable to help find a motive. \"This is the last place you would expect to find such cold-blooded violence,\" a gendarmerie officer said. \"No one in the village would even think of locking their doors.\" That false sense of security in rural areas from the Swiss border to Normandy had been prevalent at other murders since 1993 in which children were strangled, drowned, had their throats cut or died of gunshot wounds. In nearly every case a parent or relative was responsible. \"The murders were too far apart to look for a regional pattern,\" a health ministry official said. \"Once, you could link this sort of domestic killing to drink, but it may be right these days to think that some people can't bear the routine of rural life and let domestic problems get out of proportion,\" the official said. The day before the Mouliniers were found dead, a mother shot her daughters aged eight and six because her lover refused to come and live with them. In October, another mother stabbed to death her children aged eight and two because she believed that she was about to lose custody. In three other double murders last year, children were drowned or shot to death in rural areas by a parent after domestic quarrels.

      "body": "<p>The first firm evidence has emerged that the bio-tech food revolution is in retreat in its heartland - the vast cornfields of the American Midwest where the overwhelming bulk of the world's genetically engineered crops are grown. </p> <p>US farmers have just finished buying seed for the coming growing season, and early studies suggest that a significant proportion are abandoning GM. </p> <p>A market survey reveals that US farmers plan to plant 16% less genetically modified (GM) corn than they did last year. </p> <p>The nationwide survey by the American Corn Growers Association (ACGA) lends support to claims to be published today by the Worldwatch environmental group that the global acreage of all GM crops (mainly corn and soybeans) could fall by up to 25% compared with last year. </p> <p>Though sales of GM soybeans appear to be holding at last year's levels - more than half the total soybean crop - the rapid fall-off in demand for GM corn seeds represents a severe blow to the GM industry at its American core. The mass defection from GM seed will hit an industry already beset with consumer scepticism abroad, and falling stock prices on Wall Street. </p> <p>Most US market analysts questioned this week doubted that the GM slump would be as pronounced as Worldwatch - a Washington-based environmental watchdog - is suggesting. Even though no clear scientific evidence has so far surfaced proving GM crops are harmful, farmers are increasingly uncertain whether they will be able to sell their bio-tech harvest to a world concerned about its long-term health and ecological impact. </p> <p>\"The doubts are spreading like wildfire,\" Gary Goldberg, ACGA's chief executive officer, said. \"Farmers don't know if they're going to have a market next week.\" </p> <p>Producers' concerns were deepened this month when Frito-Lay, a giant producer of corn snacks and other convenience foods, told its suppliers that it would not be buying GM corn this year. Seagram, one of the world's largest distillers, made a similar announcement within a few days. The European Union imposed a two-year moratorium on new GM im ports last summer and in January an international \"biosafety protocol\" meeting in Montreal agreed that all exports of GM food products should be labelled. </p> <p>In a statement to be issued today Brian Halweil, a Worldwatch researcher, said: \"If more American manufacturers hop on the bandwagon, the drop in demand would be devastating for transgenic (GM) growers and seed producers.\" </p> <p>US growers are already feeling the pinch. Steve Mattis, an Illinois farmer and seed dealer, told the Guardian yesterday that while his customers were still buying soybean seed in about the same quantities as last season, demand for GM corn seed was down by 75%. </p> <p>\"There will be very, very little corn being planted around here,\" Mr Mattis said. \"The corn elevators [the wholesale markets] are highly recommending that we don't plant it.\" </p> <p>The Midwest slump has come despite a determined attempt by big GM producers such as Monsanto to shore up their share of the market. Monsanto representatives have appeared on television commercials to insist that the elevator operators will buy the harvested crop this autumn. </p> <p>Monsanto GM brands such as BT corn (genetically modified to produce its own insecticide) and Roundup Ready (engineered to survive Monsanto's all-purpose weedkiller) are being offered at discount prices in Illinois, according to Mr Mattis. </p> <p>Dean Urmstron, a representative of the seed industry lobby in Washington, said it was too early in the season to judge the market accurately and argued that the soybean market appeared to be \"ahead of last year\". </p> <p>But Mr Goldberg said he was confident the ACGA survey was an accurate portrayal of the market. It surveyed 582 farmers and initial results suggested that 35% have concerns about planting GM crops. Of them, 82% questioned their marketability. </p> <p>At his 600-acre farm in western Virginia, Wade Louthan said he had decided not to plant any GM corn this year, and to stop growing Roundup Ready soybeans. </p> <p>\"Not this year,\" the 37-year-old Virginian said. \"You boys [in Europe] have got us scared.\" </p> <p>Interviews with farmers across the country suggested that while many felt the European consumer response to GM foods was not entirely rational, there was growing resentment at what are seen as heavy-handed marketing techniques of the GM companies. </p> <p>Mr Mattis said: \"I've been a seed dealer for Monsanto for 18 years and this is the year we are going to have to part ways. They've forgotten that they have to serve farmers. I don't think they care who we've got to grow for. They're just concerned with making a fast buck.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first firm evidence has emerged that the bio-tech food revolution is in retreat in its heartland - the vast cornfields of the American Midwest where the overwhelming bulk of the world's genetically engineered crops are grown. US farmers have just finished buying seed for the coming growing season, and early studies suggest that a significant proportion are abandoning GM. A market survey reveals that US farmers plan to plant 16% less genetically modified (GM) corn than they did last year. The nationwide survey by the American Corn Growers Association (ACGA) lends support to claims to be published today by the Worldwatch environmental group that the global acreage of all GM crops (mainly corn and soybeans) could fall by up to 25% compared with last year. Though sales of GM soybeans appear to be holding at last year's levels - more than half the total soybean crop - the rapid fall-off in demand for GM corn seeds represents a severe blow to the GM industry at its American core. The mass defection from GM seed will hit an industry already beset with consumer scepticism abroad, and falling stock prices on Wall Street. Most US market analysts questioned this week doubted that the GM slump would be as pronounced as Worldwatch - a Washington-based environmental watchdog - is suggesting. Even though no clear scientific evidence has so far surfaced proving GM crops are harmful, farmers are increasingly uncertain whether they will be able to sell their bio-tech harvest to a world concerned about its long-term health and ecological impact. \"The doubts are spreading like wildfire,\" Gary Goldberg, ACGA's chief executive officer, said. \"Farmers don't know if they're going to have a market next week.\" Producers' concerns were deepened this month when Frito-Lay, a giant producer of corn snacks and other convenience foods, told its suppliers that it would not be buying GM corn this year. Seagram, one of the world's largest distillers, made a similar announcement within a few days. The European Union imposed a two-year moratorium on new GM im ports last summer and in January an international \"biosafety protocol\" meeting in Montreal agreed that all exports of GM food products should be labelled. In a statement to be issued today Brian Halweil, a Worldwatch researcher, said: \"If more American manufacturers hop on the bandwagon, the drop in demand would be devastating for transgenic (GM) growers and seed producers.\" US growers are already feeling the pinch. Steve Mattis, an Illinois farmer and seed dealer, told the Guardian yesterday that while his customers were still buying soybean seed in about the same quantities as last season, demand for GM corn seed was down by 75%. \"There will be very, very little corn being planted around here,\" Mr Mattis said. \"The corn elevators [the wholesale markets] are highly recommending that we don't plant it.\" The Midwest slump has come despite a determined attempt by big GM producers such as Monsanto to shore up their share of the market. Monsanto representatives have appeared on television commercials to insist that the elevator operators will buy the harvested crop this autumn. Monsanto GM brands such as BT corn (genetically modified to produce its own insecticide) and Roundup Ready (engineered to survive Monsanto's all-purpose weedkiller) are being offered at discount prices in Illinois, according to Mr Mattis. Dean Urmstron, a representative of the seed industry lobby in Washington, said it was too early in the season to judge the market accurately and argued that the soybean market appeared to be \"ahead of last year\". But Mr Goldberg said he was confident the ACGA survey was an accurate portrayal of the market. It surveyed 582 farmers and initial results suggested that 35% have concerns about planting GM crops. Of them, 82% questioned their marketability. At his 600-acre farm in western Virginia, Wade Louthan said he had decided not to plant any GM corn this year, and to stop growing Roundup Ready soybeans. \"Not this year,\" the 37-year-old Virginian said. \"You boys [in Europe] have got us scared.\" Interviews with farmers across the country suggested that while many felt the European consumer response to GM foods was not entirely rational, there was growing resentment at what are seen as heavy-handed marketing techniques of the GM companies. Mr Mattis said: \"I've been a seed dealer for Monsanto for 18 years and this is the year we are going to have to part ways. They've forgotten that they have to serve farmers. I don't think they care who we've got to grow for. They're just concerned with making a fast buck.\"",

A shake-out in the boardroom and plans to speed up the sale of half of the Geita mine in Tanzania united previously hostile shareholders and the 15-odd banks with which Ashanti conducted its ill-fated gold-hedging deals. The compromise came after two days of talks in the Ghanaian capital Accra involving Ghana's government, Ashanti managers, dissident shareholders and the leading stakeholder Lonmin, formerly the mining arm of the Lonrho group, all previously at odds with each other. With a deal agreed, Ghana's high court cleared the $100m it needs to complete the Geita project. Without the loan, Ashanti could have collapsed, brought down by its decision last year to bet heavily on a continuing slide in bullion prices. The Washington agreement in the autumn, under which big central banks agreed a moratorium on further gold sales, sent the price soaring and left Ashanti owing more than $500m to 15 banks. These banks have now agreed to roll over their right to call in Ashanti's sour gold-price hedges, and the $100m facility will allow the company to finish Geita.

Chairman David Crosland, confessed: \"The results for the quarter reflect the poor performance over the millennium period in all our major markets ... The industry as a whole failed to recognise that people would prefer to stay at home and celebrate the new millennium with family and friends than travel to foreign destinations.\" The slide in the Airtours share price underlines a difficult period in which the group had to swallow \u00a35.6m of costs associated with its bid for rival First Choice which was outlawed by the European commission. Further one-off costs are expected to mar results in the first half of the current financial year.",

PriceWaterhouseCoopers is believed to be asking for Mr Clough's assets to be frozen pending further inquiries, although no details were available last night. The writ is in the name of PWC's Anthony Lomas, receiver to Versailles, and is thought to have been served on Mr Clough's solicitors Orchard &amp; Co. Deutsche Bank profits up 50% Deutsche Bank reported a 50% jump in net income in 1999, beating forecasts as trading income offset a cost surge linked to restructuring and the integration of Bankers Trust. Germany's biggest bank said that net profit grew to euro 2.6bn (\u00a31.6bn) last year, up about 50% from 1998 and topping average analyst forecasts of around euro 2.5bn. Pretax profit reached euro 4.1bn, a rise of about 2%. Net income in the final quarter reached euro 721m, a strong improvement from just euro 77m in the third quarter. BMW presents plan for Rover BMW intends to present a rescue plan for its Rover subsidiary in \"the next few weeks\", according to reports from a German newspaper today, which cited unnamed sources within BMW. However, there is no guarantee that a solution for Rover can be presented before the next supervisory board meeting in mid-March, it said.",

      "bodyText": "President Clinton has made a last-ditch attempt to persuade Tony Blair to buy an American missile for the RAF's fleet of 232 Eurofighters instead of a European version. The US President underlined by hand \"I feel strongly\" about the decision in a letter last week to the prime minister obtained by the Guardian. The \u00a3900m deal has been the subject of the most intense political lobbying for a defence contract since the Westland affair split the Tory cabinet in 1986. Mr Blair has also been personally lobbied by an array of European leaders to back the European missile known as Meteor. The prime minister is under severe pressure from Mr Clinton and the Pentagon to opt for the \"beyond visual range air-to-air missile\" proposed by Raytheon and, with it, to prove his commitment to transatlantic defence co-operation. European colleagues, led by president Chirac of France and chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of Germany, are pressing him equally strongly to back the ramjet-powered Euro-missile and end American hegemony in missiles. Mr Blair will come under more pressure today when Matra BAe Dynamics, the Franco-British group that heads the six-nation Euro-consortium, plans to disclose that France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden are committed to buying Meteor for their own air forces - provided Britain jumps first. The White House note, signed simply \"Bill\", is the second Mr Clinton has sent in the past six months to underline how seriously the president takes the deal, worth around \u00a3900m. \"Ultimately, I know there are many factors that must enter into your BVRAAM contract selection,\" wrote Mr Clinton. \"I feel strongly that the Raytheon option is the one that best serves the interest of both our nations.\" Mr Clinton stresses the track record of the Raytheon missile and the American company's plan to co-operate with European firms including Shorts in Belfast. Andy Head, a Raytheon Systems director in Britain, confirming the letter's existence, said the Clinton administration had made an unprecedented offer to share top-secret breakthroughs in missiles technology with Britain and the Pentagon had put up an initial $250m (\u00a3160m) for this. The President's intervention came as both sides claimed that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, favoured their version of the missile - because they would create jobs in or near his Dunfermline constituency. The Euro-consortium has cut its price to around \u00a3750m. Raytheon, which is offering a cheaper \u00a3450m version capable of upgrade, claims to have the \"secret recipe\" for treasury approval in cost-savings and \"smart\" procurement that prevents over-runs. But industry insiders point to the American firm's declin ing share price. \"They are looking to the UK taxpayer to bail them out of a real financial crisis,\" one said. A senior Whitehall source said: \"New projects have a history of massive over-runs and it is true to say the treasury has some concerns.\" The ministry of defence's equipment approvals committee will recommend either the US or European versions next week amid mounting evidence that it favours Meteor.

She is simply a white, South African-born, Amsterdam-based painter. </p> <p>Marlene Dumas once dubbed herself Miss Interpreted, part of the wordplay in which she names her paintings and exhibitions. That nickname points up the painter's fate, the artist seen in the light of criticism and commentaries. She has no time for those who equate her images to real life. Her drawn and painted figures are not actual people, whose lives might have a moral dimension. </p> <p>\"My work isn't a politically correct project. It isn't about shock either. And it isn't a narrative, or the story of my life and loves,\" she says. One of the most uncomfortable things about her paintings is precisely that they don't tell stories, or imply moral judgment. \"Paintings can't really be narrative,\" she says, \"because you never get a story, only a single image. I don't paint a kiss, for example, because you look at the kiss and the people kissing, but somehow you remain outside the image.\" Instead, Dumas wants the experience of looking to be charged or dramatised, to drag the viewer in. </p> <p>She insists that her paintings don't present us with prostitutes, readers' wives, porno glamour girls, male and female strippers. They're images, with all the ambiguity that images entail. Maybe there are no innocent images. Even when she paints a baby, or a naked infant, it is a sexualised image. It's natural, she says, that a figurative painter would address the sexual, and use images of nakedness as source material. Dumas says she needs something to react to. Rely on what's in your own head and you come up with stereotypes. Meaning arises out of the encounter between the artist, the images she works from, and the image she creates, plus that later encounter between the viewer and the work. </p> <p>Does Dumas think women and men see her work in the same way? There's a difference, she suspects, and it is largely cultural, rather than innate. She muses that Michelangelo was great at painting naked men, terrible at women: they're just men with tits. \"Women, I think, are more interested in touching; men are interested in looking.\" Painting, as much as it is visual, is a tactile activity. For Dumas, it is as often about taking paint off, wiping paint away, as putting it on. The painting reveals its sense as it goes along. </p> <p>Dumas's drawings are shown just as they would be in her studio, pinned directly to the wall. Pinned-up but not pin-ups, although her models often come from her own photographs, from fashion spreads and porn mags. You can never escape the paintedness of the images, the language of her art. Dumas's drawings are worked rapidly in washy paint and have a slightly crazy air. The liquid soaks and spreads into the paper, creating puddles, drooling runs and feathery bleeds, through which Dumas navigates faces, torsos, sexual organs. Drawing for her seems to be a process of containment of these controlled accidents. And never doing too much, that's the key. This takes confidence. </p> <p>In the show there's an image of a man looking down at his engorged penis. \"Originally he was looking out at the viewer, which had a completely different reading. It didn't work, so I changed his hair to hide his eyes.\" Now he looks like Ruud Gullit, peering down at himself. The image, it seems to me, has flipped into completely different territory. We're looking at a man looking at himself, a collision between voyeurism and narcissism. There's another image of a Turkish girl, legs up, sex exposed. Her feet are cropped by the top edge of the painting. This makes you feel uncomfortably close to the image - as though your vision is cropped by your proximity too it. And the girl does look back, watching you watching her. </p> <p>Of course, we're watching Dumas too, watching her painting when we look at her work. This is one of the preoccupations of her writings. Dumas's notes and texts - poetic, aphoristic, funny and fierce - range from the entirely self-referential to her encounters with Goya and Rubens, and run in tandem with painting and drawing, which is why she's been spoken of as a painter \"with one foot in the conceptual camp\". \"I talk too much,\" Dumas says. \"I'm going to get angry now!\" She clearly finds the idea that painters should stick to painting, rather than talking or writing, horribly oppressive. She talks and goes on talking. </p> <p>She wanted to be a writer, she says, but she's a painter. No, I protest, she is a writer, a painter who writes. And don't paintings, if they're any good, always have a foot in conceptualism? \"My mother asked me why I didn't go back to making more 'philosophical' works instead of all this stuff about sex. And why not address things like child abuse, she said, because that's a big issue now in South Africa. But I said that would be even more pornographic...\" </p> <p>She laughs about artists' interviews, the way many of her peers insist on giving an \"official version\" of themselves, saying the same things over and over, honing the act. It's much more fun to make it up as you go along. But here's the warning: in her book of collected writings, Sweet Nothings, Dumas includes a short text called No More Interviews, in which she listed the reasons she didn't want to give any more \"spontaneous\" interviews. \"I can't think things over properly with a stranger facing me,\" she said. \"I'm not an entertainer.\" She wrote those lines more than 15 years ago. They may not haunt the artist, but they haunt the interviewer, the misinterpreter. </p> <p>MD: Marlene Dumas is at Camden Arts Centre, London NW3 (0171-435 2643), till March 26.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sex, bodies, painted situations. Marlene Dumas paints men and women in provocative poses, mooning and proffering themselves. A man looking at his erection, someone corseted in a straitjacket, a long-legged supermodel, a pregnant woman. The faces are sometimes alluring, sometimes ferocious, sometimes vulnerable or empty. Some of Dumas's recent works are now on display at the Camden Art Centre in London.

But why would I want to be rescued? I'm having my first tango lesson - and the time of my life. </p> <p>The scene is the gilt extravagance of the Waldorf Hotel's tea room, where Sunday dances are organised by tango dancer and zealot Christine Denniston. Denniston was once a graduate in theoretical physics but when she learned to tango in 1992 she discovered a way of life. She ran off to Buenos Aires, hung around its dance halls and learned her skills from some of Argentina's great tango masters. Now she is one of Britain's leading performers of the dance. </p> <p>Many of the Waldorf dancers are pupils and friends of Denniston; some of them have embraced tango with almost equal fervour. Over the past five years it has attracted a huge following, not only through clubs and classes, but also through stage shows - the latest of which, Una Noche de Tango, is about to open in London. </p> <p>The cult of Latin dance isn't new to drizzle-bound Britain. Various crazes have come and gone, inspired by Massine's flamenco-based ballet Le Tricorne (1919), Valentino's Hollywood tango, and visits from authentic Spanish virtuosos such as La Argentinita. Since the 80s our enthusiasm seems to have been unbroken, sustained by flamenco films like Carmen, visiting companies such as Cumbre Flamenca and the enduring salsa craze. For audiences, these hot foreign dances offer a mini-break to an exotic culture, but for participants they provide a special form of release. Many argue that they don't so much become a different person when they dance the steps of another country, rather they become more themselves. </p> <p>Tango lovers further insist that its qualities are unique. Its glamour, of course, is notorious. Tango is a dance to dress up for - beckoning women to put on their highest heels and men their sharpest suits - and while it evokes the heady perfume of European salons it also has the low-down, dirty whiff of the Buenos Aires barrios where it was born. It possesses too the most sensually wayward of rhythms, in its long, teasing, improvised glides and flick knife meshing of legs, its high, elegant strides and yielding arch of the back. </p> <p>The regulars at the Waldorf are dressed to the nines; the tourists who wander in off the street gape into the tea room as if it were a scene from an old movie. But image is the least of it, as I discover from the men who selflessly volunteer to steer me around the floor (three of whom are part of Denniston's ineffably gallant team of \"taxi dancers\"). </p> <p>Barry Jones, for instance, is perfectly styled in 40s mobster chic, with a flamboyant, macho suit and classically spivvy moustache. He looks like an extra from The Godfather, but when I ask what attracted him to tango his answer floors me more than the dancing. \"I got into it through yoga,\" he replies calmly. \"It has the same quality of inwardness. It's like meditation for two. It's body, mind and spirit.\" </p> <p>As soon as I start getting the hang of it, I realise that Barry is not some New Age tango mutant. Learning to tango is not about struggling, competitively, to perfect alien steps. It's about relaxing deep into a partner's practised embrace, feeling, literally, the beat of his heart and allowing him to lead you through the music. The more tuned two dancers become to each other, the more elegantly they elaborate their moves and the less obvious it becomes who is leading and who is being led. A dancer will learn all of the tango's characteristic steps, but as Denniston says, \"it's by contagion rather than imitation\". </p> <p>The analogy with sex is so obvious I hate to mention it. But as everyone remarks, the greatest tango dancers aren't necessarily the ones who can do the flashiest moves; they're the ones who are the most responsive, the most physically at ease. </p> <p>Denniston has an interesting theory about why tango evolved this way. In the first decades of the 20th century, Buenos Aires was teeming with immigrants, many of whom were men, many of whom felt painfully isolated from their families back home. The tango's embrace, its technical requirement of intimacy, was a way of getting close to strangers. Even in the plush Waldorf I was startled by how much I learned about my partners and how fast. Every turn around the floor was like an intense physical conversation, characterised by the relaxed, witty confidence of one partner, the more tender formality of another. </p> <p>Denniston also describes how tango used to be a man's most guaranteed form of dating women. When an Argentinian boy hit puberty he would be initiated by an older man, who'd lead him around the dance floor. After a year he'd practise with other boys, taking it in turns to lead and follow. After three years he'd finally ask a real woman to tango, by which time he'd not only be a divinely proficient dancer, he'd also, as Denniston says, \"have spent three years learning how to put himself in a woman's place, understanding how to make the dance easy and comfortable for her\". He'd be irresistible. </p> <p>This tango culture was current until the 50s when dance halls were banned by fascist governments. In 1983 the fall of the junta sparked a massive revival but the old ways weren't fully restored. As a lot of people wanted to learn the tango fast, many teachers taught it as they would any other dance, by demonstrating its steps in isolation and getting pupils to copy them. </p> <p>In today's commercial shows it's easy to distinguish the dancers who have \"been infected\" by tango from those who have picked it up in the dance studio. The latter tend to be highly professional Argentinian folk dancers who have been cast because they are younger, glossier and more disciplined than authentic tango dancers. They may be virtuoso performers but it's the dumpier middle-aged couples who usually make our hair stand on end. They make us feel that they are dancing heart to heart, that they're not only dancing steps, but an entire lifetime, even an entire history. </p> <p>The loss of tradition worries Denniston deeply. Not only does it breed a culture where qualities of style and musicality are often sacrificed to superficial competence, it also denies tango's unique form of contact. Even for beginners, old-style tango involves an element of emotional as well as physical communion: two people hearing the music as one, improvising their moves as one. Denniston argues that in high-tech societies where people increasingly live alone, this intimacy is one we can ill afford to lose. Among her own pupils, many report that tango changes the way they behave: they get better at intuiting body language, they learn how to assert themselves without being aggressive, they find they can give in to people without feeling weak. </p> <p>Is tango simply an excuse for male control freaks to boss submissive female partners around the floor? Women do sometimes dance with other women in public, and even take the lead with a male partner, but in Argentina this is still rare. In Sally Potter's film The Tango Lesson, Pablo, her Argentinian partner, rants at Potter's over-active dancing. \"You should do nothing... When you dance, you should follow. Otherwise you block my freedom to move - You destroy my liberty and I can do nothing.\" This may sound like male pride dressed up in Lawrentian metaphysics, but the reality is much more attractive. Alan Brown, one of my own partners, admits that some \"warped\" men do get off on the idea of power, but he insists they're a tiny minority. Before we start to dance he tells me to think of him \"as a tango sweet shop. I'm here for you to take all kinds of delicious tango sweets from.\" It's a perfect image. Alan guides me expertly around the floor, covers up all my mistakes, and makes it possible for me to do steps I didn't know I could do. As Denniston says, \"If this is macho, then I wish the world were a more macho place.\" </p> <p>Una Noche de Tango opens at the Peacock Theatre, London WC2 (0171-863 8222), next Wednesday.

      "body": "<p><strong> Past medical history</strong> </p> <p> Asthma diagnosed 1980; diabetes mellinus type 2 diagnosed 1990. Cardiac conduction defect identified 1992. A pacemaker was inserted and amiodarone prescribed. Previous attacks of gout, previous repair of left inguinal hernia; deafness due to accoustic trauma. Parkinsonian features and memory defect. </p> <p> <strong> Recent medical history</strong> </p> <p> For the last eight to nine months he has noted difficulty in walking, and can now only cover 200 yards before his legs become too weak to continue. He now walks with a stick. Numbness over the soles of his feet has progressed over that time. </p> <p>Over the last 10 months he has noticed a gradual progression of problems with memory which have become much more marked recently. He has difficulties in remembering people's names and in recalling events of long ago. He has been reported as talking as if he had difficulty in turning ideas into speech. </p> <p>On September 9, 1999, he was walking in the garden and developed sudden headache and imbalance. Other episodes ... reported to us include once failing to recognise his wife and once failing to register that his son had visited him. He recalls an instance in which his vision became dim. </p> <p>When seen by Dr Thomas on September 14 ... the clinical diagnosis was of multiple small bilateral cerebral infarcts. </p> <p>When reviewed later ... further deterioration with probable further cerebral ischaemic event on September 20 and October 9. A definite increase in parkinsonian features was noted, with ... speech difficulty, deterioration in hand writing, inability to dress himself, and needing help in rising from a chair. </p> <p>Since then the senator has had two further falls, one in the garden and one in the bathroom, both due to loss of balance without impairment of consciousness. His voice ... has deteriorated. </p> <p>There is a history of urinary symptoms - hesitancy, poor stream, urgency and occasional minor incontinence. He can generally stay in bed until early morning but thereafter may have to void three or four times. </p> <p>Senator Pinochet was depressed last summer but following a change of medication ... this has ceased to be a problem. He still feels homesick and bored and frustrated by physical ills. </p> <p>In recent months he has lost interest in former activities. He used to read and use the computer but now tends to sit watching television and says he has forgotten how to use the computer. Letter writing has become a chore. Recently he has developed difficulty in shaving without cutting himself. </p> <p> <strong> Examination</strong> </p> <p> Senator Pinochet arrived in wheelchair and was interviewed in bed. He is severely deaf ... he was alert and cooperative but easily tired. His voice was quiet and monotonous in tone and speech was indistinct. </p> <p>Cerebration: Showed slowness in comprehension with difficulty in understanding complex instructions. </p> <p>Mood: Good rapport and cooperative. Face immobile but smiled appropriately. Sense of humour intact. No evidence of depression. </p> <p>Gait: Required help in getting out of bed and in steadying when standing. Wide-based short-paced gait holding stick in right hand and no swinging of left arm. Tendency to fall backwards. Turning unremarkable. </p> <p>Neuropsychological assessment undertaken in Spanish by Dr Maria A. Wyke, Devonshire Hospital, London. \"Gen Pinochet shows a moderate/severe deterioration of intellectual function beyond that due to his age. He was a person of superior intelligence and at present in functioning within the low/average range. Short term memory, learning ability and delayed recall all show severe deficit. His greatest difficulty is his inability to retain information over time. There is no evidence Gen Pinochet is attempting to fake disability. In my opinion he would not be able to cope with the legal complexities of a trial.\" </p> <p> <strong> Conclusions</strong> </p> <p> General: Senator Pinochet has a complex medical history, but the main active medical problems at present are diabetic peripheral neuropathy and recently progressive cerebrovascular brain damage. The diabetic neuropathology is contributing to difficulties in walking and ... will also have predisposed to arterial disease as will a past history of smoking. </p> <p>The cerebrovascular disease has manifested partly as minor strokes and transient asthmatic attacks but also causes progressive damage without acute symptoms. There is clinical evidence of extensive damage to the brain ... producing features of parkinsonism. </p> <p> <strong> Fitness for trial</strong> </p> <p> Physically: Senator Pinochet would at present be able to attend a trial but ... further deterioration in both physical and mental condition is likely. </p> <p>Mentally: It is our view that Senator Pinochet would not at the present be mentally capable of meaningful participation in a trial. We base this opinion on: </p> <p>1. Memory defecit for both recent and remote events; </p> <p>2. Limited ability to understand complex sentences and questions owing to memory impairment and consequent inability to process verbal information appropriately; </p> <p>3. Impaired ability to express himself audibly, succinctly and relevantly; </p> <p>4. Easy fatiguability. </p> <p>With these impediments he would be unable to follow the progress of a trial sufficiently to instruct counsel. He would have difficulty in understanding the content and implications of questions put to him. </p> <p>His memory of remote events is impaired. He would have difficulty making himself heard and understood in replying to questions. </p> <p>We are satisfied that the impediments we have identified are due to brain damage, as they are coherent in nature and consistent in manifestation and formal neuropsychological testing showed none of the features of deliberate exaggeration of impairment. </p> <p>Situational stress, as likely to be occasioned by trial, produces physiological responses that could accelerate the progression of vascular disease. We were told, however, that Senator Pinochet has in the past shown notable personal abilities in managing stress. We therefore do not feel able to express any useful opinion on the possible effects on his health of undergoing trial. </p> <p>Although some day to day fluctuation in functional abilities is characteristic of brain damage due to cerebrovascular disease we consider further sustained functional improvement of a significant degree unlikely. </p> <p><strong>Doctors support report findings</strong></p> <p>\u0095 David Black, consultant geriatrician: \"I think what it [the leaked report] shows is that he [General Pinochet] is a frail, elderly gentleman with many of the common diseases and conditions associated with old age. </p> <p>\"The main problem he has is with strokes.

The likelihood is that people with diabetes tend to have further episodes in the future. </p> <p>\"He also has physical symptoms similar to those of a Parkinson's sufferer.

The major aspect of this report is that there is significant brain disorder due to a disease of the blood vessels and no doubt strokes have affected the brain. </p> <p>Clearly he is a highly intelligent man who due to disease of the blood vessels would now appear at best to have difficulty in understanding complex conversation and at worst to have difficulty in taking part in anything complex.

      "body": "<p>Cliff Stanford has made one fortune by bringing the internet to the mass market, through Demon Internet, and now he'd like to make another by using the net to deliver movies. This week the Redbus Film Group, of which Stanford is chairman, said it had secured the rights to some notable films, but the two-year old film distribution company won't launch an internet service until high-speed access is more widely available. </p> <p> Not everyone is waiting. There's already a fast-growing market for what the traditional media business calls \"video on demand\", but the net knows as \"streaming media\". The net can't yet deliver what Stanford wants - \"full-screen TV pictures with VHS quality\" - and what the mainstream film-watching public requires. But if you want to be entertained for a minute or three, are receptive to independent productions, and don't mind watching a screen image the size of a credit card, the internet already has lots to offer. </p> <p> It's been disparaged as \"cinema for the MTV generation\" and \"short attention span theatre\", but you get a front-row seat without leaving your desk, and the latest releases are only a mouse-click away. The leading websites include <a href=\"http://www.atomfilms.com\" target=\"_new\">Atomfilms</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ifilm.net\" target=\"_new\">iFilm</a>, a film community site, <a href=\"http://www.broadcast.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo! Broadcast</a> and <a href=\"http://shortbuzz.com\" target=\"_new\">ShortBuzz</a>. <a href=\"http://www.pseudo.com\" target=\"_new\">Pseudo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.loadtv.com\" target=\"_new\">LoadTV</a> also provide streamed content but in a more TV-like style. (LoadTV has Death Row Records' music videos.) </p> <p> Michael Cornish, managing director of Atomfilms in Europe, says: \"We stream more movies than any other website, as far as I know: we're shipping one to two million movies a month, and it's growing month on month. But if you're expecting a television-like experience, you'll be disappointed.\" But this is just the start of a development that could change the industry, and some of the major players have noticed. </p> <p>Film industry hot shots Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg think streaming video has, in the latter's words, \"unlimited potential\": their company, DreamWorks, is working with Imagine Entertainment on a site called <a href=\"http://www.pop.com\" target=\"_new\">Pop.com</a>, which is expected in the spring. Warner Bros Online is also exploring web-based video through its <a href=\"http://www.entertaindom.com\" target=\"_new\">Entertaindom</a> site, launched late last year. Others will follow. </p> <p>Perhaps the digital wind of change that blew through the publishing industry in the 80s and the music industry in the 90s will have a similar impact on the film industry in the coming decade. Certainly the arrival of affordable digital cameras, powerful personal computers and video-editing software will enable a wider range of people to make movies. However, it's really the internet that has changed the picture. Thanks to the net, movies that wouldn't normally be seen outside a film festival are now available to a global audience. In fact, the net has suddenly made short films a prized commodity, with more than a dozen websites competing to attract the best.</p> <p> While there may not be much money in it, there are real prizes: the Charged webzine and Film.com are running <a href=\"http://www.chargedfilmfestival.com\" target=\"_new\">ChargeCoupled</a>, a competition for one-minute movies, while the web-based <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodfestival.com\" target=\"_new\">Hollywood Film Festival</a> has recently added a <a href=\"http://hollywooddigital.com\" target=\"_new\">Hollywood Digital Film Festival</a>.</p> <p> It's a somewhat arty market, but Cornish says this reflects the demographics of the net, which is skewed towards young males. \"It also reflects what's available: the big entertainment companies are not putting their movies on the internet, so you're seeing alternative forms of content. Having said that, we've got the best British content [at Atomfilms] including several Bafta award winners and Nick Park's Aardvark films....\" In the US, at least, the net has been adopted by experimental film makers, and the <a href=\"http://www.binarytheater.com\" target=\"_new\">Binary Theatre</a> specialises in student films. </p> <p>British independents and film students don't seem to have taken their chance. The <a href=\"http://www.ica.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Institute of Contemporary Arts</a> in London, for example, runs Uncut, a series of monthly meetings for up-and-coming film makers, but Christine Atha of the ICA's education department says the internet hasn't made any impact so far. She couldn't think of anyone who'd put a film online.</p> <p> Nor could Eric Janssen at the <a href=\"http://www.lifs.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">London International Film School</a>, \"the oldest film school in the world\". He said: \"none of our students are doing it at the moment - the technology is moving way too fast for us - but it won't be long now, that's for sure.\" </p> <p>That's a shame because the cinema is going digital in a hurry. \"We have digital editing, digital production, digital projection, and in the future we'll have direct digital distribution,\" says Cornish, \"so film will disappear. It's happening at a speed far greater than people realise.\" Gill Henderson, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.lfvda.demon.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">London Film and Video Development Agency</a>, which has a \u00a3700,000 budget to support independent film, video and television, says: \"From the short film maker's point of view, the net is going to be the easiest, quickest and cheapest way of distributing your work. The changes [digital technology] will bring to the exhibition [of films] could in some ways be the most revolutionary part of the process. </p> <p> \"It will blow open a lot of things like copyright and [restricted] territories for selling films. I don't think a lot of people have thought this through, yet.\" Everyone also agrees that the breakthrough will come with high-speed broadband internet access via ADSL phone lines or cable modems. These work at least 10 times faster than standard 56K dial-up modems. \"By moving to broadband you get a quantum leap in the quality of the entertainment experience,\" Cornish says, \"because the picture size moves from being quite small to quite large. It's as simple as that! You can also bundle in a lot of ancillary information, as with DVD, which makes it much more compelling. So broadband becomes the inflection point for really serious growth.\"</p> <p>And when that happens, the film students, experimental movie makers and pop video directors who are attracting an audience on today's web will have to compete with full length features made with big budgets and Hollywood production values. Companies like Stanford's Redbus Internet Distribution will be on the web selling streamed movies on a pay-per-view basis, to save you the trip to a video rental shop.

      "bodyText": "Cliff Stanford has made one fortune by bringing the internet to the mass market, through Demon Internet, and now he'd like to make another by using the net to deliver movies. This week the Redbus Film Group, of which Stanford is chairman, said it had secured the rights to some notable films, but the two-year old film distribution company won't launch an internet service until high-speed access is more widely available. Not everyone is waiting. There's already a fast-growing market for what the traditional media business calls \"video on demand\", but the net knows as \"streaming media\". The net can't yet deliver what Stanford wants - \"full-screen TV pictures with VHS quality\" - and what the mainstream film-watching public requires. But if you want to be entertained for a minute or three, are receptive to independent productions, and don't mind watching a screen image the size of a credit card, the internet already has lots to offer. It's been disparaged as \"cinema for the MTV generation\" and \"short attention span theatre\", but you get a front-row seat without leaving your desk, and the latest releases are only a mouse-click away. The leading websites include Atomfilms and iFilm, a film community site, Yahoo! Broadcast and ShortBuzz. Pseudo and LoadTV also provide streamed content but in a more TV-like style. (LoadTV has Death Row Records' music videos.) Michael Cornish, managing director of Atomfilms in Europe, says: \"We stream more movies than any other website, as far as I know: we're shipping one to two million movies a month, and it's growing month on month. But if you're expecting a television-like experience, you'll be disappointed.\" But this is just the start of a development that could change the industry, and some of the major players have noticed. Film industry hot shots Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg think streaming video has, in the latter's words, \"unlimited potential\": their company, DreamWorks, is working with Imagine Entertainment on a site called Pop.com, which is expected in the spring. Warner Bros Online is also exploring web-based video through its Entertaindom site, launched late last year. Others will follow. Perhaps the digital wind of change that blew through the publishing industry in the 80s and the music industry in the 90s will have a similar impact on the film industry in the coming decade. Certainly the arrival of affordable digital cameras, powerful personal computers and video-editing software will enable a wider range of people to make movies. However, it's really the internet that has changed the picture. Thanks to the net, movies that wouldn't normally be seen outside a film festival are now available to a global audience. In fact, the net has suddenly made short films a prized commodity, with more than a dozen websites competing to attract the best. While there may not be much money in it, there are real prizes: the Charged webzine and Film.com are running ChargeCoupled, a competition for one-minute movies, while the web-based Hollywood Film Festival has recently added a Hollywood Digital Film Festival. It's a somewhat arty market, but Cornish says this reflects the demographics of the net, which is skewed towards young males. \"It also reflects what's available: the big entertainment companies are not putting their movies on the internet, so you're seeing alternative forms of content. Having said that, we've got the best British content [at Atomfilms] including several Bafta award winners and Nick Park's Aardvark films....\" In the US, at least, the net has been adopted by experimental film makers, and the Binary Theatre specialises in student films. British independents and film students don't seem to have taken their chance. The Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, for example, runs Uncut, a series of monthly meetings for up-and-coming film makers, but Christine Atha of the ICA's education department says the internet hasn't made any impact so far. She couldn't think of anyone who'd put a film online. Nor could Eric Janssen at the London International Film School, \"the oldest film school in the world\". He said: \"none of our students are doing it at the moment - the technology is moving way too fast for us - but it won't be long now, that's for sure.\" That's a shame because the cinema is going digital in a hurry. \"We have digital editing, digital production, digital projection, and in the future we'll have direct digital distribution,\" says Cornish, \"so film will disappear. It's happening at a speed far greater than people realise.\" Gill Henderson, chief executive of the London Film and Video Development Agency, which has a \u00a3700,000 budget to support independent film, video and television, says: \"From the short film maker's point of view, the net is going to be the easiest, quickest and cheapest way of distributing your work. The changes [digital technology] will bring to the exhibition [of films] could in some ways be the most revolutionary part of the process. \"It will blow open a lot of things like copyright and [restricted] territories for selling films. I don't think a lot of people have thought this through, yet.\" Everyone also agrees that the breakthrough will come with high-speed broadband internet access via ADSL phone lines or cable modems. These work at least 10 times faster than standard 56K dial-up modems. \"By moving to broadband you get a quantum leap in the quality of the entertainment experience,\" Cornish says, \"because the picture size moves from being quite small to quite large. It's as simple as that! You can also bundle in a lot of ancillary information, as with DVD, which makes it much more compelling. So broadband becomes the inflection point for really serious growth.\" And when that happens, the film students, experimental movie makers and pop video directors who are attracting an audience on today's web will have to compete with full length features made with big budgets and Hollywood production values. Companies like Stanford's Redbus Internet Distribution will be on the web selling streamed movies on a pay-per-view basis, to save you the trip to a video rental shop. Stanford says: \"we're working on compression techniques to get the bandwidth down to 512 kilobits per second, which is well within the capabilities of cable modems and ASDL. We could be ready by the end of this year, maybe.\" You could be logging on to the web to watch movies sooner than you think. Stream that video... or download it?

Downloading files can take some time, so it helps to have a free or flat-rate internet connection, even if the \"free\" periods are only in the evening and/or at weekends. However, it's also essential to have Headlight Software's GetRight or a similar utility, which can be downloaded from the net. In the web's early days, if the phone connection was dropped (or often if it wasn't) a file download would stop, and you'd have to start again from the beginning.

RealNetworks' RealVideo is probably essential - Michael Cornish of Atomfilms reckons it has about 85% of the streaming video market - with Macromedia's Shockwave Flash for cartoons. Microsoft's Windows Media Player supports a wide range of streaming and playback formats such as .avi, .asf, .mpg, .mpeg, .mp2 and .mp3, including Apple's QuickTime (.qt, .mov etc), though you may also want Apple's own player.

Banks' languishing share prices, pummelled of late by investors dumping \"traditional\" stocks, jumped yesterday when Halifax gained 22p to 453p and Woolwich rose 9p to 280p. Barclays, which claims to be country's biggest internet bank, jumped 7% to \u00a315.48. Richard Meddings, finance director of Woolwich, which has been regarded as being ahead of its rivals with its technology plans, admitted: \"It's the year of delivery. It's a watershed year.\" The bank has set its future on technology, through link-ups with Nokia and Vodafone, and its \"open plan\" Woolwich-branded integrated banking service, on which it will spend \u00a330m developing in 2001 and 2002. Woolwich is aiming for 2m \"open plan\" customers by 2002 and said that 20% of the 44,000 it had at the end of last year were new customers to the banks. It also has 100 customers piloting its Wap service, which allows customers to bank via mobile phone. Woolwich is spending \u00a3125m on its technology plans. Mr Meddings said: \"We have a clear strategy which people are increasingly seeing the merit of. That will come through in (stock market) value,\" he said. James Crosby, the Halifax chief executive, said the mobile phone services would be introduced to its 2m current account customers, greenfield.co customers and clients of \"other, as yet announced, internet ventures\" in the summer.",

The rule of thumb is that part of the increase in earnings is covered by higher productivity, which improves by around 2.5% a year on average.

Let's assume that the hawks are right and the increase in earnings is not just a one-off but a sign that the labour market is overheating. What then? The experience of the past 25 years suggests companies will respond by passing on their extra costs in higher prices. But in the Britain of 2000, despite eight years of growth, that is not an option for vast chunks of the corporate sector. To take one example: sales of household goods were up 10% in the final three months of last year but prices are 0.7% lower than they were a year ago. Firms are simply not able to pass on higher costs in the way they did in the 70s and 80s; they take the hit on their margins instead. </p> <p>The combination of a one percentage point increase in interest rates and the stronger pound means that monetary policy has already been tightened significantly in recent months.

The government has taken comfort from indications that factory output has started to recover a little, but the message on the ground is that companies are hanging on by the skin of their teeth, increasing output but working on negligible or non-existent margins. </p> <p>As for rising property prices in the south-east, most of those sitting on big capital gains and tempted to fund consumption by equity withdrawal have fixed-rate mortgages which are priced according to long-term interest rates. Pushing up short-term rates increases the Bank's anti-inflation credibility in the City, leading to lower long-term rates. </p> <p>The treasury is aware of all this, and there will be fiscal measures in the budget to target house price-inflation in the south-east. For political reasons, the best method of choking off demand - falling into line with most of the rest of Europe and slapping capital gains tax on all house sales - is not on the agenda, but there will almost certainly be a further increase in stamp duty.

      "body": "<p> A fundraiser for two sailors' charities, this was on the face of it an old-fashioned, patriotic programme. But if the concert was intended to paint a picture of Britain, it was a rather muddled portrait that emerged, by turns introspective and outward-looking. </p> <p>The work that began the concert received the most satisfying performance. Vernon Handley has earned a reputation as a champion of British music, and his Elgar interpretations are perhaps his most instinctive. He conducted the overture Froissart with just the right ebb and flow, with a generous amount of caprice alongside a sense of grandeur. </p> <p>The same care for detail was apparent in his direction of Elgar's Cello Concerto, though the atmosphere of this postwar work, written in 1919 by a disillusioned man, was in stark contrast to the optimism of Froissart. Cellist Colin Carr stood in for an indisposed Kathryn Price; his was a solid performance, perhaps a little heavy on vibrato, but confident and thoughtful. The opening melody was subdued and rather steady, but the second movement danced, and the slow section of the Finale had enough impassioned gravity to make a convincing case for it as the core of the whole concerto. </p> <p>There was no autumnal feeling in the second of Granville Bantock's Heroic Ballads, Kishmul's Galley. Based around a folk song from the Outer Hebrides, it was an evocative enough depiction of open seas, wheeling gulls and rolling waves, but its triumphalism sounded empty, especially when put next to the Four Sea Interludes from Britten's opera Peter Grimes. Like the Bantock, these were written in wartime, but their stifling atmosphere seemed truer to an era when careless talk cost lives. </p> <p>Despite the link with King Arthur, Bax's Tintagel owes little to British tradition. It's much more firmly rooted in the musical world of Debussy's La Mer, while the composer identified most with Celtic and Irish nationalism. But it's an effective depiction of a view onto an expanse of ocean, and the Philharmonia brought its lush orchestration vividly to life. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A fundraiser for two sailors' charities, this was on the face of it an old-fashioned, patriotic programme. But if the concert was intended to paint a picture of Britain, it was a rather muddled portrait that emerged, by turns introspective and outward-looking. The work that began the concert received the most satisfying performance. Vernon Handley has earned a reputation as a champion of British music, and his Elgar interpretations are perhaps his most instinctive. He conducted the overture Froissart with just the right ebb and flow, with a generous amount of caprice alongside a sense of grandeur. The same care for detail was apparent in his direction of Elgar's Cello Concerto, though the atmosphere of this postwar work, written in 1919 by a disillusioned man, was in stark contrast to the optimism of Froissart. Cellist Colin Carr stood in for an indisposed Kathryn Price; his was a solid performance, perhaps a little heavy on vibrato, but confident and thoughtful. The opening melody was subdued and rather steady, but the second movement danced, and the slow section of the Finale had enough impassioned gravity to make a convincing case for it as the core of the whole concerto. There was no autumnal feeling in the second of Granville Bantock's Heroic Ballads, Kishmul's Galley. Based around a folk song from the Outer Hebrides, it was an evocative enough depiction of open seas, wheeling gulls and rolling waves, but its triumphalism sounded empty, especially when put next to the Four Sea Interludes from Britten's opera Peter Grimes. Like the Bantock, these were written in wartime, but their stifling atmosphere seemed truer to an era when careless talk cost lives. Despite the link with King Arthur, Bax's Tintagel owes little to British tradition. It's much more firmly rooted in the musical world of Debussy's La Mer, while the composer identified most with Celtic and Irish nationalism. But it's an effective depiction of a view onto an expanse of ocean, and the Philharmonia brought its lush orchestration vividly to life.",

      "body": "<p>There was precious little room on stage in the Royal Scottish Academy's Matt Thomson Hall for the world premiere of Silvina Milstein's A Media Luz. </p> <p>One of three first performances given by Rumon Gamba and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra as part of a live Hear and Now broadcast for Radio 3, the Debussian voluptuousness of Milstein's work was the most ambitious on the programme. </p> <p>Splashes of percussion overlaid a heaving welter of string sound, while woodwind and brass provided a dense, weaving cantus firmus to bind the texture. </p> <p>Milstein fashions a seductive drama between individual lines, including a violin solo which rides precariously atop the crest of a tumultuous wave of string sonority. </p> <p>There was an overall abundance of colour. In some passages, all melodic clarity is sacrificed in favour of a vivid, chaotic wash of sound, as Milstein piles hundreds of different parts on top of one another in a Babel-like confusion. </p> <p>But then, at the end of the work, Milstein pares her palette down to the intimacy of a lone violinist. This betrays the origins of the piece's heightened passions in her memories of an Argentinian popular song of candlelight and romance. </p> <p>Magnus Robb's Luscinian Blue is based on his transcriptions of a nightingale's song, but its effect could hardly be more different from the sumptuous exoticism of Stravinsky's famous nightingale evocation in his Chant du Rossignol.</p> <p> In the BBC SSO's performance, Luscinian Blue was played simultaneously with another of Robb's nightingale pieces for two percussionists. Unlike in Messiaen's music, birds and birdsong do not represent a spiritual or emotional transcendence for Robb. Instead, the combination of Luscinian Blue's pointillistic orchestration and the percussion's woody onomatopoeia sounded like an amplification and celebration of the usually ignored sounds of a forest walk. </p> <p>Judith Bingham's trumpet concerto, The Shooting Star, is an attempt to convey the intense and destructive idealism of the poet Shelley's life. Bingham's writing for the solo trumpet is appropriately stratospheric, and Mark O'Keeffe dealt convincingly with the difficulties of the solo part. But Bingham's music, whatever its well-written cinematic narrative and accessible, post-Romantic idiom, scarcely conveys the danger or thrill of Shelley's convictions. </p> <p>The confidence of Stuart MacRae's handling of the orchestra in his 1999 Sinfonia is a mark of the benefits of his associate composership with the BBCSSO. Broad, tortuous string lines and woodwind fragments gradually fuse in a thunderously impressive climax. </p> <p>But MacRae's structure contains its surprises too: in the way the storm clouds suddenly part to reveal a separate strata of woodwind chatter, and the final reprise of the opening music's uneasy tranquillity. Gamba and the BBC SSO forces strongly conveyed the work's rugged outlines, even if there were hints of raggedness about the ensemble in the thick, dark textures of MacRae's orchestration. </p>",

      "bodyText": "There was precious little room on stage in the Royal Scottish Academy's Matt Thomson Hall for the world premiere of Silvina Milstein's A Media Luz. One of three first performances given by Rumon Gamba and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra as part of a live Hear and Now broadcast for Radio 3, the Debussian voluptuousness of Milstein's work was the most ambitious on the programme. Splashes of percussion overlaid a heaving welter of string sound, while woodwind and brass provided a dense, weaving cantus firmus to bind the texture. Milstein fashions a seductive drama between individual lines, including a violin solo which rides precariously atop the crest of a tumultuous wave of string sonority. There was an overall abundance of colour. In some passages, all melodic clarity is sacrificed in favour of a vivid, chaotic wash of sound, as Milstein piles hundreds of different parts on top of one another in a Babel-like confusion. But then, at the end of the work, Milstein pares her palette down to the intimacy of a lone violinist. This betrays the origins of the piece's heightened passions in her memories of an Argentinian popular song of candlelight and romance. Magnus Robb's Luscinian Blue is based on his transcriptions of a nightingale's song, but its effect could hardly be more different from the sumptuous exoticism of Stravinsky's famous nightingale evocation in his Chant du Rossignol. In the BBC SSO's performance, Luscinian Blue was played simultaneously with another of Robb's nightingale pieces for two percussionists. Unlike in Messiaen's music, birds and birdsong do not represent a spiritual or emotional transcendence for Robb. Instead, the combination of Luscinian Blue's pointillistic orchestration and the percussion's woody onomatopoeia sounded like an amplification and celebration of the usually ignored sounds of a forest walk. Judith Bingham's trumpet concerto, The Shooting Star, is an attempt to convey the intense and destructive idealism of the poet Shelley's life. Bingham's writing for the solo trumpet is appropriately stratospheric, and Mark O'Keeffe dealt convincingly with the difficulties of the solo part. But Bingham's music, whatever its well-written cinematic narrative and accessible, post-Romantic idiom, scarcely conveys the danger or thrill of Shelley's convictions. The confidence of Stuart MacRae's handling of the orchestra in his 1999 Sinfonia is a mark of the benefits of his associate composership with the BBCSSO. Broad, tortuous string lines and woodwind fragments gradually fuse in a thunderously impressive climax. But MacRae's structure contains its surprises too: in the way the storm clouds suddenly part to reveal a separate strata of woodwind chatter, and the final reprise of the opening music's uneasy tranquillity. Gamba and the BBC SSO forces strongly conveyed the work's rugged outlines, even if there were hints of raggedness about the ensemble in the thick, dark textures of MacRae's orchestration.",

Jonathan Dove, George Benjamin and Alexander Goehr were invited this year, and for Tuesday's concert Goehr had put together a typically thoughtful programme, in which his works were heard alongside Eisler and Webern, two composers from the 20th century Austro-German tradition that has formed the backdrop to his creative development. </p> <p>At a time when Eisler's songs are finally getting the recognition they deserve, it was good to hear an example of his beautifully crafted instrumental writing. Fourteen Ways of Describing Rain doubled as a 70th birthday tribute to his teacher Schoenberg (the instrumental ensemble echoes that of Pierrot Lunaire) and as a film score, each of its neat, sparkling sequence of miniatures perfectly distinct in texture and colour. Then two of Webern's most densely impacted sets of songs - the Three Traditional Rhymes and the Five Canons on Latin Texts - enclosed Goehr's own Three Songs Op 60, which take texts describing mysterious rituals from Ovid, and give them quirky, sometimes disquieting musical frames. </p> <p>One of the most impressive of Goehr's recent compositions filled the second half of the programme. Sing Ariel is a 50-minute song-cycle, though of an unconventional kind. The text, compiled by the literary critic Frank Kermode (a Cambridge colleague of the composer), is a work of art in its own right. Goehr describes it as a \"poem of poems\", taking extracts from a wide range of sources - Spenser to Stevens, Milton to Craig Raine - and shaping them into a marvellously allusive sequence that charts a kind of progression from youth to old age. Auden's poem The Sea and the Mirror, a line from which forms the title of the cycle, acts as prologue and epilogue. </p> <p>Goehr's setting is by turns elliptical and witheringly direct. The mezzo soloist (Louise Mott, making every syllable matter) is shadowed by a pair of sopranos (Sarah Leonard and Eileen Hulse, soloists in the earlier Goehr and Webern respectively); the instrumental ensemble contains saxophone and trumpet. There are sudden eruptions of instrumental virtuosity, including a wracked double-bass cadenza, and a centrepiece of mysterious bleakness with a complete setting of Philip Larkin's Unfinished Poem. Perhaps the work is fractionally too long, but there are many rewards along the way.</p>",
