It seems curious then that within 24 hours of Kevin Keegan's resignation, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was invited to take charge of the national team.</p> <p>I understand that on the Sunday following England's 1-0 defeat by Germany, a senior figure at the FA was deputed to ask Wenger if he would take charge for the match in Finland in three days' time. The Arsenal manager politely declined, deeming the idea unworkable. </p> <p>Since that day of panic, the FA appear not to have asked Wenger directly again if he would be interested in taking the job, probably as a result of his initial response. The subsequent recruitment of Eriksson, whom the FA have been at pains to point out resembles Wenger in calm, dignified bearing and enlightened outlook, smacks of right decision, wrong man. </p> <p>'Let me just clear this once and for all,' said David Dein, vice-chairman at both Arsenal and the FA, at the end of two hours of talking to the media on the day Eriksson was paraded. 'Ars\u00e8ne has made it very clear that he believes his future is with Arsenal Football Club. Once we knew that Sir Alex Ferguson, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and G\u00e9rard Houllier were going to be unavailable, it was a question then of compiling the shortlist.' </p> <p>'This was all about the art of the possible,' Dein also said. 'There was no point wasting our energies on somebody we couldn't get.' It was clear from Dein's very presence at Eriksson's press conference that he had been a prime mover in the recruitment. He had, he said, known the Swede for nine years. </p> <p>Crozier, who made it clear that Dein left discussions of the seven-man selection panel when his own manager's name cropped up, said that he believed there was 'no need to' talk to Wenger, given the Frenchman's public pronouncements. At the very least, it might have been interesting for the FA to have heard from a studious, expert figure his views on the English game after four years of success in it. </p> <p>The chief executive's position is at odds with his recent statement that all the top managers would be consulted, at odds also with the FA's repeated stance that what managers say in public is not always what they say in private when approached about the job. 'I don't know why,' Wenger himself said last week, after confirming that the FA had not contacted him directly. It should also be pointed out that, at the time the FA were courting Eriksson, Wenger and Dein were discussing a new club contract for the Arsenal coach. </p> <p>Ah, the inner workings, machinations and politics of the FA. Dein and Crozier may well be right. The best-looking girl in the class may well have declined to dance. But now we are left, like shy, regretful schoolboys, wondering for five years if just maybe.... As Eriksson said: 'When you get the opportunity, you can't say no.' </p> <p>As with all matters relating to English football, it seems, it was a fishy business. The FA's selectorial seven decided on Eriksson at a meeting on Thursday 19 October, only their second, with Terry Venables having been ruled out for his lack of 'sustained success'. On the following morning, Eriksson - or Svenners, as he could become known - was backed down from around 25-1 to 6-4 favourite before certain bookmakers suspended betting in the afternoon. Wenger himself admits to having backed the Swede. How could that have happened? For once, Crozier had no answer. </p> <p>A say-one-thing, do-another culture at the FA was seen one Friday morning a few weeks ago when Crozier said that they would talk to only two or three senior players about Keegan's successor. Later that day he volunteered to a tabloid newspaper the story that at least a dozen had been contacted. </p> <p>Still, consulting the players appears to have been a fruitful exercise. For what emerged was a picture of Keegan's squad at Euro 2000 riven by cliques off the field, with several senior figures concerned about the effects of some serious gambling by certain players, the disaffection and disharmony off the pitch mirrored in some drained, disjointed and ill-planned performances on it. Of course, when it was written at the time, the FA denied it. </p> <p>More important, the players felt almost to a man that while they received the best coaching at their clubs, it was not always true at England level. Indeed, there has been a tradition for too long of the manager bringing in cronies from his club past, rather than the best available. </p> <p>It was significant that Erikkson stressed as his first task the need 'to create a good group, a good ambient in the side. If you don't have that feeling in your group you will never do good results. I never thought about 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 as the most important. Attitude is the most important'. He then spoke of attacking and defending as a group. 'That is rather easy.' Not for Keegan's England, it wasn't. </p> <p>Part of the deal with Eriksson was that he would be allowed one man (like a condemned man with a meal, you almost stop yourself saying) and his trusted lieutenant, Tord Grip, will at first scout the English game for him. Eriksson is expected, though, to work with and develop a new generation of English coaches, among them Peter Taylor, Steve McClaren, Alan Curbishley and Brian Kidd. The likes of David Platt, Alan Shearer and Tony Adams may also be involved if and when they obtain Uefa coaching licences, the value of which the FA have belatedly come to recognise. </p> <p>The aim is to prevent the English game falling again into the mess that has seen them finally - admirably - admit that they need help to regain ground ceded over the past two years. 'He'll have to understand the mentality of the English,' someone said on a phone-in last week. Actually, we islanders need to understand more the mentality of those who have taken the game to new levels. </p> <p>It wouldn't happen in other major footballing nations, say some. Other? Results and world rankings are evidence that England are not one of them. How symbolic that latterly a nation's crumbling infrastructure, as payment for past neglect, has been reflected in its football team. </p> <p>The game having moved on, it is not possible to develop coaches in-house the way the Germans did in the Seventies and Eighties, followed by the French in the Nineties, since club management these days is such an attractively lucrative alternative. The FA believe that bringing in the new breed for international weeks will not unduly interfere with their club commitments and also enable them to accumulate daily experience over the next five years; taking the best of the French system and adapting it to a nation of strong club football, as Aim\u00e9 Jacquet advocated in these pages recently.</p> <p>'There can't be a weak link,' says Crozier. 'Because the demands on the head coach are huge, those people who take the training sessions and work with players on an individual basis are very important.

Condon said he would bring forward recommendations for action to ensure that 'what happens on the cricket square [is] to do with skill, heroism, courage and weather conditions and not the outcome of a mobile phone call or a grubby meeting at a hotel where people have decided in advance what's going to happen'. Investigators from Condon's unit held talks in Delhi yesterday with officials from the CBI. They took possession of evidence from CBI joint director RN Savani but refused to answer questions. An attempt yesterday by Ajay Jajeda, one of the five Indian players named in the CBI report, to clear his name descended into chaos when Hindu nationalist demonstrators burst into his Delhi press conference and tried to pelt him with eggs. After they were ushered away, Jajeda emerged to claim he had 'never accepted money' to underperform in a match. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

This applause is not reserved solely for the Pakistani team, but for good cricket, even if that is a one-bounce four by Graham Hick or a diving stop by Nasser Hussain. However, the biggest cheers are definitely saved for Pakistani wickets sixes. Complete pandemonium breaks out as everyone jumps up, runs around with their flags and starts to dance. This dance is difficult to describe, but it involves hopping on one leg whilst turning around and flapping you arms like a chicken.

For so long the cricketing authorities seemed determined to ignore the problem. Remember that the first serious allegations, made by Mark Waugh and Shane Warne against Salim Malik in February 1995, only became public knowledge after leaks to the Sydney Morning Herald. The Australian Cricket Board would have preferred to keep the story under wraps in the hope that the problem would somehow magically evaporate. So would all the others. </p> <p>It didn't and - oh so - slowly there have been attempts to ensure that the game's integrity is restored but these are so easily fractured by national allegiances. Take this week for example. In the wake of the allegations against Alec Stewart, the ECB's Chairman, Lord MacLaurin has had to backtrack - or in his eyes 'clarify' his position - about what to do with players under suspicion. Meanwhile, his opposite number in Pakistan, General Tauqir Zia, could not resist an open goal. 'They [the ECB] did not realise that if they throw stones at any country, the same thing may come back on them,' he said. Somehow the head of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit, Sir Paul Condon - the possessor of 'safe hands' according to Stewart - must seek to cut through national barriers in pursuit of the truth. </p> <p>Stewart, by his own admission, has just endured the most harrowing few days of his career. In England he has been the focal point of discussion about the CBI's report though the allegations against him, which occupy no more than a couple of paragraphs, are piffling compared to with those against Mohammed Azharuddin, Brian Lara or Aravinda de Silva. </p> <p>If it wasn't for the case of Hansie Cronje we would all be swatting away the allegations of the Indian bookmaker, Mukesh Gupta, about his dealings with Stewart as if they were no more an irritant than a persistent fly. Cronje, we thought, was the last person who might become embroiled with dubious bookmakers. We now think the same about Stewart but unfortunately for him in the wake of the revelations about Cronje, we never say 'never' again. </p> <p>Stewart's denial that he has ever received money for information has been emphatic. But even if the allegations of Gupta were true, it would not have represented the end of the world for Stewart. In his testimony Gupta said that Stewart refused to fix matches. Moreover, back in 1993 when Stewart was touring India as England's vice-captain, we were unaware of the bookmaker's ploy of offering 'sweeteners' for banal information before entrapping cricketers to manipulate games. In those innocent days how many players would have scorned the chance of such easy and apparently harmless money? From WG Grace onwards cricketers have sought to maximise their earning potential and Stewart is no exception to this rule. </p> <p>If Stewart had acknowledged the allegations to be true his only problem would have been explaining why he hadn't mentioned this to the authorities in the past 12 months, when the issue of match-fixing has finally come to the fore. Now he only has a problem if his denial is false. That would constitute a far greater offence than taking the money in the first place. For the moment we must assume that Stewart is telling the truth even if this leaves us bewildered why Gupta, whose association with most of the other players named in the CBI report is not in question, should name Stewart in the first place. </p> <p>However uncomfortable Stewart has been feeling over the past few days, his situation is infinitely preferable to that of de Silva, Lara and Azharuddin. Gupta, upon whom the findings of the CBI report depend so heavily, alleged that de Silva and Lara both took money to underperform, a charge on a completely different scale to passing on infor mation. De Silva, who is one of the most popular cricketers in the world (they adored him when he played for Kent) and Lara, who isn't, both refute these allegations. </p> <p>Azharuddin, however, seems to be sunk. He, alongside four other Indian cricketers (Jadeja, Mongia, Sharma and Prabhakar), has already been banned from playing by the Indian Board. In the report Azharuddin admits to fixing at least two one-day matches and a life ban must be on the cards. His plight encapsulates the sickness of modern cricket. </p> <p>Back in 1984 when England were touring I witnessed his entry into first-class cricket. He was impossibly shy but clearly a minor genius, who scored three centuries in his first three Tests during which he would whip the ball to the legside boundary with magical wrists and as if embarrassed by his precocious talent, would stare down at his feet until the next ball arrived. Along with de Silva he was the most enchanting, if not the most productive batsman, of the past decade or more. All of which now counts for nothing. He has played more one day internationals - 334 - than any other cricketer, a statistic, I suggest, that is not unconnected with his fall from grace. A</p> <p>zharuddin must bear the responsibility for his actions but he was unfortunate to play in an era when the one-day international match was so devalued. Too often in the crazy international calendar of the Nineties no one, not even the players, really cared who won or lost, but rather how much they could make out of the game. </p>",

Stewart's denial that he has ever received money for information has been emphatic. But even if the allegations of Gupta were true, it would not have represented the end of the world for Stewart. In his testimony Gupta said that Stewart refused to fix matches. Moreover, back in 1993 when Stewart was touring India as England's vice-captain, we were unaware of the bookmaker's ploy of offering 'sweeteners' for banal information before entrapping cricketers to manipulate games. In those innocent days how many players would have scorned the chance of such easy and apparently harmless money? From WG Grace onwards cricketers have sought to maximise their earning potential and Stewart is no exception to this rule. If Stewart had acknowledged the allegations to be true his only problem would have been explaining why he hadn't mentioned this to the authorities in the past 12 months, when the issue of match-fixing has finally come to the fore. Now he only has a problem if his denial is false. That would constitute a far greater offence than taking the money in the first place. For the moment we must assume that Stewart is telling the truth even if this leaves us bewildered why Gupta, whose association with most of the other players named in the CBI report is not in question, should name Stewart in the first place. However uncomfortable Stewart has been feeling over the past few days, his situation is infinitely preferable to that of de Silva, Lara and Azharuddin. Gupta, upon whom the findings of the CBI report depend so heavily, alleged that de Silva and Lara both took money to underperform, a charge on a completely different scale to passing on infor mation. De Silva, who is one of the most popular cricketers in the world (they adored him when he played for Kent) and Lara, who isn't, both refute these allegations. Azharuddin, however, seems to be sunk. He, alongside four other Indian cricketers (Jadeja, Mongia, Sharma and Prabhakar), has already been banned from playing by the Indian Board. In the report Azharuddin admits to fixing at least two one-day matches and a life ban must be on the cards. His plight encapsulates the sickness of modern cricket. Back in 1984 when England were touring I witnessed his entry into first-class cricket. He was impossibly shy but clearly a minor genius, who scored three centuries in his first three Tests during which he would whip the ball to the legside boundary with magical wrists and as if embarrassed by his precocious talent, would stare down at his feet until the next ball arrived. Along with de Silva he was the most enchanting, if not the most productive batsman, of the past decade or more. All of which now counts for nothing. He has played more one day internationals - 334 - than any other cricketer, a statistic, I suggest, that is not unconnected with his fall from grace. A zharuddin must bear the responsibility for his actions but he was unfortunate to play in an era when the one-day international match was so devalued. Too often in the crazy international calendar of the Nineties no one, not even the players, really cared who won or lost, but rather how much they could make out of the game.",

      "byline": "Simon Kuper",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This may be an apocryphal story, but it goes as follows: After Andreas Niniadis scored for Olympiakos Piraeus last weekend, he picked up a mobile phone hurled at him by a helpful opposing fan and dialled the number of Diego Maradona in Cuba. </p> <p>'Hello,' said Maradona. </p> <p>'Diego, is that you?' asked Niniadis. </p> <p>'Who is this?' asked Maradona. </p> <p>'Come on, Diego, it's me,' said Niniadis. 'Andreas from Greece. Niniadis from Olympiakos. Don't you remember me?' After more embarrassing explanations along these lines, Niniadis wished Maradona a happy fortieth birthday. Maradona, who may have forgotten that it was his birthday, said, 'You made a mistake,' and hung up. </p> <p>This call probably never happened, because it is difficult to imagine a Greek footballer speaking a word of a foreign language. Even so, the conversation sums up the tragicomedy that is Greek football, because the man Maradona had never heard of is a hero in Greece. </p> <p>The Greek game hopes to improve its image somewhat this Wednesday, when Panathinaikos receive Juventus in the Champions League. The Greeks will be through to the second round if they win, so the match is being hailed as the biggest encounter in the region since the Trojan War, or perhaps bigger. Olympiakos Piraeus will join Panathinaikos in the last 16 if they draw at Olympique Lyon on Tuesday. </p> <p>This would delight Greek football fans, who are refreshingly unspoiled. No Greek side have ever won a European trophy, and when the national team finally qualified for a World Cup in 1994 they ended up wishing they hadn't bothered. I remember watching their practices near Boston: an outfield player would stand in goal while others blasted shots over the bar. In matches they were thrashed. Athenian bars were packed with people making obscene gestures at television sets. </p> <p>It is remarkable that a reasonably prosperous European country of more than 10 million people has achieved so little in football that basketball is in danger of becoming the national sport. The best a Greek team ever managed was Panathinaikos's appearance in the European Cup final at Wembley in 1971, when they lost 2-0 to Ajax. However, in his book Champions of Europe Brian Glanville says the club 'were outrageously favoured by the French referee of their return home leg against Everton in the quarter-finals'. Joe Royle, then an Everton player, recalled how in the first match at Goodison Greek defenders would whisper in his ear, 'Athens, Athens!' </p> <p>'And in Athens', records Glanville, 'Everton got nothing from the referee.' </p> <p>Generally, there are so many bribery scandals in Greek football that they hardly qualify as scandals. The big clubs are traditionally owned by very rich men who use football as a way to snuggle up to government. The Olympiakos president and telecoms magnate Socrates Kokalis is a friend of the governing Pasok party, while the upper echelons of Panathinaikos, once pally with the ruling military junta, are now closer to the New Democracy party. Government contracts are worth a lot in Greece. </p> <p>One foreign manager recalls frequent summonses to meet his president behind suburban Athenian train stations late at night, where he would be told which players to put in his team. Presidents also delight in suddenly buying players, and if the coach doesn't like them, well, he's never around for long anyway. </p> <p>You might think all this would prompt the best Greek players to move abroad.

      "bodyText": "This may be an apocryphal story, but it goes as follows: After Andreas Niniadis scored for Olympiakos Piraeus last weekend, he picked up a mobile phone hurled at him by a helpful opposing fan and dialled the number of Diego Maradona in Cuba. 'Hello,' said Maradona. 'Diego, is that you?' asked Niniadis. 'Who is this?' asked Maradona. 'Come on, Diego, it's me,' said Niniadis. 'Andreas from Greece. Niniadis from Olympiakos. Don't you remember me?' After more embarrassing explanations along these lines, Niniadis wished Maradona a happy fortieth birthday. Maradona, who may have forgotten that it was his birthday, said, 'You made a mistake,' and hung up. This call probably never happened, because it is difficult to imagine a Greek footballer speaking a word of a foreign language. Even so, the conversation sums up the tragicomedy that is Greek football, because the man Maradona had never heard of is a hero in Greece. The Greek game hopes to improve its image somewhat this Wednesday, when Panathinaikos receive Juventus in the Champions League. The Greeks will be through to the second round if they win, so the match is being hailed as the biggest encounter in the region since the Trojan War, or perhaps bigger. Olympiakos Piraeus will join Panathinaikos in the last 16 if they draw at Olympique Lyon on Tuesday. This would delight Greek football fans, who are refreshingly unspoiled. No Greek side have ever won a European trophy, and when the national team finally qualified for a World Cup in 1994 they ended up wishing they hadn't bothered. I remember watching their practices near Boston: an outfield player would stand in goal while others blasted shots over the bar. In matches they were thrashed. Athenian bars were packed with people making obscene gestures at television sets. It is remarkable that a reasonably prosperous European country of more than 10 million people has achieved so little in football that basketball is in danger of becoming the national sport. The best a Greek team ever managed was Panathinaikos's appearance in the European Cup final at Wembley in 1971, when they lost 2-0 to Ajax. However, in his book Champions of Europe Brian Glanville says the club 'were outrageously favoured by the French referee of their return home leg against Everton in the quarter-finals'. Joe Royle, then an Everton player, recalled how in the first match at Goodison Greek defenders would whisper in his ear, 'Athens, Athens!' 'And in Athens', records Glanville, 'Everton got nothing from the referee.' Generally, there are so many bribery scandals in Greek football that they hardly qualify as scandals. The big clubs are traditionally owned by very rich men who use football as a way to snuggle up to government. The Olympiakos president and telecoms magnate Socrates Kokalis is a friend of the governing Pasok party, while the upper echelons of Panathinaikos, once pally with the ruling military junta, are now closer to the New Democracy party. Government contracts are worth a lot in Greece. One foreign manager recalls frequent summonses to meet his president behind suburban Athenian train stations late at night, where he would be told which players to put in his team. Presidents also delight in suddenly buying players, and if the coach doesn't like them, well, he's never around for long anyway. You might think all this would prompt the best Greek players to move abroad. It seldom does, and even when they do leave they usually come home fast. Grigoris Georgatos, the Olympiakos defender, joined Inter Milan a year ago, played rather well, but returned to Greece after one season desperately homesick despite having spent most of his free time in Athens. A rare Greek to have prospered abroad, the Ajax striker Nikos Machlas, admitted to having spent his first months in Holland crossing the days off a calendar.

'It's not been a bad day for me,' he smiled afterwards - and Robson was not just talking about his team's first Premiership victory at home since the end of August. </p> <p>He had also seen ample evidence that Ipswich, the other love of his football life after his 14 years at Portman Road, are again in safe hands under George Burley. Burley, an assured full-back during that successful era in East Anglia, might even have emerged with a draw in this encounter with the man who once controlled his playing career. </p> <p>But a controversial penalty won by Alan Shearer eventually ended Town's attempt to extend their unbeaten run to seven games - and Burley couldn't even win the verbal exchange which inevitably followed.

      "bodyText": "Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson enjoyed this one. 'It's not been a bad day for me,' he smiled afterwards - and Robson was not just talking about his team's first Premiership victory at home since the end of August. He had also seen ample evidence that Ipswich, the other love of his football life after his 14 years at Portman Road, are again in safe hands under George Burley. Burley, an assured full-back during that successful era in East Anglia, might even have emerged with a draw in this encounter with the man who once controlled his playing career. But a controversial penalty won by Alan Shearer eventually ended Town's attempt to extend their unbeaten run to seven games - and Burley couldn't even win the verbal exchange which inevitably followed. Ipswich were upset at referee Alan Wily's decision to award the 67th-minute penalty after Shearer's surge into the area was halted by Mark Venus's challenge. 'The ref was 50 or 60 yards away, the crowd shouts, Alan Shearer falls and he gives a penalty,' said Burley.

There was no dissatisfaction from the terraces at the end, only admiration for a plucky scrap against overwhelming odds. 'With 11 men the crowd was against Middlesbrough,' Wenger said. 'With 10 men the crowd got behind them, and we were a little too cautious.' </p> <p>Boro were one of the first Premiership teams to look overseas for inspiration, and the \u00a378m Bryan Robson has spent in the last six years has been spread around several continents. The amazing thing is how essentially English Boro remain. They played with a grit and determination which was commendable but nowhere near good enough. </p> <p>Not against Arsenal, whose pace and stealth in attack gives them an almost unfair advantage against yeoman defending. Boro hit them with everything in the opening minutes, and were unlucky to see Lee Dixon clear Gary Pallister's header off the line and Phil Stamp twice go close, but Arsenal shrugged it off. </p> <p>The goal was ostensibly a result of sloppy Boro defending, with Pallister unwisely passing across the face of his goal to Steve Vickers who was not expecting the ball, but in fact was down to Arsenal's sharpness when not in possession. Pallister could not play the obvious pass back to his goalkeeper because he was aware Thierry Henry was lurking for the intercept, and the reason Vickers took his eye off the ball at the crucial moment was that Freddie Ljungberg had anticipated the pass and was already arriving. The Arsenal man won out and advanced into the penalty area to be brought down by Crossley, who could have few complaints at the red card which followed. Robson sacrificed Hamilton Ricard to bring on substitute goalkeeper Marlon Beresford, who had no chance with Henry's penalty but made two excellent saves before the interval. </p> <p>Arsenal's tendency to over-elaborate helped keep the score down, but Ljungberg should have scored after Boro were caught in possession again, before an outrageously casual backheel in his own half by Noel Whelan saw Henry miss the target when scoring looked easier. </p> <p>The Frenchman missed by a greater distance when set up by Dennis Bergkamp five minutes later, then saw Beres- ford save bravely after he had gone past the Boro defence for the umpteenth time. Parlour almost hit the corner flag from one of Henry's pull-backs from the byline and Henry struck a post at the end, so it was cheeky of Robson to suggest his side had been unlucky. </p> <p>But at least the Boro manager was able to confirm there is no need for Terry Venables. 'I know I've got 100 per cent backing from everyone at the club, and on today's evidence that includes the players,' he said. 'United won't be easy, but we are hoping to kickstart our season with the home games against Leicester and Bradford, when we should have all our players back.'</p>",

Not against Arsenal, whose pace and stealth in attack gives them an almost unfair advantage against yeoman defending. Boro hit them with everything in the opening minutes, and were unlucky to see Lee Dixon clear Gary Pallister's header off the line and Phil Stamp twice go close, but Arsenal shrugged it off. The goal was ostensibly a result of sloppy Boro defending, with Pallister unwisely passing across the face of his goal to Steve Vickers who was not expecting the ball, but in fact was down to Arsenal's sharpness when not in possession. Pallister could not play the obvious pass back to his goalkeeper because he was aware Thierry Henry was lurking for the intercept, and the reason Vickers took his eye off the ball at the crucial moment was that Freddie Ljungberg had anticipated the pass and was already arriving. The Arsenal man won out and advanced into the penalty area to be brought down by Crossley, who could have few complaints at the red card which followed. Robson sacrificed Hamilton Ricard to bring on substitute goalkeeper Marlon Beresford, who had no chance with Henry's penalty but made two excellent saves before the interval. Arsenal's tendency to over-elaborate helped keep the score down, but Ljungberg should have scored after Boro were caught in possession again, before an outrageously casual backheel in his own half by Noel Whelan saw Henry miss the target when scoring looked easier. The Frenchman missed by a greater distance when set up by Dennis Bergkamp five minutes later, then saw Beres- ford save bravely after he had gone past the Boro defence for the umpteenth time. Parlour almost hit the corner flag from one of Henry's pull-backs from the byline and Henry struck a post at the end, so it was cheeky of Robson to suggest his side had been unlucky. But at least the Boro manager was able to confirm there is no need for Terry Venables. 'I know I've got 100 per cent backing from everyone at the club, and on today's evidence that includes the players,' he said. 'United won't be easy, but we are hoping to kickstart our season with the home games against Leicester and Bradford, when we should have all our players back.'",

His sickening behaviour has brought shame upon England's great game. </p> <p> That's what the Daily Mail didn't say last week when Sven-Goran Eriksson landed the England job and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger collected on a bet. The Arsenal manager admitted he was among those who stung the bookies by backing the Swede (whose odds coincidentally tumbled two days after David Dein returned from Rome a couple of weeks ago) in last weekend's Mail exclusive, 'Bombshell: Sven stays put' - revealing how Eriksson was out of the running for the England job. We'll gloss over that, but we're still waiting for the back end of the paper to react to this scandal in the fine traditions of the front. After all, only two days earlier the Mail went big with the whole of page one, more inside, and a scathing editorial comment on 'The Labour scam' - a handful of MPs making a profit by backing Michael Martin to become the new Speaker of the House. As Wenger also had 'inside information' - he turned down the FA's approach and recommended Eriksson - Said and Done demands the Mail launch an immediate campaign to keep us all entertained. </p> <p><strong>Razor: big dinner money</strong> </p> <p>Best contract clause of the season so far belongs to Crystal Palace and Neil Ruddock. Ruddock revealed the sanction in his otherwise generous deal to friends last week, admitting he was forced into it by brash new Palace chairman and Ken Bates wannabe Simon Jordan. The deal came about when the pair first met to talk terms in the summer - Jordan, apparently overwhelmed by the defender's size, refused to continue unless Ruddock and his representatives agreed to a unique 'get any fatter and you're fined' clause in the paperwork. As a result, if Ruddock's weight exceeds 17 stone - he's weighed at the training ground every Monday morning - he's fined a 'significant' sum. According to Selhurst insiders, the big man should be broke by Christmas. </p> <p><strong>Becks ab fab day out</strong> </p> <p>David Beckham's latest photoshoot, a semi-nude 'rent boy chic' spread for Homme magazine, is backed up by some ringing endorsements from the world's top fashion designers. 'What is so appealing about David Beckham,' reckons Giorgio Armani, 'is that he possesses that rare combination of a strong charismatic personality with an underlying sensitivity and vulnerability. Add to this his innate sense of style and you can understand his magnetism.' 'Has there been a fashion plate like this since Beau Brummel?' asks Tom Ford - 'He's a total modern dandy.' 'What a clothes borse! What a footballer!' says Paul Smith. Homme - pleased with the spread - concludes that Beckham brings to male fashion 'the kick of a catwalk queen' - sure to go down well in the Old Trafford dug-out. </p> <p><strong> WSC: win the book with balls</strong> </p> <p>When Saturday Comes have launched their latest book: the second volume of Always Next Year contains 17 WSC stories from 1999/2000, covering all four English divisions, the Scottish Premier League, several other European countries and a diner in South Carolina frequented by British taxi drivers.

      "bodyText": "Mail goes back to front Wenger must go: Arsenal have no option but to sack him - and if they don't, the FA must take action. His sickening behaviour has brought shame upon England's great game. That's what the Daily Mail didn't say last week when Sven-Goran Eriksson landed the England job and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger collected on a bet. The Arsenal manager admitted he was among those who stung the bookies by backing the Swede (whose odds coincidentally tumbled two days after David Dein returned from Rome a couple of weeks ago) in last weekend's Mail exclusive, 'Bombshell: Sven stays put' - revealing how Eriksson was out of the running for the England job. We'll gloss over that, but we're still waiting for the back end of the paper to react to this scandal in the fine traditions of the front. After all, only two days earlier the Mail went big with the whole of page one, more inside, and a scathing editorial comment on 'The Labour scam' - a handful of MPs making a profit by backing Michael Martin to become the new Speaker of the House. As Wenger also had 'inside information' - he turned down the FA's approach and recommended Eriksson - Said and Done demands the Mail launch an immediate campaign to keep us all entertained. Razor: big dinner money Best contract clause of the season so far belongs to Crystal Palace and Neil Ruddock. Ruddock revealed the sanction in his otherwise generous deal to friends last week, admitting he was forced into it by brash new Palace chairman and Ken Bates wannabe Simon Jordan. The deal came about when the pair first met to talk terms in the summer - Jordan, apparently overwhelmed by the defender's size, refused to continue unless Ruddock and his representatives agreed to a unique 'get any fatter and you're fined' clause in the paperwork. As a result, if Ruddock's weight exceeds 17 stone - he's weighed at the training ground every Monday morning - he's fined a 'significant' sum. According to Selhurst insiders, the big man should be broke by Christmas. Becks ab fab day out David Beckham's latest photoshoot, a semi-nude 'rent boy chic' spread for Homme magazine, is backed up by some ringing endorsements from the world's top fashion designers. 'What is so appealing about David Beckham,' reckons Giorgio Armani, 'is that he possesses that rare combination of a strong charismatic personality with an underlying sensitivity and vulnerability. Add to this his innate sense of style and you can understand his magnetism.' 'Has there been a fashion plate like this since Beau Brummel?' asks Tom Ford - 'He's a total modern dandy.' 'What a clothes borse! What a footballer!' says Paul Smith. Homme - pleased with the spread - concludes that Beckham brings to male fashion 'the kick of a catwalk queen' - sure to go down well in the Old Trafford dug-out.

      "body": "<p>There was once a football manager who asked a player he was intending to sign what his problem was: 'Is it booze, drugs or women, son? Because I'll find out sooner or later.' </p> <p>What was interesting about the question - quite apart from the generalised assumption that every professional footballer has some off-the-field Achilles heel that will undermine his aptitude and attitude on the field - is that the question of gambling did not come up. It went without saying, simply wasn't an issue. The old image of the English manager is that he has always liked a bet himself, and didn't mind if his players did. </p> <p>That much was seen last week when it emerged that some England players were involved in card schools for hands of \u00a310,000 during Euro 2000. That is a conservative figure. It disturbed several senior players, who were concerned about the effect on the morale and condition of their team-mates. </p> <p>Kevin Keegan himself made no secret of his fondness for horse racing and the Racing Channel was also piped into the team's hotel in Belgium. Video race nights also took place, with Alan Shearer as the bookie, though these were less of a worry and seen more as a harmless outlet for recreation among people who naturally have a competitive streak. They ceased before the friendly in France in September, with Shearer now retired. </p> <p>We are talking now of oaks and small acorns but there are fears from some in the English game that gambling is an emerging problem for players with time on their hands and more money than ever in their pockets. It could indeed, after drink and drugs, be the next big issue football has to confront. </p> <p>Alcohol was probably regarded, too, as a harmless recreational outlet in English football a decade ago. Now with the influx of overseas players and coaches, with their cultural and professional differences, and the scientific evidence of how the effects of drinking contribute to injuries and sluggish performance, there is a new mood. The top professionals have come to see how moderation, even abstinence, can increase the chances of success and longevity of career, with its attractive consequence of increased earning capacity. </p> <p>As for mood-altering drugs, the rash of bans among young players of a few years ago seems to have slowed, due partly to more testing - though still haphazard in the English game - and partly to increased awareness of the career damage it will do. Gambling, though? How can that recreational pursuit be equated with drink or drugs as a threat to a club's prospects and the career of a player? </p> <p>There are other reasons for fewer headlines on the drink and drugs front. Many players are now concerned that they will find themselves splashed across the papers as the result of some bender or brush with drugs, often grassed up by some media-conscious punter in pub or nightclub. More keep themselves to themselves, sad as that may be both for them and a largely respectful public who revere their heroes, the distancing caused by a sinister, threatening minority. </p> <p>With more money than ever finding its way into players' pockets, though, there is some evidence that those with a penchant for seeking a thrill may instead be turning more to betting, notably on sizeable card schools as well as football itself. In these days of phone and internet accounts, the latter is simple and private, after all. In fact, it could well be that if the warning signs are not heeded, gambling will become the new drinking. </p> <p>'It may not yet be something you have to worry about but something you have to keep an eye on,' says the Liverpool manager, G\u00e9rard Houllier. 'The top players have time and they have money. What else are they going to spend it on? They have cars and they have clothes. They are not going to have two steaks on their plate.' It is the point about time and money that so strikes the modern chord. </p> <p>'Yes, I do see more players betting these days and with bigger sums of money involved,' says the Aston Villa and England player Paul Merson, a self-confessed gambling addict who has not now had a bet for more than 18 months, his last spree costing him \u00a335,000 in a month. 'Betting on football is popular, other teams than your own that is, because there is football on every night of the week now. Cards is also a favourite.' </p> <p>Betting is nothing new among footballers. Horse racing has always been seen as a harmless leisure-time occupation for players, who accept with resignation like the rest of the population that a horse can take several thousand people for a ride at the same time, and that for every pay-out window in a betting shop there are three marked 'Bet here'. </p> <p>The World Health Organisation declared gambling an addiction, to rank alongside alcoholism, in 1986, but only a few such as Peter Shilton and Stan Bowles have been known to get themselves into real trouble. 'If Stan could pass a betting shop like he can pass a ball, then he'd have no worries at all,' said his manager at Crewe Alexandra, Ernie Tagg. The tradition also of owning horses, made famous in the Seventies by stars such as Keegan, Mick Channon and Alan Ball, is being carried on by Sir Alex Ferguson, David Platt and Michael Owen. </p> <p>The potential for excess, though, is growing - as shown by Keith Gillespie when losing tens of thousands while at Newcastle United a few years ago - with ever-increasing sums going on football, both through fixed odds and on spread betting. A decade ago, football accounted for only a couple of per cent of the total sum gambled in this country; now it has more than doubled at five per cent, even if it is still way behind the 70 per cent on horse racing and even 10 to 15 per cent on greyhounds. </p> <p>Money changing hands at Premiership card schools has also increased. One Premiership player told me that 'pots' on his club's coach can reach \u00a37,000. 'It always starts off normal then gets out of hand,' he said. </p> <p>Professionals betting on games is a grey area. FA rules say players are allowed to do the football pools but if they are found to be betting on a football match, they have to prove to the FA that they were not 'insider-dealing' and had no potential knowledge of the outcome or were unable to influence it. Steve Claridge, well known in the game as a gambler, says that when he was fined \u00a3900 by the FA earlier this year for backing his own team, Portsmouth, to win a match, the tribunal had to check the rules themselves then told him he could bet on matches outside his division. </p> <p>Indeed, the FA's attitude to gambling seems remarkably lax. Graham Sharpe, media relations director of William Hill, is also a director of Wealdstone FC; as a bookmaker he should be disqualified from the post. 'I rang the FA and told them but they said they were aware and had no problem with it,' he says. </p> <p>In horse racing, moves are afoot by governing bodies to disqualify anyone within the industry from gambling, jockeys already being banned, and there are suggestions that it could also soon apply to football. 'I don't object to that,' says Claridge, 'but then football isn't corrupt. It would have come out long before now.' Indeed, it should be said that the Bruce Grobbelaar affair a few years ago resulted in the former Liverpool goalkeeper being found not guilty. </p> <p>Sometimes it is the markets that prevent corruption. There was a story within football a year or two ago that one team deliberately kicked the ball into touch from the kick-off so that they could cash in on a bet on the time of the first throw-in. Losing bookmakers have since stopped offering that particular gamble. </p> <p>'In practical terms, you can't stop a jockey from betting and to pretend you can is sheer folly,' says Sharpe. 'He has friends, there are phones and computers. The same will be true of trainers in racing so how are you going to enforce it in football? </p> <p>'It's OK to say thou shall not bet on the opposition, and everyone would agree that's wrong, but what's wrong with betting on yourself? They can hand down decrees all they like but you can't stop players betting. How come it's all right for players to bet on the pools? You only need three bent teams to rig the pools, with three aways. And I can tell you, we get any number of football clubs phoning us up wanting to bet on their team for promotion, so they can cover the cost of the bonuses. What's the difference between that and insurance?' </p> <p>Claridge says: 'More players do have a flutter these days, and more players are betting on football than before. I suppose the more money there is the more people are going to do it because there are more outlets. But for me, drink is still more of a problem in the game. I've come across more drinkers than gamblers, though at the top end of the scale these days I suppose it may be more of a problem. If you've got plenty of money, you are going to live life to the maximum.' </p> <p>A new fear among some managers is the amount of money changing hands in card schools. The appeal, says Merson, is that 'it is the ultimate bet. The out come is in your own hands'. Claridge says that card schools are almost hereditary at clubs. 'At Leicester there was a money card school but not for massive amounts, but there isn't at Portsmouth.' </p> <p>Merson points out an interesting side effect of the events at Euro 2000. 'It was funny,' he says. 'I watched a couple of the England games on television last summer and thought that some of the players looked more tired than I would have expected. Gambling is majorly draining, mentally if not physically, especially if you are losing money.' Adds Houllier significantly: 'The danger is seeing your players lose emotional energy before games.' </p> <p>It is also possible that losing a large sum of money to a team-mate could be bad for morale ahead of a game, though both Merson and Claridge, as honourable gamblers, do not believe it should be a problem: </p> <p>'Not if I'd lost it fair and square,' says Claridge. </p> <p>'No. It would have to be my fault and not his,' says Merson, who believes more in the theory that tiredness is the main enemy. </p> <p>Houllier does allow card schools on the Liverpool team bus but not for money. He also has 'race nights' now and then with no more than \u00a320 staked. He does not object to betting on horse racing in moderation. 'Players need the playing edge, they like something to be always at stake,' he says, arguing that being puritanical can be counterproductive. 'It is what we call the noble uncertainty of the game. They like that and you can't expect them not to. I am a player too. I can bet with \u00a320, that's my playing side.' And only last week Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admitted having backed Sven Goran Eriksson to be England coach. It was just a bit of fun - and he won. </p> <p>Neither Claridge nor Merson believes that gambling is yet a problem within the English game but both agree that with the media eyes on players, and with players getting richer, those who have an addictive personality and seek to indulge it through gambling will proba bly hit the skids sooner in their lives than previous generations. The secretive nature is also a concern. Merson points out that bookmakers are happy to take large sums off a player when he is losing, but publicity is likely to emerge when he starts to win big. </p> <p>'If you are earning a lot, you will probably go down quicker,' says Claridge. 'In a way, it's been good for me because it's kept me playing, kept me hungry. But money doesn't make you a gambler. If you've got an addictive personality, that's what makes you a gambler.' </p> <p>'It's not yet the same threat as drinking or drugs,' says Merson, for whom those substances were secondary addictions, 'but it's definitely one way players look for a thrill or a buzz. I mean, if I walk down the street drunk, everyone is going to know but if I've been doing my money on gambling, no one is really going to notice.' </p> <p>Claridge can see the argument that if the manager is a gambler some players may feel they have to be also if they are to stay in favour. Usually it is the insecure ones, which does not appear to apply to him, as a player at least. 'I reckon I disprove it. I fell out with Alan Ball big time at Portsmouth. It got so bad he wasn't even sharing tips he got for horses with me.' </p> <p>Sharpe would not be surprised if more players were betting these days. 'Although unless well-known footballers walk into a betting shop, it's impossible to say,' he adds. But he concedes that more may be turning to gambling rather than risk the social stigma of other so-called vices. 'It's a valid point throughout society. The majority of people bet responsibly and regard it as a bit of a buzz for those few minutes. They get part-ownership. It's not a life-changing amount usually, just the chance of vindication of their opinion. </p> <p>'I can't get too worried about footballers who overspend. After 27 years in this business at the sharp end of defending it, I've come to a very strong conclusion that it's all down to personal responsibility. It's hard to feel sorry for poor little rich kids who lose \u00a310,000 then go to Adidas or whoever for a bigger contract.' </p> <p>The key point is surely the effect on performance, of which Merson has first-hand experience, and which Houllier fears. 'Clubs in England at the top are definitely on the right path concerning rest and diet but you are always going to get the odd lack of character,' says the Liverpool manager. 'You have got to be careful not to have a side of a player too much involved in gambling.' </p> <p>Just add it to the latest trends and troubles that come with the money washing around in the English game. But at least there is hope, not least in the fact that the new England head coach Sven Goran Eriksson is likely to find it alien to his footballing culture and indulge it no longer. 'We had drinking and smoking as problems in France in the mid-Eighties, and with players gambling on horse racing in the early Nineties,' adds Houllier. 'But it has gone since the academies with their good habits and good attitudes.' </p> <p>So England to win the World Cup in 2006 perhaps? Houllier, a key figure, as technical director, for the 1998 world champions, adds a cautious note. 'I have to say, even in the early Nineties in France, gambling was not in the culture as much as it is in England.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was once a football manager who asked a player he was intending to sign what his problem was: 'Is it booze, drugs or women, son? Because I'll find out sooner or later.' What was interesting about the question - quite apart from the generalised assumption that every professional footballer has some off-the-field Achilles heel that will undermine his aptitude and attitude on the field - is that the question of gambling did not come up. It went without saying, simply wasn't an issue. The old image of the English manager is that he has always liked a bet himself, and didn't mind if his players did. That much was seen last week when it emerged that some England players were involved in card schools for hands of \u00a310,000 during Euro 2000. That is a conservative figure. It disturbed several senior players, who were concerned about the effect on the morale and condition of their team-mates. Kevin Keegan himself made no secret of his fondness for horse racing and the Racing Channel was also piped into the team's hotel in Belgium. Video race nights also took place, with Alan Shearer as the bookie, though these were less of a worry and seen more as a harmless outlet for recreation among people who naturally have a competitive streak. They ceased before the friendly in France in September, with Shearer now retired. We are talking now of oaks and small acorns but there are fears from some in the English game that gambling is an emerging problem for players with time on their hands and more money than ever in their pockets. It could indeed, after drink and drugs, be the next big issue football has to confront. Alcohol was probably regarded, too, as a harmless recreational outlet in English football a decade ago. Now with the influx of overseas players and coaches, with their cultural and professional differences, and the scientific evidence of how the effects of drinking contribute to injuries and sluggish performance, there is a new mood. The top professionals have come to see how moderation, even abstinence, can increase the chances of success and longevity of career, with its attractive consequence of increased earning capacity.

      "body": "<p>It's Saturday morning by the Bosphorus and the two most famous people in Norway are talking boats. Behind them a string of vessels that would grace a Bond movie chunter noisily on to one of the world's great waterways. The powerboating Class One circus has come to Istanbul. The Bosphorus - which is usually flat and calm - is probably the fastest track on the Class One circuit, and one of the Norwegians, Bjorn Rune Gjelsten, has particular reason to know it. 'Right here last year we flipped,' he recalls. 'We were pushing really hard to win that race, because we had to win to win the championship. We sat in second place, then came side by side with the leading boat and we ended up flipping in a turn. It was probably the fastest crash in Class One ever. About 145 mph.'</p> <p>So is he nervous to be back here for the first time since then? 'I think everybody should be a little bit nervous,' he says pensively. 'Racing on the real rough, were you're bouncing around, you're hit hard - it aches and it hurts - but it's not that dangerous. It looks dangerous only it's not. But racing here,' he looks out on to the water, 'that can be quite marginal.'</p> <p> Class One - with its mix of speed, money and glamour - is powerboating's equivalent to Formula One, and Gjelsten and Kjell Inge Rokke are among its leading acts. Not that their fame has much to do with water sports. Rokke and Gjelsten made their names as businessmen - Richard Bransons with less facial hair and considerably less negative undertow - and in Norway, where nobody is as famous as a fjord, they pass for royalty. In fact they are more famous than royalty, according to a recent poll.</p> <p> Of course, the very notion of fame in Norway is a bit of an oxymoron: like focusing on America's leading socialists or the best French fast bowlers. In the absence of film stars and pop singers, Rokke and Gjelsten are in the Oslo papers all the time. In Britain they are famous for another reason. Three years ago they purchased Wimbledon FC and have been characterised as 'the mysterious Norwegians' who bought into English football ever since. Later, Gjelsten will tell me that it is only since former owner Sam Hamamm left Wimbledon that he has felt part of the club. 'It feels like we haven't been with the club for a year yet, and how can you be emotionally involved with something for less than a year? I don't think you can. It takes time. But now we have been involved with losing, with being relegated, and that gives you something.' But as they gaze over the glistening water in Istanbul the last things on their minds are a return to the Premiership or John Hartson's fitness.</p> <p> Rokke, the younger and richer of the two, has just returned from a test drive and has dropped in on Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway team for a chat. He looks very much at home, which is hardly surprising not just because the two have known each other for more than 30 years, but because he sold Gjelsten the team a couple of years ago. It's that kind of friendship. </p> <p>With his driving suit tied around his midriff - revealing the Jolly Motors T-shirt of the team he now drives for (but doesn't own) - Rokke looks relaxed as he relives his morning's endeavours. I had been told that the two look alike, which is sort of true even though they don't. Gjeltsen is taller, thinner and, unlike Rokke, wears glasses. Yet their faces lack distinctive features - faces you find it difficult to recall as soon as you look away. Though neither is remotely in the Branson class, Gjelsten is far happier talking to the press than his friend, and comes over for a chat. He first got into powerboating through Kjell (pronounced 'Chell'), he says. Kjell was driving in the US when Gjelsten went over to watch him. 'I made all these comments to him,' Gjelsten recalls. 'He should do this and that. He turned to me and said, \"Bjorn why don't you do it yourself?\" So he did, but not for the reasons you might expect. 'It's not just a question of going out and buying a big boat with the biggest engines,' he says seriously. 'There is a lot of attention to detail. And focus, discipline, being systematic. That appealed to me.' This, it should be said, is exactly what he is famous for as a businessman. He smiles. 'Yeah, I think that maybe is one of my strong sides, and maybe a weak side too: being too focused on details. '</p> <p> Before long the two were racing against each other in Class One, which didn't surprise anyone who knew them. Their friendship can be dated very precisely. Fittingly it began at a competitive event, a cross-country meeting. Both won their respective classes, and afterwards Bjorn's father - a fanatically keen footballer - invited the younger boy to come and stay with them. In doing so he introduced young Rokke to what Gjeltsen himself describes as 'a family where we were always competing'. Bjorn was 10, Kjell eight.</p> <p> There was plenty to compete at but Bjorn seems to have had the upper hand. He excelled at Nordic skiing, going on to represent his country and win international titles. In business, however, Rokke has always held sway, ever since he went off to Seattle as a young man, returning with the reputation as the biggest white fish fisherman in the world - and a lot of money.</p> <p> When they are driving on the water, I ask, are they still competing as they did as kids? 'Oh absolutely, but in a positive way. I think it's good. It drives us.' And - now that he is 44 and Rokke 41- who is the better driver? Pause. 'I think we have different talents,' Gjelsten says diplomatically. 'Kjell was very good before. Then he stayed away a couple of years. He keeps saying that I was dumb to teach him the new tricks. Powerboating has changed a lot in the past two or three years. We've gone from speeds of around 140mph to 160mph. We are now right on the edge when we are racing, we drive slightly different to how we did three years ago.'</p> <p> The combination of Gjelsten's competitiveness and the increased speed of the boats led to the near-disaster last year on the Bosphorus. Gjelsten escaped, if that's the right word, with just a few broken ribs (his throttle man Steve Curtis, he remarks ruefully, only had a cut finger) but the crash left its mark. When Formula One drivers are involved in big crashes they almost invariably return to the fray. But for them it is different. They are professionals. Gjelsten is a very successful businessman for whom driving is - surely - just a hobby. He has a family and a career; why risk it?</p> <p> 'I think you do worry about it sometimes, but your instinct to compete is there,' Gjelsten says. 'For me that's always been the case. For me actually it's more than an advanced hobby. I practise every day. I do my one-hour jog, I go to the gym. I stay fairly fit. Yeah, you can race without being as fit as I am, but you won't win.'</p> <p>Eight minutes. That was the time that Ken Thorne was under water in Oslo earlier this year. He was pushing his boat to the limit - and then she went over. 'I thought I wasn't going to get out of that one,' he says jovially, as if recalling the time he ran out of petrol. 'Eight minutes under water and you think you're a gonner. One hundred and forty to a complete stop in a second.' His memories of the crash remain vivid.

I'd lost my bearings and didn't know what the hell was going on.'</p> <p> What went on was a high-speed rescue which saw Ken and his throttle man taken ashore, shaken but not badly injured, while his boat, World Of Cars, sank to the bottom of the Oslofjord.

He likes the danger, doesn't he? 'Yes,' he says the sparkle brighter than ever. 'Someone told me I should take up golf.' Pause. 'I fucking hate golf.'</p> <p> Ken Thorne is a 59-year-old Welsh millionaire from Cardiff with a wife, four children and six grandchildren. His money comes from property development and car dealing but his passion is powerboating. When World Of Cars sank he lost roughly \u00a3300,000 - it wasn't insured - and the first thing he did was look for another ride.

Everyone told me that he is mad, they love him but he's mad. With arms like hams and his pugnaciously playful manner Ken doesn't give a damn. He just loves being on the water and racing.</p> <p> The big issue in Class One is the Arabs or, to be more specific, the United Arab Emirates. Its leading boat, Victory One, has won three of the past four races and leads the championship by 24 points. With the UAE government prepared to bankroll the team to the tune of around \u00a39 million a season, approximately nine times as much as anyone else, the fear is that in trying to promote their country (powerboating is close to a national sport) the UAE is in danger of destroying the spectacle.</p> <p> Ken, for one, isn't impressed. 'They've ruined it,' he says. 'It's not their fault. The UIM [powerboating's governing body] have allowed it to happen. But the essence of competition is a level playing field, and we haven't got one. They have so much money that they are entering the field with a higher safety margin than anyone else. To compete we all have to go all out all the time. We're pushing too hard. That's what happened to me in Oslo.'</p> <p> Apart from their competitors, there is one other person in Istanbul disturbed by the dominance of Victory One. Just over a year ago Matthias Hauger bought into OSP, the company that promotes Class One. Hauger has a vision of the sport with more teams, more venues and lots more television coverage. That vision does not involve Victory One winning every race - though he doesn't quite put it like that.</p> <p> A 33-year-old former investment banker, Hauger was born in Germany but educated in Britain and has lived here ever since. He is dynamic and friendly, in a Thatcher's child sort of way. Just over a year ago he and his friend and sometime business partner Charles Koppel came to watch Class One and were impressed by the spectacle but not by the promotion. At that time (somewhat confusingly) OSP was owned by Gjelsten, but the Norwegian was keen to bring in new blood. Hauger and Koppel bought into OSP. (Even more confusingly they have also bought into Wimbledon.) Hauger and Koppel don't wish to mislead you as to their motives. 'It's totally a business venture,' says Hauger.</p> <p> The past 10 years have been a time of decline and confusion in Class One, following the sport's heyday in the Eighties when drivers such as former F1 favourite Didier Pironi and Stefano Casiraghi (husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco) raised its profile. The deaths of both in crashes - Pironi in 1987 at Poole and Casiraghi in 1990 in Monaco - played a major part in the sport's downturn. Though the use of fighter plane cockpits has made powerboating much safer, the return to public popularity is a slow process.</p> <p> Hauger sees television as vital. He and Koppel are involved in the production and are striving for a better product. More cameras, more angles. Already there has been progress with broadcast minutes (yes, they do count these things) rocketing from a total of 2,600 minutes around the world last year to more than 36,000, across 100 countries, this. The 2000 championship was thought to have been turned down by the BBC and C4 but gets a regular airing on Sky. Apart from TV, Hauger would like to see the courses closer to the shore, big screens to generate atmosphere and some new locations. This year there are races in Italy, Norway and Turkey (two apiece); and Germany and the UAE. Next year Hauger hopes to add Barcelona and Copenhagen and, perhaps, Britain. Cowes, or possibly Cardiff, have been mentioned. 'From a television and sponsorship perspective we clearly must have a UK venue.'</p> <p> Hauger is frequently described as an aspiring Bernie Ecclestone of powerboating. When I put it to him he looks at me quizzically. Which part of the description is he uncomfortable with: the reputation for ruthlessness, the desire for total control, the legendary wealth? 'I hope it doesn't take that long,' he says.</p> <p> It's Sunday morning, race day, and there is a buzz of anticipation down by the quayside. Well, either a buzz of anticipation or the sound of Class One's camp followers enjoying the early sun and a cup of coffee. There had been a time trial yesterday but the results count only for a separate championship and have no bearing on this afternoon's race. (For the record, Victory One strolled home, nearly two seconds ahead of Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway). Today it's for real. If anything the weather is even better than Saturday: a clear blue sky, brilliant sunshine and no wind. It will be fast.</p> <p> All the pre-race action is in the Tommy Hilfiger sponsorship stand. Rokke is there with his throttle man Jim Dyke. Gjelsten is there with his throttle man Steve Curtis. And the legendary Italian driver and playboy Edoardo Polli is there with his cigar, his throttle man obscured by a plume of smoke. ('Throttle man', incidentally, is a slightly misleading term, certainly if it suggests some sort of bag carrier. In fact throttle men are at least the equals of their drivers, who concentrate solely on steering, and some say it is the more skilful position.)</p> <p> The six are huddled furtively, presumably talking race tactics. Then again, perhaps Rokke and Gjelsten are plotting the takeover of Tommy Hilfiger. If this stand doesn't give away the sort of people attracted to Class One, then the Maserati one next door certainly does. It costs at least a quarter of a million dollars to put on a weekend of Class One and for that sort of money you don't expect to be hobnobbing with the great unwashed. From the sparkling, new pantechnicons which transport the boats from venue to venue, to the expensively coutured hangers-on, to the fleet of pristine scooters everyone uses to transport themselves the smallest of distances, to the boats themselves, the evidence of wealth is everywhere. Class One may be a poor relation to Formula One, but we're talking rich families here.</p> <p> It would be nice to be able to describe the paraphernalia of the powerboating circus as incongruous pitched against the ancient backdrop of Istanbul. In fact there is no paradox at all. Across the quay the villas in this part of town could be from the French Riviera and the boats moored on the opposite shore would do credit to St Tropez. Only when you look across the Bosphorus itself and watch the huge tankers and cargo ships humming slowly between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea do you get any sense of location.</p> <p> In truth the paradox is Istanbul itself: a city laden with historical resonance but more than willing to embrace the lifestyle and values of the 21st century. The satellite dishes sprouting from every rooftop suggest a place less than consumed by its past.</p> <p> Adding to the ambience of Mediterranean chic is Rokke's girlfriend, the spectacularly monikered Selina Middlefart. Her name isn't the only thing spectacular about Selina, a tall, beautifully sculpted blonde who - as if she didn't have enough going for her - is independently wealthy. Class One may not quite have the glamorous following of Formula One, but Selina is doing a pretty good job of redressing the balance.</p> <p> I home in on Rokke. 'I don't give interviews,' he says as he disappears into the Jolly Motor trailer. Clearly his reputation is well founded. To make amends the organisers invite me on to the starter's boat to watch the race from the middle. As someone whose sea legs have never been very reliable I'm not sure this is any sort of compensation, but in this macho environment I don't like to own up to them. It is, I'm told, a great honour.</p> <p>A couple of hours later I'm next to the starter, Richard Ridout, on board his powerboat. Richard is a tubby builder from Bournemouth with a wispy grey beard and an engaging manner. He looks like Richard Griffiths with a clipboard. He tells me I can help start the race by holding the yellow flag aloft until the off. Again I wonder whether this is expecting a bit much from someone with my sea legs. Again I remain silent. How difficult can it be to hold up a yellow flag? As we zoom around the course checking the buoys it turns out to be a lot more difficult than I thought. We are buffeted up and down, the wind raging into our faces. I need all my strength to keep the flag up, but I do get a sense of the speed and exhilaration of powerboats. We are doing all of 30mph.</p> <p> Half an hour later and the moment has arrived. All the boats have to stay within the line of sight of the starter, and behind his boat, until the yellow flag goes down and the green one is raised.In an instant the competitors blaze past us in a swirl of foam and deafening noise and at that precise moment I realise the essence of Class One powerboating. There is only one word for those boats. Monsters. </p> <p> As with many sports, television does not do them justice. Nor do photographs. They are huge. Simply huge. At 46 feet long, they are a good six feet longer than a London bus and more than three times the length of a Formula One car. Each one is powered by a couple of V12 engines that make a terrifying, elemental din. Bjorn Gjelsten may say it's not just a question of size, but in the world of phallic symbols they are most definitely at the hardcore end of the Freudian metaphor.</p> <p> Not only has the start been thrilling, it is also unexpected. Victory One is at the back and the two Norwegians are in the vanguard. By the end of the first lap Rokke's Jolly Motor is ahead, closely pursued by the second Emirates boat, Victory Seven, and Gjelsten in Spirit of Norway. At the end of the second lap, right in front of us, comes a mesmerising bit of racing as Spirit, having drawn level with Victory Seven, undercuts it at the top buoy with a superbly delicate manoeuvre. But before Gjeltsen can enjoy his advantage he inexplicably clobbers the second buoy at the top of the course, allowing Victory Seven back into second place. While confusion reigns on our boat (what are the rules when a buoy has been hit?) the two boats charge down the Bosphorus. The buoy, meanwhile, is nowhere to be seen.</p> <p> By the time the leaders come round again Spirit has retaken second place and the stage seems set for a memorable battle between the Norwegians. However there is a cloud on the horizon. Victory One. After a bad start the UAE boat is moving remorselessly up the field. By lap five it has overtaken Victory Seven to claim third place. One lap later it goes past Spirit into second and on lap seven it takes the lead from Jolly Motor. A few minutes later the Arabs achieve total domination when Victory Seven goes past both Norwegians.</p> <p> And that, quite simply, is that. Just over halfway through and the race is over. Victory One wins by a comfortable margin, its fourth in five races. Victory Seven comes second, Rokke third, Polli fourth and Gjelsten a very disappointing fifth. </p> <p> For a man who has a) just been beaten, and b) dislikes talking in public, Kjell Rokke seems remarkably happy at the post-race press conference. There were two races, he says, and he was happy to have done well in the one in which Victory One was not competing. He even admits to having made a mistake, one that had allowed Victory Seven to pass him. As the conference draws to a close it occurs to me why he's so happy. He may have been beaten by the UAE boats, but he finished ahead of Gjelsten and has overtaken him in the championship. He must be in a good mood because after the conference, amazingly, Rokke agrees to a brief interview. You and Bjorn have a friendship going back 30 years? 'Yeah.' But you beat him today? 'Yeah. We were a little bit more lucky than he was.' Clearly not one to brag, then. You have a long friendship, but you also compete against each other? 'No that isn't true.' Pardon? He says you compete against each other. 'No, I don't compete against him. I compete in the class, and Bjorn by virtue of being a competitor, I compete with him. But I don't compete with Bjorn. I don't think he competes with me either.'</p> <p> Very odd. What's wrong with admitting you and Bjorn compete? By now Rokke clearly wants to get away, but before he can, I ask him whether he would buy another team in the future. 'The reason I got out of it was that I had my own team and I was spending too much time doing it. Now I'm a hired driver for the Jolly Motor team, I get paid for it and I'm happy.' You get paid for it? Jesus, you're the richest man in Norway and it's important that you get paid for it?</p> <p>He shrugs and evades the question. 'Well it's a good team, it's a professional team. I have a job to do'</p> <p>Will he be back next year? He shrugs again. 'If I get hired back, that's the question.' A few minutes later I'm talking to Gjelsten. He is fuming, and wants to explain why he didn't do better in the race. 'We had a very good start, we were leading towards the first bend, which is very important, then we lost the gear,' he says. 'We had technical problems.'</p> <p> All the same he was furious with what had happened with Victory Seven and hitting the buoy. He had to hit it, he explains, to prevent a serious collision. 'I had a line like this,' he says drawing a diagram on my notepad, 'and then we came back like this. I was the first boat to this buoy, I had my nose in front of him. I saw that he was not going to back down, as he should do, because I had the racing line. So I had two options. Either to stay outside of the buoy and him probably hitting the backside of the boat or' His voice trails off. 'I felt very insecure being there and Steve - who's no chicken - said \"Hook it.\" He would have hit me somewhere. Guaranteed. He had his nose up, so I knew he couldn't steer.' The sense of injustice is palpable. Would he appeal?</p> <p> 'No.' Why not? 'I like to race, I don't like to protest.' What about racing Kjell, when they were first and second. Didn't he enjoy that? 'I enjoyed it, but we were frustrated because we should have been in the lead. We had the perfect start. We were first out. But for the technical problems I think we would have been second for sure.' You would have beaten Kjell? 'Yeah. It's fair to say. We were less than three-quarters of a lap behind them, having stopped two times. But that's racing.' And how about their rivalry overall. Who's better at what? 'Well we competed first at track and fields [cross-country]. We were about the same. And skiing, I took it to the national and international level' The unspoken inference was clearly that Rokke hadn't. 'And racing, I've been the world champion. There's never been a Norwegian world champion.' Anything else you two compete at? 'Oh absolutely.' Go on. 'Oh - they're secret.' Business? 'Well, there we usually work together. A lot of small things.' Kjell denies the rivalry, by the way. Bjorn Gjelsten smiles benevolently, a 'yes he would say that wouldn't he?' smile. I tell him that I don't think Rokke wants to tell me anything about himself. 'Well he wants you to stay away from me.'</p> <p>On the quayside that night there is a spectacular gala dinner for more than 400 guests. The atmosphere is relaxed and festive with a lot of the teams letting go after a hard weekend's racing. And everyone I talk to agrees that there is a special rivalry between Bjorn and Kjell, whatever Kjell may say.</p> <p> Most of the drivers are there. Edoardo, surrounded by pretty women, cigar firmly in place. Ken ebullient as ever. Bjorn more subdued, but happily going over his race again. Of Kjell there is no sign. He and Selina have made straight for the airport where they board his own 737 to fly back home. By the time the gala dinner finishes Kjell Inge Rokke is back in Oslo.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's Saturday morning by the Bosphorus and the two most famous people in Norway are talking boats. Behind them a string of vessels that would grace a Bond movie chunter noisily on to one of the world's great waterways. The powerboating Class One circus has come to Istanbul. The Bosphorus - which is usually flat and calm - is probably the fastest track on the Class One circuit, and one of the Norwegians, Bjorn Rune Gjelsten, has particular reason to know it. 'Right here last year we flipped,' he recalls. 'We were pushing really hard to win that race, because we had to win to win the championship. We sat in second place, then came side by side with the leading boat and we ended up flipping in a turn. It was probably the fastest crash in Class One ever. About 145 mph.' So is he nervous to be back here for the first time since then? 'I think everybody should be a little bit nervous,' he says pensively. 'Racing on the real rough, were you're bouncing around, you're hit hard - it aches and it hurts - but it's not that dangerous. It looks dangerous only it's not. But racing here,' he looks out on to the water, 'that can be quite marginal.' Class One - with its mix of speed, money and glamour - is powerboating's equivalent to Formula One, and Gjelsten and Kjell Inge Rokke are among its leading acts. Not that their fame has much to do with water sports. Rokke and Gjelsten made their names as businessmen - Richard Bransons with less facial hair and considerably less negative undertow - and in Norway, where nobody is as famous as a fjord, they pass for royalty. In fact they are more famous than royalty, according to a recent poll. Of course, the very notion of fame in Norway is a bit of an oxymoron: like focusing on America's leading socialists or the best French fast bowlers. In the absence of film stars and pop singers, Rokke and Gjelsten are in the Oslo papers all the time. In Britain they are famous for another reason. Three years ago they purchased Wimbledon FC and have been characterised as 'the mysterious Norwegians' who bought into English football ever since. Later, Gjelsten will tell me that it is only since former owner Sam Hamamm left Wimbledon that he has felt part of the club. 'It feels like we haven't been with the club for a year yet, and how can you be emotionally involved with something for less than a year? I don't think you can. It takes time. But now we have been involved with losing, with being relegated, and that gives you something.' But as they gaze over the glistening water in Istanbul the last things on their minds are a return to the Premiership or John Hartson's fitness. Rokke, the younger and richer of the two, has just returned from a test drive and has dropped in on Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway team for a chat. He looks very much at home, which is hardly surprising not just because the two have known each other for more than 30 years, but because he sold Gjelsten the team a couple of years ago. It's that kind of friendship. With his driving suit tied around his midriff - revealing the Jolly Motors T-shirt of the team he now drives for (but doesn't own) - Rokke looks relaxed as he relives his morning's endeavours. I had been told that the two look alike, which is sort of true even though they don't. Gjeltsen is taller, thinner and, unlike Rokke, wears glasses. Yet their faces lack distinctive features - faces you find it difficult to recall as soon as you look away. Though neither is remotely in the Branson class, Gjelsten is far happier talking to the press than his friend, and comes over for a chat. He first got into powerboating through Kjell (pronounced 'Chell'), he says. Kjell was driving in the US when Gjelsten went over to watch him. 'I made all these comments to him,' Gjelsten recalls. 'He should do this and that. He turned to me and said, \"Bjorn why don't you do it yourself?\" So he did, but not for the reasons you might expect. 'It's not just a question of going out and buying a big boat with the biggest engines,' he says seriously. 'There is a lot of attention to detail. And focus, discipline, being systematic. That appealed to me.' This, it should be said, is exactly what he is famous for as a businessman. He smiles. 'Yeah, I think that maybe is one of my strong sides, and maybe a weak side too: being too focused on details. ' Before long the two were racing against each other in Class One, which didn't surprise anyone who knew them. Their friendship can be dated very precisely. Fittingly it began at a competitive event, a cross-country meeting. Both won their respective classes, and afterwards Bjorn's father - a fanatically keen footballer - invited the younger boy to come and stay with them. In doing so he introduced young Rokke to what Gjeltsen himself describes as 'a family where we were always competing'. Bjorn was 10, Kjell eight. There was plenty to compete at but Bjorn seems to have had the upper hand. He excelled at Nordic skiing, going on to represent his country and win international titles. In business, however, Rokke has always held sway, ever since he went off to Seattle as a young man, returning with the reputation as the biggest white fish fisherman in the world - and a lot of money. When they are driving on the water, I ask, are they still competing as they did as kids? 'Oh absolutely, but in a positive way. I think it's good. It drives us.' And - now that he is 44 and Rokke 41- who is the better driver? Pause. 'I think we have different talents,' Gjelsten says diplomatically. 'Kjell was very good before. Then he stayed away a couple of years. He keeps saying that I was dumb to teach him the new tricks. Powerboating has changed a lot in the past two or three years. We've gone from speeds of around 140mph to 160mph. We are now right on the edge when we are racing, we drive slightly different to how we did three years ago.' The combination of Gjelsten's competitiveness and the increased speed of the boats led to the near-disaster last year on the Bosphorus. Gjelsten escaped, if that's the right word, with just a few broken ribs (his throttle man Steve Curtis, he remarks ruefully, only had a cut finger) but the crash left its mark. When Formula One drivers are involved in big crashes they almost invariably return to the fray. But for them it is different. They are professionals. Gjelsten is a very successful businessman for whom driving is - surely - just a hobby. He has a family and a career; why risk it? 'I think you do worry about it sometimes, but your instinct to compete is there,' Gjelsten says. 'For me that's always been the case. For me actually it's more than an advanced hobby. I practise every day. I do my one-hour jog, I go to the gym. I stay fairly fit. Yeah, you can race without being as fit as I am, but you won't win.' Eight minutes. That was the time that Ken Thorne was under water in Oslo earlier this year. He was pushing his boat to the limit - and then she went over. 'I thought I wasn't going to get out of that one,' he says jovially, as if recalling the time he ran out of petrol. 'Eight minutes under water and you think you're a gonner. One hundred and forty to a complete stop in a second.' His memories of the crash remain vivid. 'The cockpit filled up with water in an instant, and then it went completely black. And freezing fucking cold. I had water up my hooter, in my mouth, in my lungs. I'd lost my bearings and didn't know what the hell was going on.' What went on was a high-speed rescue which saw Ken and his throttle man taken ashore, shaken but not badly injured, while his boat, World Of Cars, sank to the bottom of the Oslofjord. It was a narrow escape. Did he ever consider not doing it again? He looks at me as if the question is ridiculous, a sparkle in his eye. He didn't, did he? 'No I didn't.' He likes the danger, doesn't he? 'Yes,' he says the sparkle brighter than ever. 'Someone told me I should take up golf.' Pause. 'I fucking hate golf.' Ken Thorne is a 59-year-old Welsh millionaire from Cardiff with a wife, four children and six grandchildren. His money comes from property development and car dealing but his passion is powerboating. When World Of Cars sank he lost roughly \u00a3300,000 - it wasn't insured - and the first thing he did was look for another ride. Andreas Ugland, another Norwegian businessman, badly injured his back in Oslo and was unable to drive his boat Jotun in Istanbul, so he offered the drive to Ken. Throughout the weekend Class One offers images of itself as a kind of wannabe Formula One and plenty of people would like to further the analogy. But as he sits in the shade of the Jotun team trailer the day before resuming his race career, it becomes clear that F1 doesn't boast anyone remotely as original as Ken Thorne. Everyone told me that he is mad, they love him but he's mad. With arms like hams and his pugnaciously playful manner Ken doesn't give a damn. He just loves being on the water and racing. The big issue in Class One is the Arabs or, to be more specific, the United Arab Emirates. Its leading boat, Victory One, has won three of the past four races and leads the championship by 24 points. With the UAE government prepared to bankroll the team to the tune of around \u00a39 million a season, approximately nine times as much as anyone else, the fear is that in trying to promote their country (powerboating is close to a national sport) the UAE is in danger of destroying the spectacle.

At that time (somewhat confusingly) OSP was owned by Gjelsten, but the Norwegian was keen to bring in new blood. Hauger and Koppel bought into OSP. (Even more confusingly they have also bought into Wimbledon.) Hauger and Koppel don't wish to mislead you as to their motives. 'It's totally a business venture,' says Hauger. The past 10 years have been a time of decline and confusion in Class One, following the sport's heyday in the Eighties when drivers such as former F1 favourite Didier Pironi and Stefano Casiraghi (husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco) raised its profile. The deaths of both in crashes - Pironi in 1987 at Poole and Casiraghi in 1990 in Monaco - played a major part in the sport's downturn. Though the use of fighter plane cockpits has made powerboating much safer, the return to public popularity is a slow process. Hauger sees television as vital. He and Koppel are involved in the production and are striving for a better product. More cameras, more angles. Already there has been progress with broadcast minutes (yes, they do count these things) rocketing from a total of 2,600 minutes around the world last year to more than 36,000, across 100 countries, this. The 2000 championship was thought to have been turned down by the BBC and C4 but gets a regular airing on Sky. Apart from TV, Hauger would like to see the courses closer to the shore, big screens to generate atmosphere and some new locations. This year there are races in Italy, Norway and Turkey (two apiece); and Germany and the UAE. Next year Hauger hopes to add Barcelona and Copenhagen and, perhaps, Britain. Cowes, or possibly Cardiff, have been mentioned. 'From a television and sponsorship perspective we clearly must have a UK venue.' Hauger is frequently described as an aspiring Bernie Ecclestone of powerboating. When I put it to him he looks at me quizzically. Which part of the description is he uncomfortable with: the reputation for ruthlessness, the desire for total control, the legendary wealth? 'I hope it doesn't take that long,' he says. It's Sunday morning, race day, and there is a buzz of anticipation down by the quayside. Well, either a buzz of anticipation or the sound of Class One's camp followers enjoying the early sun and a cup of coffee. There had been a time trial yesterday but the results count only for a separate championship and have no bearing on this afternoon's race. (For the record, Victory One strolled home, nearly two seconds ahead of Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway). Today it's for real. If anything the weather is even better than Saturday: a clear blue sky, brilliant sunshine and no wind. It will be fast. All the pre-race action is in the Tommy Hilfiger sponsorship stand. Rokke is there with his throttle man Jim Dyke. Gjelsten is there with his throttle man Steve Curtis. And the legendary Italian driver and playboy Edoardo Polli is there with his cigar, his throttle man obscured by a plume of smoke. ('Throttle man', incidentally, is a slightly misleading term, certainly if it suggests some sort of bag carrier. In fact throttle men are at least the equals of their drivers, who concentrate solely on steering, and some say it is the more skilful position.) The six are huddled furtively, presumably talking race tactics. Then again, perhaps Rokke and Gjelsten are plotting the takeover of Tommy Hilfiger. If this stand doesn't give away the sort of people attracted to Class One, then the Maserati one next door certainly does. It costs at least a quarter of a million dollars to put on a weekend of Class One and for that sort of money you don't expect to be hobnobbing with the great unwashed. From the sparkling, new pantechnicons which transport the boats from venue to venue, to the expensively coutured hangers-on, to the fleet of pristine scooters everyone uses to transport themselves the smallest of distances, to the boats themselves, the evidence of wealth is everywhere. Class One may be a poor relation to Formula One, but we're talking rich families here. It would be nice to be able to describe the paraphernalia of the powerboating circus as incongruous pitched against the ancient backdrop of Istanbul. In fact there is no paradox at all. Across the quay the villas in this part of town could be from the French Riviera and the boats moored on the opposite shore would do credit to St Tropez. Only when you look across the Bosphorus itself and watch the huge tankers and cargo ships humming slowly between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea do you get any sense of location. In truth the paradox is Istanbul itself: a city laden with historical resonance but more than willing to embrace the lifestyle and values of the 21st century. The satellite dishes sprouting from every rooftop suggest a place less than consumed by its past. Adding to the ambience of Mediterranean chic is Rokke's girlfriend, the spectacularly monikered Selina Middlefart. Her name isn't the only thing spectacular about Selina, a tall, beautifully sculpted blonde who - as if she didn't have enough going for her - is independently wealthy. Class One may not quite have the glamorous following of Formula One, but Selina is doing a pretty good job of redressing the balance. I home in on Rokke. 'I don't give interviews,' he says as he disappears into the Jolly Motor trailer. Clearly his reputation is well founded. To make amends the organisers invite me on to the starter's boat to watch the race from the middle. As someone whose sea legs have never been very reliable I'm not sure this is any sort of compensation, but in this macho environment I don't like to own up to them. It is, I'm told, a great honour. A couple of hours later I'm next to the starter, Richard Ridout, on board his powerboat. Richard is a tubby builder from Bournemouth with a wispy grey beard and an engaging manner. He looks like Richard Griffiths with a clipboard. He tells me I can help start the race by holding the yellow flag aloft until the off. Again I wonder whether this is expecting a bit much from someone with my sea legs. Again I remain silent. How difficult can it be to hold up a yellow flag? As we zoom around the course checking the buoys it turns out to be a lot more difficult than I thought. We are buffeted up and down, the wind raging into our faces. I need all my strength to keep the flag up, but I do get a sense of the speed and exhilaration of powerboats. We are doing all of 30mph. Half an hour later and the moment has arrived. All the boats have to stay within the line of sight of the starter, and behind his boat, until the yellow flag goes down and the green one is raised.In an instant the competitors blaze past us in a swirl of foam and deafening noise and at that precise moment I realise the essence of Class One powerboating. There is only one word for those boats. Monsters. As with many sports, television does not do them justice. Nor do photographs. They are huge. Simply huge. At 46 feet long, they are a good six feet longer than a London bus and more than three times the length of a Formula One car. Each one is powered by a couple of V12 engines that make a terrifying, elemental din. Bjorn Gjelsten may say it's not just a question of size, but in the world of phallic symbols they are most definitely at the hardcore end of the Freudian metaphor. Not only has the start been thrilling, it is also unexpected. Victory One is at the back and the two Norwegians are in the vanguard. By the end of the first lap Rokke's Jolly Motor is ahead, closely pursued by the second Emirates boat, Victory Seven, and Gjelsten in Spirit of Norway. At the end of the second lap, right in front of us, comes a mesmerising bit of racing as Spirit, having drawn level with Victory Seven, undercuts it at the top buoy with a superbly delicate manoeuvre. But before Gjeltsen can enjoy his advantage he inexplicably clobbers the second buoy at the top of the course, allowing Victory Seven back into second place. While confusion reigns on our boat (what are the rules when a buoy has been hit?) the two boats charge down the Bosphorus. The buoy, meanwhile, is nowhere to be seen. By the time the leaders come round again Spirit has retaken second place and the stage seems set for a memorable battle between the Norwegians. However there is a cloud on the horizon. Victory One. After a bad start the UAE boat is moving remorselessly up the field. By lap five it has overtaken Victory Seven to claim third place. One lap later it goes past Spirit into second and on lap seven it takes the lead from Jolly Motor. A few minutes later the Arabs achieve total domination when Victory Seven goes past both Norwegians. And that, quite simply, is that. Just over halfway through and the race is over. Victory One wins by a comfortable margin, its fourth in five races. Victory Seven comes second, Rokke third, Polli fourth and Gjelsten a very disappointing fifth. For a man who has a) just been beaten, and b) dislikes talking in public, Kjell Rokke seems remarkably happy at the post-race press conference. There were two races, he says, and he was happy to have done well in the one in which Victory One was not competing. He even admits to having made a mistake, one that had allowed Victory Seven to pass him. As the conference draws to a close it occurs to me why he's so happy. He may have been beaten by the UAE boats, but he finished ahead of Gjelsten and has overtaken him in the championship. He must be in a good mood because after the conference, amazingly, Rokke agrees to a brief interview. You and Bjorn have a friendship going back 30 years? 'Yeah.' But you beat him today? 'Yeah. We were a little bit more lucky than he was.' Clearly not one to brag, then. You have a long friendship, but you also compete against each other? 'No that isn't true.' Pardon? He says you compete against each other. 'No, I don't compete against him. I compete in the class, and Bjorn by virtue of being a competitor, I compete with him. But I don't compete with Bjorn. I don't think he competes with me either.' Very odd. What's wrong with admitting you and Bjorn compete? By now Rokke clearly wants to get away, but before he can, I ask him whether he would buy another team in the future. 'The reason I got out of it was that I had my own team and I was spending too much time doing it. Now I'm a hired driver for the Jolly Motor team, I get paid for it and I'm happy.' You get paid for it? Jesus, you're the richest man in Norway and it's important that you get paid for it? He shrugs and evades the question. 'Well it's a good team, it's a professional team. I have a job to do' Will he be back next year? He shrugs again. 'If I get hired back, that's the question.' A few minutes later I'm talking to Gjelsten. He is fuming, and wants to explain why he didn't do better in the race. 'We had a very good start, we were leading towards the first bend, which is very important, then we lost the gear,' he says. 'We had technical problems.' All the same he was furious with what had happened with Victory Seven and hitting the buoy. He had to hit it, he explains, to prevent a serious collision. 'I had a line like this,' he says drawing a diagram on my notepad, 'and then we came back like this. I was the first boat to this buoy, I had my nose in front of him. I saw that he was not going to back down, as he should do, because I had the racing line. So I had two options. Either to stay outside of the buoy and him probably hitting the backside of the boat or' His voice trails off. 'I felt very insecure being there and Steve - who's no chicken - said \"Hook it.\" He would have hit me somewhere. Guaranteed. He had his nose up, so I knew he couldn't steer.' The sense of injustice is palpable. Would he appeal? 'No.' Why not? 'I like to race, I don't like to protest.' What about racing Kjell, when they were first and second. Didn't he enjoy that? 'I enjoyed it, but we were frustrated because we should have been in the lead. We had the perfect start. We were first out. But for the technical problems I think we would have been second for sure.' You would have beaten Kjell? 'Yeah. It's fair to say. We were less than three-quarters of a lap behind them, having stopped two times. But that's racing.' And how about their rivalry overall. Who's better at what? 'Well we competed first at track and fields [cross-country]. We were about the same. And skiing, I took it to the national and international level' The unspoken inference was clearly that Rokke hadn't. 'And racing, I've been the world champion. There's never been a Norwegian world champion.' Anything else you two compete at? 'Oh absolutely.' Go on. 'Oh - they're secret.' Business? 'Well, there we usually work together. A lot of small things.' Kjell denies the rivalry, by the way. Bjorn Gjelsten smiles benevolently, a 'yes he would say that wouldn't he?' smile. I tell him that I don't think Rokke wants to tell me anything about himself. 'Well he wants you to stay away from me.' On the quayside that night there is a spectacular gala dinner for more than 400 guests. The atmosphere is relaxed and festive with a lot of the teams letting go after a hard weekend's racing. And everyone I talk to agrees that there is a special rivalry between Bjorn and Kjell, whatever Kjell may say. Most of the drivers are there. Edoardo, surrounded by pretty women, cigar firmly in place. Ken ebullient as ever. Bjorn more subdued, but happily going over his race again. Of Kjell there is no sign. He and Selina have made straight for the airport where they board his own 737 to fly back home. By the time the gala dinner finishes Kjell Inge Rokke is back in Oslo.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Nancy In The Morning</strong></p> <p>I open my eyes to the sound of my hometown, Nancy, in the morning: the 7.43am for Paris pulling out slowly from the station; the hum of exhaust pipes on the avenue de la Garenne; an ambulance klaxoning moronically in the distance; heavy drops of rain rapping the bedroom window and beyond the white net curtain, the first sight of Nancy, an eternal grey sky, always the same. </p> <p> Virginia is sleeping. I reach out and nudge her gently and watch her blink and stretch and slowly stir to life. No words are exchanged between us as she pulls on her dressing gown and trudges towards the door. I lie with my thoughts and listen to the sound of Maeva being woken and coaxed into the bathroom: 'Allez, Maeva, c'est l'heure, ma cherie.' I pull back the sheets and swivel my legs on to the floor. My knee, as usual, has seized during the night. I run my fingers across the joint and feel the bone and cartilage grinding like a rusty old gate. The first step of the day is always the most painful. First, I lift my heel off the floor and flex my leg gently. Then, placing my hands on the side of the bed for the launch, I push forward, taking the weight on my left leg and hold the post of the bed for support. By the time I have limped from the wardrobe to the bathroom to the kitchen, I am almost walking normally. Virginia hands me a cup of tea. Maeva has breakfasted and is ready for school.</p> <p> My name is Tony Cascarino and I am 37 years old. I live with Maeva Cascarino and Virginia Masson on the third floor of an apartment block, a short walk from Nancy train station at 6 avenue de la Garenne. Madame Ginet, a mild-mannered teacher who sometimes teaches me French, lives in the apartment above. Monsieur Madaous, a bad-tempered sales rep who almost always acts like a prick (whenever Maeva is loud or I absentmindedly obstruct his parking space), lives in the apartment below. It is not, by any means, an exclusive development. We buy our groceries from the Codec store around the corner, drop our rubbish on the ground floor in a bin behind the lift and collect our post from wooden boxes bearing our names in the entrance hall. Most of the tenants are office workers, secretaries or tradesmen - ordinary people living ordinary lives well, maybe mine is a little different. </p> <p> I play football with Nancy FC. I have been a professional footballer since 1982, when I walked off a building site in London one afternoon and signed for a third division team called Gillingham. Before working on the building site, I spent two years cutting and styling women's hair. Professional football is a lot more fun than building or hairdressing. It also pays better and carries a lot more perks: we travel first-class, stay in the best hotels, eat the finest food, wear designer clothes, drive the fastest cars and never have to queue for surgeons, doctors or dentists. The game is good to us. The game is everything you dream it is: we are worshipped like pop stars, pampered and spoiled. But after 19 years, it begins to wear you down. Of late the sheer boredom of playing and training has been killing me. </p> <p> Sometimes, on the night before a game, I lie on the five-star bed in the five-star hotel and gaze at the five-star ceiling and it feels like a prison cell. But I still get anxious when the manager names the team. I still get excited when Saturday comes. My daughter, Maeva, is five years old. When she throws her arms around me and calls me 'Papa', it is easily the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. She was born in Nice in August 1995 at a time when I was married to another woman, living in another place and leading a deceitful double life. A day old when I sneaked away and saw her for the first time, she was aware of me for the first year of her life as the father who slept with her mother but never stayed the night. </p> <p> L'\u00c9cole Maternel de Notre-Dame is a 10-minute drive from the apartment. We take the lift to the ground floor and skip quickly through the rain to the car, where our warm breath soon mists the windscreen. 'On peut rien voir,' Maeva protests, as we join the queue on Avenue de la Garenne. 'I know, Mimi,' I reply. 'I've switched on the fan to clear it.' 'Ca marche pas, papa.' 'It will clear in a moment, Mimi. Sit back and put on your seat belt.' 'D'accord.' D'accord is French for OK. Maeva knows d'accord is French for OK and knows the English for pretty much everything she says but refuses to converse with me in anything but French </p> <p> I find a vacant space near the school on Rue de la Ravinelle and lead Maeva by the hand to the entrance. Other parents are dropping children off; from the look in their eye as we exchange 'bonjours', it is clear to me that they know who I am. The recognition is flattering. Although I have never felt that comfortable in the spotlight, one of the real satisfactions of my life these days is when Maeva comes home from school glowing because her dad has been mentioned in class. They call me 'Tony Goal' in these parts, which will probably sound absurd if you happen to follow football and live in Birmingham, Glasgow or London. But it's true. Only six other players can boast a better strike rate this season in the French first division. My name will ring a bell in every village Caf\u00e9 des Sports. But it is also true that when it comes to much of what happened before, I can offer little by way of defence.</p> <p> Ten years ago, in what seems another life, I moved from Millwall to Aston Villa, at a time when Villa were top of the league and closing on the championship. Brilliant since the start of the season, the team had started to falter in March and I was bought to supply the goals that would stave off Liverpool. I didn't score for seven games. Liverpool were champions. Villa finished runners-up. A year later, I moved from Villa to Celtic but the drought continued. One afternoon, I was out shopping with my pregnant wife and my son Michael when a supporter stopped me in the street and offered a critical assessment. </p> <p> 'You're fucking shit, you,' he hissed. 'You're a useless big bastard.' Glasgow is the world capital of tribal hatred and friends had warned me not to react when approached by Rangers fans, but this fellow was absolutely raving. 'You're a fucking wanker, a useless bastard.' 'Look, mate,' I pleaded, 'give me a break. Can't you see I'm with my wife and son?' 'You're fucking shit,' he said. 'And I'm a Celtic fan.' We moved to London six months later but the cataclysm continued at Chelsea. I was booed at Stamford Bridge on the day I made my debut, and then Michael came home from school one afternoon and inflicted the cruellest blow of all. The boys in his class had been talking about me. 'You're not very good, Dad, are you?' he said. How do you respond to something like that? What do you say to your six-year-old son? That his friends are wrong? That there's a lot more to the game than what they hear from their dads? What's your defence when you're 31 years old and your career is in freefall? There was nothing to do but swallow hard and resolve to make him proud. </p> <p> Six years have passed since I left England's shores and whenever I return, people who remember me as the lanky striker who used to play for Gillingham often stop me in the street and ask what I'm doing now. Unfortunately, the French sports daily L'Equipe doesn't sell that well in Chislehurst; I might as well be scoring goals on Mars. Usually, I'll fob them off with some yarn about retirement. How do I begin to explain my secret life? There is so much they would never understand. </p> <p>It is October and Nancy is cold and sad and grey, and over the next five months it won't change much. Take away the magnificence of the Place Stanislas and Nancy doesn't have a lot going for it. The people are decent but struggle to make a living. If it were England, it would be Barnsley. Heading west towards the suburb of Laxou, I take the A31 towards the training ground at For\u00eat de Haye. The manager has announced a double session today. Double sessions are murder when it's cold and wet and you've got bombed cartilage for a knee. I've had two cortisone injections already this season. For the past eight years I've taken anti-inflammatory pills before and after every game. The pills play havoc with my stomach and scorch my arse with diarrhoea but when the ball hits the back of the net and the crowd chants my name, it seems a small price to pay. How much longer can I keep paying? I don't know. </p> <p> There isn't a week that goes by these days when I don't ask myself that question, knowing the answer will always be the same. I play football because I have to play football. I play football because I know nothing else. On the first Friday of every month, the incentive to keep going is dropped through my letterbox in printed type: allowances and bonuses, taxes and fines, all listed in francs and centimes. I earn 160,000 francs a month playing for Nancy, which, depending on bonuses, translates to roughly \u00a38,000 a month after tax. Pretty much everything we spend is budgeted for these days - a sharp contrast to my youth, when the only figures that mattered were the goal-scoring stats. But you change as you get older: you worry about the future more. Last week, after another night spent tossing and turning, I sat down with a pen and paper and tried to figure it all out.</p> <p>1982: Gillingham - \u00a39,200 <br> 1983: Gillingham - \u00a310,400<br> 1984: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 <br> 1985: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 <br> 1986: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 <br> 1987: Gillingham/Millwall - \u00a320,800 <br> 1988: Millwall - \u00a323,400 <br> 1989: Millwall - \u00a326,000 <br> 1990: Millwall/Aston Villa - \u00a356,000 <br> 1991: Aston Villa/Celtic - \u00a371,500<br> 1992: Celtic/Chelsea - \u00a378,000 <br> 1993: Chelsea - \u00a378,000 <br> 1994: Chelsea/Marseilles - \u00a3147,000 <br> 1995: Marseilles - \u00a3225,000 <br> 1996: Marseilles - \u00a3199,000<br> 1997: Nancy - \u00a3126,000<br> 1998: Nancy - \u00a398,400 <br> 1999: Nancy - \u00a3140,000 <br> Approximate income from football since 1982: \u00a31,347,700 <br> Bonus payments and sign-on fees since 1982: \u00a3967,000<br> Total career earnings since 1982: \u00a32,314,700 <br></p> <p> It was a sobering experience. Two point three million! Where the hell has it all gone? I mean, there are porters and plumbers and painters who win that on the Lottery and never have to work again. They buy a dream house and a dream car and take their holiday of a lifetime and never look back. They probably won't, it's fair to say, invest as heavily in their pension \u00a32,314,700 -\u00a3150,000 = \u00a32,164,700 and definitely won't, it's true to say, give 40 per cent away in tax \u00a32,164,700 -\u00a3870,040 = \u00a31,294,660 or get slapped with agents' fees \u00a31,294,660 -\u00a332,000 = \u00a31,262,660 They won't sign for Celtic and drop 35 grand in Birmingham because they bought just before the property crash \u00a31,262,660 -\u00a335,000 = \u00a31,227,660 but they may incur the unfortunate sting of divorce \u00a31,227,660 -\u00a3200,000 = \u00a31,027,660 with its maintenance payments that click like a taxi meter \u00a31,027,660 -\u00a324,000 = \u00a31,003,660 and school fees \u00a31,003,660 -\u00a318,000 = \u00a3985,660 not to mention the tip for the solicitors \u00a3985,660 -\u00a35,000 = \u00a3980,660 And when you add it all up, or rather take it all away, 900 grand is not a lot of jam when spread over what it costs to live for 18 years.</p> <p> And it certainly hasn't insured my happy-ever-afters. So you keep fighting the pain when you step out of bed each morning. And you keep taking the pills that rot your stomach and burn your arse. And you keep putting the dye in your hair and pretending you're 10 years younger. You survive. You do what you can. But on mornings like this when the rain is lashing the windscreen, it's hard. </p> <p> That Celtic fan who insulted me in Glasgow, the supporters at Stamford Bridge who derided me for fun - I wish they could have been there on the night I beat Juventus. I wish they could have heard the cheers of the most fanatical supporters in France. I wish they could have seen what I went on to. I swallowed hard. I turned it around. I tried to make Michael proud. Did I? Yes, I'd like to think I did. </p> <p> His mother, Sarah, is writing a novel at the moment. It's the story of a young woman who loves and loses and is forced to start again. The woman, who is also called Sarah, lives in a leafy suburb of London with her husband Eric and their two young sons. Eric is a professional footballer whose career is falling apart. Unwanted and unloved, he is on the verge of quitting the game when he is thrown a lifeline by a big club in France. They find a house in Aix-en-Provence and at first struggle to adapt but within months are embracing the joy of their new lives. For Eric, it's the discovery of what he knew he always had. For Sarah, it's the smell and feel of Provence and their new way of life. The boys settle, too, and seem happy at school. Sarah has never been as content. It's a new chapter. The chance to start again. And then, incredibly, it all falls apart </p> <p> It happens unexpectedly, on the evening of an international game in Dublin. Sarah has returned to London to spend a few days with her mum, when a friend, whose husband, like hers, also plays for the Republic of Ireland, suggests they take a late flight to Dublin to 'surprise the boys'. The game has ended when their flight from Gatwick touches down. They take a taxi to the team hotel and arrive to find their husbands celebrating with the manager and rest of the team in the bar. Eric seems pleased. He calls a porter and has her bags delivered to his room and suggests they go for a meal. They retire with their friends to the dining room. Sarah places her order and asks Eric for the key to the room. She enters the room and sits down to call her mum. There is nothing to worry about. Her precious boys are safely tucked in bed. She thanks her mum and swivels away from the desk, tipping over a small bin with her foot. A crumpled sheet of fax paper tumbles on to the carpet. She picks it up and is about to toss it back when curiosity tempts her to unravel it. The fax is from a woman. The woman is French. The woman is pregnant. The woman has just had a scan and is expecting a baby girl. Eric is about to become a father again. </p> <p> Shaking with rage, she storms back to the dining room and an embarrassing scene ensues. Eric pleads for calm and ushers his wife back to the room. Dismissing the affair as a brief encounter, he begs her forgiveness and promises never to see the other woman again. They return to France and after a few difficult weeks the relationship settles down and appears to return to normal. But behind Sarah's back, Eric continues to lie and cheat. One morning, after dropping the boys at school, she returns to find a note on the kitchen table. 'I'm sorry, Sarah. I know you will never understand but it was something I had to do. Eric.' She checks the bedroom: her husband has removed his clothes. She collapses on the bed in a flood of tears, shaking with grief and anger. The bastard! The cruel, spineless, swine! What is to become of them? Where will they live? How will she explain it to the boys? What breed of man uproots his family from everything they know and abandons them in a strange land? </p> <p> I'm not sure how the story ends or what Sarah intends to call the book when it's published. I'd like to think that, it being a work of fiction, any resemblance between its characters and real people is purely coincidental. I'd like to think that Michael will read it and never confuse Eric with his dad. I'd like to think he goes to school these days with the cuttings he gets from his nan and says 'Told you so' to his mates. I'd like to think he sleeps beneath my poster on his bedroom wall. I'd like to think he understands. But what I'd like to think and what I do think, are not the same.</p> <p><strong>Little Voice </strong></p> <p>(In November 1999 Cascarino was picked for the Republic of Ireland squad to play Turkey in a play-off for Euro 2000. By now a perennial substitute for the Republic Cascarino prepared for the game fully expecting his friend and room-mate Niall Quinn to be picked ahead of him.)</p> <p> The day runs smoothly until just before the pre-match meal, when I bump into Packie Bonner in the corridor. Packie, a friend and former team mate, is a member of the coaching staff. 'I don't think Niall is right,' he says, grimly. 'Get ready to play.' 'You're joking.' 'No, we've just had him down with Martin (the team doctor, Martin Walsh). They're talking about a painkiller before the game.' I continue on towards the dining room but feel the blood draining from my face. I think, 'Oh shit! I might be playing this game,' and within two seconds, the little voice is in my head </p> <p> 'You pathetic fucker, Cascarino!' </p> <p> 'What do you mean?' </p> <p> 'I heard what you thought.' </p> <p> 'No I'</p> <p> 'John from Mullingar was right, you're a fucking disgrace.'</p> <p> 'I didn't mean it like that. It just .slipped out.' </p> <p> 'The truth always does.' </p> <p> 'What truth?' </p> <p> 'You don't want to play.' </p> <p> 'Of course I want to play. I was out of bed at six the other morning to drive to Luxembourg; I'll be chewing anti-inflammatories for a week for this team! Why would I inflict that on myself if I didn't want to play?'</p> <p> 'Well, I can think of the \u00a3900 match fee for a start.' </p> <p> 'That's bollocks - it has nothing to do with the money.' 'Oh, so you don't need the money?' 'I didn't say that. I said it has nothing to do with money.'</p> <p> 'So what's your problem, then?' </p> <p> 'You wouldn't understand.'</p> <p> 'No, you're right, I wouldn't. In fact, I can't think of any self-respecting professional anywhere in the world who would think what you've just thought!' </p> <p> 'I didn't mean it like that Look Niall Quinn has been my direct rival on this team for the last 14 years and although he has been the preferred choice for most of that time, I never considered myself inferior to him and always believed I could do as good a job for Ireland until last year, when for the first time ever I travelled to Dublin hoping I'd be named as a sub.' </p> <p> 'Why?' </p> <p> 'I'd gone. I'd lost it. I'd started the season well with Nancy and was still training hard but the years had finally caught up with me and I didn't want to let anyone in Ireland down. Niall is four years younger than me and playing better than ever. I'm happy to stay involved but in a supporting role.' </p> <p> 'So, it looks like you're in trouble, then?' </p> <p> 'How do you mean?' </p> <p> 'His neck injury sounds serious.' </p> <p> 'Yeah, I can't believe it! He seemed fine this morning.' </p> <p> 'Well, maybe he will be OK.' </p> <p> 'I hope so.'</p> <p> 'And maybe you'll get on for the last 20 minutes.' </p> <p> 'Yeah, that would be great.' </p> <p> 'And miss a sitter to win the game.' </p> <p> 'Clear off! Give me a break.' </p> <p> Think positive? Not me. I think negative. I have always been a negative person. I have always thought negative thoughts. For as long as I can remember, there has been a little voice in my head that highlights my weaknesses and undermines my confidence. When it comes to the art of shooting oneself in the foot, I have always been world class. I think too much during the games. Most players analyse performance after a game; not me: I do it all the wrong way - I think about how I'm playing as I play. Three bad passes and I'm glancing at the touchline</p> <p> 'Your number's up, Tony.' </p> <p> 'No it's not.' </p> <p> 'One more pass like that and it will be.' </p> <p> I've scored and played brilliantly one week and gone out and been awful the next, purely because some negative thought has hijacked me. I've tried to change and purge the doubt but it has always been in there, always been part of me. It was Graham Taylor at Aston Villa who noticed it first. He didn't know me from Adam when he signed me from Millwall, but within a few weeks he had identified my weakness. 'I want you to see a sports psychologist,' he said, one morning after training. 'You should be much more confident about who you are and what you want to be. I can't believe you're so negative in your approach.' A few weeks later he was offered the England job and I never followed it up. Would 'therapy' have made a difference? Perhaps, but I was quite immature at the time and wouldn't have been prepared to open up. We all know what happens in the psychiatrist's chair. Tell me about your childhood. What sort of a man was your dad? Tell me about the voice and when you first heard it. The prodding and probing of the secret corners; the paring away of the layers until your vulnerability is exposed </p> <p><strong>Hair today </strong></p> <p> (The Republic draw the game 1-1 and the team travels to Turkey for the return.)</p> <p> I've been dyeing my hair for as long as I can remember and make a point of presenting myself as smartly as possible when negotiating a contract. You wouldn't believe the difference a dye makes. Present yourself to the chairman in your naturally greying state and you're asking for trouble: 'Oh no, I'm not sure about this one. I don't think we'll get a year out of him.' But add a bit of colour to your roots and the contract is in the bag: 'Look at him, he's in great nick, I can't believe he's 36! He must really look after himself.' It's just an illusion but the illusion works. In football, it's not what you are but what you appear to be that counts.</p> <p> The colour costs four million Turkish lira, which seems a staggering amount to spend on your hair. (It's only \u00a34). I return to the hotel and after breakfast, slip upstairs and lock the door to the room. At a critical juncture of the process, there is a frantic rattle on the door. 'Open up, Cas,' Dave Connolly says, 'We're starting a game of cards.' Colouring your hair is not a done thing in football; you can bleach it, or shave it, but the rest is taboo. 'Sorry, Dave, I'll be out in a minute,' I lie. 'I'm just having a bath.' But Niall, who has just shaken himself from his nightly coma, immediately blows my cover. 'He's not in the bath at all,' he laughs. 'He's colouring his hair!' Within seconds, the phone is buzzing and a queue has formed at the door - 'come out, you big poof!' The ribbing continues at training and for the rest of the afternoon - a childish but welcome diversion in the on-going battle to stay sane</p> <p><strong>Home truths </strong></p> <p> I was 12 years old when I discovered what it is to be afraid. It happened on a cold afternoon in December when I was walking home to 10 Garden Cottages with my best friend Chris McCarthy. Christmas was coming and for weeks we had been working on a plan to make money from our fellow pupils at St Joseph's Secondary School. First we had compiled a shopping list of the things they most wanted for Christmas. Then today we had taken the bus to Orpington and nicked what was required. It was a no-lose situation. By selling the order at seriously reduced prices we were guaranteed a nice little earner. Delighted with a job well done, we had stashed the loot into two large plastic bags and had just started the climb at the bottom of our road when we happened to bump into my parents. Not part of the plan. My heart skipped a beat and I decided to bluff it out. 'Hi, Mum. Hi, Dad. Where're you off to, then?' Mum smiled. My father - no great surprise - was his usual crusty self. 'What's in the bags?' he snapped. 'Er nothing.' I panicked. It wasn't very convincing. My father took one of the bags and opened it and, without saying a word, handed it to Mum. The punch came from nowhere and spun me across the path. Stunned, I tried to find my bearings and catch a breath but everything was moving. A neighbour, Mr Choules, was staring across from his driveway in disbelief. Still shaking, I struggled to my feet and he hit me again. He thumped me as a man would thump another man. He booted and bombed me with every ounce of his strength for a hundred yards until we reached our house. Mum was pleading with him to stop but the battery didn't end until I reached my bedroom. Mum was worried that I was seriously hurt and sat with me for hours.</p> <p> I had lumps and bruises everywhere and ached all over as I lay on the bed but more acute than the pain was the stinging sensation of damp between my legs: I had wet myself We choose our friends, not our family. I never chose my Dad. My first tangible memory of him was a severe smacking when I was six or seven years old. I'm not sure what I did to deserve it, but then it never took much. My father was a crusty man with a volatile temper and he was almost always in a bad mood. As a boy, I didn't understand what bad moods were, but the knack of bringing out the worst in him seemed to come naturally. From the day I was born there seemed to be a chasm between us that widened the closer I became to my mother. I adored my mother and followed her constantly around the house as a boy but would never sit alone in the same room as a father who never hugged or kissed or showed me any affection. He wanted me to be like Mandy, spirited and fiery and confrontational, to be an Italian, a true Cascarino; but I just didn't have the testosterone. I was timid and docile and more an O'Malley by nature. A dreaded mummy's boy. </p> <p> When I was nine, he came to watch me playing football at school one afternoon. We were hammered 7-2 and he did nothing but shout at me all through the game. It was miserable. I could see all the other parents looking at him and towards the end I completely lost it and told him to give me a break. He brought me home and gave me a beating. He swore he would never come to watch me again and as ever was as good as his word. The experience left me physically and mentally scarred. The bruises quickly healed but the emotional wounds lingered. I performed poorly in school and generally lacked confidence. I wet the bed until I was 14 years old. The eruptions continued through my teenage years. I had a habit of lying on the carpet in front of the fire that used to really get up his nose. Incensed that I was 'blocking the heat for everyone else', he'd lash out with his boot and kick me in the back. One night, a few months after my seventeenth birthday, he did it for the last time. I'd spent the day labouring on a building site and had collapsed on the carpet in front of the TV. My father had also had a hard day and returned home even later. </p> <p> 'Get your arse away from the fire,' he roared. 'No, I'm not getting up,' I replied, instinctively. It wasn't planned. The words had already left my mouth when I realised I'd rebelled. I closed my eyes and braced myself for the inevitable. Nothing if not consistent, he jumped off the sofa and hoofed me in the ribs: 'I'm not going to tell you again, get your arse away from the fire.' Gasping as the air was toe-poked from my lungs, I coughed and spluttered and decided to hold my ground: 'No, not this time.' Enraged, he picked up a glass and flung it across the room. It shattered and stuck in my hand as I lifted my arm to protect myself. </p> <p> It would be easy to describe what happened next as that classic scene from the movies where the coward of the county breaks and shows the world he's a real man by unleashing 17 years of pent-up fury on the bastard who has cruelly abused him. But it wasn't like that. It wasn't like that at all. With blood gushing from my hand, I crossed the room to face him. We stood eye to eye and without saying a word, both understood he would never hit me again. And it was strange, but I felt no sense of joy or elation when it was over and the moment had passed. Just a sadness I couldn't fathom. </p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,391030,00.html\"> here</a> to read part 2.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nancy In The Morning I open my eyes to the sound of my hometown, Nancy, in the morning: the 7.43am for Paris pulling out slowly from the station; the hum of exhaust pipes on the avenue de la Garenne; an ambulance klaxoning moronically in the distance; heavy drops of rain rapping the bedroom window and beyond the white net curtain, the first sight of Nancy, an eternal grey sky, always the same. Virginia is sleeping. I reach out and nudge her gently and watch her blink and stretch and slowly stir to life. No words are exchanged between us as she pulls on her dressing gown and trudges towards the door. I lie with my thoughts and listen to the sound of Maeva being woken and coaxed into the bathroom: 'Allez, Maeva, c'est l'heure, ma cherie.' I pull back the sheets and swivel my legs on to the floor. My knee, as usual, has seized during the night. I run my fingers across the joint and feel the bone and cartilage grinding like a rusty old gate. The first step of the day is always the most painful. First, I lift my heel off the floor and flex my leg gently. Then, placing my hands on the side of the bed for the launch, I push forward, taking the weight on my left leg and hold the post of the bed for support. By the time I have limped from the wardrobe to the bathroom to the kitchen, I am almost walking normally. Virginia hands me a cup of tea. Maeva has breakfasted and is ready for school. My name is Tony Cascarino and I am 37 years old. I live with Maeva Cascarino and Virginia Masson on the third floor of an apartment block, a short walk from Nancy train station at 6 avenue de la Garenne. Madame Ginet, a mild-mannered teacher who sometimes teaches me French, lives in the apartment above. Monsieur Madaous, a bad-tempered sales rep who almost always acts like a prick (whenever Maeva is loud or I absentmindedly obstruct his parking space), lives in the apartment below. It is not, by any means, an exclusive development. We buy our groceries from the Codec store around the corner, drop our rubbish on the ground floor in a bin behind the lift and collect our post from wooden boxes bearing our names in the entrance hall. Most of the tenants are office workers, secretaries or tradesmen - ordinary people living ordinary lives well, maybe mine is a little different. I play football with Nancy FC. I have been a professional footballer since 1982, when I walked off a building site in London one afternoon and signed for a third division team called Gillingham. Before working on the building site, I spent two years cutting and styling women's hair. Professional football is a lot more fun than building or hairdressing. It also pays better and carries a lot more perks: we travel first-class, stay in the best hotels, eat the finest food, wear designer clothes, drive the fastest cars and never have to queue for surgeons, doctors or dentists. The game is good to us. The game is everything you dream it is: we are worshipped like pop stars, pampered and spoiled. But after 19 years, it begins to wear you down. Of late the sheer boredom of playing and training has been killing me. Sometimes, on the night before a game, I lie on the five-star bed in the five-star hotel and gaze at the five-star ceiling and it feels like a prison cell. But I still get anxious when the manager names the team. I still get excited when Saturday comes. My daughter, Maeva, is five years old. When she throws her arms around me and calls me 'Papa', it is easily the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. She was born in Nice in August 1995 at a time when I was married to another woman, living in another place and leading a deceitful double life. A day old when I sneaked away and saw her for the first time, she was aware of me for the first year of her life as the father who slept with her mother but never stayed the night. L'\u00c9cole Maternel de Notre-Dame is a 10-minute drive from the apartment. We take the lift to the ground floor and skip quickly through the rain to the car, where our warm breath soon mists the windscreen. 'On peut rien voir,' Maeva protests, as we join the queue on Avenue de la Garenne. 'I know, Mimi,' I reply. 'I've switched on the fan to clear it.' 'Ca marche pas, papa.' 'It will clear in a moment, Mimi. Sit back and put on your seat belt.' 'D'accord.' D'accord is French for OK. Maeva knows d'accord is French for OK and knows the English for pretty much everything she says but refuses to converse with me in anything but French I find a vacant space near the school on Rue de la Ravinelle and lead Maeva by the hand to the entrance. Other parents are dropping children off; from the look in their eye as we exchange 'bonjours', it is clear to me that they know who I am. The recognition is flattering. Although I have never felt that comfortable in the spotlight, one of the real satisfactions of my life these days is when Maeva comes home from school glowing because her dad has been mentioned in class. They call me 'Tony Goal' in these parts, which will probably sound absurd if you happen to follow football and live in Birmingham, Glasgow or London. But it's true. Only six other players can boast a better strike rate this season in the French first division. My name will ring a bell in every village Caf\u00e9 des Sports. But it is also true that when it comes to much of what happened before, I can offer little by way of defence. Ten years ago, in what seems another life, I moved from Millwall to Aston Villa, at a time when Villa were top of the league and closing on the championship. Brilliant since the start of the season, the team had started to falter in March and I was bought to supply the goals that would stave off Liverpool. I didn't score for seven games. Liverpool were champions. Villa finished runners-up. A year later, I moved from Villa to Celtic but the drought continued. One afternoon, I was out shopping with my pregnant wife and my son Michael when a supporter stopped me in the street and offered a critical assessment. 'You're fucking shit, you,' he hissed. 'You're a useless big bastard.' Glasgow is the world capital of tribal hatred and friends had warned me not to react when approached by Rangers fans, but this fellow was absolutely raving. 'You're a fucking wanker, a useless bastard.' 'Look, mate,' I pleaded, 'give me a break. Can't you see I'm with my wife and son?' 'You're fucking shit,' he said. 'And I'm a Celtic fan.' We moved to London six months later but the cataclysm continued at Chelsea. I was booed at Stamford Bridge on the day I made my debut, and then Michael came home from school one afternoon and inflicted the cruellest blow of all. The boys in his class had been talking about me. 'You're not very good, Dad, are you?' he said. How do you respond to something like that? What do you say to your six-year-old son? That his friends are wrong? That there's a lot more to the game than what they hear from their dads? What's your defence when you're 31 years old and your career is in freefall? There was nothing to do but swallow hard and resolve to make him proud. Six years have passed since I left England's shores and whenever I return, people who remember me as the lanky striker who used to play for Gillingham often stop me in the street and ask what I'm doing now. Unfortunately, the French sports daily L'Equipe doesn't sell that well in Chislehurst; I might as well be scoring goals on Mars. Usually, I'll fob them off with some yarn about retirement. How do I begin to explain my secret life? There is so much they would never understand. It is October and Nancy is cold and sad and grey, and over the next five months it won't change much. Take away the magnificence of the Place Stanislas and Nancy doesn't have a lot going for it. The people are decent but struggle to make a living. If it were England, it would be Barnsley. Heading west towards the suburb of Laxou, I take the A31 towards the training ground at For\u00eat de Haye. The manager has announced a double session today. Double sessions are murder when it's cold and wet and you've got bombed cartilage for a knee. I've had two cortisone injections already this season. For the past eight years I've taken anti-inflammatory pills before and after every game. The pills play havoc with my stomach and scorch my arse with diarrhoea but when the ball hits the back of the net and the crowd chants my name, it seems a small price to pay. How much longer can I keep paying? I don't know. There isn't a week that goes by these days when I don't ask myself that question, knowing the answer will always be the same. I play football because I have to play football. I play football because I know nothing else. On the first Friday of every month, the incentive to keep going is dropped through my letterbox in printed type: allowances and bonuses, taxes and fines, all listed in francs and centimes. I earn 160,000 francs a month playing for Nancy, which, depending on bonuses, translates to roughly \u00a38,000 a month after tax. Pretty much everything we spend is budgeted for these days - a sharp contrast to my youth, when the only figures that mattered were the goal-scoring stats. But you change as you get older: you worry about the future more. Last week, after another night spent tossing and turning, I sat down with a pen and paper and tried to figure it all out. 1982: Gillingham - \u00a39,200 1983: Gillingham - \u00a310,400 1984: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 1985: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 1986: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 1987: Gillingham/Millwall - \u00a320,800 1988: Millwall - \u00a323,400 1989: Millwall - \u00a326,000 1990: Millwall/Aston Villa - \u00a356,000 1991: Aston Villa/Celtic - \u00a371,500 1992: Celtic/Chelsea - \u00a378,000 1993: Chelsea - \u00a378,000 1994: Chelsea/Marseilles - \u00a3147,000 1995: Marseilles - \u00a3225,000 1996: Marseilles - \u00a3199,000 1997: Nancy - \u00a3126,000 1998: Nancy - \u00a398,400 1999: Nancy - \u00a3140,000 Approximate income from football since 1982: \u00a31,347,700 Bonus payments and sign-on fees since 1982: \u00a3967,000 Total career earnings since 1982: \u00a32,314,700 It was a sobering experience. Two point three million! Where the hell has it all gone? I mean, there are porters and plumbers and painters who win that on the Lottery and never have to work again. They buy a dream house and a dream car and take their holiday of a lifetime and never look back. They probably won't, it's fair to say, invest as heavily in their pension \u00a32,314,700 -\u00a3150,000 = \u00a32,164,700 and definitely won't, it's true to say, give 40 per cent away in tax \u00a32,164,700 -\u00a3870,040 = \u00a31,294,660 or get slapped with agents' fees \u00a31,294,660 -\u00a332,000 = \u00a31,262,660 They won't sign for Celtic and drop 35 grand in Birmingham because they bought just before the property crash \u00a31,262,660 -\u00a335,000 = \u00a31,227,660 but they may incur the unfortunate sting of divorce \u00a31,227,660 -\u00a3200,000 = \u00a31,027,660 with its maintenance payments that click like a taxi meter \u00a31,027,660 -\u00a324,000 = \u00a31,003,660 and school fees \u00a31,003,660 -\u00a318,000 = \u00a3985,660 not to mention the tip for the solicitors \u00a3985,660 -\u00a35,000 = \u00a3980,660 And when you add it all up, or rather take it all away, 900 grand is not a lot of jam when spread over what it costs to live for 18 years. And it certainly hasn't insured my happy-ever-afters. So you keep fighting the pain when you step out of bed each morning. And you keep taking the pills that rot your stomach and burn your arse. And you keep putting the dye in your hair and pretending you're 10 years younger. You survive. You do what you can. But on mornings like this when the rain is lashing the windscreen, it's hard. That Celtic fan who insulted me in Glasgow, the supporters at Stamford Bridge who derided me for fun - I wish they could have been there on the night I beat Juventus. I wish they could have heard the cheers of the most fanatical supporters in France. I wish they could have seen what I went on to. I swallowed hard. I turned it around. I tried to make Michael proud. Did I? Yes, I'd like to think I did. His mother, Sarah, is writing a novel at the moment. It's the story of a young woman who loves and loses and is forced to start again. The woman, who is also called Sarah, lives in a leafy suburb of London with her husband Eric and their two young sons. Eric is a professional footballer whose career is falling apart. Unwanted and unloved, he is on the verge of quitting the game when he is thrown a lifeline by a big club in France. They find a house in Aix-en-Provence and at first struggle to adapt but within months are embracing the joy of their new lives. For Eric, it's the discovery of what he knew he always had. For Sarah, it's the smell and feel of Provence and their new way of life. The boys settle, too, and seem happy at school. Sarah has never been as content. It's a new chapter. The chance to start again. And then, incredibly, it all falls apart It happens unexpectedly, on the evening of an international game in Dublin. Sarah has returned to London to spend a few days with her mum, when a friend, whose husband, like hers, also plays for the Republic of Ireland, suggests they take a late flight to Dublin to 'surprise the boys'. The game has ended when their flight from Gatwick touches down. They take a taxi to the team hotel and arrive to find their husbands celebrating with the manager and rest of the team in the bar. Eric seems pleased. He calls a porter and has her bags delivered to his room and suggests they go for a meal. They retire with their friends to the dining room. Sarah places her order and asks Eric for the key to the room. She enters the room and sits down to call her mum. There is nothing to worry about. Her precious boys are safely tucked in bed. She thanks her mum and swivels away from the desk, tipping over a small bin with her foot. A crumpled sheet of fax paper tumbles on to the carpet. She picks it up and is about to toss it back when curiosity tempts her to unravel it. The fax is from a woman. The woman is French. The woman is pregnant. The woman has just had a scan and is expecting a baby girl. Eric is about to become a father again. Shaking with rage, she storms back to the dining room and an embarrassing scene ensues. Eric pleads for calm and ushers his wife back to the room. Dismissing the affair as a brief encounter, he begs her forgiveness and promises never to see the other woman again. They return to France and after a few difficult weeks the relationship settles down and appears to return to normal. But behind Sarah's back, Eric continues to lie and cheat. One morning, after dropping the boys at school, she returns to find a note on the kitchen table. 'I'm sorry, Sarah. I know you will never understand but it was something I had to do. Eric.' She checks the bedroom: her husband has removed his clothes. She collapses on the bed in a flood of tears, shaking with grief and anger. The bastard! The cruel, spineless, swine! What is to become of them? Where will they live? How will she explain it to the boys? What breed of man uproots his family from everything they know and abandons them in a strange land? I'm not sure how the story ends or what Sarah intends to call the book when it's published. I'd like to think that, it being a work of fiction, any resemblance between its characters and real people is purely coincidental. I'd like to think that Michael will read it and never confuse Eric with his dad. I'd like to think he goes to school these days with the cuttings he gets from his nan and says 'Told you so' to his mates. I'd like to think he sleeps beneath my poster on his bedroom wall. I'd like to think he understands. But what I'd like to think and what I do think, are not the same. Little Voice (In November 1999 Cascarino was picked for the Republic of Ireland squad to play Turkey in a play-off for Euro 2000. By now a perennial substitute for the Republic Cascarino prepared for the game fully expecting his friend and room-mate Niall Quinn to be picked ahead of him.) The day runs smoothly until just before the pre-match meal, when I bump into Packie Bonner in the corridor. Packie, a friend and former team mate, is a member of the coaching staff. 'I don't think Niall is right,' he says, grimly. 'Get ready to play.' 'You're joking.' 'No, we've just had him down with Martin (the team doctor, Martin Walsh). They're talking about a painkiller before the game.' I continue on towards the dining room but feel the blood draining from my face. I think, 'Oh shit! I might be playing this game,' and within two seconds, the little voice is in my head 'You pathetic fucker, Cascarino!' 'What do you mean?' 'I heard what you thought.' 'No I' 'John from Mullingar was right, you're a fucking disgrace.' 'I didn't mean it like that. It just .slipped out.' 'The truth always does.' 'What truth?' 'You don't want to play.' 'Of course I want to play. I was out of bed at six the other morning to drive to Luxembourg; I'll be chewing anti-inflammatories for a week for this team! Why would I inflict that on myself if I didn't want to play?' 'Well, I can think of the \u00a3900 match fee for a start.' 'That's bollocks - it has nothing to do with the money.' 'Oh, so you don't need the money?' 'I didn't say that. I said it has nothing to do with money.' 'So what's your problem, then?' 'You wouldn't understand.' 'No, you're right, I wouldn't. In fact, I can't think of any self-respecting professional anywhere in the world who would think what you've just thought!' 'I didn't mean it like that Look Niall Quinn has been my direct rival on this team for the last 14 years and although he has been the preferred choice for most of that time, I never considered myself inferior to him and always believed I could do as good a job for Ireland until last year, when for the first time ever I travelled to Dublin hoping I'd be named as a sub.' 'Why?' 'I'd gone. I'd lost it. I'd started the season well with Nancy and was still training hard but the years had finally caught up with me and I didn't want to let anyone in Ireland down. Niall is four years younger than me and playing better than ever. I'm happy to stay involved but in a supporting role.' 'So, it looks like you're in trouble, then?' 'How do you mean?' 'His neck injury sounds serious.' 'Yeah, I can't believe it! He seemed fine this morning.' 'Well, maybe he will be OK.' 'I hope so.' 'And maybe you'll get on for the last 20 minutes.' 'Yeah, that would be great.' 'And miss a sitter to win the game.' 'Clear off! Give me a break.' Think positive? Not me. I think negative. I have always been a negative person. I have always thought negative thoughts. For as long as I can remember, there has been a little voice in my head that highlights my weaknesses and undermines my confidence. When it comes to the art of shooting oneself in the foot, I have always been world class. I think too much during the games. Most players analyse performance after a game; not me: I do it all the wrong way - I think about how I'm playing as I play. Three bad passes and I'm glancing at the touchline 'Your number's up, Tony.' 'No it's not.' 'One more pass like that and it will be.' I've scored and played brilliantly one week and gone out and been awful the next, purely because some negative thought has hijacked me. I've tried to change and purge the doubt but it has always been in there, always been part of me. It was Graham Taylor at Aston Villa who noticed it first. He didn't know me from Adam when he signed me from Millwall, but within a few weeks he had identified my weakness. 'I want you to see a sports psychologist,' he said, one morning after training. 'You should be much more confident about who you are and what you want to be. I can't believe you're so negative in your approach.' A few weeks later he was offered the England job and I never followed it up. Would 'therapy' have made a difference? Perhaps, but I was quite immature at the time and wouldn't have been prepared to open up. We all know what happens in the psychiatrist's chair. Tell me about your childhood. What sort of a man was your dad? Tell me about the voice and when you first heard it. The prodding and probing of the secret corners; the paring away of the layers until your vulnerability is exposed Hair today (The Republic draw the game 1-1 and the team travels to Turkey for the return.) I've been dyeing my hair for as long as I can remember and make a point of presenting myself as smartly as possible when negotiating a contract. You wouldn't believe the difference a dye makes. Present yourself to the chairman in your naturally greying state and you're asking for trouble: 'Oh no, I'm not sure about this one. I don't think we'll get a year out of him.' But add a bit of colour to your roots and the contract is in the bag: 'Look at him, he's in great nick, I can't believe he's 36! He must really look after himself.' It's just an illusion but the illusion works. In football, it's not what you are but what you appear to be that counts. The colour costs four million Turkish lira, which seems a staggering amount to spend on your hair. (It's only \u00a34). I return to the hotel and after breakfast, slip upstairs and lock the door to the room. At a critical juncture of the process, there is a frantic rattle on the door. 'Open up, Cas,' Dave Connolly says, 'We're starting a game of cards.' Colouring your hair is not a done thing in football; you can bleach it, or shave it, but the rest is taboo. 'Sorry, Dave, I'll be out in a minute,' I lie. 'I'm just having a bath.' But Niall, who has just shaken himself from his nightly coma, immediately blows my cover. 'He's not in the bath at all,' he laughs. 'He's colouring his hair!' Within seconds, the phone is buzzing and a queue has formed at the door - 'come out, you big poof!' The ribbing continues at training and for the rest of the afternoon - a childish but welcome diversion in the on-going battle to stay sane Home truths I was 12 years old when I discovered what it is to be afraid. It happened on a cold afternoon in December when I was walking home to 10 Garden Cottages with my best friend Chris McCarthy. Christmas was coming and for weeks we had been working on a plan to make money from our fellow pupils at St Joseph's Secondary School. First we had compiled a shopping list of the things they most wanted for Christmas. Then today we had taken the bus to Orpington and nicked what was required. It was a no-lose situation. By selling the order at seriously reduced prices we were guaranteed a nice little earner. Delighted with a job well done, we had stashed the loot into two large plastic bags and had just started the climb at the bottom of our road when we happened to bump into my parents. Not part of the plan. My heart skipped a beat and I decided to bluff it out. 'Hi, Mum. Hi, Dad. Where're you off to, then?' Mum smiled. My father - no great surprise - was his usual crusty self. 'What's in the bags?' he snapped. 'Er nothing.' I panicked. It wasn't very convincing. My father took one of the bags and opened it and, without saying a word, handed it to Mum. The punch came from nowhere and spun me across the path. Stunned, I tried to find my bearings and catch a breath but everything was moving. A neighbour, Mr Choules, was staring across from his driveway in disbelief. Still shaking, I struggled to my feet and he hit me again. He thumped me as a man would thump another man. He booted and bombed me with every ounce of his strength for a hundred yards until we reached our house. Mum was pleading with him to stop but the battery didn't end until I reached my bedroom. Mum was worried that I was seriously hurt and sat with me for hours. I had lumps and bruises everywhere and ached all over as I lay on the bed but more acute than the pain was the stinging sensation of damp between my legs: I had wet myself We choose our friends, not our family. I never chose my Dad. My first tangible memory of him was a severe smacking when I was six or seven years old. I'm not sure what I did to deserve it, but then it never took much. My father was a crusty man with a volatile temper and he was almost always in a bad mood. As a boy, I didn't understand what bad moods were, but the knack of bringing out the worst in him seemed to come naturally. From the day I was born there seemed to be a chasm between us that widened the closer I became to my mother. I adored my mother and followed her constantly around the house as a boy but would never sit alone in the same room as a father who never hugged or kissed or showed me any affection. He wanted me to be like Mandy, spirited and fiery and confrontational, to be an Italian, a true Cascarino; but I just didn't have the testosterone. I was timid and docile and more an O'Malley by nature. A dreaded mummy's boy. When I was nine, he came to watch me playing football at school one afternoon. We were hammered 7-2 and he did nothing but shout at me all through the game. It was miserable. I could see all the other parents looking at him and towards the end I completely lost it and told him to give me a break. He brought me home and gave me a beating. He swore he would never come to watch me again and as ever was as good as his word. The experience left me physically and mentally scarred. The bruises quickly healed but the emotional wounds lingered. I performed poorly in school and generally lacked confidence. I wet the bed until I was 14 years old. The eruptions continued through my teenage years. I had a habit of lying on the carpet in front of the fire that used to really get up his nose. Incensed that I was 'blocking the heat for everyone else', he'd lash out with his boot and kick me in the back. One night, a few months after my seventeenth birthday, he did it for the last time. I'd spent the day labouring on a building site and had collapsed on the carpet in front of the TV. My father had also had a hard day and returned home even later. 'Get your arse away from the fire,' he roared. 'No, I'm not getting up,' I replied, instinctively. It wasn't planned. The words had already left my mouth when I realised I'd rebelled. I closed my eyes and braced myself for the inevitable. Nothing if not consistent, he jumped off the sofa and hoofed me in the ribs: 'I'm not going to tell you again, get your arse away from the fire.' Gasping as the air was toe-poked from my lungs, I coughed and spluttered and decided to hold my ground: 'No, not this time.' Enraged, he picked up a glass and flung it across the room. It shattered and stuck in my hand as I lifted my arm to protect myself. It would be easy to describe what happened next as that classic scene from the movies where the coward of the county breaks and shows the world he's a real man by unleashing 17 years of pent-up fury on the bastard who has cruelly abused him. But it wasn't like that. It wasn't like that at all. With blood gushing from my hand, I crossed the room to face him. We stood eye to eye and without saying a word, both understood he would never hit me again. And it was strange, but I felt no sense of joy or elation when it was over and the moment had passed. Just a sadness I couldn't fathom. Click here to read part 2.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Shared pleasures</strong></p> <p>After six months of life as a professional, it was aspects of the life I had never considered that surprised me most. Before signing for Gillingham I had never, for example, roomed with another man. I had played with other men and showered with other men and dined with other men and sipped with other men and fought with other men, but I'd never actually shared a room with another man. I had shared a room with women, and shared a bed with women, and enjoyed every moment of it, but the act of sharing with another man, of breathing the same air and peeing in the same bowl and washing in the same basin and talking on the same telephone and watching the same TV and sleeping under the same ceiling with another man, a complete stranger, sometimes in the bed alongside was an alien experience. And one that took a lot of getting used to. </p> <p> Put yourselves in my shoes for a moment: you're 19 years old, have just signed for Gillingham Football Club and are about to discover the strange new world of playing away from home. You drive to Carlisle or Lincoln or Huddersfield on the eve of the game and step from the coach into the lobby of the team hotel where the physio has pinned beside the lift a list with all the rooms. You examine the list and discover you've been paired with Q, a first team regular you've trained with, but hardly spoken to before. Dinner is served in a function room downstairs. You sit listening to the banter around the table, then retire to the room to watch whatever Q fancies on TV before drifting off to sleep Before Q drifts off, that is. You, unfortunately, have always been a light sleeper and with every sense heightened, just the gentle whisper of his breathing is enough to keep you awake. And then he farts and begins to snore and you know the night will be long. You toss and turn into the early hours until the frustration finally exhausts you. When morning comes and you open your eyes, Q is staring at the ceiling with his finger up his nose and a wigwam in his bed. </p> <p> 'Morning Tone, sleep well?' he enquires, completely unabashed. </p> <p>'Yeah, great thanks, Q,' you lie. </p> <p>He casts off the sheets and walks bollock naked to the bathroom, defiantly parading his veiny sausage to the tune of Abba's 'Voulez-vous'. You shake your head in disbelief: 'This is the pits!' You've never seen an aroused penis before, except, obviously, your own. After a long and laborious pee that considerably lowers his mast, Q exits the bathroom, yawning and scratching his nuts, and makes for the bowl of fruit on the bedside table, unaware and unconcerned that two pubic hairs have dropped into the grapes. </p> <p>'Would you like some fruit?' he offers, extending the bowl.</p> <p>'No thanks,' you decline. </p> <p>Why, you wonder, didn't they warn you about this in Shoot?</p> <p>The real problem with sharing a room is that you never know who you are going to be lumbered with. As in the film Planes, Trains and Automobiles, there's always another nutcase waiting around the corner but after 18 years of smelly bastards, tight gits, sleepers, alcoholics, comedians, insomniacs, depressives, faithful husbands and serial adulterers, I can safely say I've had, and mostly enjoyed, them all. Rooming with Andy Townsend and Niall Quinn always reminded me of married life </p> <p>'You put the tea on, love, I'll get the biscuits.'</p> <p>'You sleep in that bed, love, I'll sleep in this one.' </p> <p>Throw your bag in the wrong place or leave a razor blade in the bath and you were always sure of a bollocking. Andy controlled the TV remote for the best part of 10 years! Niall used to nag me more than my wife. Bernie Slaven, another great character from my Ireland years, used to call his dog every night. I'd be sitting in the bed alongside and Bernie would be howling like Lassie into the phone 'Woof, woof, aru, aru, woof!' He'd be kissing the receiver and lavishing affection - 'Hello, lovey dovey' - on a dog! The first time it happened, I nearly wet myself and told him he was completely mad. Bernie, being Bernie, just laughed. </p> <p><strong>French correction</strong></p> <p> (In 1994, having been routinely derided by the fans of Celtic and Chelsea, Cascarino joined Olympique Marseille, the biggest club in France. OM had just been relegated to the Second Division after the match-fixing scandal surrounding club president Bernard Tapie. They signed Cascarino because they were banned from making transfers and he was available on a free.)</p> <p> Although Marc Bourier was officially the team manager, Bernard Tapie did all the talking before the game and toured the dressing room slapping us on the back and lunging at us with grunts and hoisted testicles. 'The demotion to the second division,' he announced, 'was a crushing blow for everyone in Marseilles, but it was also an opportunity to montrer les couilles (to show we had balls).' But when the game kicked off we had the worst possible start and conceded a goal after just two minutes. </p> <p>Urged forward by chants of 'Allez OM', for the next 20 minutes we battled for an equaliser until Marc Libbra was felled in the box and awarded a penalty. As Jean-Marc Ferreri, the team's designated penalty kicker, walked towards the ball and scooped it into his hands, I'm not sure what came over me but suddenly I was standing beside him. 'This is mine,' I said, seizing the ball from his hands. I walked forward and placed it on the spot. </p> <p>'What the fuck are you doing, Cass?'</p> <p>'I'm having it. This is mine.' </p> <p>'Whaaat? Are you out of your fucking mind? </p> <p>'No, it's the perfect opportunity to make a positive start.'</p> <p>'Oh yeah? What if you miss? Thought about that? Take a look at that bloke with no shirt behind the goal. Listen to those headbangers he's winding up! They make the mob from the Shed look like sheep. You'll be crucified if you miss.' </p> <p>'I don't care.'</p> <p>'What do you mean, you don't care? For fuck's sake, Cass, what are you saying? Look, you're taking this \"proud to be Marseillais\" bollocks too far. You'll be grabbing your nuts next! Dipping croissants in your coffee! Kissing your team mates before training! Saying ooh la fucking la! You're not Marseillais! You're from St Paul's Cray remember? You're the boy who pissed in his pants, the big clumsy bastard who used to hide at Celtic and Chelsea! Have you forgotten Neville Southall and the groans of the crowd?' </p> <p>'Things are going to be different here.'</p> <p>'Yeah? Don't make me laugh!'</p> <p>'No, I'm serious, it's shit or bust from now on. I'm going to think like a selfish bastard; I'm going to shoot every time I get a sniff at goal; I'm going to think and play uniquely for myself. I'm going to show them back in England. I'm going to shove it up their arse!'</p> <p>I smashed it by the keeper into the back of the net. A week later, we travelled to Brittany for our second game of the season at Saint Brieuc. It was a tough, physical encounter that looked set to end in stalemate until six minutes to go, when we were awarded another penalty. Unopposed on this occasion, I smashed it by the keeper again for my second goal of the season. Our third game was away to Nancy and after 15 minutes, I put us in front with a screaming volley that found the top corner of the net from 25 yards. Growing in confidence with every game, I made it four from four with the winner against Ales and five from five to earn a draw at Guingamp. Our sixth game of the season was a friendly at home to Juventus. Tapie was like a lunatic in the dressing room. The game was being transmitted live on Eurosport and because Juventus were Juventus and Marseilles were an ageing, makeshift, second-division team, he was afraid we were going to get tanked. I wasn't. I wasn't afraid of anything. Sent out to face the German international Jurgen Kohler, I ran him ragged and scored both goals in our 2-0 win. Kohler shook my hand when the game was over. Four months earlier, we had played against each other in a friendly international in Hamburg. 'You're not the same guy I played last time,' he smiled, as we walked towards the tunnel. How right he was. I was fitter, faster and stronger. I was three quarters of a stone lighter. I was confident. I believed. I was fier d'\u00eatre Marseillais. </p> <p><strong>The territory of lies</strong></p> <p> I did not want my marriage to fail. I know too much about failure. I had watched my parents' marriage fail, had failed for long periods of my football career and was determined to stick it out rather than fail again. By the summer of '94, our marriage certainly wasn't succeeding; I was cheating on Sarah at every opportunity; we had argued bitterly at the World Cup; and the only thing uniting our families was mutual contempt. The move to Marseilles had come at just the right time. It was a chance to clean the slate, to start again. </p> <p> A week after my meeting with Tapie, Sarah arrived with the boys. We stayed at the Palm Beach Hotel until the Thursday before the opening game of the season, when we decided to take a trip to Cannes to meet Andy Townsend and his wife, Jackie, who had just arrived on a week's holiday. They checked in for a night in a fancy hotel on the Boulevard de la Croissette, and after securing a babysitter to watch the boys, we booked a table for four in a brasserie beside the hotel. </p> <p> It was one of those classic, balmy, summer nights when it feels good to be alive. Sarah and Jackie have always got on well and as Andy and I had not seen each other since the end of the World Cup, there was loads to gossip about. At midnight, after a really nice meal, Sarah suggested we move on to a nightclub. </p> <p>'I can't stay out,' I said, 'I've got a game on Saturday.'</p> <p>Sarah was disappointed. She had switched into party girl mode and when Sarah was in party girl mode she ignored all the red lights. </p> <p>Andy tried to be as diplomatic as possible. 'Come on, be fair, Sarah. He can't! It's his first big game! It's important he makes a good start!' </p> <p>Sarah wasn't having it. She kept pegging away 'It's got nothing to do with the game' kept pushing out the envelope 'It's always the bloody same.' further and further 'He's just a boring bastard.' and she had gone over the edge. </p> <p> I had been called worse things in my time, but none had ever hurt as much or popped as big a fuse in my head. I thought I was going to explode. Andy and Jackie, who had been circling the table like firefighters, were running out of water to douse the flames. We paid the bill and stepped outside and I walked on ahead with Andy towards the hotel. A cool sea breeze was blowing gently across the boulevard but it wasn't cool enough: 'I could fucking kill her,' I spat. 'Calm down,' he urged. 'She's just had a few drinks. Just go to bed and forget about it.' There was no chance of that. I was walking quicker now. I couldn't wait to get back to the room, close the door and shut out the world so it was just me and her. Alone. </p> <p> 'You fucking bastard.'</p> <p>'You fucking cow.'</p> <p>'You're fucking loathsome.' </p> <p>'I fucking hate you.'</p> <p>I'm not sure how long we had been screaming when Michael poked his head through the door. And can't really explain why his frightened little face didn't bring us to our knees. It's just the way rage envelopes you, I suppose; short-circuiting your brain, numbing your senses, taking control so that nothing else matters. And in the early hours of that summer morning in Cannes, nothing else - not Michael's living nightmare, not my first game for Marseille, not anything in the world - mattered but retribution from Sarah, making the bitch pay. </p> <p>'I didn't have a job three weeks ago!' I fumed. 'I've been training my bollocks off, trying to secure a fucking future for us all, but all that interests you is having fucking fun!'</p> <p>I reached out and shoved her on to the bed. She bounced straight back and fronted me again. She was like a pit bull; she kept biting back: 'Don't you touch me, you boring fucking bastard!' I wanted to kill her. I wanted to drive my fist into the middle of her face. The rage began to scare me. I actually did want to kill her. I actually did want to punch her, as I had once been punched. Is this what happens when you grow up with violence? I made a conscious effort to calm down. What on earth was happening to me? I took a sheet and pillow to the bathroom and decided to make a bed.</p> <p> A few hours later, we breakfasted together and it was as if nothing had ever happened. </p> <p>'Morning,' she chirped. 'All right? Funny last night, wasn't it?' </p> <p>It was typical Sarah. She genuinely didn't believe we had a problem, was fully prepared to carry on as if nothing had been said. I wasn't. My sense of humour had gone. I had been doing a lot of thinking in the bath. </p> <p>'I'm going to leave you, Sarah,' I said.</p> <p>'Shaaat-up,' she said. 'It was nothing.'</p> <p>But I was never as sure of anything in my life.</p> <p>[Soon after this row Cascarino began an affair with Virginie Masson (Virginia) then a 20-year-old law student. She became pregnant, but the situation became messily complicated with Cascarino remaining with his wife and two sons when Virginia gave birth to their daughter. From then the situation just got worse.]</p> <p> Virginia moved back to her apartment in Marseilles. Her mother stayed for a while but it didn't take long before the reality of single motherhood began to bite. The next few months were a lonely and depressing time. I continued to visit regularly but they were only ever visits and not nearly as exciting as before. There were no romantic dinners or nipping around for a quickie: just tears and fatigue and nappies caked in shite. Our relationship began to come under strain and had deteriorated so much by Christmas that I was actually getting on better with my wife. I wanted to be with Virginia but couldn't leave Sarah and the boys. And for months it continued until the summer of '96, when Virginia finally decided she had taken enough. She was leaving for Normandy to spend some time with her father. There would be no more lies.</p> <p> My mother remarried on Saturday, 8 June. I phoned Virginia from the reception but for the first time since we had met, two years earlier, she was refusing to answer my calls. The following morning, I jumped into a car and disappeared for five days until Thursday evening, when I called Sarah. </p> <p> 'What have you been doing? Why didn't you call? I've been worrying about you for days!' </p> <p>'I'm in Normandy,' I said. 'I've been with Virginia and Maeva all week. I couldn't call for the obvious reason that I didn't want to upset you.'</p> <p> We arranged to meet in Marseilles on Sunday. There was an initial heated argument and then things calmed for a few days, when we talked it through again and she asked me what I wanted to do. I wanted to leave. I wanted to take a chance with Virginia but I didn't have the courage to say it to her face. And I couldn't bear to leave the boys with an image of their dad walking out of the door with his bags. So I told her I was confused and needed a day to work it out, and she obliged the next morning and took the kids out of the house.</p> <p>'See you later, Tony.'</p> <p>'Bye, Dad.'</p> <p>I waited 30 minutes before packing a sports bag with some clothes, then sat down at the kitchen table to write a note. </p> <p>Sarah, I'm sorry. It's something I had to do. I know you will never understand. Tony.</p> <p>If there is one day I could change, one day I could retrieve and rewrite, it is that one. Sarah deserved better. It was a spineless way to go.</p> <p><strong>Full Time</strong></p> <p> [After two and a half years at OM Cascarino moved to a smaller French club, Nancy.]</p> <p> Nancy has been good for us. Better than we ever imagined. When we first arrived, a lot of supporters were sceptical, believing that I had just signed for the money and would just sit out my time, but I scored a hat-trick - my first in Division One - in my second game and played so well for the remainder of the season that Gili was hammered in Marseilles for letting me go. For the last two seasons, I have continued to give my best for the club and tonight, in recognition, I was awarded the Medaille D'Or - the highest honour the city can bestow - at a champagne reception in the city hall. It was lovely. Virginia's family are from Nancy and it was a great honour to join a list of previous recipients that included the city's favourite son, Michel Platini. All the team were present: I was showered with tributes from every angle and was so overcome that I almost lost it in my acceptance speech, when I announced that 'the perfect ending for me would be to score the goals on Saturday that kept Nancy in Division One'. I'm not sure that Jacques Rousselot, the club president was listening. At the end of the evening, he asked me to rip up my contract and stay for another season. I thanked him for the offer but refused.</p> <p> The contract to which he was referring is the one I signed committing me next season to Red Star, a third division team in Paris. OK. I know. How can a 37-year-old pro who has made 88 appearances for his country, played in two World Cups and spent the last 16 chapters moaning about the state of his knee, how much he misses his boys and how badly he wants to quit even consider another year? Never mind another year at a club where the average gate is 600 people! Fear is how. Desperation is how. Money is how. What other job was going to pay me as well? What else was I qualified to do? </p> <p><strong>Postscript</strong></p> <p>On 19 August 2000, Tony Cascarino terminated his contract with Red Star and announced his retirement after being substituted in only his second game of the season: 'The team were an absolute disaster.' A week later, Nancy made him an offer to return. He refused.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shared pleasures After six months of life as a professional, it was aspects of the life I had never considered that surprised me most. Before signing for Gillingham I had never, for example, roomed with another man. I had played with other men and showered with other men and dined with other men and sipped with other men and fought with other men, but I'd never actually shared a room with another man. I had shared a room with women, and shared a bed with women, and enjoyed every moment of it, but the act of sharing with another man, of breathing the same air and peeing in the same bowl and washing in the same basin and talking on the same telephone and watching the same TV and sleeping under the same ceiling with another man, a complete stranger, sometimes in the bed alongside was an alien experience. And one that took a lot of getting used to. Put yourselves in my shoes for a moment: you're 19 years old, have just signed for Gillingham Football Club and are about to discover the strange new world of playing away from home. You drive to Carlisle or Lincoln or Huddersfield on the eve of the game and step from the coach into the lobby of the team hotel where the physio has pinned beside the lift a list with all the rooms. You examine the list and discover you've been paired with Q, a first team regular you've trained with, but hardly spoken to before. Dinner is served in a function room downstairs. You sit listening to the banter around the table, then retire to the room to watch whatever Q fancies on TV before drifting off to sleep Before Q drifts off, that is. You, unfortunately, have always been a light sleeper and with every sense heightened, just the gentle whisper of his breathing is enough to keep you awake. And then he farts and begins to snore and you know the night will be long. You toss and turn into the early hours until the frustration finally exhausts you. When morning comes and you open your eyes, Q is staring at the ceiling with his finger up his nose and a wigwam in his bed. 'Morning Tone, sleep well?' he enquires, completely unabashed. 'Yeah, great thanks, Q,' you lie. He casts off the sheets and walks bollock naked to the bathroom, defiantly parading his veiny sausage to the tune of Abba's 'Voulez-vous'. You shake your head in disbelief: 'This is the pits!' You've never seen an aroused penis before, except, obviously, your own. After a long and laborious pee that considerably lowers his mast, Q exits the bathroom, yawning and scratching his nuts, and makes for the bowl of fruit on the bedside table, unaware and unconcerned that two pubic hairs have dropped into the grapes. 'Would you like some fruit?' he offers, extending the bowl. 'No thanks,' you decline. Why, you wonder, didn't they warn you about this in Shoot? The real problem with sharing a room is that you never know who you are going to be lumbered with. As in the film Planes, Trains and Automobiles, there's always another nutcase waiting around the corner but after 18 years of smelly bastards, tight gits, sleepers, alcoholics, comedians, insomniacs, depressives, faithful husbands and serial adulterers, I can safely say I've had, and mostly enjoyed, them all. Rooming with Andy Townsend and Niall Quinn always reminded me of married life 'You put the tea on, love, I'll get the biscuits.' 'You sleep in that bed, love, I'll sleep in this one.' Throw your bag in the wrong place or leave a razor blade in the bath and you were always sure of a bollocking. Andy controlled the TV remote for the best part of 10 years! Niall used to nag me more than my wife. Bernie Slaven, another great character from my Ireland years, used to call his dog every night. I'd be sitting in the bed alongside and Bernie would be howling like Lassie into the phone 'Woof, woof, aru, aru, woof!' He'd be kissing the receiver and lavishing affection - 'Hello, lovey dovey' - on a dog! The first time it happened, I nearly wet myself and told him he was completely mad. Bernie, being Bernie, just laughed. French correction (In 1994, having been routinely derided by the fans of Celtic and Chelsea, Cascarino joined Olympique Marseille, the biggest club in France. OM had just been relegated to the Second Division after the match-fixing scandal surrounding club president Bernard Tapie. They signed Cascarino because they were banned from making transfers and he was available on a free.) Although Marc Bourier was officially the team manager, Bernard Tapie did all the talking before the game and toured the dressing room slapping us on the back and lunging at us with grunts and hoisted testicles. 'The demotion to the second division,' he announced, 'was a crushing blow for everyone in Marseilles, but it was also an opportunity to montrer les couilles (to show we had balls).' But when the game kicked off we had the worst possible start and conceded a goal after just two minutes. Urged forward by chants of 'Allez OM', for the next 20 minutes we battled for an equaliser until Marc Libbra was felled in the box and awarded a penalty. As Jean-Marc Ferreri, the team's designated penalty kicker, walked towards the ball and scooped it into his hands, I'm not sure what came over me but suddenly I was standing beside him. 'This is mine,' I said, seizing the ball from his hands. I walked forward and placed it on the spot. 'What the fuck are you doing, Cass?' 'I'm having it. This is mine.' 'Whaaat? Are you out of your fucking mind? 'No, it's the perfect opportunity to make a positive start.' 'Oh yeah? What if you miss? Thought about that? Take a look at that bloke with no shirt behind the goal. Listen to those headbangers he's winding up! They make the mob from the Shed look like sheep. You'll be crucified if you miss.' 'I don't care.' 'What do you mean, you don't care? For fuck's sake, Cass, what are you saying? Look, you're taking this \"proud to be Marseillais\" bollocks too far. You'll be grabbing your nuts next! Dipping croissants in your coffee! Kissing your team mates before training! Saying ooh la fucking la! You're not Marseillais! You're from St Paul's Cray remember? You're the boy who pissed in his pants, the big clumsy bastard who used to hide at Celtic and Chelsea! Have you forgotten Neville Southall and the groans of the crowd?' 'Things are going to be different here.' 'Yeah? Don't make me laugh!' 'No, I'm serious, it's shit or bust from now on. I'm going to think like a selfish bastard; I'm going to shoot every time I get a sniff at goal; I'm going to think and play uniquely for myself. I'm going to show them back in England. I'm going to shove it up their arse!' I smashed it by the keeper into the back of the net. A week later, we travelled to Brittany for our second game of the season at Saint Brieuc. It was a tough, physical encounter that looked set to end in stalemate until six minutes to go, when we were awarded another penalty. Unopposed on this occasion, I smashed it by the keeper again for my second goal of the season. Our third game was away to Nancy and after 15 minutes, I put us in front with a screaming volley that found the top corner of the net from 25 yards. Growing in confidence with every game, I made it four from four with the winner against Ales and five from five to earn a draw at Guingamp. Our sixth game of the season was a friendly at home to Juventus. Tapie was like a lunatic in the dressing room. The game was being transmitted live on Eurosport and because Juventus were Juventus and Marseilles were an ageing, makeshift, second-division team, he was afraid we were going to get tanked. I wasn't. I wasn't afraid of anything. Sent out to face the German international Jurgen Kohler, I ran him ragged and scored both goals in our 2-0 win. Kohler shook my hand when the game was over. Four months earlier, we had played against each other in a friendly international in Hamburg. 'You're not the same guy I played last time,' he smiled, as we walked towards the tunnel. How right he was. I was fitter, faster and stronger. I was three quarters of a stone lighter. I was confident. I believed. I was fier d'\u00eatre Marseillais. The territory of lies I did not want my marriage to fail. I know too much about failure. I had watched my parents' marriage fail, had failed for long periods of my football career and was determined to stick it out rather than fail again. By the summer of '94, our marriage certainly wasn't succeeding; I was cheating on Sarah at every opportunity; we had argued bitterly at the World Cup; and the only thing uniting our families was mutual contempt. The move to Marseilles had come at just the right time. It was a chance to clean the slate, to start again. A week after my meeting with Tapie, Sarah arrived with the boys. We stayed at the Palm Beach Hotel until the Thursday before the opening game of the season, when we decided to take a trip to Cannes to meet Andy Townsend and his wife, Jackie, who had just arrived on a week's holiday. They checked in for a night in a fancy hotel on the Boulevard de la Croissette, and after securing a babysitter to watch the boys, we booked a table for four in a brasserie beside the hotel. It was one of those classic, balmy, summer nights when it feels good to be alive. Sarah and Jackie have always got on well and as Andy and I had not seen each other since the end of the World Cup, there was loads to gossip about. At midnight, after a really nice meal, Sarah suggested we move on to a nightclub. 'I can't stay out,' I said, 'I've got a game on Saturday.' Sarah was disappointed. She had switched into party girl mode and when Sarah was in party girl mode she ignored all the red lights. Andy tried to be as diplomatic as possible. 'Come on, be fair, Sarah. He can't! It's his first big game! It's important he makes a good start!' Sarah wasn't having it. She kept pegging away 'It's got nothing to do with the game' kept pushing out the envelope 'It's always the bloody same.' further and further 'He's just a boring bastard.' and she had gone over the edge. I had been called worse things in my time, but none had ever hurt as much or popped as big a fuse in my head. I thought I was going to explode. Andy and Jackie, who had been circling the table like firefighters, were running out of water to douse the flames. We paid the bill and stepped outside and I walked on ahead with Andy towards the hotel. A cool sea breeze was blowing gently across the boulevard but it wasn't cool enough: 'I could fucking kill her,' I spat. 'Calm down,' he urged. 'She's just had a few drinks. Just go to bed and forget about it.' There was no chance of that. I was walking quicker now. I couldn't wait to get back to the room, close the door and shut out the world so it was just me and her. Alone. 'You fucking bastard.' 'You fucking cow.' 'You're fucking loathsome.' 'I fucking hate you.' I'm not sure how long we had been screaming when Michael poked his head through the door. And can't really explain why his frightened little face didn't bring us to our knees. It's just the way rage envelopes you, I suppose; short-circuiting your brain, numbing your senses, taking control so that nothing else matters. And in the early hours of that summer morning in Cannes, nothing else - not Michael's living nightmare, not my first game for Marseille, not anything in the world - mattered but retribution from Sarah, making the bitch pay. 'I didn't have a job three weeks ago!' I fumed. 'I've been training my bollocks off, trying to secure a fucking future for us all, but all that interests you is having fucking fun!' I reached out and shoved her on to the bed. She bounced straight back and fronted me again. She was like a pit bull; she kept biting back: 'Don't you touch me, you boring fucking bastard!' I wanted to kill her. I wanted to drive my fist into the middle of her face. The rage began to scare me. I actually did want to kill her. I actually did want to punch her, as I had once been punched. Is this what happens when you grow up with violence? I made a conscious effort to calm down. What on earth was happening to me? I took a sheet and pillow to the bathroom and decided to make a bed. A few hours later, we breakfasted together and it was as if nothing had ever happened. 'Morning,' she chirped. 'All right? Funny last night, wasn't it?' It was typical Sarah. She genuinely didn't believe we had a problem, was fully prepared to carry on as if nothing had been said. I wasn't. My sense of humour had gone. I had been doing a lot of thinking in the bath. 'I'm going to leave you, Sarah,' I said. 'Shaaat-up,' she said. 'It was nothing.' But I was never as sure of anything in my life. [Soon after this row Cascarino began an affair with Virginie Masson (Virginia) then a 20-year-old law student. She became pregnant, but the situation became messily complicated with Cascarino remaining with his wife and two sons when Virginia gave birth to their daughter. From then the situation just got worse.] Virginia moved back to her apartment in Marseilles. Her mother stayed for a while but it didn't take long before the reality of single motherhood began to bite. The next few months were a lonely and depressing time. I continued to visit regularly but they were only ever visits and not nearly as exciting as before. There were no romantic dinners or nipping around for a quickie: just tears and fatigue and nappies caked in shite. Our relationship began to come under strain and had deteriorated so much by Christmas that I was actually getting on better with my wife. I wanted to be with Virginia but couldn't leave Sarah and the boys. And for months it continued until the summer of '96, when Virginia finally decided she had taken enough. She was leaving for Normandy to spend some time with her father. There would be no more lies. My mother remarried on Saturday, 8 June. I phoned Virginia from the reception but for the first time since we had met, two years earlier, she was refusing to answer my calls. The following morning, I jumped into a car and disappeared for five days until Thursday evening, when I called Sarah. 'What have you been doing? Why didn't you call? I've been worrying about you for days!' 'I'm in Normandy,' I said. 'I've been with Virginia and Maeva all week. I couldn't call for the obvious reason that I didn't want to upset you.' We arranged to meet in Marseilles on Sunday. There was an initial heated argument and then things calmed for a few days, when we talked it through again and she asked me what I wanted to do. I wanted to leave. I wanted to take a chance with Virginia but I didn't have the courage to say it to her face. And I couldn't bear to leave the boys with an image of their dad walking out of the door with his bags. So I told her I was confused and needed a day to work it out, and she obliged the next morning and took the kids out of the house. 'See you later, Tony.' 'Bye, Dad.' I waited 30 minutes before packing a sports bag with some clothes, then sat down at the kitchen table to write a note. Sarah, I'm sorry. It's something I had to do. I know you will never understand. Tony. If there is one day I could change, one day I could retrieve and rewrite, it is that one. Sarah deserved better. It was a spineless way to go. Full Time [After two and a half years at OM Cascarino moved to a smaller French club, Nancy.] Nancy has been good for us. Better than we ever imagined. When we first arrived, a lot of supporters were sceptical, believing that I had just signed for the money and would just sit out my time, but I scored a hat-trick - my first in Division One - in my second game and played so well for the remainder of the season that Gili was hammered in Marseilles for letting me go. For the last two seasons, I have continued to give my best for the club and tonight, in recognition, I was awarded the Medaille D'Or - the highest honour the city can bestow - at a champagne reception in the city hall. It was lovely. Virginia's family are from Nancy and it was a great honour to join a list of previous recipients that included the city's favourite son, Michel Platini. All the team were present: I was showered with tributes from every angle and was so overcome that I almost lost it in my acceptance speech, when I announced that 'the perfect ending for me would be to score the goals on Saturday that kept Nancy in Division One'. I'm not sure that Jacques Rousselot, the club president was listening. At the end of the evening, he asked me to rip up my contract and stay for another season. I thanked him for the offer but refused. The contract to which he was referring is the one I signed committing me next season to Red Star, a third division team in Paris. OK. I know. How can a 37-year-old pro who has made 88 appearances for his country, played in two World Cups and spent the last 16 chapters moaning about the state of his knee, how much he misses his boys and how badly he wants to quit even consider another year? Never mind another year at a club where the average gate is 600 people! Fear is how. Desperation is how. Money is how. What other job was going to pay me as well? What else was I qualified to do? Postscript On 19 August 2000, Tony Cascarino terminated his contract with Red Star and announced his retirement after being substituted in only his second game of the season: 'The team were an absolute disaster.' A week later, Nancy made him an offer to return. He refused.",

      "body": "<p>Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson arrived in England for an early-morning press conference and the red-carpet treatment last week. For a product of Sweden, a country biliously characterised by the Daily Mail as a nation of skiers and hammer throwers who spend half their lives in darkness, he taught the English a few things about the straight, defensive blocking shot. </p> <p>England's new manager spent his first hour in the job knocking back the probing questions and leaving the wider deliveries alone. He breezed through that first encounter with English journalists, who ranged from the supportive and inquisitive to the downright abusive, telling them, 'I'll talk about England the day I start work.' But when will that day be? It could be months before his first opportunity to make an impression on the players. Honeymoon period? There may not be one and, as one commentator drily observed, there can be no honeymoon until Eriksson and England are wedded. So Eriksson's guard is up and he is staying on the defensive. </p> <p>'In Italy, the press are more interested in my technique and tactics as a football trainer than is apparent in the English press,' he told Swedish journalists yesterday. 'There the interest is in my private life. They have already tried to contact my girlfriend Nancy Dall'Olio and tried to visit my son Johan in America; my brother Lars and his wife Agnetha in Portugal; my father and my mother in Torsby and my ex-wife Ann-Christine in Florence. I have not seen Ann-Christine for five or six years so what they might expect she would have to say is something of a mystery. It leaves me with a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach.' </p> <p>And the real fun has not even begun. If Eriksson struggles to win on the pitch and win over the critics off it, the glare of the media spotlight will burn hotter than the southern European sun Eriksson has become accustomed to in recent years. Even in Rome, in charge of Lazio, he has struggled at times with the Italian press. </p> <p>'The journalists can be really nasty in Italy. I spent three years with Roma and three with Lazio and one of them criticised me at every possible opportunity and coined the expression \"Eriksson is a successful loser\", which other papers picked up. So it was a small revenge for me after Lazio won the Scudetto (league title) earlier this year and he went down on his knees and begged me to forgive him,' Eriksson said. </p> <p>Now all he has to do is convince those doubters in the English pack, especially those who, like the Daily Mail, continue to hold a torch for Terry Venables and who predictably railed against the Dagenham cheeky chappie's latest snub last week. </p> <p>But not for Eriksson the Venables way of schmoozing with the media. He does not indulge in football analysis on TV. He will co-operate with the media; answer their questions and drop the odd quip. Much more is not readily on offer. </p> <p>Indeed recently in Italy a media blackout was imposed at Lazio. Not by Eriksson but by president Sergio Cragnotti, angered by what was perceived as exaggerated reports on racial abuse aimed at Arsenal players during the recent Champions League game in Rome. There can be no such defensive mechanism used by the FA and their coach once both move into their new HQ in Soho Square. </p> <p>But those close to Eriksson say he has the toughness and ability to deal with adversaries. </p> <p>That applies to players, too. Clearly there was concern at basic failings in the Kevin Keegan regime even before the revelations about England's gambling culture which surfaced in the last few days. That Eriksson will stamp out such activity has already been made clear. What might surprise some of the England players is the severity with which the Swede can act. </p> <p>'He can be as hard as nails,' one of his former Sampdoria players said. 'He is mild mannered but firm, but you couldn't describe him as a man's man in the English sense. He doesn't go in for hard drinking and I have never seen him drunk or out of control. He is as straight as they come and won't stand for anything that might cause disharmony or disunity in his squads.' </p> <p>Bryan King, the former Coventry and Millwall goalkeeper, has known Eriksson since the mid-Eighties and has worked and scouted for him. He said: 'Sven-G\u00f6ran is a hands-on coach and the England players will know who is the boss. He will run the show - although he will have a team of top coaches around him. He'll talk and eat with the players but he won't socialise with them. There will be a clear divide. </p> <p>'When I was manager of Falkenberg in Norway in the early Nineties he brought Benfica to us for two weeks and I saw him close-up. He is very impressive; very clear, very methodical. He's hot on punctuality and won't suffer fools gladly. Remember he's been dealing with some of Europe's top players for almost two decades. Even in the early Nineties, he demanded the right diet for his team, the right food and drink. At the time, it would have brought an outcry from English players. Now they'll be more accepting.' </p> <p>Last Thursday, the only question to get past his guard was one about his international ambitions. Would he consider being manager of Brazil? 'Maybe only Brazil,' he said. 'It is a big, big job to be manager of England, Brazil might be the only team to compete.' There's something the FA has never had to worry about before. England have lost managers in a variety of ways down the years, even some of their successful ones, but the possibility of their top man being head-hunted from Rio is new. </p> <p>His guard was less disciplined at home in Sweden where he was asked about taking over England at a time when the national side was troubled. And what about managing his own country? Eriksson replied: 'Results over the last few years have proved that the Swedes are better than the English but in prestige terms, the England job is fantastic. I certainly do not think English football is bad. Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds have all acquitted themselves well in Europe and the under-21 side has been functioning very well, so I see a bright future for English football and the national team.' </p> <p>So will Eriksson be given a fair chance by some of his fiercer critics, in and out of the press? An early guess is that, just as Arsenal discovered with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, insular prejudice soon evaporates if results improve. There is every chance of that happening, since Eriksson's coaching credentials are impeccable and he will be starting from such a low base. </p> <p>'It was important to look for someone who is an extraordinarily good coach,' said Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive, stating the obvious while tacitly admitting Keegan had been a spectacularly bad choice. </p> <p>Eriksson might never have been a coach at all had he not been such an unspectacular player. He admits to having been slightly taken aback when, at the age of 27, his mentor Tord Grip - now scouting for the FA as Eriksson's assistant - told him to quit playing. </p> <p>'He has never said it but I know Grip didn't rate me as a player,' Eriksson said earlier this year. 'I am sure that when he saw me on the pitch for the first time, after I had just joined Karlskoga, he thought, \"Where on earth did this bloke come from and why have we wasted \u00a3500 on him?\" But the decision to stop playing and become a coach was one of the best decisions of my life and I have Tord to thank for that.' </p> <p>The num of the issue, at least for the Daily Mail, Gordon Taylor, John Barnwell and the others who have been giving Blimpish soundbites all week, is whether that coaching career should have landed him a job in charge of England. Surely, they argued, there must be an Englishman who could and should have been offered the job ahead of Eriksson. But no, there isn't. </p> <p>Eriksson's CV is ample proof to back Crozier's assertion that the FA have landed one of the world's top coaches. At the moment, as opposed to where he was nearly five years ago when the FA first sounded him out, Eriksson is exactly that. </p> <p>Shrewd enough to realise in 1996 that he was not yet experienced enough for international management (although the FA never formalised their offer and opted for Glenn Hoddle to replace Venables), and astute enough to leave the door open for an offer from Lazio even while he was signing a contract with Blackburn Rovers, the Swede has his detractors in Italy but possesses a record which puts even Wenger's in the shade. </p> <p>The FA's really lucky break, and this is possibly why they were looking abroad in the first place, was in finding such a well-qualified coach who regarded managing England as an honour and a privilege. Eriksson has been a fan of English football for as long as he can remember, citing Manchester United's 1968 European Cup victory as one of his earliest memories, and as a young coach spent time observing the methods of Bobby Robson and Don Howe. </p> <p>'He came to England and sat in on training sessions at Ipswich and Arsenal,' King recalled. 'I remember how happy he was in 1991 when his Benfica side beat Arsenal 3-1 in extra time in the European Cup. It meant so much to him. Now, he has tremendous regard for players like David Beckham and Michael Owen, and truly believes he is ready for this job.' </p> <p>David Dein - one of the two-man raiding party who took Eriksson from Lazio (Crozier was the other) is sure they have got it right this time. 'Sven will bring a refreshing dimension to the England team, by way of tactics, organisation and training methods,' he said. Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman, should know, having seen the prototype at Highbury. </p> <p>What of the churlish anti-foreigner reaction by many last week? Gordon Taylor could perhaps be excused his peevish comments about betrayal of England's heritage, but his suggestion that Eriksson could not be trusted to turn up, or would change his mind at the first bad result, was unworthy of a fellow professional. Particularly as Eriksson has practically made a career of overcoming initial hostility. </p> <p>In his early days at Gothenburg, fans implored the club to 'send him back to the woods'. His arrival as Benfica's first foreign coach prompted 18 club directors to resign in protest, and Lazio fans threatened to trash 'his beautiful Volvo' after he sold Beppe Signori. </p> <p>He only narrowly survived his first coaching appointment, at Degerfors, after complaining to his chairman that the players were spending too much time and money in the bar after matches. The chairman, who had been at the club for 30 years, told Eriksson: 'If you take care of the football, I'll care care of the women and the booze.' Eriksson didn't argue - but he would certainly do so now. </p> <p>Friends in Italy have noticed a significant change in Eriksson in recent years; while he can be a hard man when he needs to be, he has also become very aware of his public image, particularly since his relationship with 36-year-old fianc\u00e9e Nancy Dall'Olio blossomed. </p> <p>'His hairstyle has changed, his clothes have changed, even his spectacles have changed,' said one of his Lazio players. 'He is very much more aware of style now.' But not at the expense of substance. </p> <p>Crozier, a man with a keen eye for image himself, is keen to accentuate the positive and look forward. 'A clean start should prove to be a good thing. 1966 was wonderful, but we have done nothing since then, got nowhere. We are not in the frame of countries that can win tournaments, and that is where we want to be.' </p> <p>Quite, except some people are already arguing that any such victory, as distant a prospect as it might appear at present, would be tainted by foreign involvement. These people hold up France as an example of how to run things, forgetting that the French once had a foreign coach, and appear to include Jack Charlton, that famous Irishman. The assumption is that England are cheating, or seeking to cover up their deficiencies by looking abroad, when in fact the opposite is true. The FA has bravely accepted that it needs help. </p> <p>'It's about looking forward rather than back,' Crozier said. 'There comes a time when you have been trying something for a long time when you have to accept it is not working. It's a time for courage.' </p> <p>Amen to that. English football can learn from Eriksson and with one single but serious reservation both should be good for each other. That reservation concerns the England fans, or at least the percentage of them who do not mirror their new coach in being urbane, stylish and softly-spoken. </p> <p>How the notoriously xenophobic element among England's following will take to a foreign coach is, frankly, a worry. An even bigger one is how the civilised Eriksson will take to the primitives in his new public. </p> <p>It is sad to have to insert this caveat into what should be a brave new England dawn, but for all the wrong reasons Gordon Taylor might have got something right. </p> <p> Tears before bedtime cannot be ruled out.</p>",

For a product of Sweden, a country biliously characterised by the Daily Mail as a nation of skiers and hammer throwers who spend half their lives in darkness, he taught the English a few things about the straight, defensive blocking shot. England's new manager spent his first hour in the job knocking back the probing questions and leaving the wider deliveries alone. He breezed through that first encounter with English journalists, who ranged from the supportive and inquisitive to the downright abusive, telling them, 'I'll talk about England the day I start work.' But when will that day be? It could be months before his first opportunity to make an impression on the players. Honeymoon period? There may not be one and, as one commentator drily observed, there can be no honeymoon until Eriksson and England are wedded. So Eriksson's guard is up and he is staying on the defensive. 'In Italy, the press are more interested in my technique and tactics as a football trainer than is apparent in the English press,' he told Swedish journalists yesterday. 'There the interest is in my private life. They have already tried to contact my girlfriend Nancy Dall'Olio and tried to visit my son Johan in America; my brother Lars and his wife Agnetha in Portugal; my father and my mother in Torsby and my ex-wife Ann-Christine in Florence. I have not seen Ann-Christine for five or six years so what they might expect she would have to say is something of a mystery. It leaves me with a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach.' And the real fun has not even begun. If Eriksson struggles to win on the pitch and win over the critics off it, the glare of the media spotlight will burn hotter than the southern European sun Eriksson has become accustomed to in recent years. Even in Rome, in charge of Lazio, he has struggled at times with the Italian press. 'The journalists can be really nasty in Italy. I spent three years with Roma and three with Lazio and one of them criticised me at every possible opportunity and coined the expression \"Eriksson is a successful loser\", which other papers picked up. So it was a small revenge for me after Lazio won the Scudetto (league title) earlier this year and he went down on his knees and begged me to forgive him,' Eriksson said. Now all he has to do is convince those doubters in the English pack, especially those who, like the Daily Mail, continue to hold a torch for Terry Venables and who predictably railed against the Dagenham cheeky chappie's latest snub last week. But not for Eriksson the Venables way of schmoozing with the media. He does not indulge in football analysis on TV. He will co-operate with the media; answer their questions and drop the odd quip. Much more is not readily on offer. Indeed recently in Italy a media blackout was imposed at Lazio. Not by Eriksson but by president Sergio Cragnotti, angered by what was perceived as exaggerated reports on racial abuse aimed at Arsenal players during the recent Champions League game in Rome. There can be no such defensive mechanism used by the FA and their coach once both move into their new HQ in Soho Square. But those close to Eriksson say he has the toughness and ability to deal with adversaries. That applies to players, too. Clearly there was concern at basic failings in the Kevin Keegan regime even before the revelations about England's gambling culture which surfaced in the last few days. That Eriksson will stamp out such activity has already been made clear. What might surprise some of the England players is the severity with which the Swede can act. 'He can be as hard as nails,' one of his former Sampdoria players said. 'He is mild mannered but firm, but you couldn't describe him as a man's man in the English sense. He doesn't go in for hard drinking and I have never seen him drunk or out of control. He is as straight as they come and won't stand for anything that might cause disharmony or disunity in his squads.' Bryan King, the former Coventry and Millwall goalkeeper, has known Eriksson since the mid-Eighties and has worked and scouted for him. He said: 'Sven-G\u00f6ran is a hands-on coach and the England players will know who is the boss. He will run the show - although he will have a team of top coaches around him. He'll talk and eat with the players but he won't socialise with them. There will be a clear divide. 'When I was manager of Falkenberg in Norway in the early Nineties he brought Benfica to us for two weeks and I saw him close-up. He is very impressive; very clear, very methodical. He's hot on punctuality and won't suffer fools gladly. Remember he's been dealing with some of Europe's top players for almost two decades. Even in the early Nineties, he demanded the right diet for his team, the right food and drink. At the time, it would have brought an outcry from English players. Now they'll be more accepting.' Last Thursday, the only question to get past his guard was one about his international ambitions. Would he consider being manager of Brazil? 'Maybe only Brazil,' he said. 'It is a big, big job to be manager of England, Brazil might be the only team to compete.' There's something the FA has never had to worry about before. England have lost managers in a variety of ways down the years, even some of their successful ones, but the possibility of their top man being head-hunted from Rio is new. His guard was less disciplined at home in Sweden where he was asked about taking over England at a time when the national side was troubled. And what about managing his own country? Eriksson replied: 'Results over the last few years have proved that the Swedes are better than the English but in prestige terms, the England job is fantastic. I certainly do not think English football is bad. Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds have all acquitted themselves well in Europe and the under-21 side has been functioning very well, so I see a bright future for English football and the national team.' So will Eriksson be given a fair chance by some of his fiercer critics, in and out of the press? An early guess is that, just as Arsenal discovered with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, insular prejudice soon evaporates if results improve. There is every chance of that happening, since Eriksson's coaching credentials are impeccable and he will be starting from such a low base. 'It was important to look for someone who is an extraordinarily good coach,' said Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive, stating the obvious while tacitly admitting Keegan had been a spectacularly bad choice. Eriksson might never have been a coach at all had he not been such an unspectacular player. He admits to having been slightly taken aback when, at the age of 27, his mentor Tord Grip - now scouting for the FA as Eriksson's assistant - told him to quit playing. 'He has never said it but I know Grip didn't rate me as a player,' Eriksson said earlier this year. 'I am sure that when he saw me on the pitch for the first time, after I had just joined Karlskoga, he thought, \"Where on earth did this bloke come from and why have we wasted \u00a3500 on him?\" But the decision to stop playing and become a coach was one of the best decisions of my life and I have Tord to thank for that.' The num of the issue, at least for the Daily Mail, Gordon Taylor, John Barnwell and the others who have been giving Blimpish soundbites all week, is whether that coaching career should have landed him a job in charge of England. Surely, they argued, there must be an Englishman who could and should have been offered the job ahead of Eriksson. But no, there isn't. Eriksson's CV is ample proof to back Crozier's assertion that the FA have landed one of the world's top coaches. At the moment, as opposed to where he was nearly five years ago when the FA first sounded him out, Eriksson is exactly that. Shrewd enough to realise in 1996 that he was not yet experienced enough for international management (although the FA never formalised their offer and opted for Glenn Hoddle to replace Venables), and astute enough to leave the door open for an offer from Lazio even while he was signing a contract with Blackburn Rovers, the Swede has his detractors in Italy but possesses a record which puts even Wenger's in the shade. The FA's really lucky break, and this is possibly why they were looking abroad in the first place, was in finding such a well-qualified coach who regarded managing England as an honour and a privilege. Eriksson has been a fan of English football for as long as he can remember, citing Manchester United's 1968 European Cup victory as one of his earliest memories, and as a young coach spent time observing the methods of Bobby Robson and Don Howe. 'He came to England and sat in on training sessions at Ipswich and Arsenal,' King recalled. 'I remember how happy he was in 1991 when his Benfica side beat Arsenal 3-1 in extra time in the European Cup. It meant so much to him. Now, he has tremendous regard for players like David Beckham and Michael Owen, and truly believes he is ready for this job.' David Dein - one of the two-man raiding party who took Eriksson from Lazio (Crozier was the other) is sure they have got it right this time. 'Sven will bring a refreshing dimension to the England team, by way of tactics, organisation and training methods,' he said. Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman, should know, having seen the prototype at Highbury. What of the churlish anti-foreigner reaction by many last week? Gordon Taylor could perhaps be excused his peevish comments about betrayal of England's heritage, but his suggestion that Eriksson could not be trusted to turn up, or would change his mind at the first bad result, was unworthy of a fellow professional. Particularly as Eriksson has practically made a career of overcoming initial hostility. In his early days at Gothenburg, fans implored the club to 'send him back to the woods'. His arrival as Benfica's first foreign coach prompted 18 club directors to resign in protest, and Lazio fans threatened to trash 'his beautiful Volvo' after he sold Beppe Signori. He only narrowly survived his first coaching appointment, at Degerfors, after complaining to his chairman that the players were spending too much time and money in the bar after matches. The chairman, who had been at the club for 30 years, told Eriksson: 'If you take care of the football, I'll care care of the women and the booze.' Eriksson didn't argue - but he would certainly do so now. Friends in Italy have noticed a significant change in Eriksson in recent years; while he can be a hard man when he needs to be, he has also become very aware of his public image, particularly since his relationship with 36-year-old fianc\u00e9e Nancy Dall'Olio blossomed. 'His hairstyle has changed, his clothes have changed, even his spectacles have changed,' said one of his Lazio players. 'He is very much more aware of style now.' But not at the expense of substance. Crozier, a man with a keen eye for image himself, is keen to accentuate the positive and look forward. 'A clean start should prove to be a good thing. 1966 was wonderful, but we have done nothing since then, got nowhere. We are not in the frame of countries that can win tournaments, and that is where we want to be.' Quite, except some people are already arguing that any such victory, as distant a prospect as it might appear at present, would be tainted by foreign involvement. These people hold up France as an example of how to run things, forgetting that the French once had a foreign coach, and appear to include Jack Charlton, that famous Irishman. The assumption is that England are cheating, or seeking to cover up their deficiencies by looking abroad, when in fact the opposite is true. The FA has bravely accepted that it needs help. 'It's about looking forward rather than back,' Crozier said. 'There comes a time when you have been trying something for a long time when you have to accept it is not working. It's a time for courage.' Amen to that. English football can learn from Eriksson and with one single but serious reservation both should be good for each other. That reservation concerns the England fans, or at least the percentage of them who do not mirror their new coach in being urbane, stylish and softly-spoken. How the notoriously xenophobic element among England's following will take to a foreign coach is, frankly, a worry. An even bigger one is how the civilised Eriksson will take to the primitives in his new public. It is sad to have to insert this caveat into what should be a brave new England dawn, but for all the wrong reasons Gordon Taylor might have got something right. Tears before bedtime cannot be ruled out.",

My partners are in Los Angeles but the first correspondence I look at is any emails from a group called the Portsmouth Anoraks, who run a website giving regular updates of news to do with the club. When I was shooting The English Patient in the Sahara, I used to get the Portsmouth Football Mail Fed-Exed to me every week, and I also had it sent out to Italy when we were making The Talented Mr Ripley. I have misgivings about being seen as a professional Portsmouth supporter. But when the club was in financial dire straits last year, I got involved with a group of supporters who wanted to run the club in the way that Bournemouth fans run theirs. I went to a fans' rally at the Portsmouth Guildhall and did interviews stressing the value of a football club like Portsmouth in the local community. The visibility of doing that was disconcerting; I like going to Fratton Park and being anonymous. Nick Hornby lassoed something all real football supporters know: that a lot of it is to do with your family and personal history. In the Sixties I went with my dad, uncle and cousins. It's the same today, except that my son Max now comes. Going to Fratton Park has been a compass over the years, and it's still an undiluted pleasure. But because we don't have a winning team, the result of the game is secondary to the pleasure of us all meeting up. Given their catchment area, Portsmouth could be sustained as a Premiership club. Our great rivals Southampton aren't greatly different to us; they've stayed in the top flight by having better players and better managers. A good start for us would be to stop selling our best players, like we did with Darren Anderton and Neil Webb. On the Portsmouth Anoraks website you aren't allowed to say 'Southampton'; you have to put an S followed by several asterisks or swear words! Would I rather have my Oscar for The English Patient or see Portsmouth win the Premiership? That's a tough call. I think I'd keep the Oscar, because it means a lot to other people and it's a passport to work in my business, but there's practically nothing else I wouldn't trade. You can have my house but not my Oscar! On the other hand, it's an unimaginable fantasy for me that Portsmouth will ever be in a position to win the Premiership. \u0095 Interview by Denis Campbell",

Despite Plymouth's position near the bottom of the table, and their frustration yesterday in being held to a 1-1 draw at Torquay after being ahead, one suspects that it can hardly be more stressful for him than it was at United. The strain of trying to lift their struggling team was such that at one point, Sturrock collapsed on the touchline.",

      "body": "<p> Walking the soft white beaches of Los Roques, it is rare to see another human being. There are empty conch shells, coral sculptures, scuttling hermit crabs, shiny lizards and long-legged sandpipers. A heron watches while a fluffy white chick sits in its nest amid the green sea-purslane. When I took to the warm turquoise waters, jumping jacks flopped in the shallows; frigate birds with sharply angled wings floated above; curious terns looked me in the eye; and pelicans dive-bombed for breakfast. Below the surface, designer fish played hide and seek in the corals: angelfish, butterflyfish, parrotfish, blueheads, snappers, baby damsels and a fleeing turtle, to mention but a few. </p> <p>Los Roques is a coral archipelago 150km off the coast of Venezuela comprising 42 small islands surrounding a huge lagoon. Here, in this paradisical playground, hurricanes rarely happen. The days are hot and the nights cool. The trade winds permanently blow and the rainy season produces only the odd squall. Venezuelans visit at weekends to snorkel, scuba dive and watch the sunset, returning to Gran Roque, the only inhabited island, for dinner and a comfortable night in one of the many delightful posadas. </p> <p>The area is a strictly regulated national park with half the lagoon out of bounds to conserve the coral and sea grass beds. Yachts are granted a 15-day stay, time enough to savour the islands, soak up the sun and prepare for the rigours of the mainland. </p> <p>Following in the wake of Christopher Columbus and Walter Raleigh on his search for El Dorado, we took a boat up the Orinoco river. Our guides encouraged us to take a dip in the river at sunset. It looked inviting - the wide dark waters tinged with pink, parrots winging their way home above a wall of green jungle. A young Belgian couple took the plunge. But are there crocodiles? And piranha fish? Yes. Although we never saw any. We did, however, see electric-blue morph butterflies, with wings as large as your hand, noisy families of red howler monkeys and the part-reptile guacharacca bird, a hangover from prehistoric times. </p> <p>There was also plenty of wildlife activity at the jungle camp. A magnificent puma, brought in as a baby by the Indians, paced the length of its enclosure. In the rafters of the dining room an ocelot and a racoon played together while a family of otters honked noisily for scraps at our table. A huge tarantula sitting on an adjacent banana plant caused a stir. The young Belgian took it on the back of his hand; unfortunately his mosquito repellent irritated the spider which slowly hunched up ready to deliver its poison. It was coaxed back to its leaf. </p> <p>On retiring, keeping images of the tarantula at bay, I concentrated on counting the flashing fireflies outside my room. I kept my shoes and socks on, just in case, and the night passed peacefully. In the morning a black object whizzed past my ear and stuck on the shower room wall. It was a flying frog (usually found in the toilet bowl). I skipped my shower. </p> <p>The Orinoco Delta is home to the Warao Indians. The river is their highway and the canoe their only mode of transport. Made from a single tree, the hollowed out trunk is heated over fire, which causes it to unfurl like a flower and seals the wood at the same time. A father crafts a canoe for his child before it can walk and when a member of the family dies he or she is placed in a canoe covered with flowers and carried far into the jungle. The family then moves to another part of the river and builds a new house to avoid the spirit of death. </p> <p>The Warao believe they came from the stars and that God has brought them to the Orinoco Delta, to paradise, where the Mareche, the 'tree of life', grows in abundance. The Mareche produces an orange fruit which, when softened for several days, makes a palatable juice or wine, if fermented. The young tree yields a string from which hammocks and baskets are made. When the tree rots, it is home to a large, yellow grub, an excellent source of protein, eaten live. I was offered a chance to try this wriggling delicacy - I wasn't hungry. </p> <p>For the most part the Warao still live in the old way, at one with the jungle in their riverside houses on stilts - the dwellings that caused Columbus to christen the country Little Venice, or Venezuela. </p> <p>The country's major tourist attraction, Angel Falls, lies in the region of the Gran Sabana, in Canaima National Park, and is managed by the indigenous Pem\u00f3n Indians. The spectacular landscape includes thick jungle, open grassland, great rivers and breathtaking waterfalls. Here stand the Tepuis, the flat-topped mountains of Conan Doyle's Lost World. Hailed as the oldest rock formations in the world, they are about two billion years old, and prehistoric species still exist on their summits. Sacred to the Indians, the mountains are 'guardians of the savanna', dwelling-place of spirits, and it has been suggested that they form a solar observatory, like Stonehenge. Unsurprisingly, there are more sightings of UFOs in this area than anywhere else on the globe. </p> <p>As we flew up the Devil's Canyon toward Angel Falls I pointed at a pair of Tepuis peaks known as the Sun and Moon. This gesture was a mistake - apparently it angers the Gods, who can bring bad weather. But they seemingly forgave my ignorance, for the clouds parted and the sun came out illuminating the highest falls in the world. </p> <p>At nearby Canaima, which means poltergeist, there are seven waterfalls. People used not to go near them for fear the spirits would get them. We went very near, walking behind the width of the great El Sapo waterfall. As tons of water smashed past, we edged along the rocky path gasping through the flying, choking spray. On the other side, filled with an overwhelming sense of exhilaration, I plunged into a still pool. Not only had our guide extolled the iron-rich waters as a useful antidote to wrinkles, she had also kept repeating, 'I get my power from the waterfall.' As we climbed to the summit and contemplated the sacred mountain beyond I felt on top of the world.

      "body": "<p>'Ice is nice when you ski in the right position,' said Meinhardt, our ski instructor in St Anton, cradle of Austrian skiing. 'When it is a little bit icy, we heff ze edges,' he emphasised with a large grin. 'And more edges equals more holiday.' </p> <p>Not having had a ski lesson in the Alps for over a decade, I was curious to see whether Alpine instruction had moved on from 'Bend ze knees and follow me'. </p> <p> <strong> Austria</strong> </p> <p> An instructor took me on to the snow, pointed up the hill and said: 'Go.' I trudged 100 metres up, put on my skis and made as many turns as I could in the short descent. 'Ok, join the ski safari (a ski tour of the Arlberg region) with Meinhardt. We can assess skiers just by how they handle the skis. Seeing them skiing confirms this.' </p> <p>Founded in the Arlberg by Hannes Schneider in the Twenties, the Austrian skiing technique is characterised by the wedel , a succession of fast turns on the fall-line. Today there are some 500 ski schools and over 12,000 instructors, all trained by the Austrian Ski Federation. Jurgen took up the story: 'Boot technology has transformed skiing. More recently the shaped, waisted (or 'carving') ski has made it easier to turn and edge the skis with less effort. Up to a certain level our teaching is the same as before; how to balance, feeling the support of boot and ski. Sliding is still the same. From about level four (advanced intermediates) we teach skiers to use the shape of the ski, to carve.' Across the Alps, adult beginners are recommended 'fun' carving skis - about nose height. </p> <p>'The main problem for skiers,' continued Jurgen, 'is how to shift the upper body and weight. Teaching is about how to break up a movement into parts. We have to let the client know what is wrong and how to make it right.' </p> <p>The Austrians, French and Swiss all divide skiers into six groups, from novice to expert. Instructors who speak good English are widely available. </p> <p>This was Meinhardt's tenth season teaching in St Anton. He graduated from the Austrian National Ski School over a five years, working first with beginners, then as a county instructor and finally as a national instructor. </p> <p>'Steve, more leg action up and down. We heff steel edges so the ice dumplings are no problem, unless we lean back into the slope.' Guilty as charged. 'If you use the expensive waisting of your skis properly, then you have more holiday. But if you let them slide, you might as well be on old-fashioned straight skis.' </p> <p>'Round turns are the best, Denise. Go slowly down for the whole steering phase. If you go down too quickly, you have no pressure left to apply and you lose the edge. This means less holiday.' </p> <p>Throughout the day Meinhardt emptied our minds of bad habits by a variety of tricks; skiing without sticks, touching our knees as we turned, synchronising turns with the skier in front, linking slalom poles with the next skier. He even produced a rope, which we had to wind around our midriff contrary to the direction of the turn. It worked. We found we leant down the hill more, naturally assuming a better position, skiing faster but still in control. Meinhardt summed it up over a beer. 'Skiing is kneeing. More leg action, more flex, don't waste the waist of your ski. Look down the hill.' </p> <p> <strong> France</strong> </p> <p> 'What is your exact skiing standard?' asked Lionel outside the Ecole du Ski Fran\u00e7ais (ESF) in Chamonix. After some cross-examination about how I handle black runs and moguls, a class was fixed. </p> <p>Of the 13,500 instructors in 250 French resorts, 80 per cent are male. The average age is 34. Lionel Didier, 33, who passed his ESF national diploma in 1989, has been a full-time instructor for six years. He usually works with English-speakers. 'When the English say they want to learn, they mean it,' he said.'They tell the truth about their skiing standard, so it is easy to put them in a class. Grouping is very important; a well-chosen group has a synergy that helps everyone improve. But a slow person feels pressure and the group gets bored.' </p> <p>Lionel puts great emphasis on the psychological aspect of the sport. 'You have to be attentive to people and their wishes. I would say your skiing reflects how you really are as a person.' So poetic, so very French. And so worrying - I was about to be rumbled. </p> <p>Lionel likes to teach by example and imitation. Technical explanations are saved for when people are resting. 'Copying is quicker than understanding. Look at me, see the picture and copy. I know what you are thinking, \"Ooof, it is steep, I am going to fall\".' </p> <p>Now for the first trick. 'What do we put on frightened horses? Blinkers. Hold your poles shoulder-width like a window frame. Look at the downhill view. Turn the window like a robot. Don't use the upper body to turn. Turn with a down-and-up motion. Was it a nightmare? Good. This means that with the window you can't use the type of turn you normally use; you have to use your weight.' </p> <p>The encouragement continues: 'If you are scared, don't look at the slope, don't think of what might happen: use your window. There is no one skiing technique. There are many - for ice, powder, crust, spring snow. With the knees you can be precise. In deep snow, not much edge. For ice, lots of edge. </p> <p>'Allez, Barbara.' Just up from a less advanced class, Barbara is apprehensive on the black runs, finding this group younger and fitter. Lionel is attentive. 'Trust me, ski behind me.' At the front of the class she will not notice the speed. Her confidence increases. We try another trick - lifting the uphill knee while keeping the ski tip on the snow; this keeps the weight forward. 'Don't set your mental computer into turning mode, but into feeling what the ski is doing. Once you feel it, you have it forever.' </p> <p> <strong> Switzerland</strong> </p> <p> 'Gravity is a game,' began Gaby Fischer, our instructor in Nendaz, near Verbier. 'Carving skis have transformed Swiss teaching. Instruction used to be more academic.Now we no longer seek perfection, we just have fun.' The Swiss Ski School, established in 1930, formerly taught to a rigid format. But the Swiss have revamped their methods as a direct result of the now-standard carving skis. Qualifying as a Swiss ski instructor is harder than ever, with 65 per cent failing the skiing tests in the first assessments. It takes nearly six weeks over two years to qualify as a Professor de Ski, with annual refreshers. </p> <p>'Now that the pistes are always prepared and bumps are harder to find, skiers can enjoy a wider, stabler and more individual stance,' said Gaby, now in his seventh season teaching in Nendaz. With typical Swiss precision the all-important 'resistance to the snow' has been broken down into a number of key elements which apply equally to snowboarding: edge, slide, find resistance, make the turn; weight and unweight, set the edge. </p> <p>In my intermediate class, Gaby taught initiation of the turn from the centre of gravity, the belly-button; move this in the desired direction of travel and everything else follows. Gaby's teaching was supplemented by a variety of trick turns. We tried the crab, the Swedish, the Norwegian, even some faltering freestyle. He tailored his advice to our personalities.'Some people are tactile, some artistic, some musical. We try all sorts of things. Rachel, try thinking of long turns as a melody, like a waltz. Mike, on short turns, you need aggression, more techno, more samba.' </p> <p> I left the Alps feeling that instruction is better than it has ever been. With the latest equipment, skiing has become easier and more fun. Great care is taken to place the skier in the right group. Good teaching today depends not so much on traditional national methods, which are moving ever closer together, but on the instructor's personality. </p> <p>My instructors were attentive, innovative and perceptive. Lionel showed me a window in the mist. Gaby got me waltzing in difficult snow. And Meinhardt got me using my knees and edges so I had 'more holiday'. </p> <p>But in the end, you still have to 'bend ze knees'. It is just that now, they have so many different ways of telling you how to do it.</p> <p><strong>Downhill all the way</strong></p> <p>Stephen Lee drove to the Alps, travelling from Portsmouth to Le Havre with <a href=\"http://www.poportsmouth.com\">P&amp;O Portsmouth</a>: 0870 2424 999.</p> <p><strong>Switzerland</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.switzerlandtourism.ch\">www.switzerlandtourism.ch</a><br> Nendaz - <a href=\"http://www.skinendaz.ch\">www.skinendaz.ch</a> Hotel Deserteur: good position and old Swiss charm (00 41 27 288 2455)</p> <p><strong>Austria</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.austria-tourism.at\">www.austria-tourism.at</a><br> St Anton - <a href=\"http://www.stantonam arlberg.com\">www.stantonam arlberg.com</a><br> Hotel Neue Post: superb position and elegance.

We found we leant down the hill more, naturally assuming a better position, skiing faster but still in control. Meinhardt summed it up over a beer. 'Skiing is kneeing. More leg action, more flex, don't waste the waist of your ski. Look down the hill.' France 'What is your exact skiing standard?' asked Lionel outside the Ecole du Ski Fran\u00e7ais (ESF) in Chamonix. After some cross-examination about how I handle black runs and moguls, a class was fixed. Of the 13,500 instructors in 250 French resorts, 80 per cent are male. The average age is 34. Lionel Didier, 33, who passed his ESF national diploma in 1989, has been a full-time instructor for six years. He usually works with English-speakers. 'When the English say they want to learn, they mean it,' he said.'They tell the truth about their skiing standard, so it is easy to put them in a class. Grouping is very important; a well-chosen group has a synergy that helps everyone improve. But a slow person feels pressure and the group gets bored.' Lionel puts great emphasis on the psychological aspect of the sport. 'You have to be attentive to people and their wishes. I would say your skiing reflects how you really are as a person.' So poetic, so very French. And so worrying - I was about to be rumbled. Lionel likes to teach by example and imitation. Technical explanations are saved for when people are resting. 'Copying is quicker than understanding. Look at me, see the picture and copy. I know what you are thinking, \"Ooof, it is steep, I am going to fall\".' Now for the first trick. 'What do we put on frightened horses? Blinkers. Hold your poles shoulder-width like a window frame. Look at the downhill view. Turn the window like a robot. Don't use the upper body to turn. Turn with a down-and-up motion. Was it a nightmare? Good. This means that with the window you can't use the type of turn you normally use; you have to use your weight.' The encouragement continues: 'If you are scared, don't look at the slope, don't think of what might happen: use your window. There is no one skiing technique. There are many - for ice, powder, crust, spring snow. With the knees you can be precise. In deep snow, not much edge. For ice, lots of edge. 'Allez, Barbara.' Just up from a less advanced class, Barbara is apprehensive on the black runs, finding this group younger and fitter. Lionel is attentive. 'Trust me, ski behind me.' At the front of the class she will not notice the speed. Her confidence increases. We try another trick - lifting the uphill knee while keeping the ski tip on the snow; this keeps the weight forward. 'Don't set your mental computer into turning mode, but into feeling what the ski is doing. Once you feel it, you have it forever.' Switzerland 'Gravity is a game,' began Gaby Fischer, our instructor in Nendaz, near Verbier. 'Carving skis have transformed Swiss teaching. Instruction used to be more academic.Now we no longer seek perfection, we just have fun.' The Swiss Ski School, established in 1930, formerly taught to a rigid format. But the Swiss have revamped their methods as a direct result of the now-standard carving skis. Qualifying as a Swiss ski instructor is harder than ever, with 65 per cent failing the skiing tests in the first assessments. It takes nearly six weeks over two years to qualify as a Professor de Ski, with annual refreshers. 'Now that the pistes are always prepared and bumps are harder to find, skiers can enjoy a wider, stabler and more individual stance,' said Gaby, now in his seventh season teaching in Nendaz. With typical Swiss precision the all-important 'resistance to the snow' has been broken down into a number of key elements which apply equally to snowboarding: edge, slide, find resistance, make the turn; weight and unweight, set the edge. In my intermediate class, Gaby taught initiation of the turn from the centre of gravity, the belly-button; move this in the desired direction of travel and everything else follows. Gaby's teaching was supplemented by a variety of trick turns. We tried the crab, the Swedish, the Norwegian, even some faltering freestyle. He tailored his advice to our personalities.'Some people are tactile, some artistic, some musical. We try all sorts of things. Rachel, try thinking of long turns as a melody, like a waltz. Mike, on short turns, you need aggression, more techno, more samba.' I left the Alps feeling that instruction is better than it has ever been. With the latest equipment, skiing has become easier and more fun. Great care is taken to place the skier in the right group. Good teaching today depends not so much on traditional national methods, which are moving ever closer together, but on the instructor's personality. My instructors were attentive, innovative and perceptive. Lionel showed me a window in the mist. Gaby got me waltzing in difficult snow. And Meinhardt got me using my knees and edges so I had 'more holiday'. But in the end, you still have to 'bend ze knees'. It is just that now, they have so many different ways of telling you how to do it.

The Government, bizarrely, gave him a 40 per cent pay rise, increasing his salary to \u00a3115,000 at a time when teachers got a pittance. The need to cling to him persisted either until David Blunkett, never an admirer, finally lost patience or, in Woodhead's version, the chief inspector took a unilateral decision to go. And what does he leave behind? A shrinking, demoralised workforce. A secondary system that is far from adequate. The suspicion that the attainment levels in primary schools, undoubtedly improved, have been bought at the expense of sacrificing broader skills to oppressive targets. Most of all, inequality prevails. It is iniquitous that higher education still discriminates against state school children. If admissions were done strictly on A-level grades, universities would take 30 per cent fewer pupils from private schools, according to the educational philanthropist, Peter Lampl. At the other end of the spectrum, the impact of child poverty on failing schools has never properly been addressed.</p> <p>Dictating education policy was not, of course, in the chief inspector's gift. Nor should he get all the union flak for doing exactly what he was hired to do. Woodhead was reappointed not despite his Wackford Squeers credentials but because the Prime Minister deemed toughness a major weapon in wooing Middle England and winning his own second term.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The final showdown was just over three weeks ago. It had been a long time coming. On Wednesday, 11 October, Chris Woodhead, the ever-controversial Chief Inspector of Schools, was called to a meeting with David Blunkett at the Department for Education and Employment. Blunkett had discovered that his Chief Inspector had been in secret talks with the Daily Telegraph, a paper fiercely opposed to Labour's education policies. What's more, he had been offered a consultancy with Bell-Pottinger, the Thatcherite public relations lobbying company that ran the campaign to support Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. </p> <p>As he waited in the glass atrium, with its faux-rural fountains and hanging greenery, Woodhead's thoughts might have turned to the mountains that are his true passion as a climber. His mind was certainly no longer focused entirely on his job at the Office for Standards in Education. Friends told The Observer this weekend that Woodhead had been talking privately about the job offers for at least three months and was just waiting for the right moment to leave. When Blunkett rumbled him, he was left with no choice but to resign. </p> <p>It was the end of an era. After six years in the post, Woodhead had become a national figure, where his predecessors had been anonymous civil servants. For his supporters, the Woodhead tough-love approach saved state education from trendy lefties and 'child-centred' teaching methods. But in the process, said his opponents, his brutal Ofsted regime drove teachers out of the profession. </p> <p>Sources close to Blunkett and Woodhead said the meeting itself was cordial: no shouting or stamping of feet. In fact, the only point of conflict over the past three weeks has been Woodhead's refusal to give the Secretary of State confirmation that he really was going. </p> <p>The relationship between the two men over the three years of the Labour Government had been fraught, but Blunkett had been repeatedly forced to publicly back his Chief Inspector: when Tony Blair first said a Labour Government would retain Woodhead, appointed under the Tories, prompting fury among teachers; when he announced the renewal of his contract in 1998; and when, during six difficult months last year, the press focused on the alleged affair Woodhead had with a sixth-former 25 years ago. </p> <p>In 1997 Blunkett had famously said there would be only one education boss under Labour. Woodhead spent three years attempting to prove otherwise. Finally, last Wednesday he threw in the towel, claiming he could no longer support Blunkett's policy on education. </p> <p>His close friend and climbing partner David Hopkins, professor of education at Nottingham University, said Woodhead had become increasingly bored and frustrated at Ofsted. But even Hopkins, one of the few members of the education establishment to lend his full support to the Chief Inspector, said it was probably right to move on from the Woodhead era: 'There is no doubt that Ofsted has sharpened up the performance of schools and put the debate about standards fully on the agenda. But now is the time to have a wider debate about it.' </p> <p>It is an open secret in Whitehall that Woodhead had fallen out with the two key civil servants at the DfEE: Permanent Secretary Michael Bichard and Michael Barber, Blunkett's favourite education guru and head of the Standards and Effectiveness Unit. Insiders say Woodhead's rudeness has become spectacular: at a meeting of the Standards Task Force last month, it is said, he became so irritated by Barber that he lay back in his chair and put his feet on the table while he was speaking. </p> <p>It is now clear that Woodhead's ideological differences with the Government run far deeper than anyone imagined. He said last week that he didn't believe the Government was doing enough to dismantle the power of local education authorities and pass control to individual headteachers. In an interview with the Guardian last month, he said A-levels were too easy for the brightest children. Although exams do not fall within his remit, he repeated the claims at last week's education select committee in the Commons, despite being unable to give any evidence to back them up. </p> <p>He is also bitterly opposed to appointment of 'learning mentors' at inner-city schools, which he sees as a soft touch. But it is thought that the final straw was a government proposal to introduce performance-related pay. Woodhead had argued vociferously against a centralised, bureaucratic scheme, believing the extra money should have been given to schools to pay teachers as they wish. </p> <p>He has always claimed that as a servant of the Crown he is answerable not to the Secretary of State, but to the the Prime Minister himself via the Commons select committee. But his relations with the committee, never good, have become increasingly strained under its new chairman, Barry Sheerman, who rebuked him last Wednesday for suggesting that Liberal Democrat member Evan Harris was too stupid to understand what he was saying. </p> <p>By then Woodhead knew that his resignation was likely to be announced the next day. The select committee also criticised his failure to meet researchers from the Commission for Racial Equality over a period of four months. The chair of the commission, Gurbux Singh, described Woodhead's correspondence over the matter as offensive. The Chief Inspector's more than usually abrasive style over recent months can now be attributed to the fact that he was already feeling demob happy. </p> <p>There is hardly a figure in public life who so divides public opinion as Woodhead. For his - often right-wing - supporters, such as Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre and his new boss at the Telegraph, Charles Moore, he is the most important educational reformer since the comprehensive system was set up in the mid-Sixties.

'He simply didn't understand schools and classrooms enough to deal with the problems he had correctly identified.'

      "bodyText": "The final showdown was just over three weeks ago. It had been a long time coming. On Wednesday, 11 October, Chris Woodhead, the ever-controversial Chief Inspector of Schools, was called to a meeting with David Blunkett at the Department for Education and Employment. Blunkett had discovered that his Chief Inspector had been in secret talks with the Daily Telegraph, a paper fiercely opposed to Labour's education policies. What's more, he had been offered a consultancy with Bell-Pottinger, the Thatcherite public relations lobbying company that ran the campaign to support Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. As he waited in the glass atrium, with its faux-rural fountains and hanging greenery, Woodhead's thoughts might have turned to the mountains that are his true passion as a climber. His mind was certainly no longer focused entirely on his job at the Office for Standards in Education. Friends told The Observer this weekend that Woodhead had been talking privately about the job offers for at least three months and was just waiting for the right moment to leave. When Blunkett rumbled him, he was left with no choice but to resign. It was the end of an era. After six years in the post, Woodhead had become a national figure, where his predecessors had been anonymous civil servants. For his supporters, the Woodhead tough-love approach saved state education from trendy lefties and 'child-centred' teaching methods. But in the process, said his opponents, his brutal Ofsted regime drove teachers out of the profession. Sources close to Blunkett and Woodhead said the meeting itself was cordial: no shouting or stamping of feet. In fact, the only point of conflict over the past three weeks has been Woodhead's refusal to give the Secretary of State confirmation that he really was going. The relationship between the two men over the three years of the Labour Government had been fraught, but Blunkett had been repeatedly forced to publicly back his Chief Inspector: when Tony Blair first said a Labour Government would retain Woodhead, appointed under the Tories, prompting fury among teachers; when he announced the renewal of his contract in 1998; and when, during six difficult months last year, the press focused on the alleged affair Woodhead had with a sixth-former 25 years ago. In 1997 Blunkett had famously said there would be only one education boss under Labour. Woodhead spent three years attempting to prove otherwise. Finally, last Wednesday he threw in the towel, claiming he could no longer support Blunkett's policy on education. His close friend and climbing partner David Hopkins, professor of education at Nottingham University, said Woodhead had become increasingly bored and frustrated at Ofsted. But even Hopkins, one of the few members of the education establishment to lend his full support to the Chief Inspector, said it was probably right to move on from the Woodhead era: 'There is no doubt that Ofsted has sharpened up the performance of schools and put the debate about standards fully on the agenda. But now is the time to have a wider debate about it.' It is an open secret in Whitehall that Woodhead had fallen out with the two key civil servants at the DfEE: Permanent Secretary Michael Bichard and Michael Barber, Blunkett's favourite education guru and head of the Standards and Effectiveness Unit. Insiders say Woodhead's rudeness has become spectacular: at a meeting of the Standards Task Force last month, it is said, he became so irritated by Barber that he lay back in his chair and put his feet on the table while he was speaking. It is now clear that Woodhead's ideological differences with the Government run far deeper than anyone imagined.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In court 67 of the Royal Courts of Justice in London last week Oxford University and the style of the English establishment were subjected to unaccustomed scrutiny. The case against Oxford was plain to see. The university was accused of treating Nadeem Ahmed so perversely when it deemed he had failed an exam that an unprecedented intervention by the judiciary in its affairs was in order. Ahmed is, as you may have guessed, a British Asian and his second and equally unprecedented charge that Oxford is a racist institution will be heard by the County Court in a few weeks. </p> <p>The establishment style was harder to pin down. You caught it in the circumlocutions of the pack of university lawyers and a faint, musty smell in the air. Both suggested that Oxford remained a self-protecting world where students were expected to fall on their swords without a murmur; where nudges and hints were preferred to precise, open standards. Transparency would allow the public to look in and pass impertinent judgments. Better, far better, to keep the waters muddy and the procedures obscure. </p> <p>Amateurism has its champions. But the informal approach is an absolute disaster when accusations of racism are made. A simple question - did Nadeem Ahmed pass or fail? - which any other academic institution could resolve without breaking sweat, has become the subject of two court hearings. </p> <p>Ahmed is neat and rather donnish. He did not strike me a professional victim willing to cover his failings with bellows of 'racists'. Quite the reverse. In the months before his case came to court he had displayed a deplorable unwillingness to shoot his mouth off to Observer columnists desperate for a story, as I learned the hard way. </p> <p>He went to Oxford to study the tranquil Sufi philosophy of the Islamic kingdoms of medieval Spain. His experience was anything but calming. The supervisor of his post-graduate degree was Dr Fritz Zimmermann from the School of Oriental Studies. They did not get on. </p> <p>In 1999 Ahmed and his fellow students were told to sit an exam in Arabic. A white woman who had no training in Arabic before she had begun the course sailed through. Ahmed who studied Arabic at the University of London, and whose tutor there described him as a proficient pupil, failed. </p> <p>According to Ahmed's evidence, Zimmermann told him afterwards: 'Why are you so interested in academia, is it the glamour? You are not cut out for academia. You have a basic problem with languages. Seriously, are you dyslexic? You give the impression of being an uneducated person?' When Ahmed replied that he had tried to produce a stylish rather than a literal translation, he alleges Zimmermann countered: 'Well, that is just your problem. Where a text is clear-cut and simple, you wish to turn your behind around and fart on it with your obscurity.' These fighting words concluded with Zimmermann saying that Ahmed should leave Oxford. Yet, peculiarly, he could not order him to go because the 'exam' his student had sat, and on which his academic ambitions rested, was not an exam. </p> <p>I'll explain as best I can. Normal exams are set by a rigorous and independent exam board. The papers are not marked by a pupil's teachers - accusations of bias would fly if they were - but by external examiners. None of these conditions applied in the School of Oriental Studies. The exam was set by Zimmermann and marked by Zimmermann. It wasn't an exam but an informal test. Ahmed couldn't be expelled for failing it. </p> <p>Zimmermann and the university deny all accusations of racism vehemently and I've no way of knowing whether Ahmed is a victim or an academic incompetent. But Oxford accepts that the 'exam' was flawed because it was 'not independent' and 'not double-marked'. The university adds that a second 'exam' Ahmed took after he protested was also flawed. In this instance, Ahmed wasn't just presented with a translation but had to answer supplementary questions on Arabic grammar which his fellow students had been spared. </p> <p>The scholar found himself in a weird position. The School of Oriental Studies said it wanted to see the back of him, but couldn't force him to leave. Ahmed was called to meetings in pubs and asked to be a good chap and disappear. In these circumstances, most graduates go. There is no point in studying under dons who don't want to teach you. Ahmed, however, decided to stay and fight for the right to be taught. 'I know I will have a miserable time if I win,' he told me. 'But I want to make sure that no Asian or black student at Oxford goes through what I've gone through.' </p> <p>Ahmed searched for allies. The university had no ethnic minority officers for Asian students with a grievance, so he appealed to Tom Paulin, who teaches at his college. Readers who have seen Paulin explode on BBC2 when asked to comment on the latest saccharine film or Britart banality may think there is not a force on earth which can stand in his way when a rage is upon him (with the possible exception of a battle-ready nuclear sub). Paulin made more than 100 phone calls but got nowhere. No one wanted to listen. </p> <p>Paulin says he is 'deeply concerned' and I can understand why. If Ahmed wins in the High Court, a ruling is expected tomorrow, or succeeds in substantiating his racism charge, Oxford will look like an dysfunctional relic. Discrimination is at its worst in those industries - journalism is one - which don't advertise jobs but rely on informal recommendations and word of mouth. Pupils may soon learn that Oxford apes the informality of the worst employers. </p> <p>A victory for Ahmed would also encourage Ministers to turn what is left of their socialist scorn on Oxford and Cambridge. Gordon Brown may have got his facts hopelessly wrong during the Laura Spence affair, but his broad argument was undeniable. The 7 per cent of pupils who go to private schools make up one third of all students who get three As at A-level but receive 50 per cent of Oxbridge places. </p> <p>There are, of course, many in both universities who are desperate to connect their colleges to the rest of society but they may be fighting a losing battle. Applications from state schools fell this year. Oxbridge academics complain that it is getting harder to persuade working- and middle-class students to apply to universities where they believe they will be belittled by plausible but dimwitted snobs. Ahmed says he is fighting for the black and Asian Oxford students of the future. They could be few in number. </p> <p><strong>Who is allowed to remember the Armenians? Not us</strong></p> <p>'Who now remembers the Armenians?' Hitler asked as he brushed aside objection to the extermination of European Jewry. About one and a half million Armenian Christians were slaughtered by the Turks in 1915. Few cared about them in 1941 let alone 2000. </p> <p>Certainly the Home Office and the BBC are insouciant. They have decided that the first Holocaust memorial day commemoration - which, I suspect, will be a triumph of professional mourning over history - should contain no mention of the genocide that suggested to Hitler he could get away with mass murder. </p> <p>There are good political reasons for amnesia. Turkey is an Armenian Holocaust denier. Last month Ankara told Washington it would not let the US Air Force use its bases if Clinton accepted that what happened was genocide. </p> <p>The same pressures may be at work in Britain. When Sarah Topalian, a British citizen with an Armenian father, complained to Neil Frater, the Home Office master of Holocaust ceremonies, she was told that the Foreign Office had intervened. 'Some people might conclude' that Turkish pressure had been effective, Frater said. </p> <p>It's an old story. The designers of the Washington Holocaust Museum promised Armenians that their past would be mentioned. They broke their word when the museum's council decided that discussion of Armenians diluted the 'unprecedented' character of Jewish suffering and the Israeli government said it was anxious not to offend its ally, Turkey. </p> <p>American Holocaust museums are not keen on finding space for the communists, the socialists, the trade unionists and the mentally ill - Hitler's first victims - either. No one goes on about Hitler's killing of 500,000 gypsies. They are even more unpopular than the Reds. </p> <p>Holocaust commemoration is too often the manipulation of the past for present purposes, and the Turks and museum directors aren't the only culprits. US and Israeli Jewish leaders have disgraced themselves by claiming that the suffering of European Jews was 'unique' and used it to brand protest against the persecution of the Palestinians with race laws and overwhelming force as 'anti-semitism'. If what happened to Jews is unique, replied the brilliant (and Jewish) historian Peter Novick what are these 'lessons' Holocaust Days are meant to teach us? Surely the unique can never be repeated and we can all therefore ignore it? </p> <p>To me, the only lesson to be learned is to support asylum-seekers as they are libelled and denied sanctuary by Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe. We should ask the British politicians to reform themselves rather than wallow in a phoney concern for the Jews whose 'bogus' claims for asylum they would have rejected had they been in office in the Thirties.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In court 67 of the Royal Courts of Justice in London last week Oxford University and the style of the English establishment were subjected to unaccustomed scrutiny. The case against Oxford was plain to see. The university was accused of treating Nadeem Ahmed so perversely when it deemed he had failed an exam that an unprecedented intervention by the judiciary in its affairs was in order. Ahmed is, as you may have guessed, a British Asian and his second and equally unprecedented charge that Oxford is a racist institution will be heard by the County Court in a few weeks. The establishment style was harder to pin down. You caught it in the circumlocutions of the pack of university lawyers and a faint, musty smell in the air. Both suggested that Oxford remained a self-protecting world where students were expected to fall on their swords without a murmur; where nudges and hints were preferred to precise, open standards. Transparency would allow the public to look in and pass impertinent judgments. Better, far better, to keep the waters muddy and the procedures obscure. Amateurism has its champions. But the informal approach is an absolute disaster when accusations of racism are made. A simple question - did Nadeem Ahmed pass or fail? - which any other academic institution could resolve without breaking sweat, has become the subject of two court hearings. Ahmed is neat and rather donnish. He did not strike me a professional victim willing to cover his failings with bellows of 'racists'. Quite the reverse. In the months before his case came to court he had displayed a deplorable unwillingness to shoot his mouth off to Observer columnists desperate for a story, as I learned the hard way. He went to Oxford to study the tranquil Sufi philosophy of the Islamic kingdoms of medieval Spain. His experience was anything but calming. The supervisor of his post-graduate degree was Dr Fritz Zimmermann from the School of Oriental Studies. They did not get on. In 1999 Ahmed and his fellow students were told to sit an exam in Arabic. A white woman who had no training in Arabic before she had begun the course sailed through. Ahmed who studied Arabic at the University of London, and whose tutor there described him as a proficient pupil, failed. According to Ahmed's evidence, Zimmermann told him afterwards: 'Why are you so interested in academia, is it the glamour? You are not cut out for academia. You have a basic problem with languages. Seriously, are you dyslexic? You give the impression of being an uneducated person?' When Ahmed replied that he had tried to produce a stylish rather than a literal translation, he alleges Zimmermann countered: 'Well, that is just your problem. Where a text is clear-cut and simple, you wish to turn your behind around and fart on it with your obscurity.' These fighting words concluded with Zimmermann saying that Ahmed should leave Oxford. Yet, peculiarly, he could not order him to go because the 'exam' his student had sat, and on which his academic ambitions rested, was not an exam. I'll explain as best I can. Normal exams are set by a rigorous and independent exam board. The papers are not marked by a pupil's teachers - accusations of bias would fly if they were - but by external examiners. None of these conditions applied in the School of Oriental Studies. The exam was set by Zimmermann and marked by Zimmermann. It wasn't an exam but an informal test. Ahmed couldn't be expelled for failing it. Zimmermann and the university deny all accusations of racism vehemently and I've no way of knowing whether Ahmed is a victim or an academic incompetent. But Oxford accepts that the 'exam' was flawed because it was 'not independent' and 'not double-marked'. The university adds that a second 'exam' Ahmed took after he protested was also flawed. In this instance, Ahmed wasn't just presented with a translation but had to answer supplementary questions on Arabic grammar which his fellow students had been spared. The scholar found himself in a weird position. The School of Oriental Studies said it wanted to see the back of him, but couldn't force him to leave. Ahmed was called to meetings in pubs and asked to be a good chap and disappear. In these circumstances, most graduates go. There is no point in studying under dons who don't want to teach you. Ahmed, however, decided to stay and fight for the right to be taught. 'I know I will have a miserable time if I win,' he told me. 'But I want to make sure that no Asian or black student at Oxford goes through what I've gone through.' Ahmed searched for allies. The university had no ethnic minority officers for Asian students with a grievance, so he appealed to Tom Paulin, who teaches at his college. Readers who have seen Paulin explode on BBC2 when asked to comment on the latest saccharine film or Britart banality may think there is not a force on earth which can stand in his way when a rage is upon him (with the possible exception of a battle-ready nuclear sub). Paulin made more than 100 phone calls but got nowhere. No one wanted to listen. Paulin says he is 'deeply concerned' and I can understand why. If Ahmed wins in the High Court, a ruling is expected tomorrow, or succeeds in substantiating his racism charge, Oxford will look like an dysfunctional relic. Discrimination is at its worst in those industries - journalism is one - which don't advertise jobs but rely on informal recommendations and word of mouth. Pupils may soon learn that Oxford apes the informality of the worst employers. A victory for Ahmed would also encourage Ministers to turn what is left of their socialist scorn on Oxford and Cambridge. Gordon Brown may have got his facts hopelessly wrong during the Laura Spence affair, but his broad argument was undeniable. The 7 per cent of pupils who go to private schools make up one third of all students who get three As at A-level but receive 50 per cent of Oxbridge places. There are, of course, many in both universities who are desperate to connect their colleges to the rest of society but they may be fighting a losing battle. Applications from state schools fell this year. Oxbridge academics complain that it is getting harder to persuade working- and middle-class students to apply to universities where they believe they will be belittled by plausible but dimwitted snobs. Ahmed says he is fighting for the black and Asian Oxford students of the future. They could be few in number. Who is allowed to remember the Armenians? Not us 'Who now remembers the Armenians?' Hitler asked as he brushed aside objection to the extermination of European Jewry. About one and a half million Armenian Christians were slaughtered by the Turks in 1915. Few cared about them in 1941 let alone 2000. Certainly the Home Office and the BBC are insouciant. They have decided that the first Holocaust memorial day commemoration - which, I suspect, will be a triumph of professional mourning over history - should contain no mention of the genocide that suggested to Hitler he could get away with mass murder. There are good political reasons for amnesia. Turkey is an Armenian Holocaust denier. Last month Ankara told Washington it would not let the US Air Force use its bases if Clinton accepted that what happened was genocide. The same pressures may be at work in Britain. When Sarah Topalian, a British citizen with an Armenian father, complained to Neil Frater, the Home Office master of Holocaust ceremonies, she was told that the Foreign Office had intervened. 'Some people might conclude' that Turkish pressure had been effective, Frater said. It's an old story. The designers of the Washington Holocaust Museum promised Armenians that their past would be mentioned. They broke their word when the museum's council decided that discussion of Armenians diluted the 'unprecedented' character of Jewish suffering and the Israeli government said it was anxious not to offend its ally, Turkey. American Holocaust museums are not keen on finding space for the communists, the socialists, the trade unionists and the mentally ill - Hitler's first victims - either. No one goes on about Hitler's killing of 500,000 gypsies. They are even more unpopular than the Reds. Holocaust commemoration is too often the manipulation of the past for present purposes, and the Turks and museum directors aren't the only culprits. US and Israeli Jewish leaders have disgraced themselves by claiming that the suffering of European Jews was 'unique' and used it to brand protest against the persecution of the Palestinians with race laws and overwhelming force as 'anti-semitism'. If what happened to Jews is unique, replied the brilliant (and Jewish) historian Peter Novick what are these 'lessons' Holocaust Days are meant to teach us? Surely the unique can never be repeated and we can all therefore ignore it? To me, the only lesson to be learned is to support asylum-seekers as they are libelled and denied sanctuary by Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe. We should ask the British politicians to reform themselves rather than wallow in a phoney concern for the Jews whose 'bogus' claims for asylum they would have rejected had they been in office in the Thirties.",

      "bodyText": "The Government's tough line on drugs will take a significant turn this week when Mo Mowlam calls for a 'sensible debate' on the issue and admits that a 'just say no' policy no longer works. In a series of interviews, Mowlam, the Cabinet Office Minister with responsibility for drugs policy, will say that treatment for people vulnerable to the drugs trade should be enhanced and that there should be greater understanding of how poverty and bleak prospects push people into drug-taking. She will also back her colleague, Cabinet Office Minister Ian McCartney, who last week argued for a 'new realism' on drugs and launched a campaign to give young people advice on taking precautions if they insisted on taking drugs. McCartney faced personal tragedy last year when his son Hugh died from a heroin overdose in a squalid tenement flat in Parkhead, Glasgow. He was 23. Mowlam's move will reveal the deep splits in the Cabinet over drugs policy. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, take a much harder line on the drugs issue than Mowlam, who caused controversy when she suggested there should be a debate about the decriminalisation of cannabis. She has also admitted to taking cannabis when she was young. Sources close to Mowlam said she would go as far as she could in promoting her own more liberal stance while keeping within the broad framework of Government policy. She has apparently been shocked by visits around Britain and to New York where she met people involved in drugs. Instead of condemning drug-taking, she believes a more sophisticated view needs to be taken, which addresses young people who find the Government's tough stance a turn-off. On Tuesday, Mowlam will announce a \u00a394 million treatment scheme for drug-takers that will allow the present 60,000 treated a year to be increased to 90,000. A report released on the same day by the Government's drugs tsar, Keith Hellawell, will reveal a large increase in seizures of heroin and cocaine. The report, which will say that more than \u00a31 billion worth of drugs was seized by customs officers and police, will also reveal a 10 per cent increase in the confiscation of assets from criminals involved in the drugs trade. The \u00a37m taken from criminals will now be used to fund treatment centres. More money to help schools run drugs awareness courses will also be announced. Supporters of a more liberal approach to drugs policy will also be encouraged by new evidence that reveals cannabis users are already bypassing the law by using the internet and mobile phone networks to supply each other with drugs. Cannabis lobbyists who have become frustrated by adulterated dope supplied at high prices by criminals have now set up a national registration scheme to improve supplies. They believe they have created a foolproof system to put growers and customers in direct touch with each other over the web and avoid prosecution by the police. The scheme, called Cannabis Registration, has been devised in consultation with lawyers and web designers and will go live tomorrow. They believe recent confessions by a third of the Shadow Cabinet, two Ministers and at least two dozen MPs that they have all tried cannabis means there will be less official hostility to the scheme. A recent report by the Police Federation recommended the decriminalisation of cannabis, while the former chief constable of Gwent, Francis Wilkinson, has called for its complete legalisation. Neil Morgan, from South Wales, said he founded Cannabis Registration as a result of frustration over government inaction and its refusal to decriminalise the drug. 'The time for talk is over; it's time to do things,' he said. 'This is direct action. People have to stand up for what they believe in.' The website divides the UK into geographical regions according to the Ordnance Survey map, and will provide prospective users with a mobile telephone number for a grower in their area. If police try to track down growers by pretending to be customers, they will be guilty of entrapment, making any prosecution invalid. Morgan said: 'The whole thing has been sorted out to the final detail.' Most of the cannabis consumed in the UK is heavily adulterated, often with toxic substances, in order to boost the profits of the dealers, who are sometimes prepared to be violent to protect their livelihood. Neil Montgomery, consultant anthropologist to the government-sponsored UK Medicinal Cannabis Project, said: 'Most cannabis sold in the UK is called \"soap bar\", which is heavily adulterated with everything from plastic and boot polish to diesel. We analysed one piece that was 8 per cent soil.' The facts about cannabis \u0095 Six million British people have used cannabis, including a third of the Shadow Cabinet. \u0095 The number of people given a criminal record for breaking the cannabis laws has risen fourfold in 10 years, to 96,381 in 1998. \u0095 Only 0.5 per cent of people think that upholding the cannabis laws should be a top police priority, according to the Police Foundation. \u0095 Last year, 2,838 people went to prison for possession of cannabis. \u0095 The annual cost of upholding the cannabis law is estimated at \u00a31.5 bn. \u0095 More British schoolchildren have tried cannabis than any other nationality in Europe. \u0095 Queen Victoria used cannabis for treating her period pains. \u0095 First reference to drug in 2737BC by Chinese emperor Shen Nung.

      "body": "<p>Film stars, when you meet them, can seem disarmingly small. If you saw the grungily anonymous Joaquin Phoenix on the street, you wouldn't notice him or you might look the other way with a grimace. But once his face is magnified and projected on to a screen, its play of alert, wounded expression becomes mesmeric and his identity multiplies as we watch. </p> <p>Earlier this year, he was the slimily incestuous emperor in Gladiator. Now, he has two new films out, and two new personae on show. In James Gray's The Yards, he plays Willie Gutierrez, a Puerto Rican wideboy for whom racketeering on the New York subway offers a frail chance of social mobility. This will be followed by Philip Kaufman's Quills. Here, Phoenix is the tenderly idealistic Abb\u00e9 de Coulmier, the cleric in charge of the asylum where the Marquis de Sade was confined, who finds himself tempted and corrupted by his prisoner's doctrine of sensual liberty. </p> <p>On the way to the Dorchester for my interview with Phoenix, I passed a poster for The Yards. It makes him look like a fallen angel painted by Caravaggio, moodily engulfed by shadows. Upstairs, in one of the hotel's hospitality suites, surrounded by bottles of water which had lost their fizz and bowls choked with cigarette butts, I met the 26-year-old owner of that glowering, alluring image. There was not much resemblance between them. His hair had been slept in and his clothes - creased shirt, greasy jeans, scuffed trainers - belied his apprenticeship as a Prada model. </p> <p>But once he began to talk, I understood the camera's infatuation with him. He is cinematic because he's so restlessly kinetic. The hotel armchair might have had hot bricks in it rather than cushions. His fingers anxiously shredded a scrap of paper, while his body twisted sideways like a corkscrew. The New Yorker's film critic Anthony Lane has said that Phoenix's face seems to have been squeezed in a vice; the rest of him is also pushed and pummelled by invisible forces. His slight frame houses a cyclone. </p> <p>Describing a cinematic fight with Mark Wahlberg - the blood brother who betrays him in The Yards - Phoenix re-enacted the struggle in the hotel room, concussing the perfumed air. 'Mark and I blocked it out of ourselves. We wanted it to be an epic battle, falling down the stairs and out on to the street. We had elbow pads and knee pads, but on the first take Mark just grabbed me with his pinkie, flipped me into the air and I landed on my head. Man, did I have a bump. I was black and blue for days. But I sure as hell wasn't gonna do any fucking John Wayne-style punching. I wanted it to be sloppy and barbaric and painful, like I'm hugging the life out of this guy who's my friend while I'm pounding at him.' </p> <p>He demonstrated on himself, pulling fistfuls of his hair and slamming the side of his skull. I remembered the astonishing scene in Gus Van Sant's To Die For in which Phoenix, a dim-witted slacker suborned by Nicole Kidman (who bribes him with blowjobs) to murder her husband, talks about vampires and turns himself into one, scratching at his own flesh as if it were anaesthetised, insentient, dead. The actor is someone who can replace his face at will. Phoenix, so frenetically physical, often seems to be trying to unscrew his own head. </p> <p>He was able to treat me to a solo performance of the fight with Wahlberg because both characters were slugging it out inside him. James Gray originally offered him Wahlberg's role of Leo, a convict plaintively trying to go straight. Phoenix favoured Willie: 'I said, \"I wanna play the charismatic one, the proactive guy\", just to get away from the post-To Die For thing, where I was always the loser. But I agreed to take Leo; then, after I'd been being him in my head for a year, they offered me Willie instead. So I spent a month going back and forth between them, trying to decide. I chose Willie because he was the sorta guy I hadn't been before. And when I became him, that was kinda shocking to my family - that I could be so obnoxious and strut and swagger about, being so goddamn suave, as this guy who just thought he was the man.' </p> <p>His family is Phoenix's touchstone of moral truth and emotional reality, and he endearingly explains the waywardness of Willie by saying: 'That kid had no secure parenting.' His parenting was secure, though unconventional. His mother and father were itinerant hippies, who happened to be disseminating the gospel of the Children of God in Puerto Rico when he was born. They named their offspring elementally or allegorically: the eldest was River (who overdosed on heroin and cocaine in 1993 and died on the asphalt of Sunset Boulevard while Joaquin, still a teenager, phoned for an ambulance in sobbing desperation), followed by Rain, Liberty and Summer. Joaquin felt that his own name (pronounced, significantly, Whack him) excluded him from the Aquarian tribe, and for a while experimentally called himself Leaf. </p> <p>Their parents fed them on tofu sandwiches and, when signing the toddlers up with a talent agency, specified that they would not do commercials for Coke, McDonald's, meat or milk. Engaged by Prada, Joaquin declined to wear leather shoes. He isvegan, though I wonder how his intake of cigarettes and his proud ownership of a yellow, '72 Le Mans sports car accord with these dietary and ecological dogmas. </p> <p> Although he claims not to have suffered from his vagabond, hand-to-mouth upbringing, it's remarkable how many of his characters are waifs, mentally precocious but emotionally vulnerable. In Ron Howard's Parenthood, aged only 15, he carried round a paper-bag full of porn flicks; he even described Commodus in Gladiator to me as 'a lost kid. Yeah, I discovered the child in him. He was only 19 when he became emperor. You know, the guy's father ran the Roman Empire, which is like the biggest multinational ever, and Commodus just hates the fucking suit and tie they make him wear!' </p> <p>By encouraging self-expression, the elder Phoenixes turned their children into instinctive actors. 'I'm not technical,' Joaquin said, his arms flailing, when I asked him about a scene near the end of The Yards in which, in an excruciating close-up, we watch a tear slowly form in the eye of the anguished thug. 'I don't have something I can just turn on. I sit there for hours in my trailer, hoping I can get into the mind of the guy I'm supposed to be. I don't think too much. I try to let go and suddenly [he flung his arms wide, like Leonardo DiCaprio riding the breeze on the prow of the Titanic] it's time to feel.' </p> <p>On Gladiator, Richard Harris helped him to liquefy by pouring booze into him. But eventually, he found his own way into Commodus. 'About two weeks in, I had an epiphany. I'd shot the beginning, with me arriving at the German camp, and I had some days off. So one morning I was studying the script, and lightning struck. I thought, \"Fuck ya! I geddit!\" I went out and cut my hair and added some weight. To start with, I was toned. But I made him flabbier, to show how this scrawny prince had kinda ripened into an emperor. It all happened because... no, I don't think I want to say what the epiphany was.' </p> <p>Self-expression for Phoenix entails self-denudation. Hence the borrowed, inherited garments shed by Commodus: 'We never see people pulling off their clothes in period films. But I though he'd be uncomfortable with those strangling collars and heavy cuffs. So why not take his shirt off?' </p> <p>Phoenix tore at his own shirt and exposed an unironed vest. The psychological striptease went even further as he remembered and re-enacted the abb\u00e9's crazed, quixotic effort to rescue Kate Winslet in Quills, discarding piety and propriety as he races to save her from flagellation. 'He sheds his armour, which is his cassock, and he runs through the rain with his shirt open, his chest bare.' By now, Phoenix had worked himself into a frenzy, ripping off clothes he wasn't actually wearing. And the end of the process was the revelation of naked, puny inadequacy. 'This guy thinks he's being so heroic, and we're going, \"You arsehole\". The joke of the movie is that there is no heroism in that world.' </p> <p> The Yards is already being compared to On the Waterfront, with Phoenix as a latterday Brando. But there is an earlier and, perhaps, more telling augury in To Die For. His character is called Jimmy; Kidman flatters him by calling him James, which reminds us that his mother called him after James Dean. Phoenix was modestly shifty when I made the comparison between their styles (or, if you like, their shared Method), and created a diversion by fumbling with a cigarette. 'Yeah, I guess I saw some of East of Eden when I was a kid. But only about 10 minutes of it and I couldn't see why everyone thought he was so amazing.' </p> <p>He paused, puffed meditatively, then decided to risk a further admission. 'Then I watched Rebel Without a Cause not so long ago.' Again he stopped, wistfully unreeling Dean's great, intimate, raw-nerved performance in his head. 'As a matter of fact,' he tentatively added, 'that was while I was on Gladiator.' He dragged on the cigarette, exhaled, and disappeared behind a thick grey cloud. When the fog cleared, I noticed that he was staring directly into my eyes, while a knowing grin sealed lips which were not prepared to say any more on the matter. </p> <p>But his smile confirmed my suspicion: he had told me, not in so many words, about his epiphany.</p>",

I remembered the astonishing scene in Gus Van Sant's To Die For in which Phoenix, a dim-witted slacker suborned by Nicole Kidman (who bribes him with blowjobs) to murder her husband, talks about vampires and turns himself into one, scratching at his own flesh as if it were anaesthetised, insentient, dead. The actor is someone who can replace his face at will. Phoenix, so frenetically physical, often seems to be trying to unscrew his own head. He was able to treat me to a solo performance of the fight with Wahlberg because both characters were slugging it out inside him. James Gray originally offered him Wahlberg's role of Leo, a convict plaintively trying to go straight. Phoenix favoured Willie: 'I said, \"I wanna play the charismatic one, the proactive guy\", just to get away from the post-To Die For thing, where I was always the loser. But I agreed to take Leo; then, after I'd been being him in my head for a year, they offered me Willie instead. So I spent a month going back and forth between them, trying to decide. I chose Willie because he was the sorta guy I hadn't been before. And when I became him, that was kinda shocking to my family - that I could be so obnoxious and strut and swagger about, being so goddamn suave, as this guy who just thought he was the man.' His family is Phoenix's touchstone of moral truth and emotional reality, and he endearingly explains the waywardness of Willie by saying: 'That kid had no secure parenting.' His parenting was secure, though unconventional. His mother and father were itinerant hippies, who happened to be disseminating the gospel of the Children of God in Puerto Rico when he was born. They named their offspring elementally or allegorically: the eldest was River (who overdosed on heroin and cocaine in 1993 and died on the asphalt of Sunset Boulevard while Joaquin, still a teenager, phoned for an ambulance in sobbing desperation), followed by Rain, Liberty and Summer. Joaquin felt that his own name (pronounced, significantly, Whack him) excluded him from the Aquarian tribe, and for a while experimentally called himself Leaf. Their parents fed them on tofu sandwiches and, when signing the toddlers up with a talent agency, specified that they would not do commercials for Coke, McDonald's, meat or milk. Engaged by Prada, Joaquin declined to wear leather shoes. He isvegan, though I wonder how his intake of cigarettes and his proud ownership of a yellow, '72 Le Mans sports car accord with these dietary and ecological dogmas. Although he claims not to have suffered from his vagabond, hand-to-mouth upbringing, it's remarkable how many of his characters are waifs, mentally precocious but emotionally vulnerable. In Ron Howard's Parenthood, aged only 15, he carried round a paper-bag full of porn flicks; he even described Commodus in Gladiator to me as 'a lost kid. Yeah, I discovered the child in him. He was only 19 when he became emperor. You know, the guy's father ran the Roman Empire, which is like the biggest multinational ever, and Commodus just hates the fucking suit and tie they make him wear!' By encouraging self-expression, the elder Phoenixes turned their children into instinctive actors. 'I'm not technical,' Joaquin said, his arms flailing, when I asked him about a scene near the end of The Yards in which, in an excruciating close-up, we watch a tear slowly form in the eye of the anguished thug. 'I don't have something I can just turn on. I sit there for hours in my trailer, hoping I can get into the mind of the guy I'm supposed to be. I don't think too much. I try to let go and suddenly [he flung his arms wide, like Leonardo DiCaprio riding the breeze on the prow of the Titanic] it's time to feel.' On Gladiator, Richard Harris helped him to liquefy by pouring booze into him. But eventually, he found his own way into Commodus. 'About two weeks in, I had an epiphany. I'd shot the beginning, with me arriving at the German camp, and I had some days off. So one morning I was studying the script, and lightning struck. I thought, \"Fuck ya! I geddit!\" I went out and cut my hair and added some weight. To start with, I was toned. But I made him flabbier, to show how this scrawny prince had kinda ripened into an emperor. It all happened because... no, I don't think I want to say what the epiphany was.' Self-expression for Phoenix entails self-denudation. Hence the borrowed, inherited garments shed by Commodus: 'We never see people pulling off their clothes in period films. But I though he'd be uncomfortable with those strangling collars and heavy cuffs. So why not take his shirt off?' Phoenix tore at his own shirt and exposed an unironed vest. The psychological striptease went even further as he remembered and re-enacted the abb\u00e9's crazed, quixotic effort to rescue Kate Winslet in Quills, discarding piety and propriety as he races to save her from flagellation. 'He sheds his armour, which is his cassock, and he runs through the rain with his shirt open, his chest bare.' By now, Phoenix had worked himself into a frenzy, ripping off clothes he wasn't actually wearing. And the end of the process was the revelation of naked, puny inadequacy. 'This guy thinks he's being so heroic, and we're going, \"You arsehole\". The joke of the movie is that there is no heroism in that world.' The Yards is already being compared to On the Waterfront, with Phoenix as a latterday Brando. But there is an earlier and, perhaps, more telling augury in To Die For. His character is called Jimmy; Kidman flatters him by calling him James, which reminds us that his mother called him after James Dean. Phoenix was modestly shifty when I made the comparison between their styles (or, if you like, their shared Method), and created a diversion by fumbling with a cigarette. 'Yeah, I guess I saw some of East of Eden when I was a kid. But only about 10 minutes of it and I couldn't see why everyone thought he was so amazing.' He paused, puffed meditatively, then decided to risk a further admission. 'Then I watched Rebel Without a Cause not so long ago.' Again he stopped, wistfully unreeling Dean's great, intimate, raw-nerved performance in his head. 'As a matter of fact,' he tentatively added, 'that was while I was on Gladiator.' He dragged on the cigarette, exhaled, and disappeared behind a thick grey cloud. When the fog cleared, I noticed that he was staring directly into my eyes, while a knowing grin sealed lips which were not prepared to say any more on the matter. But his smile confirmed my suspicion: he had told me, not in so many words, about his epiphany.",

      "body": "<p>Rosie Boycott was trudging through a forest in Shropshire last Sunday, relaxing before another gruelling week in the editor's chair at the Daily Express, when her mobile phone rang. It was a media reporter calling from London. He wanted her comments on reports in that day's papers, which she was yet to read, that the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT), publishers through Associated Newspapers of the Express's biggest rival, the Daily Mail , was making a bid to buy the Express group from Lord Hollick's United News and Media company. </p> <p>For Boycott there was something horribly familiar about the way she had received the news. Ever since Andrew Neil had revealed during the Conservative Party conference that his bosses, the Barclay brothers, were making a \u00a375 million bid for the Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star - since withdrawn - rumours had been flying. Three weeks ago newspaper reports had informed her of a \u00a3100m bid for the group by the wealthy Hinduja brothers, last week increased to \u00a3120m. </p> <p>A week later she had again needed to read rival papers to find out that Conrad Black's Hollinger Group, which owns the Daily Telegraph, was also thinking of making an offer. Now the Daily Mail had entered the fray with a bid 'in excess of \u00a3100m'. And her bosses at United News and Media were still telling her absolutely nothing. </p> <p>Initially Boycott appeared enthusiastic about the proposition. She was quoted as describing the Mail's editorial-led management style as 'fantastic', a move taken in some quarters as a desperate bid to keep her job, though a deeply curious one at that. It was not just that the Express and Mail are, as they have been for much of the past century, arch rivals in the lucrative mid-market. Since Boycott's arrival as editor at the Express in April 1998 she has completely repositioned the paper, dragging it from the wilder, slavering shores of the political right to a broadly left of centre position that finds it offering general support to the Labour Government that the Mail so clearly hates. </p> <p> By late last week Boycott was keen to clarify her position. 'Look. Any newspaper editor would be keen to have the resources and professional management skills of Associated Newspapers,' she told The Observer, 'but that's a very different thing from being able to produce the kind of paper we want to produce.' The Daily Mail, she said, seems to think Britain was only great in some notional 1950s, before single mothers or working mothers, before divorce or progressive teaching methods, before sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll. In their pitch for the hearts and minds of Middle England - a highly successful one that has seen the Daily Mail's circulation rise to 2.39 million compared with 1.04 million for the Express - they appear to have set their faces firmly against the twenty-first century. </p> <p>'Everything about the way the world is today the Daily Mail hates and despises,' Boycott said. 'Well, I think it's important that there is a big national newspaper which embraces the modern world and contemporary culture, which says that you aren't actually more at risk of being murdered than you were 20 years ago, that it's okay for mothers to go out to work, that divorce is a fact of life not some threat to society. But I've no belief that the paper we want to create could exist within their culture.' </p> <p>Over at the chrome and marble headquarters of Associated Newspapers in Kensington, news of the proposed bid had been circulating for two weeks before it was made public. Any suggestions that their offer was simply an attempt to push up the price for the papers so that the eventual buyer would not have enough money left to invest in them, were finally scotched last week; it emerged that they had retained the services of Mike Craven, a political lobbyist with the firm Lexington Communications, to help steer a path through the Competition Commission procedures to which any such merger would be referred. Craven, a former adviser to John Prescott and one-time head of press for the Labour Party, was described by one rival as 'the ultimate New Labour insider. He has total access to Number 10'. In short, the DMGT meant business. </p> <p> But what would it do with the Express if it got its hands on it? Executives there say that the management team, led by 32-year-old Jonathan Harmsworth, the fourth Viscount Rothermere, who succeeded to the chairmanship of DMGT on the death of his father Vere in 1998, has been buoyed up by the runaway success of Metro, the new free morning paper for London. Launched in spring 1999, it is already turning a profit well ahead of schedule. </p> <p>'There wouldn't be any sense in turning the Express back in to a Conservative paper because that is the territory the Daily Mail already occupies,' one Mail veteran said. 'With Metro it's discovered there is a good market for a paper that doesn't necessarily come at you with too much attitude. So its news told straight, lots of pictures, lots of graphics. A kind of USA Today approach.' </p> <p>But the success of Metro is, in truth, only the most recent excuse for this attempt by the Daily Mail to take over its old rival. Many of the senior executives at Associated, including Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, started out at the Express and would like to be able to proclaim total victory over it. But the current intrigue should be also seen in the context both of a newspaper battle stretching back over 80 years and of one young man's attempt to escape the deep, looming shadow of his late father. </p> <p>Shortly before he died Vere Harmsworth, the third Viscount Rothermere, expressed the belief to his senior executives that his son, Jonathan, would need a good five years' further grooming before he'd be ready to take over the old family firm. He'd already been sent up to Scotland to cut his teeth as a journalist on one of the group's regional papers, had done a stint as an executive on a local paper in Kent and had spent time as managing director of the Evening Standard . </p> <p>But nobody believed he was yet ready to take over the reins of a \u00a33.7 billion company with multiple interests in radio, new media and the regional press. On his succession he was dismissed by some at Associated as 'not very bright'; this, at least, was an experience he shared with his father who had likewise been described on his own succession in 1971 as 'mere Vere'. </p> <p>Mere Vere had proven them all wrong. He closed the Daily Sketch and brought its editor, a young man called David English, over to its sister paper, the Daily Mail. At that point the Mail was ailing and there were even proposals for it to be taken over by the Express. Together English and Rothermere formulated a new kind of newspaper, specifically targeted at women, which became a raging success. Its circulation swiftly overtook that of the Express which, in its heyday had sold four million copies a day to the Daily Mail's one million. If the new Viscount Rothermere could now manoeuvre his company to buy the Express he would be pulling off a coup as audacious as anything achieved by his father and he would establish himself in his own right. </p> <p>All that stands in his way is the judgment of the Competition Commission which, in turn, will have to be referred to Steven Byers, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Some critics have argued that it would be an affront to press freedom to have one wealthy group, with its own particular take on what makes Middle England tick, owning the entirety of the mid-market; for its part the DMGT argues that under its own rules the Competition Commission cannot make value judgements about where a newspaper sits in the market place, only on overall market share. </p> <p>As the DMGT points out, the purchase of the Express group would still leave it owning both less than 30 per cent of the market - perceived as the threshold for one owner - and less than Rupert Murdoch's News International group. It has also said it would maintain the editorial independence of the Express group, not change its political position this side of the next general election and that it would invest \u00a350m a year in the titles over five years. </p> <p>On competition matters Byers is said to take his lead directly from Downing Street. Would Number 10 be greatly troubled by the Daily Mail's ownership of the Express group? It seems unlikely. During a meeting of the Young Fabians last week, addressed by Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, was asked why the Government seemed so intent on following the agenda set by the Daily Mail. </p> <p>'I don't mind following the agenda of the Daily Mail,' Mandelson said. 'The Daily Mail represents the views, aspirations and fears of the great mass of British people and we can't ignore them. But operating on the same agenda doesn't mean reaching the same conclusions. It doesn't mean to say that every dot and comma of every editorial that appears in every edition of the Daily Mail inevitably therefore has to represent or become Government policy and nor has it.' It was an extraordinary vote of support from a senior member of the Government for a newspaper which traditionally has been one of its harshest critics. </p> <p>As far as staff at the Express are concerned the intervention of the DMGT is seen as a stay of execution with any inquiry by the Competition Commission being measured in months rather than weeks. Rosie Boycott was last week able to sit down and draw up the Christmas rotas. But those who see the DMGT's likely victory as sounding the death sentence for the left of centre popular tabloid they were trying to produce may regret that a chance to head it off was not taken when it came their way. </p> <p>Last month William Culbert, a former Daily Mail employee bent on revenge after being made redundant, was jailed for 18 months for hatching an 'evil plot' to hack into the Mail's computer system. He planned to close down the paper for a week, which would have cost the group millions of pounds. Culbert approached the Express offering to carry out the sabotage in return for a payment of \u00a3600,000. The Express declined the offer and, in a move praised by the judge for showing 'probity in a tough commercial world', shopped him to the police. So the Mail never did go off the streets. Last week it set about repaying the favour in its own inimitable way: it offered to swallow up the Express.</p>",

'I don't mind following the agenda of the Daily Mail,' Mandelson said. 'The Daily Mail represents the views, aspirations and fears of the great mass of British people and we can't ignore them. But operating on the same agenda doesn't mean reaching the same conclusions. It doesn't mean to say that every dot and comma of every editorial that appears in every edition of the Daily Mail inevitably therefore has to represent or become Government policy and nor has it.' It was an extraordinary vote of support from a senior member of the Government for a newspaper which traditionally has been one of its harshest critics. As far as staff at the Express are concerned the intervention of the DMGT is seen as a stay of execution with any inquiry by the Competition Commission being measured in months rather than weeks. Rosie Boycott was last week able to sit down and draw up the Christmas rotas. But those who see the DMGT's likely victory as sounding the death sentence for the left of centre popular tabloid they were trying to produce may regret that a chance to head it off was not taken when it came their way. Last month William Culbert, a former Daily Mail employee bent on revenge after being made redundant, was jailed for 18 months for hatching an 'evil plot' to hack into the Mail's computer system. He planned to close down the paper for a week, which would have cost the group millions of pounds. Culbert approached the Express offering to carry out the sabotage in return for a payment of \u00a3600,000. The Express declined the offer and, in a move praised by the judge for showing 'probity in a tough commercial world', shopped him to the police. So the Mail never did go off the streets. Last week it set about repaying the favour in its own inimitable way: it offered to swallow up the Express.",

      "body": "<p>There is untold pleasure to be had in cooking for yourself. We should do it whenever we can, basking in the luxury of having only ourselves to please. There is no one to regale us with tales about their day or to quiz us about ours, no children, no one to serve, no one to fuss over. At last a meal in which we have only to consider our own satisfaction. Yet no one should regard this as an act of selfishness. Cooking for yourself is simply a matter of self-respect. </p> <p>No one should even think of pitying the single cook. That vision of the lone diner with their sad little can of baked beans and their individual portion of M&amp;S shepherd's pie is actually a myth put around by couples desperately trying to reassure themselves. Most single people I know actually live alone because they choose to, and understand that, while cooking for someone else is one of the greatest pleasures known to man, so is making something fabulous to eat just for yourself. </p> <p>I see no reason why the lone cook should make do with anything less tempting than a couple or family might. A dish of asparagus, a plate of smoked salmon, a family-size pizza, a steak, a warming curry are all regular single suppers in my house. I am never happier than when no else is around, the phone is off the hook and I am contemplating a plate of oysters all to myself. </p> <p>A meal alone is also a time to rejoice in the things that you would not otherwise be able to eat - the fish, steak, mussels, whatever, that your other half/flatmates/ family will not or cannot eat. With everyone else out of the way, you can wallow in that culinary pleasure that you generally forgo for the sake of marital harmony. I have a friend who has not eaten meat for more than a decade because his other half, a life-long vegetarian, won't have the stuff in the house. I keep telling him to leave home and make himself a nice steak supper. </p> <p>There is no shame in making something utterly delectable just for oneself - in fact, I will happily endorse it. For once, we have the supreme indulgence of not having to satisfy or even please anyone else. If this sounds like the culinary equivalent of masturbation, then so be it. To quote the title of one of Delia's books, One is Fun. </p> <p>Speaking as someone who is (now) devoutly single, I often find myself eating alone - though in practice not quite as often as I would like - and highly recommend the solitary supper. Too much is made of the buzz you get from cooking for others. Yes, I know I am the first to harbour aspirations of being the earth-mother-with-the-overflowing-ladle, but that can just as easily be a way of making oneself feel needed. For my money, there is nothing quite so blissful as the bacon sandwich you make for yourself at midnight, when everyone else is tucked up in bed. </p> <p>While no one understands the beckoning call of the Marks &amp; Spencer's vegetable bake more than I, I do think cooking for yourself is the best possible way to spend the first hour or so when you come in from work. Even so, I would never suggest that single people cook themselves a sumptuous meal every night. Part of the bonus of eschewing the shackles of coupledom is that you don't always have to bother. What I do believe is that you should spend at least a few evenings soaking up the pleasure of home cooking. But there are rules. </p> <p>Never stint yourself. Providing funds allow, anything should be on the menu. Whereas some evenings supper may be little more than a tub of hummus, a bag of pitta bread and two-thirds of a bottle of wine, there are others when we should be more than happy to mess up every pot and pan in the house just for ourselves. Why not? We would do it for someone else. </p> <p>And we must have something delicious to drink with our meal. Ignore anything you read about the perils of drinking alone. Such warnings invariably come from smug do-gooders who wouldn't know a good time if one smacked them in the mouth. We should, instead, buy ourselves something exceptionally beautiful to drink. I wouldn't dream of spending less on a bottle of wine for myself than I would if was buying it as a gift or for a dinner party. </p> <p>OK, I don't smoke or drive a car, so I probably have a bit more cash to throw around in Oddbins than some, but to celebrate becoming single again I got into the habit of drinking a couple of glasses of champagne every night before dinner (thank you to the person who invented the Screwpull champagne stopper) and wolfing a little smoked salmon or an oyster or two. And I still do it, every single day. My feeling is that I deserve it. And you know what? I do. </p> <p><strong> A steak sandwich with mustard garlic butter </strong><br> </p> <p>I have been known to make myself saut\u00e9ed potatoes with this blissful, bloody, garlic-scented sandwich. But oven chips will do. Serves 1. </p> <p><strong> a piece of rump steak - about 200g </strong><br> <strong> a small baguette or piece of ciabatta </strong><br> <strong> olive oil</strong></p> <p>For the mustard butter</p> <p><strong> 50g butter at room temperature</strong><br> <strong> a little lemon juice </strong><br> <strong> 1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed </strong><br> <strong> 1 tsp smooth Dijon mustard </strong></p> <p>I am not sure it matters in what order you do this, the whole thing being over in minutes anyway, but I like to get the butter made first, and if necessary, refrigerated for later. Mash the butter, lemon juice, garlic and mustard together. I usually do this with a fork in a small bowl. Cover a chopping board with clingfilm, lay down the steak, spread it lightly with olive oil, then cover it with another piece of clingfilm. Now bat it firmly with a rolling pin - kit fetishists will no doubt have a professional cutlet bat in their batterie de cuisine - until it is less than a centimetre thick - ideally, half that. Take care not to tear the meat. </p> <p>Get a griddle pan hot. Slice the baguette in half lengthwise and toast it briefly (either under an overhead grill or on the griddle pan) before spreading it with the seasoned butter. Season the steak with black pepper from the mill, then slap it down on the griddle, cooking it for a minute or two only. In a perfect world, the meat will be lightly charred on the outside, pink and juicy within. Season the steak with salt, then immediately sandwich it between the baguette halves, cutting it to fit where necessary, the hot meat melting the garlic butter. </p> <p><strong> Pan-fried scallops</strong><br> </p> <p>Serves 1 </p> <p><strong> butter </strong><br> <strong> 4 large, juicy scallops </strong><br> <strong> a plump clove of garlic </strong><br> <strong> a small palmful of chopped flat-leaf parsley </strong></p> <p>Melt enough butter to cover the bottom of a small frying pan. You want no more than a thin pool. Let it bubble over a moderate heat, then just as it starts to froth, add the scallops. Be prepared for them to spit back at you. After two minutes or so, a golden crust will have formed under them, so flip them briefly over and colour the other side. Whip them out on to a warm plate and discard the butter in the pan. While they are cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic. </p> <p>Put the pan back on the heat and add a thick slice of fresh, sweet butter (about 30g). As it froths add the garlic, swirl the pan around so the garlic turns gold (it should not brown), then throw in the parsley, and if you wish a little salt (I often find shellfish doesn't always need it when cooked this way). Tip the butter, sweetly frothing, over the scallops. </p> <p><strong> Baked aubergine with mint and yogurt</strong><br> </p> <p>A baked aubergine may not sound like a luxury, but its richness is in its texture rather than its price. A simple supper that feels expensive. Some soft Middle Eastern bread would be good here. Serves 1. </p> <p><strong> 1 large, firm aubergine </strong><br> <strong> olive oil - a good everyday one </strong><br> <strong> 2 cloves of garlic, whole and unpeeled </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 tbsp yogurt - sheep's if you can </strong><br> <strong> a small palmful of mint leaves </strong><br> <strong>a little ground paprika</strong></p> <p>Wipe the aubergine, removing its leaves, and slice it lengthwise down the middle. Score across the cut sides, going deep down into the flesh, in a lattice pattern. This will help the heat and olive oil penetrate deep into the aubergine. Place it cut side up in a small baking dish or roasting tin then drizzle generously with olive oil. Grind over a little salt, then flip the aubergine over, so the cut sides sit flat on the dish, then pop the garlic cloves, whole and unpeeled, into the pan. Bake at 200 C/gas mark 6 until it is tender and melting, the flesh translucent with oil. This will take a good 45 minutes, but much will depend on the size of your aubergine, so keep an eye out. </p> <p>When the aubergine is totally soft and juicy, lift it on to a plate, squeeze the soft garlic flesh from its skin and smooth it into the aubergine. No need to make a big deal of this, just wipe it over the flesh. Spoon over the yogurt, dust very lightly with paprika and scatter the mint leaves. Scoop the flesh from the skins, mashing it with the yogurt and herbs. </p> <p>\u0095 Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> for a week's worth of recipes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is untold pleasure to be had in cooking for yourself. We should do it whenever we can, basking in the luxury of having only ourselves to please. There is no one to regale us with tales about their day or to quiz us about ours, no children, no one to serve, no one to fuss over. At last a meal in which we have only to consider our own satisfaction. Yet no one should regard this as an act of selfishness. Cooking for yourself is simply a matter of self-respect. No one should even think of pitying the single cook. That vision of the lone diner with their sad little can of baked beans and their individual portion of M&amp;S shepherd's pie is actually a myth put around by couples desperately trying to reassure themselves. Most single people I know actually live alone because they choose to, and understand that, while cooking for someone else is one of the greatest pleasures known to man, so is making something fabulous to eat just for yourself. I see no reason why the lone cook should make do with anything less tempting than a couple or family might. A dish of asparagus, a plate of smoked salmon, a family-size pizza, a steak, a warming curry are all regular single suppers in my house. I am never happier than when no else is around, the phone is off the hook and I am contemplating a plate of oysters all to myself. A meal alone is also a time to rejoice in the things that you would not otherwise be able to eat - the fish, steak, mussels, whatever, that your other half/flatmates/ family will not or cannot eat. With everyone else out of the way, you can wallow in that culinary pleasure that you generally forgo for the sake of marital harmony. I have a friend who has not eaten meat for more than a decade because his other half, a life-long vegetarian, won't have the stuff in the house. I keep telling him to leave home and make himself a nice steak supper. There is no shame in making something utterly delectable just for oneself - in fact, I will happily endorse it. For once, we have the supreme indulgence of not having to satisfy or even please anyone else. If this sounds like the culinary equivalent of masturbation, then so be it. To quote the title of one of Delia's books, One is Fun.

A steak sandwich with mustard garlic butter I have been known to make myself saut\u00e9ed potatoes with this blissful, bloody, garlic-scented sandwich. But oven chips will do. Serves 1. a piece of rump steak - about 200g a small baguette or piece of ciabatta olive oil For the mustard butter 50g butter at room temperature a little lemon juice 1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed 1 tsp smooth Dijon mustard I am not sure it matters in what order you do this, the whole thing being over in minutes anyway, but I like to get the butter made first, and if necessary, refrigerated for later.

Season the steak with salt, then immediately sandwich it between the baguette halves, cutting it to fit where necessary, the hot meat melting the garlic butter. Pan-fried scallops Serves 1 butter 4 large, juicy scallops a plump clove of garlic a small palmful of chopped flat-leaf parsley Melt enough butter to cover the bottom of a small frying pan. You want no more than a thin pool. Let it bubble over a moderate heat, then just as it starts to froth, add the scallops. Be prepared for them to spit back at you. After two minutes or so, a golden crust will have formed under them, so flip them briefly over and colour the other side. Whip them out on to a warm plate and discard the butter in the pan.

Tip the butter, sweetly frothing, over the scallops. Baked aubergine with mint and yogurt A baked aubergine may not sound like a luxury, but its richness is in its texture rather than its price. A simple supper that feels expensive. Some soft Middle Eastern bread would be good here. Serves 1. 1 large, firm aubergine olive oil - a good everyday one 2 cloves of garlic, whole and unpeeled 3 or 4 tbsp yogurt - sheep's if you can a small palmful of mint leaves a little ground paprika Wipe the aubergine, removing its leaves, and slice it lengthwise down the middle. Score across the cut sides, going deep down into the flesh, in a lattice pattern. This will help the heat and olive oil penetrate deep into the aubergine. Place it cut side up in a small baking dish or roasting tin then drizzle generously with olive oil.

      "body": "<p>On the second of April this year, I finished 'My Roots' with the sentence: 'A solo garden must be tinged with loneliness.' The response to this was instantaneous. A single man emailed me to say: 'I have lived alone for all of my adult life. I am not lonely, I enjoy my own company and the company of others. You are profoundly wrong in implying that single gardeners must be lonely. Worse, by putting that view in writing, you are promoting the myth that the single lifestyle is inherently worse. Frankly, the thought of having to share decisions about my garden with someone else horrifies me, but then we are all different. Please respect that diversity.' </p> <p>And a single woman emailed me to tell me about the 'people' (plants) that filled her garden. I completely identify with this because plants do become familiar, even loved, as individuals. If they die you cannot just replace them with another of the same size, shape and variety any more than you can replace a person. They can and often do have individual identities. 'I have to take issue with your last remark in \"My Roots\",' she wrote . 'My garden is a solo effort, and even though I always work in it alone, it is thronged with people_ I sometimes pause in a smiling reverie, trowel in hand - and forget what I went out to do! Solo does not necessarily equal lonely.' </p> <p>There were others, all in a similar vein. The truth is that although I enjoy my own company, I have a horror of being really alone. I need a mate to feel complete. This might be because I am a twin and thus have never known separateness without loneliness, or might be because I am sufficiently undeveloped as an individual to make it on my own. Either way, I can't imagine the degree of self-sufficiency needed to make a garden entirely by and for myself. But I accept that this is a failure of imagination and is clearly not universally true. Many people are alone because they choose to live and garden alone. </p> <p>Their garden then takes on a different role. It becomes garden as companion and gardening as an interactive thing. Now, if there are more than one of you involved (and I believe that it is impossible to make a decent garden with more than two people involved at a creative level) a lot of that to-ing and fro-ing is done between you. You discuss. Argue a little. There is an awful lot of 'Whadya think?' and 'What if..?' It is a genuinely collaborative effort. </p> <p>One of the most interesting aspects of filming Real Gardens over the past three years has been seeing how the dynamics of a household affected the garden. I never visited a gardener who lived alone. I don't think I ever knowingly have. In almost every case there was a dominant personality who 'did' the garden. The spouse often initially played a low-key, even negative, role. But as time went by, it became apparent that they invariably had a powerful influence over every aspect of the garden, even if it was a negative one. A garden made despite other occupants of the house is a storyboard of anger and frustration, another measure of an unfulfilled life. Think of all the primped and tightly dragooned gardens run by tight-lipped, angry old men while angrier women clean the house to death indoors. </p> <p>So gardening alone can definitely be a liberation of sorts. There is something exhilaratingly creative about deliberately pleasing yourself. The first thing to do is to define the degree of privacy you need and want. Different strokes for different folks, but I know that I want my garden to be entirely private if I am to enjoy it to the full. In my experience, the only way to avoid the horror of loneliness is to enjoy being physically on your own, and the first stage along that route is to create a domestic aesthetic where the only value judgements are your own. For me, this means not being overlooked if at all possible, and no uninvited human presence. In an ideal world, this means screening the edges of your garden with a combination of walls, fences, trellis and hedges and, even if that is not possible, creating an inner sanctum within the more public gaze of the garden at large, with a genuinely private area where you can see the parts of the garden you want but cannot be overlooked. </p> <p>Then clearly that privacy gets filled by an extension of yourself. On one level, it is impossible to advise or instruct on how that might manifest itself without contradicting the notion of glorious individual, solitary freedom of expression. But on another, I think it is even more important to look and read like mad if you are making a garden on your own. The reading is easy, if potentially expensive, although most local libraries have a fairly decent selection of gardening books. </p> <p>It always astonishes me that people would rather go to the trouble of writing to someone like me to ask advice or inspiration than pop into the library and get a book that will do the job better. I am writing this with shelves behind me holding more than 1,000 gardening books. However creative you are, you need to be challenged and stimulated to respond well, and short of a gardening companion, books play that role supremely well. </p> <p>Looking involves going and visiting other people's gardens as much as possible. Always take a notebook and pencil and, if possible, a camera. In fact, I cannot recommend too highly the practice of taking pictures of your own garden - however basic or humble - on a regular basis. It is astonishing how you forget what you have done, and the combination of photographs and a daily garden diary adds greatly to the pleasure and success of a garden. By looking at other people's gardens - even the huge, thronged gardens of the great and good - you can expand the solitary possibilities of your own private backyard. </p> <p>However private, there is an element of all gardens that is pure theatre. I simply cannot imagine not wanting to share that with others. Tucked in behind that statement is the suggestion that solitary gardeners have no one to share with - which I realise is absurd. But I think it means a different kind of sharing. If you garden with a companion, you share small, intimate moments: the light catching the leaves just so, that hour when the primroses are poised on the edge of glory. </p> <p>A solo gardener rolls out the garden like a performance. It is part of entertaining, a tool of friendship. This is fun and I wish we did more of it - I suspect that this side of gardening gets sublimated in the casual sharing of coupledom. Balanced against presenting the garden as an all-singing, all-dancing personal work of art is the simple pleasure of gardening. Quietly pottering around with just a radio for company is one of the great secrets of happiness: not doing anything for show or public acclaim, but simply for the love of it. Alone.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>We shall have a bonfire tonight unless the rain is torrential, but I know there are some people who find bonfires deeply antisocial, about on par with people smoking in restaurants. </p> <p>I had a letter from someone saying his asthma drove him indoors every time one of his neighbours lit up, so to speak. But we keep the bonfire heap as a vital piece of the garden and its presence is the source of constant debate. We have a good bonfire site with room to put all burnable rubbish, but it does take up a lot of space.</p> <p>Yet life would be difficult without a bonfire at all. You cannot compost or shred everything. What do you do with the bindweed, ground elder and couch-grass roots, diseased hellebore leaves or box-hedge clippings? What do you do with your magazines? (Not this one, of course - it composts beautifully.) Surely it is better to burn these things and spread the ashes on the garden than to add to the huge quantity of rubbish that goes into landfill sites?</p> <p>We can't move it nearer the neighbours lest they rush in, batten down all their windows and reach for the phone to complain, as well they might. And anyway, there is nowhere else it could go without severe horticultural compromise. Problems, problems.</p> <p>Because of my dodgy shoulder I've been wandering around the garden looking much more than usual. Normally I look until I see an irresistible job and close my eyes to everything else until that is done. But for the last week I have been out, new digital Ixus in hand, taking pictures. The pictures then fly down onto my computer screen and I spend hours studying them. It is both a record for next year's planting and also a means of objectively assessing what is going right and wrong without the sensual assault of real life.</p> <p>I spent an hour cutting back the leaves of hellebores. These have been seeding themselves freely and H orientalis has really taken hold in the Spring Garden. I long to cut all the old off, but I restricted myself to the noticeably diseased or floppy. I shall have another session at it in the new year, when they have drawn all possible nourishment from their old foliage.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Planting tulips and storing dahlias</strong></p> <p>November is the best time to plant tulips. Actually, it is the best time to plant just about anything, but especially tulips. There are two schools of thought about tulip planting. </p> <p>The conventional one is that they need planting particularly deep - which means making a hole about 6in deep, preferably with an inch or two of grit popped in the hole first, to add to the drainage. This is a counsel of perfection and applies really to tulips planted in mixed borders where they are to remain in position all their lives.</p> <p>The other method is to plant them an inch or so down with a trowel, where they will get at the best soil, and then to lift them after flowering to be replanted next year.</p> <p>Lift the tubers of dahlias as soon as they blacken off and die down. Cut off the top growth and store in a box of dry soil or potting compost. It is a mistake to let them completely dry out, although they should be stored in a dry, cool (but frost-free) and dark place. Check them every few weeks to see that they are not drying up too much or being attacked by mice.</p>",

But on another, I think it is even more important to look and read like mad if you are making a garden on your own. The reading is easy, if potentially expensive, although most local libraries have a fairly decent selection of gardening books. It always astonishes me that people would rather go to the trouble of writing to someone like me to ask advice or inspiration than pop into the library and get a book that will do the job better. I am writing this with shelves behind me holding more than 1,000 gardening books. However creative you are, you need to be challenged and stimulated to respond well, and short of a gardening companion, books play that role supremely well. Looking involves going and visiting other people's gardens as much as possible. Always take a notebook and pencil and, if possible, a camera. In fact, I cannot recommend too highly the practice of taking pictures of your own garden - however basic or humble - on a regular basis. It is astonishing how you forget what you have done, and the combination of photographs and a daily garden diary adds greatly to the pleasure and success of a garden. By looking at other people's gardens - even the huge, thronged gardens of the great and good - you can expand the solitary possibilities of your own private backyard. However private, there is an element of all gardens that is pure theatre. I simply cannot imagine not wanting to share that with others. Tucked in behind that statement is the suggestion that solitary gardeners have no one to share with - which I realise is absurd. But I think it means a different kind of sharing. If you garden with a companion, you share small, intimate moments: the light catching the leaves just so, that hour when the primroses are poised on the edge of glory. A solo gardener rolls out the garden like a performance. It is part of entertaining, a tool of friendship. This is fun and I wish we did more of it - I suspect that this side of gardening gets sublimated in the casual sharing of coupledom. Balanced against presenting the garden as an all-singing, all-dancing personal work of art is the simple pleasure of gardening. Quietly pottering around with just a radio for company is one of the great secrets of happiness: not doing anything for show or public acclaim, but simply for the love of it. Alone. My roots: A week in Monty's garden We shall have a bonfire tonight unless the rain is torrential, but I know there are some people who find bonfires deeply antisocial, about on par with people smoking in restaurants. I had a letter from someone saying his asthma drove him indoors every time one of his neighbours lit up, so to speak. But we keep the bonfire heap as a vital piece of the garden and its presence is the source of constant debate. We have a good bonfire site with room to put all burnable rubbish, but it does take up a lot of space. Yet life would be difficult without a bonfire at all. You cannot compost or shred everything. What do you do with the bindweed, ground elder and couch-grass roots, diseased hellebore leaves or box-hedge clippings? What do you do with your magazines? (Not this one, of course - it composts beautifully.) Surely it is better to burn these things and spread the ashes on the garden than to add to the huge quantity of rubbish that goes into landfill sites? We can't move it nearer the neighbours lest they rush in, batten down all their windows and reach for the phone to complain, as well they might. And anyway, there is nowhere else it could go without severe horticultural compromise. Problems, problems. Because of my dodgy shoulder I've been wandering around the garden looking much more than usual. Normally I look until I see an irresistible job and close my eyes to everything else until that is done. But for the last week I have been out, new digital Ixus in hand, taking pictures. The pictures then fly down onto my computer screen and I spend hours studying them. It is both a record for next year's planting and also a means of objectively assessing what is going right and wrong without the sensual assault of real life. I spent an hour cutting back the leaves of hellebores. These have been seeding themselves freely and H orientalis has really taken hold in the Spring Garden. I long to cut all the old off, but I restricted myself to the noticeably diseased or floppy. I shall have another session at it in the new year, when they have drawn all possible nourishment from their old foliage. Your roots: Planting tulips and storing dahlias November is the best time to plant tulips. Actually, it is the best time to plant just about anything, but especially tulips. There are two schools of thought about tulip planting. The conventional one is that they need planting particularly deep - which means making a hole about 6in deep, preferably with an inch or two of grit popped in the hole first, to add to the drainage. This is a counsel of perfection and applies really to tulips planted in mixed borders where they are to remain in position all their lives. The other method is to plant them an inch or so down with a trowel, where they will get at the best soil, and then to lift them after flowering to be replanted next year. Lift the tubers of dahlias as soon as they blacken off and die down. Cut off the top growth and store in a box of dry soil or potting compost. It is a mistake to let them completely dry out, although they should be stored in a dry, cool (but frost-free) and dark place. Check them every few weeks to see that they are not drying up too much or being attacked by mice.",

      "body": "<p>No sooner have you dusted yourself down, picked up the pieces and returned to that blissful state of emotional tranquillity and delicious self-indulgence, then along comes somebody to mess it all up again. Within weeks, your social life has been pruned down to the occasional dinner party with other couples, while weekends are spent fighting over the remote control and trying to lure the lumpish body next to you out for a walk. A life that you managed perfectly yourself becomes a minefield of tricky situations brought about by attempting to share responsibilities. </p> <p>Yet the coveted state of singledom continues to be seen as a compromise. When was the last time you heard somebody say pityingly, 'Poor thing, she's still married, you know' - yet that's exactly the sort of presumptuous insult that's hurled at the single dweller on a regular basis. This despite the fact that many marriages involve more misery and compromise than most people who choose to go it alone will experience in a lifetime. The accepted wisdom, that from the day we're born we're duty bound to seek out a like-minded person who'll make two become one, defies logic. You only need the most basic grasp of mathematics to know that two is always two. </p> <p>I had my macro Damascene revelation on the joys of being single about three years ago. It was early morning and the pale light of a wintry sun trickled through my bed-room curtains as I stretched myself diagonally over the expanse of my double bed. Wearing my recently departed ex's pyjama bottoms and my own vest, I shuffled into the kitchen and prepared myself a cappuccino and a bowl of cereal. Then, picking up the newspaper from my doorstep, I slipped back between the still-warm sheets. The radio alarm had switched itself on, and John Humphrys's sonorous tones were reassuring me that, despite a few hiccups, the world hadn't ended overnight. </p> <p>As I lolled around on my bed reading the news and trying to remember my plans for the day ahead, I experienced a quiver of smug contentment. No more breakfast television, no more checking my watch when I was enjoying the company of friends, no more declining of invitations from people who bored him or vice versa, as much theatre as I wanted, no more Sky Sport. The list of my blessings was endless. I was free. I was single again. After years of whining self pity during my regular phases of being single I'd suddenly realised that, far from a being punishment, it was an idyllic state to be savoured. </p> <p>Of course, you can write me off as being a smug yuppie with a comfortable lifestyle and a selfish nature. But you'd be wrong. My modicum of financial security was hard earned, and as for being single, I've tried as hard as anyone to make terrible relationships work. Yet it never occurred to me to rise to the converse challenge of creating a worthwhile lifestyle alone. Like most people in their late thirties, over the last 20 years I've succumbed to the lure of cohabitation on a few occasions. My ex-boyfriends remain good friends, but as I watch them fall like skittles into new unions, I find surprisingly that I don't envy them at all. I've no doubt that despite my best efforts I won't remain in this heavenly state uninterrupted, but the chances are I will return to it again, and again, and again. Marriage has an undeserved reputation as the only way of life worth aspiring to, cohabitation comes a close second, and the popular misconception is that no one would choose to be single. A faintly hypocritical scenario when you look at the state of modern relationships. In the clear light of day, and with the right attitude, going it alone offers many advantages. </p> <p>Nevertheless, being single, particularly as a woman, continues to get a bad press. Pitied (poor thing can't get a man), vilified (single-mum syndrome) or condescended to (isn't it time you grew up) but never celebrated as a chosen way of life. I don't want to turn this into a diatribe about the male of the species - in general I have only the fondest feelings for the opposite sex - but it does seem slightly unjust that when a man chooses to remain a bachelor, he's openly envied by his cohabiting friends and admired by the world at large. A woman in the same position finds none of that respect forthcoming, and can only pray that the day the label 'single' turns to 'spinster' is further away than her menopause. For centuries, men have been prolonging their 'merry bachelor' days. Is it mere coincidence that women only reach a similar jovial state when they become 'merry widows'? I suppose it stands to reason. If a woman has never had the 'official' stamp of approval from a man, then what on earth has she got to be happy about? </p> <p>Any declaration on the joys of being single is invariably met with a sympathetic smile and a pat on the head for being brave enough to pretend you're not suicidal. If you don't answer questions regarding your love life with a resigned shrug and an 'I'll try to do better' attitude, people think there's something wrong with you. No matter how good a time you're having as a single woman, you are expected to be a bit ashamed. It wouldn't do to turn up to a dinner party and boast about the incredible sex you had all weekend with a man you met at a fabulous party two weeks previous. 'What a shame you couldn't get a babysitter; don't even remember what time we left but we danced for hours.' The couples who weren't plain horrified at the notion of such grotesquely casual sex (funny how moralistic people get after they've settled down) would be consumed with envy disguised as sympathy for your delusional state. 'I honestly think she really believes she's enjoying herself,' accompanied by a caring shake of the head while you're happily showing off your bite marks to the person sitting next to you. </p> <p>Sex for the single girl is unquestionably a tricky issue. Even in these supposedly emancipated times, it's still regarded as an activity that men should take pride in doing a lot of and women should try hard to pretend they never indulge in - unless it's in a monogamous, long-term relationship. Well, we all make mistakes and the longevity of the relationship is something none of us can guarantee when, overcome by passion, we find ourselves cavorting on the sofa. Unless, of course, we have a hotline to Mystic Meg. </p> <p>Women may be less profligate with their sexual favours, but they get just as bored by regular bad sex, or indeed just the same old sex. A married girlfriend recently turned to me in fury when I questioned the wisdom of her flirtation with another man. 'You have no idea what it's like to sleep with the same man day in, day out for 15 years. Why shouldn't I have a tiny frisson of excitement in my life?' </p> <p>I'm not recommending infidelity, but she had a point. As Bridget Jones so rightly said, if every married person who condescendingly enquires as to whether you've 'found a boyfriend yet?' had to illuminate you on the last time they had exciting sex (or just sex), they would soon desist. 'Yes, I've found a boyfriend, two or three this year, actually! Oh sorry, don't look so disappointed; didn't mean to gloat. How's Charles?' </p> <p>Most of my married friends question me relentlessly about whom I'm dating in a way single friends fail to do. My independently minded friends aren't less interested, they're just way too busy living their own lives - something I'm afraid cohabitees stop doing the minute they start sharing a front door. How else do you explain the wistful look in their eyes when you tell them you're off to Vietnam for a month? The urgency of their messages when a newspaper reports on an alleged tryst with George Clooney? The obvious resentment when you're shopping together at the Gap and you buy yourself a leather skirt while they hunt for baby dungarees? </p> <p>Men understood way back the benefits of staying single for as long as possible. It wasn't an enlightened state brought about by superior intelligence, but during the Dark Ages only they had the wherewithal. Now, finally, women have the opportunity to enjoy the lifestyle they've worked hard to create. Only a lunatic would leap off that bandwagon having only just managed to manoeuvre your way on! The second your deposit account has upwards of a three-figure balance is surely not the time to throw in the towel and start procreating. The fun is only just beginning. Hooking up with someone involves such a plethora of compromises that just thinking about it makes me nervous. I haven't slogged my guts out for 20 years to spend my much-needed holidays with a man who wants to play Moby Dick on a sun lounger while I trail around the cultural hotspots desperately wishing I had a girlfriend there to keep me company. Or, worse still, not even getting to make those trips thanks to an endless stream of boring in-laws whose only interest is in whether you're up the duff yet. I have trouble enough trying to keep up with my own family without embracing the assorted dysfunction of somebody else's. </p> <p>I want to see the world, meet Machiavellian people, read more books, sleep in, stay out, spend three weeks in a row without switching the television on, eat toast and Marmite four times a day for a month. None of those minor indulgences seem possible once you've let a partner muscle in on your life. Yet I have to listen to endless diatribes from unsingle buddies trying to convince me (and more frequently themselves) that life has perked up since they found someone to push the trolley around Sainsbury's for them. I can let weeks go by without venturing anywhere near a supermarket. Contrary to popular perception, when I open the fridge door and discover only a bottle of delicious wine and a bag of prunes (instead of several varieties of fruit juice and a winebox that hides the telltale signs of tippling) I'm not depressed for a moment. Instead I'm beside myself with relief that it's not full of snack-sized Babybels and six-packs of hideous fruit yogurts. </p> <p>The other day I found myself plucking the ends off a bag full of exotic salad leaves because my friend's husband doesn't enjoy the stems. 'Tell him to do it himself,' I finally snapped when the mundanity of my task grew too much to bear and the gales of laughter from the guests in the sitting room too enticing. 'That's the sort of attitude that explains why you'll never find a husband,' she retorted. Was it churlish of me to point out that that's one of the myriad reasons I don't want another husband at present? </p> <p> For, yes, I too once fell by the wayside. Marriage is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, I now consider on a par with smoking - a bad habit that you either pick up when you're young, or manage to avoid until you're old enough not to care about the repercussions. I leapt enthusiastically into that cauldron at the age of 18 and back out again three years later with third-degree emotional burns. Friends often ask why I don't describe myself as a divorc\u00e9e. When I ask why I should, they mumble an answer which even they are embarrassed to be verbalising. Being divorced is still considered a step better than single, apparently. It means someone once wanted you. No surprise, then, that 'spinster' is by definition a woman who was never lucky enough to marry, yet bachelors remain bachelors forever if they so desire. Society wants to be able to easily identify these poor, failed specimens so we can learn by their mistakes. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm less proud of the fact I made an error once than I am of my choice to remain independent ever since. </p> <p>When you ask people to define single, they often find themselves at a loss for words. Does it mean someone who lives alone? Someone who's not dating? In that case, I wasn't single last week; I'm single at present; but between now and the New Year, I'll probably only be single for a couple of weeks. The whole notion of singledom in an era of escalating divorce rates, when unconventional liaisons often outlive their more conventional friends' unions, is faintly ridiculous. It's also a label that only counts in the eye of the beholder. Unless I take out an ad in a national newspaper to announce my union with another or have sex publicly and regularly with one partner, I will continue to be perceived as single. What I do in my private life and the privacy of my own bedroom, or his, or wherever else we choose, doesn't alter my status unless I make a public declaration. One of the happiest couples I know lives in separate flats in the same building. Are they single or just plain happy? It makes you wonder if the only reason we do get married or cohabit is to convince other people that we're not repulsive. </p> <p>The independence of a career introduces the possibility of choosing to live alone, and it's an improvement to the status quo that my generation seem all too happy to embrace. Remember, we've lived through the Ice Storm era. Watched our parents fight their way through unhappy marriages or deal with society's disapproval if they chose to escape. That scourge of society, a single mother, raised me. With no money and no man to speak of, she brought up four functional, participating members of society. Five, if you count me! Now she's finally enjoying her 'state of independence' holidays with friends to Spain or Italy, weekends at music festivals in Wales - she never seems to have a spare moment.The opportunity to have similar choices without waiting for my widow's pension is a legacy my mother and her generation fought hard to be able to hand down. I'm not so naive as to believe you can have it all, but you've certainly got to try and get your paws on as much as possible while you can. </p> <p>Perhaps my own experiences of 'happy coupledom' have something to do with my reticence to share door keys at present. They say that living alone is lonely, but I don't think I've ever felt as alone as in the twilight months of a relationship when a once-busy double bed has become as wide and desolate as Antarctica. The possibility of reaching out for comfort from the other side is as ridiculous as warming your hands on an ice cube. </p> <p>Other low points of cohabitation include the plentiful nights I spent during one four-year tryst sitting at home with my lovingly prepared dinner for two while my partner went AWOL in the Bermuda triangle of Notting Hill pubs. During another relationship, I experienced the most miserable day of my working life. My partners dispensed with my services and my hitherto loyal assistant, with whom I'd been planning to set up a new business, deserted me for their offer of a new car. I called my boyfriend in tears and he offered to leave work early and meet me at home for crisis counselling. I raced back longing for a shoulder to cry and instead found myself weeping into my own chest for much of the night. He finally stumbled in at 2am mumbling about a prior engagement. Nowadays when I'm in trouble I know where to turn. </p> <p> Friendships are the one essential ingredient to a happy life that no single person can afford to underestimate. In the old days, the accepted form of behaviour when you managed to grab hold of a partner was to ditch your pals. Post singledom, your main contact was on the rare occasions when you tried to set them up with someone else. Again an arrogant assumption that what they really, really want is to be just like you. The 'libbers' of old may have been comrades on the picket line, but they kept one eye on their 'sisters in arms' to make sure they weren't running off with their husbands. They still lived in a dog eat dog world where hanging on to your man was imperative - perhaps the reason that old retainers like Fay Weldon and Janet Street Porter still rarely have a good word to say about their own sex. </p> <p>Nowadays we tend to value friendship much more than the opportunity of a leg-over with a pal's husband. For the post-marriage generation, friendship has established itself as the most stable relationship on offer. My friends and I joke about putting our savings into a farmhouse in Tuscany that we can share when we're old and incontinent. We plan on wheeling each other around and reminiscing while making passes at our hunky young gardeners. Friends are for life, while boyfriends tend to come and go. It's your friends who'll prop you up when your relationship crumbles, or you lose your job or life just gets too much. </p> <p>Of course there are lonely days and empty nights, but not just for people who choose to live alone - times when you want a cuddle and there's nobody there, or medicinal sex and not with a stranger. And of course the perfect relationship is an enticing dream. I used to experience physical heartache when watching an ex-boyfriend's parents together. They'd been married for 50 years, and yet when they danced with each other, they still looked like honeymooners. They used to wander around their own garden hand in hand, for heaven's sake! </p> <p>In this fractured world, that sort of 'happy marriage' is becoming an oxymoron. I'd like to have children and hope it will be with someone who adds another dimension to my life. It's true that one can never make two, but if you're lucky two can sometimes be better than one. Especially when they go on to make three and four. Meanwhile, and maybe forever, I intend to gobble up the world in gargantuan chunks. I have a suspicion that spending more time on enjoying your life and less time on seeking a partner may ultimately be the secret to both. One thing's for sure, though. Sitting around moping and waiting for Lancelot is a waste of time. And that's one thing you never have enough of.</p>",

Or, worse still, not even getting to make those trips thanks to an endless stream of boring in-laws whose only interest is in whether you're up the duff yet. I have trouble enough trying to keep up with my own family without embracing the assorted dysfunction of somebody else's. I want to see the world, meet Machiavellian people, read more books, sleep in, stay out, spend three weeks in a row without switching the television on, eat toast and Marmite four times a day for a month. None of those minor indulgences seem possible once you've let a partner muscle in on your life. Yet I have to listen to endless diatribes from unsingle buddies trying to convince me (and more frequently themselves) that life has perked up since they found someone to push the trolley around Sainsbury's for them. I can let weeks go by without venturing anywhere near a supermarket. Contrary to popular perception, when I open the fridge door and discover only a bottle of delicious wine and a bag of prunes (instead of several varieties of fruit juice and a winebox that hides the telltale signs of tippling) I'm not depressed for a moment. Instead I'm beside myself with relief that it's not full of snack-sized Babybels and six-packs of hideous fruit yogurts. The other day I found myself plucking the ends off a bag full of exotic salad leaves because my friend's husband doesn't enjoy the stems. 'Tell him to do it himself,' I finally snapped when the mundanity of my task grew too much to bear and the gales of laughter from the guests in the sitting room too enticing. 'That's the sort of attitude that explains why you'll never find a husband,' she retorted. Was it churlish of me to point out that that's one of the myriad reasons I don't want another husband at present? For, yes, I too once fell by the wayside. Marriage is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, I now consider on a par with smoking - a bad habit that you either pick up when you're young, or manage to avoid until you're old enough not to care about the repercussions. I leapt enthusiastically into that cauldron at the age of 18 and back out again three years later with third-degree emotional burns. Friends often ask why I don't describe myself as a divorc\u00e9e. When I ask why I should, they mumble an answer which even they are embarrassed to be verbalising. Being divorced is still considered a step better than single, apparently. It means someone once wanted you. No surprise, then, that 'spinster' is by definition a woman who was never lucky enough to marry, yet bachelors remain bachelors forever if they so desire. Society wants to be able to easily identify these poor, failed specimens so we can learn by their mistakes. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm less proud of the fact I made an error once than I am of my choice to remain independent ever since. When you ask people to define single, they often find themselves at a loss for words. Does it mean someone who lives alone? Someone who's not dating? In that case, I wasn't single last week; I'm single at present; but between now and the New Year, I'll probably only be single for a couple of weeks. The whole notion of singledom in an era of escalating divorce rates, when unconventional liaisons often outlive their more conventional friends' unions, is faintly ridiculous. It's also a label that only counts in the eye of the beholder. Unless I take out an ad in a national newspaper to announce my union with another or have sex publicly and regularly with one partner, I will continue to be perceived as single. What I do in my private life and the privacy of my own bedroom, or his, or wherever else we choose, doesn't alter my status unless I make a public declaration. One of the happiest couples I know lives in separate flats in the same building. Are they single or just plain happy? It makes you wonder if the only reason we do get married or cohabit is to convince other people that we're not repulsive. The independence of a career introduces the possibility of choosing to live alone, and it's an improvement to the status quo that my generation seem all too happy to embrace. Remember, we've lived through the Ice Storm era. Watched our parents fight their way through unhappy marriages or deal with society's disapproval if they chose to escape. That scourge of society, a single mother, raised me. With no money and no man to speak of, she brought up four functional, participating members of society. Five, if you count me! Now she's finally enjoying her 'state of independence' holidays with friends to Spain or Italy, weekends at music festivals in Wales - she never seems to have a spare moment.The opportunity to have similar choices without waiting for my widow's pension is a legacy my mother and her generation fought hard to be able to hand down. I'm not so naive as to believe you can have it all, but you've certainly got to try and get your paws on as much as possible while you can. Perhaps my own experiences of 'happy coupledom' have something to do with my reticence to share door keys at present. They say that living alone is lonely, but I don't think I've ever felt as alone as in the twilight months of a relationship when a once-busy double bed has become as wide and desolate as Antarctica. The possibility of reaching out for comfort from the other side is as ridiculous as warming your hands on an ice cube. Other low points of cohabitation include the plentiful nights I spent during one four-year tryst sitting at home with my lovingly prepared dinner for two while my partner went AWOL in the Bermuda triangle of Notting Hill pubs. During another relationship, I experienced the most miserable day of my working life. My partners dispensed with my services and my hitherto loyal assistant, with whom I'd been planning to set up a new business, deserted me for their offer of a new car. I called my boyfriend in tears and he offered to leave work early and meet me at home for crisis counselling. I raced back longing for a shoulder to cry and instead found myself weeping into my own chest for much of the night. He finally stumbled in at 2am mumbling about a prior engagement. Nowadays when I'm in trouble I know where to turn. Friendships are the one essential ingredient to a happy life that no single person can afford to underestimate. In the old days, the accepted form of behaviour when you managed to grab hold of a partner was to ditch your pals. Post singledom, your main contact was on the rare occasions when you tried to set them up with someone else. Again an arrogant assumption that what they really, really want is to be just like you. The 'libbers' of old may have been comrades on the picket line, but they kept one eye on their 'sisters in arms' to make sure they weren't running off with their husbands. They still lived in a dog eat dog world where hanging on to your man was imperative - perhaps the reason that old retainers like Fay Weldon and Janet Street Porter still rarely have a good word to say about their own sex. Nowadays we tend to value friendship much more than the opportunity of a leg-over with a pal's husband. For the post-marriage generation, friendship has established itself as the most stable relationship on offer. My friends and I joke about putting our savings into a farmhouse in Tuscany that we can share when we're old and incontinent. We plan on wheeling each other around and reminiscing while making passes at our hunky young gardeners. Friends are for life, while boyfriends tend to come and go. It's your friends who'll prop you up when your relationship crumbles, or you lose your job or life just gets too much. Of course there are lonely days and empty nights, but not just for people who choose to live alone - times when you want a cuddle and there's nobody there, or medicinal sex and not with a stranger. And of course the perfect relationship is an enticing dream. I used to experience physical heartache when watching an ex-boyfriend's parents together. They'd been married for 50 years, and yet when they danced with each other, they still looked like honeymooners. They used to wander around their own garden hand in hand, for heaven's sake! In this fractured world, that sort of 'happy marriage' is becoming an oxymoron. I'd like to have children and hope it will be with someone who adds another dimension to my life. It's true that one can never make two, but if you're lucky two can sometimes be better than one. Especially when they go on to make three and four. Meanwhile, and maybe forever, I intend to gobble up the world in gargantuan chunks. I have a suspicion that spending more time on enjoying your life and less time on seeking a partner may ultimately be the secret to both. One thing's for sure, though. Sitting around moping and waiting for Lancelot is a waste of time. And that's one thing you never have enough of.",

      "body": "<p>At one o'clock tomorrow afternoon, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, will sit down to a light buffet lunch with a small group of men in his office in Queen Anne's Gate in London. Over smoked salmon sandwiches and sparkling mineral water, they will review the war so far and look forward to the battles that lie ahead. On the sofas around the low coffee table will be Straw's junior Ministers, their aide, and a handful of key advisers. The weekly meetings tend to be informal and convivial. Tomorrow, the mood will be sterner.</p> <p>The next 10 days may see Britain plunged into chaos not seen since the late Seventies. Protests against fuel prices will rage up and down the country. Motorways will be jammed with convoys of trucks; airports ringed with trailers. Fishing boats will block the Thames. Petrol stations will be out of fuel and supermarkets out of food. There will be running battles with the police. In September Britain staggered badly as protests flashed from Dartmouth to Dundee. This time, the protesters hope, Britain will be stretched full length on the tarmac.</p> <p>But, if Straw and his people have done their work well, there will be nothing more than a couple of heavily policed demonstrations and a few minor disruptions. They may distract momentarily from the chaos on the railways and the floods. The activists' hopes of forcing a cut in fuel tax, let alone a general election, will look risible. By the end of the month they will be back in their farmhouses and haulage firm offices with their exhaust pipes firmly between their legs.</p> <p>One of the biggest and most sophisticated operations of its kind ever run by a British government - involving tens of thousands of people from press officers to the head of MI5, from Army generals to low-level union officials - will have worked. The battle will have been won.</p> <p>At the Muir Town Lodge Hotel on the bleak shores of the Moray Firth in northern Scotland, there was talk of revolution last Wednesday night at an open meeting of the People's Fuel Lobby (PFL). Mark Francis, a haulier from Rhyl in Wales and a leader of the PFL, told the crowd that their cause was right and that if they held firm they would win the fight.</p> <p>The crowd listened carefully. Then several stood up to talk. A housewife said the cost of fuel was ruining her budget; a tourist worker said coaches couldn't afford to drive up from England to the Highlands. After two and a half hours, the meeting broke up. Within hours PFL leaders were heading for Newcastle and another planning session.</p> <p>Their aim is simple: to repeat what happened two months ago. Then, a dozen or so committed men caused chaos on a scale not seen in Britain for nearly 20 years. They forced the Government on to the defensive and, for one astonishing week, rode an unprecedented wave of public support. Only when the supermarkets were out of bread and milk, when hospitals cut back operations, when most fuel stations were out of petrol, did they end their protests. Almost overnight the blockades outside the oil refineries and the convoys jamming the motorways disappeared.</p> <p>But the activists, an ad hoc alliance of the frantic, the fanatic and the plain fed-up, did not end their protests unconditionally. Unless Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, made some move to lessen the burden of high fuel prices then, they made clear, the blockades would be back. Their deadline expires a week tomorrow. This Wednesday Brown is due to make his 'pre-Budget statement'. He is not expected to give much, if any, ground. The activists' demands of a 26p cut in the tax on fuel has fallen on deaf ears. There will be no 'hand-outs'.</p> <p>Brown and the protesters agree on one thing: if you want a fight, they are both saying, you can have one. And the fight will be fierce.</p> <p>'At the end of the day we are going to cause as much mayhem as possible,' Nigel Kime, a Lincolnshire haulier at the forefront of September's protests, told The Observer last week.</p> <p>Even the protesters don't yet know quite what form that mayhem will take. The aim is to cause disruption across the country. Last time oil refineries and fuel terminals were the primary target. But, as the oil firms have boosted defences - Shell's Stanlow refinery now boasts new concrete barriers - they may not be an initial target this time. Other plans include:</p> <p>\u0095 using trucks to blockade food distribution centres;</p> <p>\u0095 disrupting the National Grid by switching on farming and light industrial machinery to create surges of demand;</p> <p>\u0095 creating roadblocks by draining vehicles of fuel;</p> <p>\u0095 holding protests across railway lines to halt trains;</p> <p>\u0095 blockading milk depots;</p> <p>\u0095 organising small-scale strikes among supporters;</p> <p>\u0095 and demonstrating outside the homes of Labour MPs.</p> <p>Even before the expiry of the 13 November deadline some protesters will already be on the road. A convoy of lorries and tractors will leave Jarrow on Friday and head south at 25 mph through Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Milton Keynes. A second convoy will leave John O'Groats heading for Edinburgh. By the time the main protest reaches London, on 14 November, the organisers hope it will be causing traffic queues 100 miles long.</p> <p>It will end - if the police let it - with a rally in Hyde Park. At the same time a fleet of trawlers will block the Thames. The protesters hope they can snarl up the capital for a week.</p> <p>'Seven days in London should present us with no problems,' says Kime, 37. 'If we end up stuck on the M25, then so be it. If we block up London, then we can seriously damage three major airports.'</p> <p>The key organiser is David Handley, a Monmouthshire farmer who heads the PFL and the more militant Farmers For Action. Handley, 48, has more than \u00a340,000 of debts and has been protesting on behalf of farmers for five years. His dairy farm, rented from Monmouthshire County Council, could soon be taken from him.</p> <p>Handley has left the running of his 88-acre property to his wife and dedicated himself to his campaigns. His boast that he can trigger protests practically anywhere at anytime is not idle. A 'bush telegraph' of mobile phones connecting hundreds of activists has been proven effective.</p> <p>He is not alone. Many, especially in north Wales, will be looking to Brynle Williams, a hillfarmer from near Mold, for leadership. Williams set the protesters' 60-day deadline and led the first protests in September. His associates say they are ready to go to jail.</p> <p>'Let them arrest us. Let's see how big their jail cells really are,' said Clive Swan, a neighbour of Williams's.</p> <p>Police and protesters worry that a few hotheads will hijack the demonstrations. There is evidence of infiltration from far right-wing organisations. There has also been interest from the left, from both anarchist groups and the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I am very worried. As soon as anything violent happens I'm off home,' said Rhys Parry, a farmer who co-ordinates protests in South Wales.</p> <p>The demonstrators' actions will put larger organisations sympathetic to their aims in a difficult position. The Road Haulage Association, the National Farmers Union and the Countryside Alliance all officially oppose direct action. But they face enormous pressure from members who support the protests. Handley is a member of the CA, and Williams is an official in the NFU. For everybody concerned the stakes are high.</p> <p>The Government's planning started in earnest on 18 September, days after the end of the last protests, with a meeting of a 'Fuel Task Force' in the Cabinet Office and of the Civil Contingency Committee, the Government's key crisis management unit.</p> <p>Blair and Straw knew they had to get it right. In the aftermath of the first blockades, the Tories overtook Labour in the polls, albeit fleetingly, for the first time since the 1992 election. The pair agreed that the Government had appeared to lose control.</p> <p>Their strategy was careful and clever. The Government worked out the threats they faced, then moved to eliminate them. One of Straw's first acts was to order one of the biggest undercover operations against non-terrorist targets in Britain for 20 years.</p> <p>Every local police force's Special Branch began to gather intelligence on the main leaders of the protests. The local media was monitored. Dossiers were compiled of activists' police records, finances and political views. Many were put under 'soft' surveillance.</p> <p>The Observer has learnt that operatives from MI5, the domestic security service, infiltrated a number of the more aggressive groups. Their information was critical in determining the Government's tactics. The divisions within the activists - particularly between Williams and Handley - were key.</p> <p>'It was perfect,' one intelligence source said. 'It played to one of this government's greatest strengths.'</p> <p>One of the first lessons learned from the September crisis was the importance of winning public opinion early. The Home Office and Downing Street agreed that a seven-day campaign of media management was needed. Those seven days ended yesterday.</p> <p>Last week was chosen as 'fuel week' because it looked like it would be quiet. Downing Street allowed only one key announcement a day.</p> <p>First, two Sunday newspapers were briefed about plans to use the military to make sure fuel got through. When The Observer had run the story a week earlier, government press officers downplayed it. Now they cranked as hard as they could.</p> <p>On Monday Straw urged people to 'get in stocks' and spoke of the threat to the NHS. On Tuesday and Wednesday Blair repeatedly said the Government would not act when threatened. At the end of the week Straw rammed the message home.</p> <p>There was a more aggressive side to the press campaign too. In September Handley had depicted himself as a Spartacus of the shires, a reasonable man pushed unwillingly to extreme action. It was essential to discredit him.</p> <p>Soon journalists came to hear, from concerned and anonnmous callers, about splits among the activists. Then came suggestions that Handley's business affairs might be worth looking at. One senior union official called him a 'latter-day Arthur Scargill'. A report detailing 180 alleged violent incidents directed at tanker drivers during the last protests was made public. Soon tabloid headlines were branding Handley a 'dangerous fool'.</p> <p>There was spin elsewhere too. Again and again spokesmen repeated that to cut fuel taxes would mean taking money from elsewhere. Predictably they said the money would come from the health service or pensioners. The storms battering the UK helped too. Global warming was highlighted as Ministers suddenly got very green.</p> <p>And, if the going does get tough, the Government has covered its flanks.</p> <p>The oil firms are well on board. During the first protests, when tanker drivers refused to cross picket lines, their relationship with Whitehall looked tense. Now they have pledged to Straw that they will do everything, without jeopardising drivers' safety, to get the tankers out.</p> <p>Essential services are now prepared - a clear contrast with last time. On 26 October, every NHS trust, local health authority, medical supply agency and the National Blood Service received a fax and email from Neil McKay, then the Acting Chief Executive of the NHS, suggesting they stockpile supplies and draw up contingency plans.</p> <p>Many petrol stations are storing three times as much fuel as usual. Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are taking their own precautions, buying storage tanks and jerry cans and filling up. Yesterday panic buying was continuing in southern England. The north was calmer, though there were problems in Liverpool.</p> <p>In the last resort the Government will use force. The policing of demonstrations will be far tougher than two months ago. Senior policemen say protesters are guilty of a criminal act even when just plotting to break the law. Pickets can be arrested for obstructing a public highway - as could slow-moving lorry drivers - or causing a breach of the peace. During the miners' strike pickets were prevented from travelling. 'There's no reason why we can't do the same now,' a former police officer and key government adviser said. Truckers have been warned that they face losing their operating licences if they break the law.</p> <p>And the Government has one last ace to play. A thousand soldiers are ready to drive tankers, more can drive trucks and several hundred men are trained to run the refineries. Between them they will ensure the fuel gets out.</p> <p>But the wild card is the public. The Government's control of public opinion is not as strong as it would like and opinion polls have shown support for the protesters is still high. There is a deep-seated conviction that the fuel tax - currently \u00a337 out of a \u00a350 fuel bill - is too high. There is a temptation to see deeper themes: the city against the country, the capital against the provinces, the urbanite Europhiles against those who have a very different view of what Britain is and should be.</p> <p>But, say academics, the emergence of a group of largely middle-class protesters signals the erosion of Britain's traditional class system rather than a reinforcement of divisions. New alignments are yet to be properly defined.</p> <p>Professor Rodney Barker, an expert on British civil disobedience at the London School of Economics, said: 'I could not have imagined this happening here 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. The fuel protesters may look like an anomaly, but they might well be a sign of things to come.'</p>",

Last week was chosen as 'fuel week' because it looked like it would be quiet. Downing Street allowed only one key announcement a day. First, two Sunday newspapers were briefed about plans to use the military to make sure fuel got through. When The Observer had run the story a week earlier, government press officers downplayed it. Now they cranked as hard as they could. On Monday Straw urged people to 'get in stocks' and spoke of the threat to the NHS. On Tuesday and Wednesday Blair repeatedly said the Government would not act when threatened. At the end of the week Straw rammed the message home. There was a more aggressive side to the press campaign too. In September Handley had depicted himself as a Spartacus of the shires, a reasonable man pushed unwillingly to extreme action. It was essential to discredit him. Soon journalists came to hear, from concerned and anonnmous callers, about splits among the activists. Then came suggestions that Handley's business affairs might be worth looking at. One senior union official called him a 'latter-day Arthur Scargill'. A report detailing 180 alleged violent incidents directed at tanker drivers during the last protests was made public. Soon tabloid headlines were branding Handley a 'dangerous fool'. There was spin elsewhere too. Again and again spokesmen repeated that to cut fuel taxes would mean taking money from elsewhere. Predictably they said the money would come from the health service or pensioners. The storms battering the UK helped too. Global warming was highlighted as Ministers suddenly got very green. And, if the going does get tough, the Government has covered its flanks. The oil firms are well on board. During the first protests, when tanker drivers refused to cross picket lines, their relationship with Whitehall looked tense. Now they have pledged to Straw that they will do everything, without jeopardising drivers' safety, to get the tankers out. Essential services are now prepared - a clear contrast with last time. On 26 October, every NHS trust, local health authority, medical supply agency and the National Blood Service received a fax and email from Neil McKay, then the Acting Chief Executive of the NHS, suggesting they stockpile supplies and draw up contingency plans. Many petrol stations are storing three times as much fuel as usual. Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are taking their own precautions, buying storage tanks and jerry cans and filling up. Yesterday panic buying was continuing in southern England. The north was calmer, though there were problems in Liverpool. In the last resort the Government will use force. The policing of demonstrations will be far tougher than two months ago. Senior policemen say protesters are guilty of a criminal act even when just plotting to break the law. Pickets can be arrested for obstructing a public highway - as could slow-moving lorry drivers - or causing a breach of the peace. During the miners' strike pickets were prevented from travelling. 'There's no reason why we can't do the same now,' a former police officer and key government adviser said. Truckers have been warned that they face losing their operating licences if they break the law. And the Government has one last ace to play. A thousand soldiers are ready to drive tankers, more can drive trucks and several hundred men are trained to run the refineries. Between them they will ensure the fuel gets out. But the wild card is the public. The Government's control of public opinion is not as strong as it would like and opinion polls have shown support for the protesters is still high. There is a deep-seated conviction that the fuel tax - currently \u00a337 out of a \u00a350 fuel bill - is too high. There is a temptation to see deeper themes: the city against the country, the capital against the provinces, the urbanite Europhiles against those who have a very different view of what Britain is and should be. But, say academics, the emergence of a group of largely middle-class protesters signals the erosion of Britain's traditional class system rather than a reinforcement of divisions. New alignments are yet to be properly defined. Professor Rodney Barker, an expert on British civil disobedience at the London School of Economics, said: 'I could not have imagined this happening here 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. The fuel protesters may look like an anomaly, but they might well be a sign of things to come.'",

I would like to go back to the beginning and ask you how you decided that you wanted to act, what made you choose that career path?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I think the first time that I was ever on stage was when I was at St Mary's Academy boarding school in Windsor, Ontario, and I was six years old. And I guess it was a Christmas programme, and we did, you know, little nursery rhymes, and I was Little Miss Muffet, sitting on her tuffet. </p> <p>I remember my mother came to see the programme, and I just have this one image of being on stage, looking out into the blackness of the auditorium and not being able to see any faces, but knowing where my mother was - sensing her presence in a particular place. There are no thoughts or anything from that time, it was just that moment of looking out into the darkness and feeling my mother there. It was like something imprinted on my brain. It was like my destiny or something was established and any time I went on stage after that, I got that same kind of feeling.</p> <p>I remember my first audition in New York - I should actually tell you how I came to have an audition. It was kind of funny really, when I started working after I got out of school I was first a dancer, in night-clubs, and then a model, I modelled for several years in New York. Then when I was 23, I think, I said, 'All right. I've made up my mind, I want to be an actress. I want to do a Broadway play this fall. Does anybody know how I can get an audition?'.</p> <p>And it was, you know, innocent and foolish and probably a little stupid, except that someone did get me an audition and I did get the part. It was a lead on Broadway, and that's how I became an actress. But at the audition I remember going out on stage - the play was called Fair Game, and I was playing a model - and the audition scene was her first day in New York, having come from the midwest, to become a model. </p> <p>Just as I had come from the midwest, Detroit. So I got on stage, and I was at the Paramount theatre, and the director and the producer were up there, and I thought to myself, 'Well, here I am on my first day in my new apartment in New York, I remember what that was like'. And I was just about to begin and I said, 'OK. My first day, my first apartment. In New York. And I'm in it now'. </p> <p>Then this voice in my head said, 'No. You are on the stage in the Ethel Barrymore theatre, auditioning for your first Broadway play'. And I got so excited that it gave me everything I needed to play the scene. And I didn't realise it then, but I found out years later when I went to Lee Strasberg, that that's method acting. That it's using the truth of the situation to stimulate you to play the fiction. That's the kind of kernel of the technique. So, um, I don't know, but I think that my destiny was established in that one little moment, but I didn't really decide to do it until I was 23, or 24, I can't remember exactly. </p> <p>Later I realised, when I was reading a book called Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, by Suzuki, a Buddhist monk, that what I had done was what's called Beginner's Way - where you don't have enough information to do it wrong, so you just blunder in and do it right. And later, when you start learning a little bit about it you think, 'Oh dear. Maybe I shouldn't have done that'. And then you lose that ability to just do it. So that was when I started going to classes and taking acting lessons and learning how to do what I was bumbling into.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> You mentioned Lee Strasberg, and you went to the Actor's Studio. Can you say a little bit about that experience, and what you think you drew from that.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, after that play I had a career. I was working on Broadway and on television and in radio. I went to Los Angeles - not because I wanted to, but because my husband dragged me there - [Laughter] - and I was working in television and I did some films, and my career was sort of advancing. And then I got a good part, a co-starring part, not a starring part, in a movie called Goodbye Charlie, with Debbie Reynolds and Walter Matthau and Tony Curtis. </p> <p>I was sitting on the set one day and I had been sort of assembled. I was wearing an old wig of Shirley MacLaine's and Debbie Reynolds' brother Bill painted my face in a way that I almost recognised and I had this lovely dress, and I felt kind of put together to fit this character. And I was sitting on the set, Vincente Minnelli was the director, and I looked around, it was at 20th Century Fox, and I said to myself, 'Alright. This is it. This is the big-time', the next step would be to play the Debbie Reynolds part. And that same voice that spoke to me at the audition said, 'I don't wannit.'</p> <p>And I was absolutely startled. There was no thought process that led up to it at that time that said I didn't like the path I was on. It was just at that moment. I knew I didn't like the way my career was developing... not just my career, but my talent. So when the film was over, I packed up my things and left California and went back to New York and met Lee and started his private classes. I didn't go straight into the Actor's Studio, I studied with Lee for several years before I auditioned for the Actors' Studio and got in - and working for him was one of the most important experiences of my life. </p> <p>I don't know how many of you have had the experience of being exposed to a master teacher, but it is one of the really profound things that can happen to you, because they don't just teach you about your art, whatever it is, but they teach you about how, as you develop in your art, you are developing your own humanity. </p> <p>When I first worked for Lee - I'll tell you the first exercise we did. It was to create, with your senses, a sense memory exercise, whatever you had for breakfast, a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, or whatever it was. And you had to pick up your cup and feel it and feel its weight and the heat of it and whatever you did. So I was doing my cup, my first exercise for Lee, and I saw him look at the cards in his hands with the names on them, and I could feel he was focused on me and I thought, 'Aaarrhh, here he comes'. Because he had penetrating vision, you know, he really saw. </p> <p>So after a while he said, 'Do you ride horses?' and when he comes out of leftfield like that you know you're really in trouble. So I said, 'Well, I used to.' And he said, 'Did you ride well?', and I said, 'Well. I had my own horse and I rode well at that time.' Then he said, 'Well, you don't have to ride that cup!'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>I was... shocked! I looked at him and thought, 'What?' He said, 'What if you made a mistake? Go on. Let me see you do it. Make a mistake.' And I started crying, and I cried for about two weeks. And I can't even say in logical terms what it was that transpired there, but he saw something in me that I wasn't aware of - that it had to be perfect. And only when I learnt how to relax that, and not to ride the cup, that to be in the moment in all of its imperfections, whatever that entails, was I able to begin to learn how to act. I hope that's meaningful to you!</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Around about that time, when you were going through that process and your career was starting to take off, that period during the early 1970s we now tend to see as a very significant time for American cinema. A time when there was a sense of there being a new energy. Did it feel like that then?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, you know, I remember a couple of years ago reading something in a newspaper about the 'golden age' of cinema in the 1970s and I thought, 'Was it? I had no idea. Someone should have told us when we were doing it!' But it was a very fertile and fervent time in America. It was the time of the Vietnam war and the protests and everybody was very fired up - with LSD too - and Watergate, and all of the things that were going on at the time in the country. </p> <p>And we were all very active with this new energy. I think that somebody said once that only a small percentage of the population needs to do something like take LSD and everybody goes into an altered state. And I think that happened in America at that time. There was a sense that we were really contributing to culture and government and to what was happening. So I think that the cinema reflected that. I don't think that it was only happening in the cinema, but what was happening in the cinema was in the context of the time. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn1.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a></strong> (1min 31)]</p> <p>I feel like that there is a return now to that time, and I give a lot of credit to Robert Redford for starting Sundance because he intentionally made it possible for there to be a place for young film-makers to develop. And it was after the 70s that the corporations came in and took over the cinema, and it stopped being an art form in America - not completely, of course, but to a large degree - and it was people making films, not because they like to make films, but because they like to make money with films. </p> <p>I think that Robert Redford, and all the people that came out of that movement and are in it now, are taking the art form back, away from the corporations and now making films like the Yards by James Gray and Requiem for a Dream by Darren Aronofsky. They are film-makers who really love films. When James Gray offered me the part in The Yards, it was such a low offer my agent asked for more money. </p> <p>The studio wouldn't change the budget, so James offered to pay the difference himself. When he did that, of course the studio came up with the rest of the money! And he didn't get much money himself, so there is a passion in film-makers today, which I am pleased to see because that means that there are roles for me again.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> If we can go back a bit to The Last Picture Show, which was your first Academy Award nomination, for best supporting actress. Can you say a little about working on that film with Peter Bogdanovich?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I'll tell you a couple of stories that come to mind. First, the audition. There were three parts in that film I could have played - Lois, Ruth and the waitress in the restaurant. When I was sent to read the script I was asked to read for the waitress. I went in to meet Peter and I told him that I was happy to read the waitress, but I really wanted to be Lois. He said, alright, read them both. And then he asked me to read Ruth too. </p> <p>So I read and he said, 'OK, you're in the movie. Now we just have to figure out what part you're gonna play!' He called me at home and said, 'Look. I know you wanna play Lois, but I have a couple of choices for her, and I don't have anyone to play Ruth, so I really need you to play that if I don't find someone.' So I said I would. And then he said, 'You know, that's the Academy Award part.' </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>He did! And I said, 'You know, I just don't want to play that type of character right now.' I was going through a divorce, I was very unhappy and I wanted to play a character who was a little more on top of it rather than beneath it. So, lucky for me, he found Cloris Leachman, and she did win the Academy Award, but I got to play the part that I wanted. The scene you saw [ Lois advising her teenage daughter not to marry her boyfriend as life would soon become monotonous and dull] because it was shot in a little bedroom, there was no room to put the camera to do a master shot. </p> <p>Normally you would do the whole scene and then break it up into small pieces. But I was moving around the room a lot and there was no room for the camera. So there was just one set-up for each line, and each line was in a different place, so there were 10 camera moves. So I had no, kind of, run at the scene. </p> <p>I would just go to one place and do one line, and then he would say 'cut' and then we'd move the camera to the next place and do the next line. So it was a bit tricky to get continuity in it, because I had to do the transition from one moment to the next at the beginning of each set-up. I had to remember what I had just said and do the transition. Which I did. </p> <p>When it was edited together Peter showed it to me, the film wasn't edited yet, but he said he wanted me to see this scene. So when the lights went up he said, 'Do you like it?', and I said, 'No.' And he said, 'Why not?' and I said, 'Well, you've cut off all my transitions.' And without stopping he turned to the editor and said, 'Put the heads and tails on each of those takes, will ya?' And he put them all back on and that was what he used. I was always very impressed with him for being able to do that.</p> <p>Oh. One other wonderful story. The first time that we all got together to read the script, we were in a hotel outside San Antonio. It was like a Holiday Inn on the freeway and just massively depressing.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>We all got together around a table in a low-ceilinged room, and we hadn't met before, none of us knew each other - we were all unknown at the time. As the reading went along this feeling in the room began to grow, like, 'Come on! What have we got here?' and I remember as we finished the last line and closed our scripts there was a pause, and then somebody said, 'You know. This could be a good movie!'</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> I wanted to ask you a little about The Exorcist. It is one of the roles you've been most widely seen in. It must have been very demanding - physically demanding, apart from anything else.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Yup! It took us nine months to shoot it, I've never done any other film that took so long. Six day weeks, twelve hour days for nine months, it was really very, very stressful. And difficult in so many ways. Emotional heights that had to be hit and then sustained. </p> <p>When you do a master shot you have to hold on to what you've just done while they reset everything for the close-ups and I remember I had, because it was 1973, a big headset that was a radio and I would put that on so I could listen to some music and turn my chair to the wall to help keep me in whatever mood we had just established. </p> <p>So it seems to me that one of my main memories of that film was looking at a wall, listening to music. Because it was quite difficult to maintain that level of terror for so many hours and days and weeks and months. It was a big event in my life. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn2.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a></strong> (1min 47) ]</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Let's talk about Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. You won an Academy Award and a Bafta, and also it seems as though that was a very personal film that you were committed to getting made.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, while I was shooting The Exorcist, Warner Brothers was the studio and John Kelly was the executive. John was looking in the dailies every day back in Los Angeles - we were in New York and Washington - and he decided that he wanted to do another film with me, so he started sending me scripts. Now at that time, 1973, it was early in the woman's movement and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different. </p> <p>With that in mind, and what was happening to me and my own consciousness, as I looked at the scripts they all reflected the 'old position' of women. They were either victims, dutiful wives or prostitutes, or... well, that was pretty much it. I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognised, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, the script by Bob Getchell. </p> <p>When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said to look at a movie called Mean Streets, which hadn't been released yet. </p> <p>So I looked at it and I felt that it was exactly what the script of Alice needed, because Alice was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know - in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day-Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty. </p> <p>When I saw Mean Streets I felt that Martin [Scorsese] was the person who could do it. So I asked to meet him and he came to John Kelly's office - this very small, nervous little guy, he was very young then - and I told him how much I liked the film but I said, 'You know, it's hard to tell from that film what you know about women. Do you know anything about women?' and he said, 'No. But I'd like to learn!' So we went to work together and it was just one of the best experiences I've ever had. Marty has a way of providing a creative atmosphere on the set wherein the actors can do what they know how to do best. </p> <p>So the script is basically how Getchell wrote it, but with a lot of improvisation in rehearsal and a lot was added to it from our own lives. And a lot from my relationship with my son at that time worked its way into the film. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn3.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a></strong> (3mins 01) ]</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> That was something I wanted to ask you. What leaps of the screen is that incredible relationship you have between you and Alfred Lutter, who plays your son. I was interested in how you worked to get that.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, a lot of the things... well, I'm embarrassed to say that the clip you saw [ when Alice orders her son to write down all the bad things in his life on a piece of paper] actually happened between me and my son when I was at my wits' end. When I look at it now I think, 'God, I was being rather rough with that boy!' </p> <p>Alfred Lutter was a very bright boy, very bright and very bratty. He was very in the moment and very fine to work with. My son was on the set too, and he played the boy next door. And he wasn't a great fan of Alfred Lutter, actually. So there was a kind of feedback between the script and my life. </p> <p> <a href=\"/Film/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,393617,00.html\">To next page</a></p> <p><strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn1.ra\">On the 'golden age' of cinema in the 1970s</a> (1min 31) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn2.ra\">Working on The Exorcist</a> (1min 47) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn3.ra\">The genesis of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a> (1min 01) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn4.ra\">Working currently with young directors</a> (2mins 18) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn5.ra\">The physical hardships of shooting Requiem for a Dream</a> (3mins 22) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn6.ra\">On the roles for which she is best known, and the new version of The Exorcist</a> (1min 17)</p>",

It was a lead on Broadway, and that's how I became an actress. But at the audition I remember going out on stage - the play was called Fair Game, and I was playing a model - and the audition scene was her first day in New York, having come from the midwest, to become a model. Just as I had come from the midwest, Detroit. So I got on stage, and I was at the Paramount theatre, and the director and the producer were up there, and I thought to myself, 'Well, here I am on my first day in my new apartment in New York, I remember what that was like'. And I was just about to begin and I said, 'OK. My first day, my first apartment. In New York. And I'm in it now'. Then this voice in my head said, 'No. You are on the stage in the Ethel Barrymore theatre, auditioning for your first Broadway play'. And I got so excited that it gave me everything I needed to play the scene. And I didn't realise it then, but I found out years later when I went to Lee Strasberg, that that's method acting. That it's using the truth of the situation to stimulate you to play the fiction. That's the kind of kernel of the technique. So, um, I don't know, but I think that my destiny was established in that one little moment, but I didn't really decide to do it until I was 23, or 24, I can't remember exactly. Later I realised, when I was reading a book called Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, by Suzuki, a Buddhist monk, that what I had done was what's called Beginner's Way - where you don't have enough information to do it wrong, so you just blunder in and do it right. And later, when you start learning a little bit about it you think, 'Oh dear. Maybe I shouldn't have done that'. And then you lose that ability to just do it. So that was when I started going to classes and taking acting lessons and learning how to do what I was bumbling into. SH: You mentioned Lee Strasberg, and you went to the Actor's Studio. Can you say a little bit about that experience, and what you think you drew from that. EB: Well, after that play I had a career. I was working on Broadway and on television and in radio. I went to Los Angeles - not because I wanted to, but because my husband dragged me there - [Laughter] - and I was working in television and I did some films, and my career was sort of advancing. And then I got a good part, a co-starring part, not a starring part, in a movie called Goodbye Charlie, with Debbie Reynolds and Walter Matthau and Tony Curtis. I was sitting on the set one day and I had been sort of assembled. I was wearing an old wig of Shirley MacLaine's and Debbie Reynolds' brother Bill painted my face in a way that I almost recognised and I had this lovely dress, and I felt kind of put together to fit this character. And I was sitting on the set, Vincente Minnelli was the director, and I looked around, it was at 20th Century Fox, and I said to myself, 'Alright. This is it. This is the big-time', the next step would be to play the Debbie Reynolds part. And that same voice that spoke to me at the audition said, 'I don't wannit.' And I was absolutely startled. There was no thought process that led up to it at that time that said I didn't like the path I was on. It was just at that moment. I knew I didn't like the way my career was developing... not just my career, but my talent. So when the film was over, I packed up my things and left California and went back to New York and met Lee and started his private classes. I didn't go straight into the Actor's Studio, I studied with Lee for several years before I auditioned for the Actors' Studio and got in - and working for him was one of the most important experiences of my life. I don't know how many of you have had the experience of being exposed to a master teacher, but it is one of the really profound things that can happen to you, because they don't just teach you about your art, whatever it is, but they teach you about how, as you develop in your art, you are developing your own humanity. When I first worked for Lee - I'll tell you the first exercise we did. It was to create, with your senses, a sense memory exercise, whatever you had for breakfast, a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, or whatever it was. And you had to pick up your cup and feel it and feel its weight and the heat of it and whatever you did. So I was doing my cup, my first exercise for Lee, and I saw him look at the cards in his hands with the names on them, and I could feel he was focused on me and I thought, 'Aaarrhh, here he comes'. Because he had penetrating vision, you know, he really saw. So after a while he said, 'Do you ride horses?' and when he comes out of leftfield like that you know you're really in trouble. So I said, 'Well, I used to.' And he said, 'Did you ride well?', and I said, 'Well. I had my own horse and I rode well at that time.' Then he said, 'Well, you don't have to ride that cup!' [Laughter] I was... shocked! I looked at him and thought, 'What?' He said, 'What if you made a mistake? Go on. Let me see you do it. Make a mistake.' And I started crying, and I cried for about two weeks. And I can't even say in logical terms what it was that transpired there, but he saw something in me that I wasn't aware of - that it had to be perfect. And only when I learnt how to relax that, and not to ride the cup, that to be in the moment in all of its imperfections, whatever that entails, was I able to begin to learn how to act. I hope that's meaningful to you! SH: Around about that time, when you were going through that process and your career was starting to take off, that period during the early 1970s we now tend to see as a very significant time for American cinema. A time when there was a sense of there being a new energy. Did it feel like that then? EB: Well, you know, I remember a couple of years ago reading something in a newspaper about the 'golden age' of cinema in the 1970s and I thought, 'Was it? I had no idea. Someone should have told us when we were doing it!' But it was a very fertile and fervent time in America. It was the time of the Vietnam war and the protests and everybody was very fired up - with LSD too - and Watergate, and all of the things that were going on at the time in the country. And we were all very active with this new energy. I think that somebody said once that only a small percentage of the population needs to do something like take LSD and everybody goes into an altered state. And I think that happened in America at that time. There was a sense that we were really contributing to culture and government and to what was happening. So I think that the cinema reflected that. I don't think that it was only happening in the cinema, but what was happening in the cinema was in the context of the time. [Listen to the sound clip (1min 31)] I feel like that there is a return now to that time, and I give a lot of credit to Robert Redford for starting Sundance because he intentionally made it possible for there to be a place for young film-makers to develop. And it was after the 70s that the corporations came in and took over the cinema, and it stopped being an art form in America - not completely, of course, but to a large degree - and it was people making films, not because they like to make films, but because they like to make money with films. I think that Robert Redford, and all the people that came out of that movement and are in it now, are taking the art form back, away from the corporations and now making films like the Yards by James Gray and Requiem for a Dream by Darren Aronofsky. They are film-makers who really love films. When James Gray offered me the part in The Yards, it was such a low offer my agent asked for more money. The studio wouldn't change the budget, so James offered to pay the difference himself. When he did that, of course the studio came up with the rest of the money! And he didn't get much money himself, so there is a passion in film-makers today, which I am pleased to see because that means that there are roles for me again. SH: If we can go back a bit to The Last Picture Show, which was your first Academy Award nomination, for best supporting actress. Can you say a little about working on that film with Peter Bogdanovich? EB: Well, I'll tell you a couple of stories that come to mind. First, the audition. There were three parts in that film I could have played - Lois, Ruth and the waitress in the restaurant. When I was sent to read the script I was asked to read for the waitress. I went in to meet Peter and I told him that I was happy to read the waitress, but I really wanted to be Lois. He said, alright, read them both. And then he asked me to read Ruth too. So I read and he said, 'OK, you're in the movie. Now we just have to figure out what part you're gonna play!' He called me at home and said, 'Look. I know you wanna play Lois, but I have a couple of choices for her, and I don't have anyone to play Ruth, so I really need you to play that if I don't find someone.' So I said I would. And then he said, 'You know, that's the Academy Award part.' [Laughter] He did! And I said, 'You know, I just don't want to play that type of character right now.' I was going through a divorce, I was very unhappy and I wanted to play a character who was a little more on top of it rather than beneath it. So, lucky for me, he found Cloris Leachman, and she did win the Academy Award, but I got to play the part that I wanted. The scene you saw [ Lois advising her teenage daughter not to marry her boyfriend as life would soon become monotonous and dull] because it was shot in a little bedroom, there was no room to put the camera to do a master shot. Normally you would do the whole scene and then break it up into small pieces. But I was moving around the room a lot and there was no room for the camera. So there was just one set-up for each line, and each line was in a different place, so there were 10 camera moves. So I had no, kind of, run at the scene. I would just go to one place and do one line, and then he would say 'cut' and then we'd move the camera to the next place and do the next line. So it was a bit tricky to get continuity in it, because I had to do the transition from one moment to the next at the beginning of each set-up. I had to remember what I had just said and do the transition. Which I did. When it was edited together Peter showed it to me, the film wasn't edited yet, but he said he wanted me to see this scene. So when the lights went up he said, 'Do you like it?', and I said, 'No.' And he said, 'Why not?' and I said, 'Well, you've cut off all my transitions.' And without stopping he turned to the editor and said, 'Put the heads and tails on each of those takes, will ya?' And he put them all back on and that was what he used. I was always very impressed with him for being able to do that. Oh. One other wonderful story. The first time that we all got together to read the script, we were in a hotel outside San Antonio. It was like a Holiday Inn on the freeway and just massively depressing. [Laughter] We all got together around a table in a low-ceilinged room, and we hadn't met before, none of us knew each other - we were all unknown at the time. As the reading went along this feeling in the room began to grow, like, 'Come on! What have we got here?' and I remember as we finished the last line and closed our scripts there was a pause, and then somebody said, 'You know. This could be a good movie!' SH: I wanted to ask you a little about The Exorcist. It is one of the roles you've been most widely seen in. It must have been very demanding - physically demanding, apart from anything else. EB: Yup! It took us nine months to shoot it, I've never done any other film that took so long. Six day weeks, twelve hour days for nine months, it was really very, very stressful. And difficult in so many ways. Emotional heights that had to be hit and then sustained. When you do a master shot you have to hold on to what you've just done while they reset everything for the close-ups and I remember I had, because it was 1973, a big headset that was a radio and I would put that on so I could listen to some music and turn my chair to the wall to help keep me in whatever mood we had just established. So it seems to me that one of my main memories of that film was looking at a wall, listening to music. Because it was quite difficult to maintain that level of terror for so many hours and days and weeks and months. It was a big event in my life. [ Listen to the sound clip (1min 47) ] SH: Let's talk about Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. You won an Academy Award and a Bafta, and also it seems as though that was a very personal film that you were committed to getting made. EB: Well, while I was shooting The Exorcist, Warner Brothers was the studio and John Kelly was the executive. John was looking in the dailies every day back in Los Angeles - we were in New York and Washington - and he decided that he wanted to do another film with me, so he started sending me scripts. Now at that time, 1973, it was early in the woman's movement and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different. With that in mind, and what was happening to me and my own consciousness, as I looked at the scripts they all reflected the 'old position' of women. They were either victims, dutiful wives or prostitutes, or... well, that was pretty much it. I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognised, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, the script by Bob Getchell. When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said to look at a movie called Mean Streets, which hadn't been released yet. So I looked at it and I felt that it was exactly what the script of Alice needed, because Alice was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know - in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day-Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty. When I saw Mean Streets I felt that Martin [Scorsese] was the person who could do it. So I asked to meet him and he came to John Kelly's office - this very small, nervous little guy, he was very young then - and I told him how much I liked the film but I said, 'You know, it's hard to tell from that film what you know about women. Do you know anything about women?' and he said, 'No. But I'd like to learn!' So we went to work together and it was just one of the best experiences I've ever had. Marty has a way of providing a creative atmosphere on the set wherein the actors can do what they know how to do best. So the script is basically how Getchell wrote it, but with a lot of improvisation in rehearsal and a lot was added to it from our own lives. And a lot from my relationship with my son at that time worked its way into the film. [ Listen to the sound clip (3mins 01) ] SH: That was something I wanted to ask you. What leaps of the screen is that incredible relationship you have between you and Alfred Lutter, who plays your son. I was interested in how you worked to get that. EB: Well, a lot of the things... well, I'm embarrassed to say that the clip you saw [ when Alice orders her son to write down all the bad things in his life on a piece of paper] actually happened between me and my son when I was at my wits' end. When I look at it now I think, 'God, I was being rather rough with that boy!' Alfred Lutter was a very bright boy, very bright and very bratty. He was very in the moment and very fine to work with. My son was on the set too, and he played the boy next door. And he wasn't a great fan of Alfred Lutter, actually. So there was a kind of feedback between the script and my life.

      "trailText": "<p>New York voter  Gregory Palast  is ruffled by murky episodes in Hillary Clinton's past</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>My wife would kill me if she knew what I was doing to that blonde, but I don't see how I can vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton. My vote against her in the New York Senate race could put Republican bats in charge of Congress and the White House, where they are certain to suck the blood of the working class - by privatising social security. </p> <p>Yet I hesitate about Hillary. It all goes back to something Ron Brown, the late Commerce Secretary, said about our dear First Lady: 'I'm not Hillary's mother-f***ing tour guide.' </p> <p>To know what that's all about, turn back to Arkansas 1976, when Bill Clinton won election to the powerful state post of Attorney General. I hunted down Clinton's old ally Zack Polatt, of Little Rock, to talk about those glory days. </p> <p>Clinton ran his campaign on fighting the despised local electricity company, Arkansas Power. Funny thing was, Polatt told me, Arkansas consumer organisations were defeated in court by the power company's sharp lawyers, Webster Hubbell and Hillary Rodham of Rose Law. </p> <p>At the time, Hillary would not use her husband's name. She strategically switched to 'Mrs Clinton' only while crying crocodile tears for the oppressed. The official biography of the 'Flotus' (government-speak for First Lady of the United States) lists her six-month stint on a child-protection task force. Yet nowhere does it mention her six years on the board of Wal-Mart Corporation, notorious during her directorship for alleged abuses of child labour. Sam Walton called her 'My little lady' and paid her fees equal to 60 per cent of her income as a lawyer. </p> <p>Fast forward to 1994 and the Brown 'tour guide' business. According to Nolanda Hill, the Commerce Secretary's long-time business partner and love interest, Brown, who died in 1996, endorsed a Hillary cash-for-access scheme ($10,000 for coffee with the President, $100,000 for a night in the Lincoln bedroom), but resented the discount rate the Flotus put on US executives joining his lucrative trade missions. 'I'm worth more than $50,000 a pop!' </p> <p>A reflection of the Brown-Hillary scheme is visible in a document The Observer obtained through the US Freedom of Information Act, dated June 1994. In the memo, Jude Kearney, Commerce Department officer (and Clinton chum from Arkansas) warned someone called 'JCB' of power company Entergy that his employer would be locked out of Brown's upcoming China mission unlessit was 'politically connected'. </p> <p>By the end of the month, Entergy, whose partner in the China venture was the Riady family of Indonesia, would connect big time to both Flotus and 'Potus' (the President) and get its spot on the China mission, on which it signed a billion-dollar deal with the Chinese. </p> <p>On 27 June James Riady paid Webster Hubbell, Hillary's former law partner, $100,000. How strange. Hubbell was under indictment for fraudulently inflating his legal bills, a felony. I've conducted investigations of lawyer overbilling. How can one law partner to fake detailed time logs without the complicity of another lawyer in the firm? Hillary's logs were worth close inspection by authorities. </p> <p>Funny thing about Hillary's billing records: when requested for disclosure in an unrelated matter they disappeared. First, her law firm's computers went ka-blooey. Then the paper printouts vanished, but not before, during the 1992 Presidential campaign, they were secretly combed over, line by line, by two of her partners, Vince Foster and Web Hubbell. </p> <p>Hubbell knew his own logs were phonied, and he understood the consequences of exposure. Ultimately, bloated hours on those records caused him to lose his law licence, his ministerial post (the President had appointed him Assistant US Attorney General) and his freedom - 21 months in the slammer. </p> <p>What did Foster and Hubbell see and know about Hillary's logs? Hubbell won't say, except for a cryptic remark, after seeing her bills, that 'every lawyer' fabricates records. Hubbell pleaded guilty, but refused to answer investigators' questions, a requirement in any plea bargain, so the judge had to sentence him to prison. </p> <p>Why would Hubbell choose to do time on the chain gang over testifying about the Flotus? His prosecutors did not know at the time of a $100,000 Riady payment, the first of over half a million dollars Hubbell would receive from Clinton friends in the weeks up to his entering jail. </p> <p>Foster didn't speak either - and now he can't. Hubbell, a jovial good ol' boy, had the temperament to suffer a brush with ruin with a grin... and wait for friends of Bill and Hill to stuff his piggy bank. Foster, who Clinton made a White House counsel, had a less flexible personality. On 20 July, 1993, as Rose Law fake billings were about to become public, Foster committed suicide. </p> <p>Files of the Flotus were removed from Foster's White House office prior to the arrival of the FBI. Her billing records reappeared two years later just outside her office, right after Hubbell's refusal to testify against her. </p> <p>By overbilling, Hubbell admits he stole from his partners and clients. Some sued Hubbell, but the Flotus did not. Imagine: Hillary, a supposed victim of the overbilling scam not only refused to sue the thief who cheated her, she helped make him wealthy on his way to prison. The lady's a saint, unless - and I'd never believe this - she was in on Hubbell's scam. </p> <p>Maybe the Clintons knew nothing about the big money flowing to prison-bound Hubbell. Knowledge of the payments would suggest they were buying Hubbell's silence. In 1996, when the LA Times uncovered the payments, the President stone-cold denied he knew anything about it. </p> <p>Then, this past April, in a deposition by the Justice Department weirdly unreported by the US press, Clinton changed his tune. Investigators confronted the President with this: on 20 June 1994, Hubbell met with the Flotus. Two days later, James Riady met with Hubbell for breakfast, then went to the White House, met again with Hubbell, then made two more treks to the White House. Two days later, a videotape shows the beginning of a meeting in the Oval Office between Clinton and Riady before the tape goes blank. Two days after that, Hubbell gets his $100,000 through a Riady bank. </p> <p>Lying to journalists is a venal sin, but lying to the Feds is perjury. In his deposition, the President's denial transformed into amnesia. He couldn't remember if Riady mentioned the payment. Then, the President slyly opened the door to the truth. 'I wouldn't be surprised if James told me,' Clinton said. Neither would I. </p> <p>Riady said other surprising things to Clinton. According to FBI debriefing papers, on 14 August 1992 the Indonesian billionaire, riding with candidate Clinton in a limousine, promised to give $1 million to Clinton's campaign. Riady made good on his promise through sham donors, a violation of US laws against concealed and foreign donations. </p> <p>What did Riady get? The Flotus herself, says Nolanda Hill, forced Brown to accept the appointment of Riady's bag man, John Huang, as a Commerce Department deputy. Huang's first order of business was to wheedle his way into confidential CIA briefings on Indonesia and China, then call Riady and his Entergy partners. </p> <p>The very day Riady met the President, diaries show he called on a Clinton crony at the top of the department's Export-Import Bank. 'We just came over from the Oval Office,' is a nice way to provide assurance of the 'political connection' required for help. These and other Riady team meetings at Commerce are marked 'social'. Yet, shortly thereafter, the department agreed to promote and fund the Riady-Entergy China venture. </p> <p>Influence is not a victimless crime. Riady and his minions' visits to the White House (94 times!) included successful requests for the President to meet Indonesian dictator Suharto and to kill negative reports on East Timor and working conditions in Indonesia. Timorese and Indonesians paid for these policy flips with blood. </p> <p>As a loyal Democrat, I will never accept that the $1m slipped to the Clinton campaign and the cash for Hillary's tight-lipped partner Hubbell connect in any way with Clinton administration actions - no matter what the evidence says. But it does shake my belief in the Flotus. </p> <p>Which leaves me with her Republican opponent, Congressman Rick Lazio, the disarming young man with the little-boy grin. Little Ricky, whom I remember trying to sabotage a government racketeering case. Ricky the Rat? Forget it. </p> <p>So, Hillary, I'm back, flowers and vote in hand. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@observer.co.uk\">gregory.palast@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Two days later, James Riady met with Hubbell for breakfast, then went to the White House, met again with Hubbell, then made two more treks to the White House. Two days later, a videotape shows the beginning of a meeting in the Oval Office between Clinton and Riady before the tape goes blank. Two days after that, Hubbell gets his $100,000 through a Riady bank. Lying to journalists is a venal sin, but lying to the Feds is perjury. In his deposition, the President's denial transformed into amnesia. He couldn't remember if Riady mentioned the payment. Then, the President slyly opened the door to the truth. 'I wouldn't be surprised if James told me,' Clinton said. Neither would I. Riady said other surprising things to Clinton. According to FBI debriefing papers, on 14 August 1992 the Indonesian billionaire, riding with candidate Clinton in a limousine, promised to give $1 million to Clinton's campaign. Riady made good on his promise through sham donors, a violation of US laws against concealed and foreign donations. What did Riady get? The Flotus herself, says Nolanda Hill, forced Brown to accept the appointment of Riady's bag man, John Huang, as a Commerce Department deputy. Huang's first order of business was to wheedle his way into confidential CIA briefings on Indonesia and China, then call Riady and his Entergy partners. The very day Riady met the President, diaries show he called on a Clinton crony at the top of the department's Export-Import Bank. 'We just came over from the Oval Office,' is a nice way to provide assurance of the 'political connection' required for help. These and other Riady team meetings at Commerce are marked 'social'. Yet, shortly thereafter, the department agreed to promote and fund the Riady-Entergy China venture. Influence is not a victimless crime. Riady and his minions' visits to the White House (94 times!) included successful requests for the President to meet Indonesian dictator Suharto and to kill negative reports on East Timor and working conditions in Indonesia. Timorese and Indonesians paid for these policy flips with blood. As a loyal Democrat, I will never accept that the $1m slipped to the Clinton campaign and the cash for Hillary's tight-lipped partner Hubbell connect in any way with Clinton administration actions - no matter what the evidence says. But it does shake my belief in the Flotus. Which leaves me with her Republican opponent, Congressman Rick Lazio, the disarming young man with the little-boy grin. Little Ricky, whom I remember trying to sabotage a government racketeering case. Ricky the Rat? Forget it. So, Hillary, I'm back, flowers and vote in hand. gregory.palast@observer.co.uk",

As it is, the tragedy has made such questions redundant. Her status as a national icon - the beautiful, warm-hearted, exploited princess, the ideal queen who has been denied us - is likely to remain secure. </p> <p>Tragedy made Jacqueline Kennedy an icon too - a far greater icon than Diana - but the tragedy in her case was the death of her husband, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. She had 30 more years to live after his assassination in Dallas in 1963, and during that time she horrified the world, and especially the Kennedy clan, by marrying the monstrous, bullying Greek shipping billionaire, Aristotle Onassis. </p> <p>But even this failed to knock her off her pedestal, for she never forfeited the adulation of her fellow Americans. She remained fixed forever in their imaginations as the 'marble' widow at Kennedy's funeral, a grieving heroine who, as Sarah Bradford puts it, 'restored America's pride', exorcising the shame of the killing of the thirty-fifth President and becoming, in Frank Sinatra's words, 'America's queen'. </p> <p>This was not entirely ordained by fate. Despite the strain of being married to a serial adulterer, Jackie Kennedy was a ruthless promoter of the Kennedy image while her husband was alive, and its ferocious custodian until her death in 1994. She regarded loyalty as the paramount virtue and anyone, even among her husband's greatest admirers, who went even the tiniest bit 'off message', as we would say now, would be brutally ejected from her circle, often never to be readmitted. </p> <p>She was fully aware of her power as a national icon and once told the historian William Manchester, when she was trying to censor his official account of the assassination, that she was bound to win the argument because 'anybody who is against me will look like a rat unless I run off with Eddie Fisher'. (This was before she ran off with Onassis.) </p> <p>Fiercely protective of her privacy, and commendably determined to bring up her two children, Caroline and John Jnr in as normal a way as possible in the most difficult circumstances, she was deeply suspicious of the press and extremely haughty towards it. Helen Thomas, a White House reporter, told Bradford that she 'treated the press like so many foreign invaders'. Once, when Jackie arrived back in Washington from Hyannis Port, the Kennedy home in Massachusetts, bearing a puppy given her as a birthday present by her father-in-law, Ambassador Joe Kennedy, the press sent her a note asking what she would feed it. She replied with one word: 'Reporters.' </p> <p>But the press played her game, perhaps because it knew the public would never stomach the truth. Not until several years after JFK's death did the public hear anything about his addiction to sex ('I swear to you, and this is absolutely true, at this point it was chicer not to have slept with the President than to have slept with him,' said one New York society debutante), his dependence on amphetamines for his agonising back pain, or his father's links with the Chicago mafia. </p> <p>If Jackie could tolerate her husband's infidelities and take part in the conspiracy to conceal them from the world, this may have been because her father, the handsome, drunken wastrel John Vernou Bouvier III - 'Black Jack', as he was called - was at least as bad. She adored him and was proud of his success with women, while he, in turn, warned her that 'all men are rats'. </p> <p>She was conditioned by her family background to gravitate instinctively towards powerful, dominant men and, especially, very rich ones. She was obsessed with money, which she saw as the key to security and independence, and would never have married anyone less than a multi-millionaire. She was, Bradford frequently tells us, the ultimate American geisha. </p> <p>This consummate myth-maker was brought up on a myth - that the Bouviers were descended from the highest nobility of France. Despite indisputable evidence that they were descended from lowly French shopkeepers, the family stuck to its story. Jackie may also have been influenced by a remark of her father-in-law during Jack's election campaign that 'It's not about what you are, it's about what people think you are'. Image was on JFK's mind to the end. His last words to his wife on that fateful car ride through Dallas were: 'Take off the glasses, Jackie.' </p> <p>In this highly readable, if too long and sometimes repetitious, account of her life, Bradford brings out Jackie's appealing qualities - her intelligence, curiosity and sense of fun, as well as her selfless devotion to her children and her extraordinary courage. But the real Jackie remains concealed behind the protective shell with which she surrounded herself since childhood to keep an ugly and dangerous world at bay. </p> <p>As First Lady, she was no Hillary Clinton.

It is. Since he was reportedly paid a six-figure sum to write this book about a peripatetic lock of Beethoven's hair, it is worth paying close attention to learn the secrets of his technique.

'Do not judge me by ordinary standards,' pleaded Andersen, in a social climate all but closed to open homosexuality (yet rife with its practice). Yet again, there is no convincing evidence of consummation. Only of aching need and rhetoric.

Lisa is the bitchy editor of London's Femme magazine, compensating for feelings of insecurity by making others feel inadequate. But she gets a taste of her own medicine when instead of being offered the job of editor at a fashionable New York magazine, she is redeployed to rainy Dublin to start Colleen, a magazine for Irish women. </p> <p>Among her small group of staff is Ashling, the naive assistant editor who gradually learns that working in publishing is like learning to use chopsticks - it is a tricky, delicate and slippery process. Ashling really wants to be like her friend, Clodagh - beautiful, adored by her wonderful husband, suffocated by her two charming children and looking for contentment in new clothes and furnishings. </p> <p>The elusive goal of happiness is a familiar one for Keyes and that is why she writes about it with such dexterity.

      "bodyText": "Sushi for Beginners Marian Keyes Read by Niamh Cusack Four hours Penguin Audiobooks, \u00a38.99 Buy it at BOL Marian Keyes has created three alarmingly recognisable characters in this tale about the pursuit of happiness. Lisa is the bitchy editor of London's Femme magazine, compensating for feelings of insecurity by making others feel inadequate. But she gets a taste of her own medicine when instead of being offered the job of editor at a fashionable New York magazine, she is redeployed to rainy Dublin to start Colleen, a magazine for Irish women. Among her small group of staff is Ashling, the naive assistant editor who gradually learns that working in publishing is like learning to use chopsticks - it is a tricky, delicate and slippery process. Ashling really wants to be like her friend, Clodagh - beautiful, adored by her wonderful husband, suffocated by her two charming children and looking for contentment in new clothes and furnishings. The elusive goal of happiness is a familiar one for Keyes and that is why she writes about it with such dexterity. Niamh Cusack completes this audacious audio delight with her versatile native Irish accent. In the role of Ashling, she whines and pants like a puppy but surpasses all expectations as the snappy, idea-snatching Lisa.",

'I awoke the imagination of my century so that it created myth and legend around me.' Now, in the centenary of his demise and with the publication of his 1,500 extant letters, the case is made for his contemporary iconic status. The Complete Letters constitute posterity's retrial of Oscar Wilde. </p> <p>'The flannel shirts you sent in the hamper are both Willie's,' protests the 14-year-old Oscar from school. 'Mine are quite scarlet and the other lilac.' It would be a life of fine distinction, of the supremacy of taste. Nine years later, George Macmillan is describing his fellow student as 'aesthetic to the last degree, passionately fond of secondary colours, Morris papers, and capable of talking a good deal of nonsense thereupon, but for all that a very sensible, well-informed and charming man'. </p> <p>Already Wilde was striving for the world's attention, claiming his play Vera as 'my first attack on Tyranny'. But it would take a gruelling tour of America to set a new standard of literary celebrity. From coast to coast, he becomes a pre-Warholian superstar, his perfume trails dipping into Eastern Seaboard society and descending Western mines, dining with Colorado miners as silver dust falls from the cavern roof. The clamour is audible, visible: ' \"Nothing like it since Dickens,\" they tell me. I am torn to bits by Society. I wave a gloved hand and an ivory cane and they cheer. Rooms are hung with white lilies for me everywhere. I have a black servant, who is my slave.' </p> <p>Back in England, he declares, like David Bowie circa 1973, that 'the Oscar of the first period is dead'. He marries the beautiful Constance, a willowy soulmate in aesthetic dress, and edits Woman's World. His visibility appears to contradict his Emersonian advice to Whistler - 'Be warned in time, James, and remain as I do, incomprehensible. To be great is to be misunderstood.' </p> <p>Wilde's networking is brought vividly to life. He might declare that 'cultivated idleness seems to me to be the proper occupation for a man', yet in his search for the nouveau frisson of his French Decadent counterparts, he placed himself definitely within society, for all his subversion. Thus the fall, when it came, was that much greater. </p> <p>The worrisome undercurrents begin to stir with talk of 'honey-coloured and charming' boys, and playful declarations - 'What is to become of an indolent hedonist like myself if Socialism and the Church join forces against me? I want to stand apart, and look on, being neither for God nor for his enemies.' Wilde's delicious equivocation was a decadence itself; it would prove his downfall.</p> <p>In a world 'washed by a sea of sovereigns', as William Gaunt wrote, already it seems he was being shaped as the sacrificial lamb for the fin de si\u00e8cle. 'Are there beautiful people in London?' he asks Robbie Ross, his first male seducer, from his temporary reclusion in Babbacombe, working on A Woman of No Importance; and writes to his new lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, of 'strange and troubling personalities walking in painted pageants'. </p> <p>As the storm erupts, it is almost too painful to read the second half of this book. 'I decided that it was nobler and more beautiful to stay,' he tells Bosie. 'I did not want to be called a coward or a deserter. A false name, a disguise, a hunted life, all that is not for me.' Sadly, it would be. 'With what a crash this fell!' he writes to Ada Leverson from Holloway, as if it were only now, out of the theatre of the Old Bailey whose events he looked on as if from his first night box, that he grasped the enormity of what had happened. The letters from Reading jail climax in the most extraordinary missive of all: the original text of De Profundis, as bitter, profound and even self-indulgent here, in its unedited form. It alone would justify the publication of this book. </p> <p>Thereafter, the death of Constance, the scrabbling for money, the petty indignities of social disgrace follow inexorably on. Although counterpointed by Wilde's humour, and the loyalty of Ross and others, there comes a point - around about Reggie Turner's 'I'm afraid its all over with Oscar', as Wilde lies dying in the Hotel d'Alsace - that you want to turn back the pages. </p> <p>The context of these letters is crucial. It is a very fine thing to have the verbatim transcriptions of the Bosie period letters, from Wilde's orchidaceous description of the languid Oxford youth decorating his sofa - 'Quite like a narcissus; so white and gold' - to the acid recriminations as the relationship plunges Wilde into disaster, demanding the return of his presents and those very letters themselves. </p> <p>In an age of dangerous words, their texts become the vocabulary of Wilde's legend, a taxonomy of his 'symbolic relations'. Set next to quotidian demands to publishers for payment, their drama becomes that much more affecting; more beautiful in its tragedy, more wounding in its pain. And yet, somehow, more real - and Oscar would hate me for saying it - more ordinary. These letters give us the human side of Wilde's legend and its human cost.</p>",

Posterity at first mocked Boswell as a buffoon and lickspittle who, by some unaccountable accident, managed to write a great book. The subject of his classic biography, who died in 1784, was buried at Westminster Abbey, revered as one of the greatest Englishmen. </p> <p>Johnson's work has grown ever more remote from us while Boswell's reputation has prospered, a fact that owes much to the discovery in the twentieth century of a rich collection of his papers eventually acquired by Yale University, where they formed the raw material of an academic industry. The consequent publication of his London Journal established Boswell, at last, as a major literary figure in his own right. </p> <p>Yet, as Adam Sisman implies, the antithesis is false and the question of who was the greater irrelevant. The issue he examines is how Boswell came to create his classic Life of Johnson. It is now accepted as a masterpiece of biography, presciently modern in its vivid, easy style. It dwelt on Johnson's many oddities, his uncouth manners and slipshod dress, but with the purpose not of mockery but to give human depth to a moral and intellectual giant. </p> <p>Sisman has not given us just another biography, which might have been superfluous after Peter Martin's Life of James Boswell, published last year. Rather, he presents a vivid portrait of Boswell the biographer as an artist and fallible human being, convivial often to the point of stupor, martyr to his wayward penis, weakened at his death by 17 episodes of gonorrhoea. He confines his interest in Boswell's story to the points where it entwines with that of Johnson and unpicks the process that created art out of another's life. </p> <p>That biography cannot be an exact or impartial science is, of course, obvious. Boswell spent the first part of his adult lifetime taking notes about Johnson and the second gathering anecdotal and written material, a task which continued after the publication of the Life in 1791. Yet he moulded his material not in the spirit of a dim recording clerk but as a sculptor works his clay. </p> <p>Sisman is at his most persuasive when he examines a question that has long troubled scholars. Boswell had a 'scoop': he knew that Johnson, a man revered for his moral character as well as his literary judgment, had hoped to remarry little more than a year after the death of his first wife, the implication being that his affections had already strayed beyond the marital yoke. Boswell chose to suppress this fact, which did not become generally known until 1936. He acquired the knowledge by surreptitiously copying Johnson's diaries. </p> <p>Sisman argues that Boswell omitted this information not out of delicacy or scruple, but because it did not sit with the Johnson he wanted to present to the world, a man 'incapable of ignoble or unworthy action'. Johnson was 'a moral giant, capable of human weakness, susceptible to temptation, but triumphing over both by the force of his intellect and still more by the strength of his character'. </p> <p>More than that, Boswell had not only chronicled Johnson's life; he had appropriated it. 'Boswell's Johnson,' writes Sisman, 'is a heroic expression of Boswell himself.' The idea of a second marriage, though not shocking in itself, may also have troubled Boswell, riddled with guilt as he was at his neglect of his own suffering wife. </p> <p>Boswell's genius as a biographer owed much to his prodigious memory for reconstructing conversations from rough notes and his gift for mimicry. He was not afraid to rewrite anecdotes or sayings attributed to Johnson to make them more 'authentic'. Johnson played up to Boswell, aware that he was taking notes, speaking more oracularly and portentously in his presence, sometimes repeating a phrase afterwards to improve and polish it. And, as gifted mimic, Boswell could roll out the magisterial Johnsonian cadences. Truly they were a double act. </p> <p>Boswell was most groundbreaking in his willingness to cross from the public domain into private life, to touch up the formal portrait with brushstrokes of human frailty. It is not surprising that his work should continue to have resonance in our own age, brutally self-revelatory and fixated on the private lives of celebrities as it is. </p> <p>Though his Lif e sold well - and indeed has not been out of print - Boswell ended his days in humiliation and despair. His career at the English Bar had withered, his debts had mounted, his vicious patron, Lord Lonsdale, from whom he vainly hoped for political preferment, treated him with parsimonious cruelty. </p> <p>Boswell's unhappiness flowed from his own unsteady and volatile character. But he was also deracinated, a Scot who preferred London and its intellectual excitements to Presbyterian Edinburgh, a man intensely proud of his status as an Ayrshire laird yet miserable whenever he spent time at Auchinleck, a man who deposited his daughters in a social no man's land by giving them a smattering of an upper-class English education which never quite concealed the less polished Scots beneath. </p> <p>In the maelstrom of his life, Samuel Johnson stood like a rock, a substitute for his own cold and contemptuous father, the judge, Lord Auchinleck. On an ill-tempered meeting between the two during Johnson's visit to Scotland, Boswell was uncharacteristically exiguous with his account. His descendants were 'ashamed' of Boswell's 'toadying' to Johnson. Thus they neglected, indeed despised, his papers, which had the curious result of guaranteeing their survival. </p> <p>Sisman's verdict is that Boswell's achievement is unlikely ever to be emulated because of the strange circumstances which gave rise to it. His Life of Johnson was not only pioneering - it was unique. 'Never again will there such a combination of subject, author and opportunity.' </p> <p> Boswell's Presumptuous Task - the quotation is from his own foreword to the Life - has an exhilarating narrative clip and its scholarship, though robust, is lightly worn. In the overcrowded field of Boswellian studies, it stands out as a major achievement.</p>",

In contrast, Michael Collins's The Keepers of Truth offers an intelligent but mentally ill narrator whose overblown style is absolutely in keeping with the mismatch between his education and aspirations.

Its slow finish, after a bustling, brilliant series of vignettes and voices, has an honesty which one would be loath to trade for anything gentler or neater. Matthew Kneale's marvellous English Passengers, telling an old imperial tale through many voices, manages to revive some unpleasant historical episodes and ideologies with a remarkable, but not unbalancing, gusto and humour.

Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin, Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place, and Kazuo Ishiguro's When We Were Orphans are all identity-quests, set in a past-gazing present. The narrator of The Blind Assassin is an 82-year-old woman, musing on the collapse of her family's industrialist empire during the 1930s, her father's death, her sister's suicide. </p> <p>The disaster-afflicted family of The Hiding Place are Maltese immigrants, recently arrived in 1960s Cardiff. Dolores is unable to suppress needling memories of the rotting streets of her childhood, the low-league treachery of the Cardiff underworld, her abandonment by her parents. </p> <p>Ishiguro converts the family retrospective into a detective snoop. The hysterical narrator of When We Were Orphans, Christopher Banks, begins the book as a celebrated sleuth in a stylised 1930s England of 'chaps' and 'old boys'. But Banks's case-solving zeal masks the gap: the unexplained disappearance of his parents during his expat childhood among the opium traders of Shanghai. </p> <p>These are resolutely inward-seeking novels. But, the self-analysis is set against beguilingly exotic backdrops: inter-war China, 1930s Canada, 1960s Maltese Cardiff. Inner-searching becomes travelogue, by virtue of the strangeness of its surroundings.

O'Doherty's Irish priest-narrator is tormented by a libidinous village idiot, but too much a rustic archetype to carry the weight of significance attached to him. Simultaneously boisterous travelogue, mournful autobiography of an oppressed outsider, Victorian farce and post-colonial apology, Kneale's English Passengers supplies a fascinating display of the twitches of our times. </p> <p>The list includes a whirling dervish satire on parent-questing confessionals and outsider-worship - Michael Collins's The Keepers of Truth. In a US hicksville, local hack Bill becomes perversely enticed by a local case of patricide. For raucous hilarity, and for offering a timely antidote to the trend for self-analysis as epic quest, Collins's The Keepers of Truth clearly goes before the others. Atwood's The Blind Assassin I'd put as runner-up, for a grand scheme performed with desultory lacklustre. If the judges prefer their novels more dark and languid, then Azzopardi's The Hiding Place might claim it. </p> <p> <strong> Winner: Michael Collins</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Justine Ettler</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Justine Ettler is the best-selling author of The River Ophelia and is working on her fourth novel. </p> <p> Viewed as a whole, this year's shortlist is, for the most part, a delectable combination of well-known writers and new talent. A common thread is a haunting preoccupation with tragedies past, with the exception of Michael Collins's The Keepers of the Truth. Matthew Kneale's English Passengers recreates the 'ethnic cleansing' of the Aboriginal inhabitants in Tasmania. What makes this novel so satisfying is that, in spite of Kneale's use of multiple narrators, the most sympathetically presented versions of events are narrated by the novel's two underdogs, the half-caste Aboriginal Peevay, and the Manxian Captain Kewley. </p> <p>Similarly, debut novelist Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place is written from multiple points of view, but privileges the viewpoint of an abused child. </p> <p>Following this vein, Kazuo Ishiguro's When We Were Orphans is set in 1930s Shanghai and London, and zeroes in on the devastating effects of war, espionage and betrayal on a family. And while Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin examines broader social themes - the novel is a kind of obituary to industrial capitalism, Canadian style - the story is closely focused on the familial dimensions of industrialism's demise. O'Doherty's bizarre novel, The Deposition of Father McGreevy, seems out of place on the list.

      "body": "<p>According to Darren Aronofsky, his new film Requiem For A Dream isn't a heroin movie. And in some ways, he is right. It covers addiction in general, from prescription drugs to TV and self-improvement. He has also got a point in that the film has moments that are so extraordinary it shouldn't be pigeon-holed. </p> <p>With his debut Pi, Aronofsky showed he had an armoury of techniques that created a visual code for the process of a mind losing control. And in the final half hour of Requiem For A Dream, he uses everything he knows with devastating results. You won't feel worse - physically or emotionally - coming out of a cinema anytime soon. If the ultra-quick edits of pop videos have had a mainly negative impact on cinema thus far, this is where they come good. </p> <p>But in other ways, Requiem For A Dream is a classic heroin movie. It uses the swing from the floating gentleness of the high to the desperate, agonised search for a fix. It plays with our horror of needles. And it takes an unreasonably beautiful leading couple (Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly) and destroys them before our eyes. These are the elements that have made heroin more appealing as a subject to filmmakers than any other drug. </p> <p>Ann Widdecombe may think otherwise, but as far as modern movies go marijuana is a gentle giggle. Ecstasy films remain in their infancy and LSD had its day in the Sixties (if you discount unacknowledged acid movies like The Cell). There have been cocaine movies, of course, but the ones about users (Bright Lights Big City, The Boost) are far outnumbered by the ones about the business. Perhaps this is because producers are worried that coke addiction seems too much like the vice of the spoilt wealthy, and so it is hard to feel sympathetic for the characters. Or maybe it is just because, in the film business, coke is just too close to home. </p> <p>But the heroin film has been thriving, despite the fact that apart from a couple of brief and localised outbreaks - grunge, the Britpop hangover - it is a drug that hasn't really been on the cultural agenda in recent years. It is widely considered a regrettable fact of life rather than the source of moral panic it was in the 'Just Say No' Eighties. </p> <p>This year we've already had one excellent smack movie, Jesus' Son (the title comes from the Velvet Underground's 'Heroin'). Then there was the belated straight-to-video release of Permanent Midnight, an adaptation of TV scriptwriter Jerry Stahl's autobiographical account of how he blew a fortune on smack, with Ben Stiller playing Stahl. There was a heroin sub-plot in two movies about paramedics: Bringing Out The Dead and Broken Vessels. A couple of years back there was the critically adored High Art, and in the years immediately before that Gridlock'd, Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction. If movies did corrupt us, there would have been a heroin epidemic in the past five years. </p> <p>Hollywood's original beautiful junkie was Frank Sinatra in The Man With The Golden Arm. Like most of the better heroin films, it was based on a book, and in theory the internalised nature of drug-taking will always work better on the page than on film. Compared with Nelson Algren's novel, the film is a tame affair. But by the standards of Hollywood in 1955, Otto Preminger's film was genuinely shocking. The US ratings board - the MPAA - refused it a certificate because the Hays Code forbade depictions of drug use on screen. The film was released without an MPAA certificate (as, intriguingly, was Requiem For A Dream). </p> <p>We never actually see the needle enter Sinatra's arm, but we do see his arm prepared with a tie as a tourniquet, and watch his face as the rush hits. There's also a long, harsh cold turkey scene. And despite the assumption of the MPAA that this would all be beyond the imagination of decent Americans, the film uses junkie slang with no explanation, which suggests Preminger presumed audiences were be familiar with the meaning of terms such as 'monkey on the back', 'fix' and 'kicking'. Beyond the drugs, it has everything you'd expect from a mid-Fifties classic: a great Sinatra performance, a great Saul Bass title sequence and a great Elmer Bernstein score. </p> <p>As Frankie Machine, Sinatra cuts a rather more elegant figure than the broken-nosed antihero of Algren's book. The idea of beauty going to waste is central to the movie portrayal of the addict: from Sinatra to Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch and Heather Graham raiding pharmacies in Drugstore Cowboy, Ewan McGregor and Jonnie Lee Miller putting their looks at risk in Trainspotting, Tupac and Thandie Newton (along with the less perfect Tim Roth) as gorgeous users trying to go straight in Gridlock'd, and Billy Crudup as the sweetminded loser in Jesus' Son. But the most telling example is Jennifer Jason Leigh in Rush, a 1992 film about undercover cops who shoot up to prove their credentials, and end up addicted. Normally, Leigh doesn't play 'pretty'. But in the early scenes of Rush, she is filmed as a cheerleader-type, wholesome and good-looking blonde. Why? For the contrast later on when she turns into a scab covered, emaciated junkie. </p> <p>After The Man With Golden Arm, the next landmark in heroin cinema was Panic In Needle Park (1971). The combination of the new liberalism in censorship, and the heroin boom, made for a film that was a lot less circumspect than The Man With The Golden Arm, based in a community of users, rather than showing addiction as solitary vice. It is a bit dated and melodramatic, but it made the reputation of Al Pacino, and a young Raul Julia and Paul Sorvino also feature in an impressive cast. In the early Seventies, smack was the drug ravaging the streets in blaxploitation movies, Bond films and thrillers. One of these, French Connection II, has the definitive cold turkey scene, with Gene Hackman going through near unendurable agony. But then it would be odd if heroin was not rife in Seventies cinema: it was everywhere on US streets. </p> <p>The Eighties smack crisis, on the other hand, didn't produce a cinematic response. Cinema's junkies of the time were based on real people: Sid and Nancy, Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's Bird and the wrecked visage of the ultimate real-life beautiful smackhead, Chet Baker, lovingly preserved in Bruce Weber's documentary Let's Get Lost. On this side of the Atlantic, the most famous fictional heroin user of the Eighties remained Zammo in Grange Hill. The cinematic vocabulary of the contemporary heroin film was laid down in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy (1989), although the film is set in the late Sixties. The gang in it are equal opportunity abusers - they'll consume whatever they can steal. The heroin angle isn't ignored, though - not when the film includes a cameo from William Burroughs. It is the things Van Sant does stylistically - the wooziness, the changing speeds, the willingness to render visions literally on screen - that are the template for subsequent heroin films. </p> <p>And it looks great: in contrast with the griminess of Panic In Needle Park or Sid And Nancy, most recent heroin films have been seductively lovely in appearance, at least until the infected arms appear. The seduction is necessary to explain the addiction, which is the central theme of most of these films. They are about characters being rendered powerless by a desire, being taken over by a force outside their control. This sets up a series of much-visited plot points. The ritual of trying to get clean, which can be played for comedy (Trainspotting, Gridlock'd) or used to show the terrors of cold turkey. The disastrous descent back into addiction. And finally either redemption or tragedy: the films break down philosophically into the ones that believe life after addiction is possible and those that suggest there is no escape. </p> <p>But what gives the heroin an edge over other addictive drugs - including alcohol - from a filmmaker's point of view is the shock factor of needles: shooting up makes heroin use seem so more extreme than any other drug use. Not just the act of injecting and the shots of the syringe filling with blood, but the physical consequences of scabs, sores, infection and ultimately amputation of limbs. Conversely, High Art (1998), in which the drug is only snorted, makes it seem an utterly appealing lifestyle option - lazy evenings lounging in a stylishly post-Warholian milieu. </p> <p>Certainly, there is a degree of romanticisation in heroin films, even if the characters in them either end up badly or undergo horrifying experiences on the road to some kind of recovery. But then if taking heroin was not - at least initially - an extraordinary experience, no one would get sucked in. A film that can't show why its characters end up stealing from their mothers to feed the habit is one you'll end up ignoring. Are Hollywood's junkies too beautiful? Possibly, but when the film gets it right - as Requiem For A Dream does - that should make a complex anti-drugs message more powerful. And morality apart, heroin - as a subject matter - has given us some great movies, just as it has inspired some great records. It's a habit that filmmakers shouldn't try to kick just yet. </p> <p>\u0095 'Requiem For A Dream' screens at the London Film Festival tomorrow (020 7928 3232) before going on general release next January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "According to Darren Aronofsky, his new film Requiem For A Dream isn't a heroin movie. And in some ways, he is right. It covers addiction in general, from prescription drugs to TV and self-improvement. He has also got a point in that the film has moments that are so extraordinary it shouldn't be pigeon-holed. With his debut Pi, Aronofsky showed he had an armoury of techniques that created a visual code for the process of a mind losing control. And in the final half hour of Requiem For A Dream, he uses everything he knows with devastating results. You won't feel worse - physically or emotionally - coming out of a cinema anytime soon. If the ultra-quick edits of pop videos have had a mainly negative impact on cinema thus far, this is where they come good. But in other ways, Requiem For A Dream is a classic heroin movie. It uses the swing from the floating gentleness of the high to the desperate, agonised search for a fix. It plays with our horror of needles. And it takes an unreasonably beautiful leading couple (Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly) and destroys them before our eyes. These are the elements that have made heroin more appealing as a subject to filmmakers than any other drug. Ann Widdecombe may think otherwise, but as far as modern movies go marijuana is a gentle giggle. Ecstasy films remain in their infancy and LSD had its day in the Sixties (if you discount unacknowledged acid movies like The Cell). There have been cocaine movies, of course, but the ones about users (Bright Lights Big City, The Boost) are far outnumbered by the ones about the business. Perhaps this is because producers are worried that coke addiction seems too much like the vice of the spoilt wealthy, and so it is hard to feel sympathetic for the characters. Or maybe it is just because, in the film business, coke is just too close to home. But the heroin film has been thriving, despite the fact that apart from a couple of brief and localised outbreaks - grunge, the Britpop hangover - it is a drug that hasn't really been on the cultural agenda in recent years. It is widely considered a regrettable fact of life rather than the source of moral panic it was in the 'Just Say No' Eighties. This year we've already had one excellent smack movie, Jesus' Son (the title comes from the Velvet Underground's 'Heroin'). Then there was the belated straight-to-video release of Permanent Midnight, an adaptation of TV scriptwriter Jerry Stahl's autobiographical account of how he blew a fortune on smack, with Ben Stiller playing Stahl. There was a heroin sub-plot in two movies about paramedics: Bringing Out The Dead and Broken Vessels. A couple of years back there was the critically adored High Art, and in the years immediately before that Gridlock'd, Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction. If movies did corrupt us, there would have been a heroin epidemic in the past five years. Hollywood's original beautiful junkie was Frank Sinatra in The Man With The Golden Arm. Like most of the better heroin films, it was based on a book, and in theory the internalised nature of drug-taking will always work better on the page than on film. Compared with Nelson Algren's novel, the film is a tame affair. But by the standards of Hollywood in 1955, Otto Preminger's film was genuinely shocking. The US ratings board - the MPAA - refused it a certificate because the Hays Code forbade depictions of drug use on screen. The film was released without an MPAA certificate (as, intriguingly, was Requiem For A Dream). We never actually see the needle enter Sinatra's arm, but we do see his arm prepared with a tie as a tourniquet, and watch his face as the rush hits. There's also a long, harsh cold turkey scene. And despite the assumption of the MPAA that this would all be beyond the imagination of decent Americans, the film uses junkie slang with no explanation, which suggests Preminger presumed audiences were be familiar with the meaning of terms such as 'monkey on the back', 'fix' and 'kicking'. Beyond the drugs, it has everything you'd expect from a mid-Fifties classic: a great Sinatra performance, a great Saul Bass title sequence and a great Elmer Bernstein score. As Frankie Machine, Sinatra cuts a rather more elegant figure than the broken-nosed antihero of Algren's book. The idea of beauty going to waste is central to the movie portrayal of the addict: from Sinatra to Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch and Heather Graham raiding pharmacies in Drugstore Cowboy, Ewan McGregor and Jonnie Lee Miller putting their looks at risk in Trainspotting, Tupac and Thandie Newton (along with the less perfect Tim Roth) as gorgeous users trying to go straight in Gridlock'd, and Billy Crudup as the sweetminded loser in Jesus' Son. But the most telling example is Jennifer Jason Leigh in Rush, a 1992 film about undercover cops who shoot up to prove their credentials, and end up addicted. Normally, Leigh doesn't play 'pretty'. But in the early scenes of Rush, she is filmed as a cheerleader-type, wholesome and good-looking blonde. Why? For the contrast later on when she turns into a scab covered, emaciated junkie. After The Man With Golden Arm, the next landmark in heroin cinema was Panic In Needle Park (1971). The combination of the new liberalism in censorship, and the heroin boom, made for a film that was a lot less circumspect than The Man With The Golden Arm, based in a community of users, rather than showing addiction as solitary vice. It is a bit dated and melodramatic, but it made the reputation of Al Pacino, and a young Raul Julia and Paul Sorvino also feature in an impressive cast. In the early Seventies, smack was the drug ravaging the streets in blaxploitation movies, Bond films and thrillers. One of these, French Connection II, has the definitive cold turkey scene, with Gene Hackman going through near unendurable agony. But then it would be odd if heroin was not rife in Seventies cinema: it was everywhere on US streets. The Eighties smack crisis, on the other hand, didn't produce a cinematic response. Cinema's junkies of the time were based on real people: Sid and Nancy, Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's Bird and the wrecked visage of the ultimate real-life beautiful smackhead, Chet Baker, lovingly preserved in Bruce Weber's documentary Let's Get Lost. On this side of the Atlantic, the most famous fictional heroin user of the Eighties remained Zammo in Grange Hill. The cinematic vocabulary of the contemporary heroin film was laid down in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy (1989), although the film is set in the late Sixties. The gang in it are equal opportunity abusers - they'll consume whatever they can steal. The heroin angle isn't ignored, though - not when the film includes a cameo from William Burroughs. It is the things Van Sant does stylistically - the wooziness, the changing speeds, the willingness to render visions literally on screen - that are the template for subsequent heroin films. And it looks great: in contrast with the griminess of Panic In Needle Park or Sid And Nancy, most recent heroin films have been seductively lovely in appearance, at least until the infected arms appear. The seduction is necessary to explain the addiction, which is the central theme of most of these films. They are about characters being rendered powerless by a desire, being taken over by a force outside their control. This sets up a series of much-visited plot points. The ritual of trying to get clean, which can be played for comedy (Trainspotting, Gridlock'd) or used to show the terrors of cold turkey. The disastrous descent back into addiction. And finally either redemption or tragedy: the films break down philosophically into the ones that believe life after addiction is possible and those that suggest there is no escape. But what gives the heroin an edge over other addictive drugs - including alcohol - from a filmmaker's point of view is the shock factor of needles: shooting up makes heroin use seem so more extreme than any other drug use. Not just the act of injecting and the shots of the syringe filling with blood, but the physical consequences of scabs, sores, infection and ultimately amputation of limbs. Conversely, High Art (1998), in which the drug is only snorted, makes it seem an utterly appealing lifestyle option - lazy evenings lounging in a stylishly post-Warholian milieu. Certainly, there is a degree of romanticisation in heroin films, even if the characters in them either end up badly or undergo horrifying experiences on the road to some kind of recovery. But then if taking heroin was not - at least initially - an extraordinary experience, no one would get sucked in. A film that can't show why its characters end up stealing from their mothers to feed the habit is one you'll end up ignoring. Are Hollywood's junkies too beautiful? Possibly, but when the film gets it right - as Requiem For A Dream does - that should make a complex anti-drugs message more powerful. And morality apart, heroin - as a subject matter - has given us some great movies, just as it has inspired some great records. It's a habit that filmmakers shouldn't try to kick just yet. \u0095 'Requiem For A Dream' screens at the London Film Festival tomorrow (020 7928 3232) before going on general release next January.",

Senior Express insiders also question Black's record in investing in newspaper titles. Yet they forget the small fortune he has poured into Canada's two-year-old National Post, the first major newspaper to be launched in North America since Gannett's USA Today in 1982. With weekday sales of 325,000 the Post is overtaking the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail and due to make its first profit this quarter, Colson says. </p> <p>'We are certainly interested in the Express,' Colson says.

And that's why we've not got hold of any UK regional newspaper groups.' </p> <p>Hollinger's exasperation with the doubters is easily fathomable, too. When it put most of its 350 North American titles on the block earlier this year, it clearly said control of certain papers, notably the Telegraph, was not up for grabs. Yet it has since rebuffed several approaches for its die-hard Tory title. Among other flagship papers the Jerusalem Post is also off limits, Colson says, despite reports of an auction by Black's Wall Street advisers. </p> <p>'Our intention is to take the CanWest proceeds, pay down the debt and look for other newspaper opportunities in the US, Europe and UK,' Colson says. 'We're now concentrating on bigger titles with more potential for synergies with the internet.' </p> <p>The world wide web was the stuff of science fiction when Black bought his first Canadian newspaper at the age of 22. He was born to wealth, the son of a brewery magnate and the heiress to an insurance fortune, and over three decades the strident right-winger built a newspaper empire to rival Canada's traditional barons, the Thomson family. An eager military historian (Napoleon is his hero, leadership his fascination), Black lighted on the Telegraph in 1985, four years after the Thomsons sold the Times and Sunday Times to Murdoch. At the time the titles were floundering but Black had forged his success on brutal cost-cutting and by 1990 the Telegraph group was handsomely back in profit. </p> <p>In recent years the Sunday Telegraph has gone from third to second place among the quality broadsheets, with a circulation of 813,000 to the Sunday Times's 1.3m, by virtue of a seven-day subscription promotion. But only one-third of those sales are at full price (against The Observer's entire 448,000 circulation). It is a testament to the strength of the Daily Telegraph - which still sells more than 1m copies a day - that Hollinger's UK arm turned in increased profits of \u00a343m on turnover of \u00a3340m last year. </p> <p> In 1994, the Electronic Telegraph was the first UK paper to go live on the internet. And, along with the \u00a3100m or so Hollinger is spending on its printing plants at Docklands and Trafford Park, a total revamp of its web offering is a main priority. This month, the new telegraph.co.uk website will launch sport.telegraph, with travel.telegraph to follow as part of a \u00a310m investment by Hollinger Telegraph New Media (HTNM), the UK internet arm launched this year. </p> <p>Corporately, Hollinger is still looking for a global new media partner, which can bring it the dimensions AOL added to Time Warner. It has also come close to buying papers on the Continent, Colson says. And with the Telegraph titles taking just 4.3 per cent of UK national newspaper circulation, the main opposition to Hollinger buying the Express is likely to come from Labour and Lord Rothermere rather than the competition authorities. </p> <p>Far from giving up print, Black's dream remains to buy a US title to give him more clout than the Chicago Sun Times, Hollinger's biggest US paper to date. And, as befits a Telegraph proprietor driven by power, money and influence, to clinch that seat in the Lords which was blocked by Canadian prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien a year ago.</p>",

'Our intention is to take the CanWest proceeds, pay down the debt and look for other newspaper opportunities in the US, Europe and UK,' Colson says. 'We're now concentrating on bigger titles with more potential for synergies with the internet.' The world wide web was the stuff of science fiction when Black bought his first Canadian newspaper at the age of 22. He was born to wealth, the son of a brewery magnate and the heiress to an insurance fortune, and over three decades the strident right-winger built a newspaper empire to rival Canada's traditional barons, the Thomson family. An eager military historian (Napoleon is his hero, leadership his fascination), Black lighted on the Telegraph in 1985, four years after the Thomsons sold the Times and Sunday Times to Murdoch. At the time the titles were floundering but Black had forged his success on brutal cost-cutting and by 1990 the Telegraph group was handsomely back in profit. In recent years the Sunday Telegraph has gone from third to second place among the quality broadsheets, with a circulation of 813,000 to the Sunday Times's 1.3m, by virtue of a seven-day subscription promotion. But only one-third of those sales are at full price (against The Observer's entire 448,000 circulation). It is a testament to the strength of the Daily Telegraph - which still sells more than 1m copies a day - that Hollinger's UK arm turned in increased profits of \u00a343m on turnover of \u00a3340m last year. In 1994, the Electronic Telegraph was the first UK paper to go live on the internet. And, along with the \u00a3100m or so Hollinger is spending on its printing plants at Docklands and Trafford Park, a total revamp of its web offering is a main priority. This month, the new telegraph.co.uk website will launch sport.telegraph, with travel.telegraph to follow as part of a \u00a310m investment by Hollinger Telegraph New Media (HTNM), the UK internet arm launched this year. Corporately, Hollinger is still looking for a global new media partner, which can bring it the dimensions AOL added to Time Warner. It has also come close to buying papers on the Continent, Colson says. And with the Telegraph titles taking just 4.3 per cent of UK national newspaper circulation, the main opposition to Hollinger buying the Express is likely to come from Labour and Lord Rothermere rather than the competition authorities. Far from giving up print, Black's dream remains to buy a US title to give him more clout than the Chicago Sun Times, Hollinger's biggest US paper to date. And, as befits a Telegraph proprietor driven by power, money and influence, to clinch that seat in the Lords which was blocked by Canadian prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien a year ago.",

      "body": "<p>Stupidity is infectious. Read any book by Wilbur Smith and then try to write an interesting sentence. Or how else do we explain people who go to a Lloyd Webber concert together and decide unaccountably to mark the end of his 'music' with applause? Stupidity is simply too contagious; and the more time we spend exposed to it, the quicker we exhibit the nastier symptoms. </p> <p>Which, I presume, is why I am asking Donna Air some flamboyantly stupid questions. She's recently turned 21, on 2 August to be precise, and so I work out she must be a Leo, yes? Yes! You too? Yes, actually, I'm ... I mean, what am I doing ? It's not just that I am old enough to be her father's freakishly young brother. I just don't often ask people about their star signs. </p> <p>And it is absolutely not Donna's fault, the stupidity stuff, it honestly isn't. She is refreshingly, zestfully, a long way from stupid, despite what we've been strongly led to expect. It's the vacuous nature of all the publicity that has surrounded her since her early teens - the lads' mags, the banal red-top interviews and the relentless, repetitive mentions of the word 'babe' - that lead you to dumb down your own expectations, until you realise you've duped yourself; she might be practically flawless, but she's not clueless. </p> <p>Although - and here, I suppose, there is a bit of a flaw - while she assuredly has the smarts, she can hardly deny all responsibility for her public thicko image. This is a girl who's known little but the chase for fame since the age of 10, since first auditioning in her native city for teen soap Byker Grove - 'Newcastle's so small, everyone's been an extra in Byker Grove at some point' - and winning a five-year stint as Charlie Charlton. </p> <p>Five years later, at 15, she came to London and became a professional teen celebrity - hanging out in the Met Bar with Liam, drinking too much, taking her clothes off for lads' mags, hosting an MTV programme, trying an abortive singing career ('I was simply crap,' she says now, in her new, honest, grown-up mode), winning record numbers of sweaty-palmed internet hits and landing annually near the top of FHM 's list of the world's 100 sexiest women. </p> <p>Her looks have never been in doubt; her talent and capacity for joined-up thinking have. Knowingly, she has now called her own company Airhead Productions, but knowingness might not be enough: caught somewhere in blonde-land between the success of Kylie and the tat of Patsy, there's still a danger it could all go the wrong way. </p> <p>So despite her recent stints on Big Breakfast, where her Geordie charm and a certain native wit have won new followers, and a serious, meaty role in ITV's forthcoming Catherine Cookson six-parter A Dinner of Herbs, and her constant refrain that she has grown up - I have to ask her whether she knows that it might be a long time before people take her seriously. </p> <p>'You can't blame people for thinking what they think, I suppose,' she says, smoking fitfully, cross-legged in the Soho offices of her production company, 'because I haven't known what I wanted to do myself until now. I was 10 years old when I started, I didn't really have what you'd call a game plan.' She asks her PR, gracefully, to leave; we've got through the star-sign stuff, I've managed not to ask her for her favourite colour, and I suspect she wants to expand on the serious stuff. ('This isn't the kind of interview I normally do,' she says thoughtfully.) </p> <p>'You see, I can't get the acting out of my head at the moment. Sorry if this sounds cliched, but ... you know when you've found that thing you want to do for the rest of your life? I've finally found it. I just love being on set; I want to work at it, work really hard, and at something that will last. Look at films like Apocalypse Now: hardly anyone puts that kind of effort into films now, into anything that will still be remembered in 10 years' time. </p> <p>'Acting's harder now, but better. I'm older, and more conscious of everyone, so I think more. Byker Grove I just went in and did. Now, for the first time, I want to make a difference, be remembered for something good: I'm learning patience for the first time in my life, and I'm happy not to rush things. When I was young I thought everything was going to be handed to me on a plate. But then I realised you've got to work so incredibly hard if you want to be memorably good, not just ... adequate. Reality has set in, and I'm ready for it now. </p> <p>'And I've got through that fame for fame's sake thing, I'm disillusioned by it. I mean, it's bollocks, really, isn't it? I did want to be famous at one point, but it doesn't really interest me now. You don't really have to do anything to be a celebrity in London. I got quite embarrassed the other day, being followed around by this photographer, and I thought, what have I done? I do work hard, but I haven't done any great pieces of work, nothing to be proud of in 10 years' time, and that's the urge I've got just now.' </p> <p>The change, she supposes, came during her eighteenth year, when her parents split up, her relationship broke up and various management teams fell out. The bars and the booze - bourbon, vodka, tequila, 'all the strong stuff' grew boring, she says, and she grew up. </p> <p>Now she just enjoys her job and knows it for what it is - 'Christ, it's not brain surgery, you just have some fun and try to wake people up, it's not meant to be taken seriously' - while scouting quietly for good, serious film roles and trying to use the hard knowledge won by a decade's flirtation with fame to avoid being taken for a ride by Hollywood. </p> <p>Did she regret much? 'God, no, why should I? I've been lucky. And most of what I did was my own choice. I'm not naive, I'm quite aware what these magazines want. I'm not going to do them then whinge afterwards that they've printed my boobs. But I only do stuff now if I've got something to talk about, because there's so many of the girls doing the rounds now for these magazines, but if there's no content to what you do then you're fucked, basically. And I was 15 to 18 when most of the pictures were taken, so ... yes, I feel different now. </p> <p>'Though I'm not saying I'll never do a bikini shot again because I probably will. If there's something I want to promote I'll give them that. It's the way of the world, that sex sells; it's sad but it's true.' Surely she isn't saying that she wishes she'd been plainer, and therefore taken more seriously? </p> <p>She raises an arch eyebrow. 'Not really, because I don't think I was going to be taken too seriously anyway at the age of 15, do you?' It's not quite the suffragette spirit of Emily Davison - 'Emily Wilding Davison', she corrects, with a smile - but it's probably a coherent enough stance for today's morals, and she still feels she's using the magazines every bit as much as they use her. The thought of the pictures being out there forever on the net doesn't she says, really worry her at all. </p> <p>So what, I wonder, does? Love, or the lack of it? She thinks for a long time. 'Yes, it would be good to find somebody I could happily spend the rest of my life with.' There's no boyfriend at the moment? 'No. But I'm quite happy on my own, always have been, and I've got my friends. </p> <p>'What would worry me? Well, I'm not interested in what people think day to day, not worried at all by criticism. But I would hate, really hate , to reach 60 or something and have done nothing good to be remembered by. Now, with acting, I finally know what I'm going to do, and, trust me, I'm going to do it well. Yes, you're right, it would really depress me just to be remembered as a pretty airhead. It's terribly important for me to be good now.' </p> <p>But what, I worry, if the acting doesn't work out? And I worry genuinely, for this kind, gamine Geordie has been funny and honest throughout, and she seems incredibly determined, and yet the vagaries of film careers have brought down a million such souls. 'It will.' What, with no room for doubt? 'It will. It has to. It's all I want to do.' She gazes at me steadily, all grown up at last.</p>",

Hugely, in many ways. The President is top dog in foreign policy and rigging the Supreme Court. His choice, for Americans, defines who they are and where they find their own centre of gravity. He will, whoever he is, set an agenda on health, education, social security, that tips some of the balances.</p> <p>But that is also all of a piece with the Murdoch ratings debacle.

      "body": "<p>On 21 July of next year I'm going to do something deeply unfashionable: I'm going to get married. According to the Office of National Statistics, the number of people getting married between 1988 and 1998 declined by approximately 25 per cent, dipping below the 300,000 mark in 1993 for the first time in 50 years. In the same period, the number of divorces fell by less than 5 per cent. On current trends, divorces will start outnumbering marriages by the year 2025, though I hope Caroline and I won't be adding to that statistic.</p> <p>There are two possible explanations for this: either women are turning men down more or men are proposing less. Now, it's true that Caroline refused me at least half a dozen times before finally succumbing, but I think men are probably popping the question less. Judging from the presence of Bridget Jones and her pale imitators on the bestseller lists, women certainly seem more anxious about remaining single than men. Indeed, the reluctance of men to get married - our so-called 'commitment-phobia' - is one of the main themes of contemporary popular culture, from EastEnders to Men Behaving Badly.</p> <p>Is it really fear of commitment that's holding us back or something more rational? According to Dr Jonathan Scales, a research fellow at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, men are financially better off if they remain single. 'Men's disposable income drops when they get married, while women's goes up,' he says. For a man, getting married is like entering a new tax bracket without any corresponding increase in income; it's like moving to Sweden.</p> <p>My accountant confirmed that there was no tax benefit in getting married, at least not since the Government abolished the married couple's allowance last April. 'Start saving is the best advice I can give to you,' he said dryly. The only advantage he could think of would be if I transferred some of my income-earning assets into Caroline's name in order to equalise our incomes, thereby reducing our joint tax burden. However, he quickly pointed out that I don't have any income-earning assets and, even if I did, there'd be no guarantee that Caroline would return them to me if we got divorced.</p> <p>My only asset is my London flat and, following a landmark decision by the Law Lords recently, that won't be safe either if things go pear-shaped. It's a common misconception that wives have always been able to lay claim to half their husbands' assets when, in fact, that's been true of Scotland but not of England and Wales. However, the Law Lords have now decided that judges should regard a 50-50 split as a 'yardstick' when dividing a couple's assets. From a financial point of view, getting married is about as sensible as investing your life savings in a fly-by-night dotcom.</p> <p>So why am I doing it? Why would any man in possession of a good fortune - or a bedsit in Shepherd's Bush - be in want of a wife? The only compelling reason, it seems to me, is to make it harder to split up. To paraphrase Shakespeare, marriage binds you together with hoops of steel. In the less romantic language of economics, it creates a 'barrier to exit'. Should Caroline or I wish to leave each other, there'll be all sorts of hurdles in our path once we've taken our wedding vows. From my point of view, that's quite reassuring. Caroline's dumped me twice already and, even though there's no guarantee she won't do it again, she's less likely to after we're married. Since I'm in love with her, that's a powerful incentive.</p> <p>In general terms, creating a 'barrier to exit' is a better reason for women to get married than for men, particularly if they want to have children. Contrary to popular myth, there's no such thing as a 'common-law wife'. As Jerry Hall discovered to her cost earlier this year, an unmarried woman has a far weaker claim on her partner's assets than a married one, even if they have four children together. In this respect, the Law Lords' decision, while providing men with yet another incentive not to tie the knot, may end up strengthening the institution of marriage since it makes it more expensive for husbands to leave their wives. This is one of the reasons Scotland has a lower divorce rate than England and Wales.</p> <p>Tories want to make the commitment to marriage a cornerstone of their party's manifesto and the fact that married couples are more likely to stay together than unmarried ones is often cited by them as Exhibit A in the case for marriage. They point out that children born out of wedlock are more likely to be brought up in one-parent families and, as a result, will place a greater burden on the state. This isn't just in terms of social security. There's a well-established correlation between illegitimacy and criminal behaviour.</p> <p>However, it's possible to address this problem without necessarily strengthening the institution of marriage. For instance, the law could be changed to make it more expensive for unmarried men to leave their partners, particularly if they have children. Scottish law is about to be reformed to strengthen the rights of female cohabitees and next year the Law Commission plans to publish a Consultation Paper which will effectively propose that the legal privileges and obligations of married couples in England and Wales should be extended to cohabitees.</p> <p>The net effect of these changes would be to impose the same 'barrier to exit' on cohabitees as married couples. Once a man had lived with a woman for long enough she'd become his wife, whether he liked it or not. The proposed changes in the law would, in effect, create the institution of the 'common-law wife'. From a legal point of view, marriage and cohabitation would be completely equivalent, just as they are from a tax point of view at the moment.</p> <p>Given the high illegitimate birth rate - 33.9 per cent of all births in England and Wales took place outside of wedlock in 1995 - these legal reforms seem like a sensible response to the inevitable. At the very least, they may result in fewer absentee fathers. However, they would also end up limiting people's choices. Living together is one step; getting married is another. If the law's changed, couples will either have to go the whole hog or go their separate ways. There'll be no intermediate stage.</p> <p>Is there any other reason to preserve the unique legal status of marriage? In spite of the economic disadvantages, I've decided to tie the knot. Why? Because it's a very public way for Caroline and I to express our commitment to each other. If we'd chosen not to get married, but to simply live together in perpetuity, there's no recognised way in which we could communicate that decision to our families and friends. We could have a party, I suppose, but it wouldn't be the same as taking solemn vows in front of our nearest and dearest.</p> <p>There's something about the formality of a wedding, its official nature, that makes the decision to stay together that much more binding. On 21 July of next year, when we promise to love and cherish one another, in sickness and in health, till death us do part, it's a promise we both intend to keep and the fact that we'll be making it in front of 150 witnesses will make it that much harder to break.</p> <p>This is the greatest 'barrier to exit'. If the law's changed to make marriage and cohabiting legally equivalent, it may make it more inconvenient for unmarried couples to separate, but it won't make it any more shameful. For a married couple to split up, by contrast, they have to break their vows. By anyone's reckoning - Christian and non-Christian alike - that's unethical. It's this moral component that makes marriage such a unique institution. It isn't just a partnership conjoined for two people's mutual benefit; it's a sacred union founded on a promise.</p> <p>Oh, and one other thing. Caroline's training to be a solicitor, while I'm a freelance journalist, so I fully expect my disposable income to increase after we've tied the knot.</p> <p>\u0095 Toby Young is the editor of the Spectator.co.uk.

Judging from the presence of Bridget Jones and her pale imitators on the bestseller lists, women certainly seem more anxious about remaining single than men. Indeed, the reluctance of men to get married - our so-called 'commitment-phobia' - is one of the main themes of contemporary popular culture, from EastEnders to Men Behaving Badly. Is it really fear of commitment that's holding us back or something more rational? According to Dr Jonathan Scales, a research fellow at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, men are financially better off if they remain single. 'Men's disposable income drops when they get married, while women's goes up,' he says. For a man, getting married is like entering a new tax bracket without any corresponding increase in income; it's like moving to Sweden. My accountant confirmed that there was no tax benefit in getting married, at least not since the Government abolished the married couple's allowance last April. 'Start saving is the best advice I can give to you,' he said dryly. The only advantage he could think of would be if I transferred some of my income-earning assets into Caroline's name in order to equalise our incomes, thereby reducing our joint tax burden. However, he quickly pointed out that I don't have any income-earning assets and, even if I did, there'd be no guarantee that Caroline would return them to me if we got divorced. My only asset is my London flat and, following a landmark decision by the Law Lords recently, that won't be safe either if things go pear-shaped. It's a common misconception that wives have always been able to lay claim to half their husbands' assets when, in fact, that's been true of Scotland but not of England and Wales. However, the Law Lords have now decided that judges should regard a 50-50 split as a 'yardstick' when dividing a couple's assets. From a financial point of view, getting married is about as sensible as investing your life savings in a fly-by-night dotcom. So why am I doing it? Why would any man in possession of a good fortune - or a bedsit in Shepherd's Bush - be in want of a wife? The only compelling reason, it seems to me, is to make it harder to split up. To paraphrase Shakespeare, marriage binds you together with hoops of steel. In the less romantic language of economics, it creates a 'barrier to exit'. Should Caroline or I wish to leave each other, there'll be all sorts of hurdles in our path once we've taken our wedding vows. From my point of view, that's quite reassuring. Caroline's dumped me twice already and, even though there's no guarantee she won't do it again, she's less likely to after we're married. Since I'm in love with her, that's a powerful incentive. In general terms, creating a 'barrier to exit' is a better reason for women to get married than for men, particularly if they want to have children. Contrary to popular myth, there's no such thing as a 'common-law wife'. As Jerry Hall discovered to her cost earlier this year, an unmarried woman has a far weaker claim on her partner's assets than a married one, even if they have four children together. In this respect, the Law Lords' decision, while providing men with yet another incentive not to tie the knot, may end up strengthening the institution of marriage since it makes it more expensive for husbands to leave their wives. This is one of the reasons Scotland has a lower divorce rate than England and Wales. Tories want to make the commitment to marriage a cornerstone of their party's manifesto and the fact that married couples are more likely to stay together than unmarried ones is often cited by them as Exhibit A in the case for marriage. They point out that children born out of wedlock are more likely to be brought up in one-parent families and, as a result, will place a greater burden on the state. This isn't just in terms of social security. There's a well-established correlation between illegitimacy and criminal behaviour. However, it's possible to address this problem without necessarily strengthening the institution of marriage. For instance, the law could be changed to make it more expensive for unmarried men to leave their partners, particularly if they have children. Scottish law is about to be reformed to strengthen the rights of female cohabitees and next year the Law Commission plans to publish a Consultation Paper which will effectively propose that the legal privileges and obligations of married couples in England and Wales should be extended to cohabitees. The net effect of these changes would be to impose the same 'barrier to exit' on cohabitees as married couples. Once a man had lived with a woman for long enough she'd become his wife, whether he liked it or not. The proposed changes in the law would, in effect, create the institution of the 'common-law wife'. From a legal point of view, marriage and cohabitation would be completely equivalent, just as they are from a tax point of view at the moment. Given the high illegitimate birth rate - 33.9 per cent of all births in England and Wales took place outside of wedlock in 1995 - these legal reforms seem like a sensible response to the inevitable. At the very least, they may result in fewer absentee fathers. However, they would also end up limiting people's choices. Living together is one step; getting married is another. If the law's changed, couples will either have to go the whole hog or go their separate ways. There'll be no intermediate stage. Is there any other reason to preserve the unique legal status of marriage? In spite of the economic disadvantages, I've decided to tie the knot. Why? Because it's a very public way for Caroline and I to express our commitment to each other. If we'd chosen not to get married, but to simply live together in perpetuity, there's no recognised way in which we could communicate that decision to our families and friends. We could have a party, I suppose, but it wouldn't be the same as taking solemn vows in front of our nearest and dearest. There's something about the formality of a wedding, its official nature, that makes the decision to stay together that much more binding. On 21 July of next year, when we promise to love and cherish one another, in sickness and in health, till death us do part, it's a promise we both intend to keep and the fact that we'll be making it in front of 150 witnesses will make it that much harder to break. This is the greatest 'barrier to exit'. If the law's changed to make marriage and cohabiting legally equivalent, it may make it more inconvenient for unmarried couples to separate, but it won't make it any more shameful. For a married couple to split up, by contrast, they have to break their vows. By anyone's reckoning - Christian and non-Christian alike - that's unethical. It's this moral component that makes marriage such a unique institution. It isn't just a partnership conjoined for two people's mutual benefit; it's a sacred union founded on a promise. Oh, and one other thing. Caroline's training to be a solicitor, while I'm a freelance journalist, so I fully expect my disposable income to increase after we've tied the knot. \u0095 Toby Young is the editor of the Spectator.co.uk.

It was spring and the people rejoiced: all over the country could be heard the music of trumpets, and the glad cries of his name.

Hayes is a sober observer, but even he it seems has become seduced by the power the myth of America can exercise over the political imagination here. He cast his mind back to the Clinton visit to Ireland and the warm glow instilled by the Bill and Hillary show at Belfast City Hall, and appears to have swallowed the 'Days like these' propaganda that coloured so much coverage of the visit.</p> <p>What is forgotten is that during the visit the first dark hints of an end to the IRA ceasefire were conveyed to American officials. As Birney and Julian O'Neil point out in their account of the trip, 'When the President calls', Niall O'Dowd, the Irish Voice publisher, and Congressman Bruce Morrison were taken to a house off the Falls and told on the very day Clinton was in west Belfast that the IRA cessation was about to collapse. Meanwhile, near Crossmaglen, the South Armagh brigade was getting ready to transport a deadly cargo to London.

At least Gore knows where Ireland is whereas Dubya, like some of the Republic's soccer team's former English-born stars, would need someone to show him the little piece of sod off Europe and tell him 'that's Ireland, Mr President'. But if America elects Bush, the village idiot from Texas to lead the most powerful parish council on the planet, this Tuesday there will be at least one positive outcome.

The superstate whose ambitions menace our sovereignty and frames our policy choices is not the European Union - it is the USA.</p> <p>The range of American influence is already intense and growing. It was American investment banks which wanted to put the London Stock Exchange up for sale to Frankfurt. Our enfeebled film industry depends on distribution through American-owned cinema chains. Our research scientists register their patents at the US Patent Office. Our drug companies seek the approval of the US Federal Drug Administration. Our academics make their intellectual mark by being published in American journals refereed by American professors around American benchmarks and objectives.</p> <p>Our politicians look to America for their policies - William Hague 'denationalising compassion' as he attacks the welfare state or Gordon Brown building a social policy around tax credits are both overtly borrowing from Republicans and Democrats alike. And the American companies buying up our leading firms bring with them the same expectation about how to lobby and how to union-bust as they do at home, generating copycat British political lobbying firms and copycat legal experts adept at bending employment law.</p> <p>This is an American capitalism much harsher and more profit-seeking than ever before. It is creating a society in which everything - even votes - is increasingly up for sale. We think America is the same friend it has always been, but it is changing for the worse.</p> <p>Those with doubts should take a look at the US's relations with the rest of the world. The international framework in which the British operate is firmly run from Washington, and President Clinton has chosen not to challenge a tide in which the assertion of 'America first' is becoming ever more aggressive - and which Bush is pledged to intensify.</p> <p>If you are worried about global warming and climate change, then beware Bush; he will have no truck with any international treaty limiting the emission of American carbon dioxide. Debt relief for the poorest countries? Forget it. The establishment of an international criminal court? Baying for the Moon. Even American support for the United Nations, IMF and World Bank - flawed as they are - should not be taken for granted. Bush, for all his homespun affability, is bad news.</p> <p>He personifies the new business-led American ideology. He portrays Washington and the Federal government as evil, business and the private sector as virtuous. He has no truck with those who worry about the decline of public debate, public spirit or the common interest. Bush's heroes are those of American conservative mythology; the god-fearing, gun-owning, male small farmer or small businessman who is rugged and self-reliant. His 'compassion' does not stretch to spending hard cash on alleviating poverty or promoting educational opportunity. That would be unAmerican.</p> <p>Bush and the coalition of the Business Roundtable, National Rifle Association (NRA) and Christian Right which supports him are indifferent to the gross inequalities that disfigure American life; the mushrooming of millions of 'gated' communities at the top and the harsh insecurity at the bottom. Nor do they worry about environmental despoilation of their country, the violence in their cities or the gross commercialisation that intrudes into every avenue of American endeavour. Rather, they would advance inequality with across-the-board tax cuts that favour the rich, entrench gun ownership, weaken what is left of universal medical and pension provision, and cut corporate interests free of what little regulation remains. It is sheer poison.</p> <p>The depths to which Bush and the Republicans have sunk is their mendacious approach to the impact of money on American politics. This will be the most expensive presidential election campaign ever. Total political advertising expenditure, including soft money, is estimated to be more than $1 billion. And the business givers - the investment banks which demand more financial deregulation, the NRA which wants no change to the gun-control laws, the drug companies opposed to prescription drugs, the oil companies which want to drill in the protected wilderness and so on - all want to buy private advantage at the expense of public interest.</p> <p>In this, the Democrats, however business-friendly they try to be, will always be outspent by the Republicans. The trick is to evade the formal laws on campaign finance by enlisting interest groups to advertise on your behalf, which as long as their adverts do not mention 'vote for' or 'elect', is deemed as soft money - and legal. In the last four weeks, the Republicans and their networks have outspent the Democrats two to one, literally trying to buy the election.</p> <p>It makes a mockery of democracy, as both Bill Bradley and John McCain - challenging for the nomination of the Democrat and Republican parties - argued in the primaries. But while Al Gore is pledged to attempt some reform of campaign finance, Bush is unapologetic. The state should not stand in the way of those who want to give money to politics.</p> <p>It is an indifference to the public domain and accompanying celebration of the private that is uniquely American - and which has deep roots in the experience of the early settlers and the expansion west. Extending citizenship rights beyond the narrow domain established by the eighteenth-century constitution and into the social and economic realm has always been fiercely contested by the American Right as 'unAmerican'.</p> <p>Yet the paradox is that Bush's challenge comes as a growing mass of ordinary Americans are ever more concerned about the harshness of their capitalism, the decline of their politics and the illiberality of much social policy. Religious attendance is falling as is support for capital punishment. There is no fall-away in the support for international engagement. Support for gun control mounts. There is no especial demand for more tax cuts; rather, there is a recognition, as in Britain, that necessary public goods have to be paid for.</p> <p>Without his stunning war chest or the 'integrity' issue after Lewinsky, Bush would be in trouble. But if he wins, or even narrowly loses on Tuesday, his campaign stands as a warning. Beware the powerful American Right - they menace us all.

And the business givers - the investment banks which demand more financial deregulation, the NRA which wants no change to the gun-control laws, the drug companies opposed to prescription drugs, the oil companies which want to drill in the protected wilderness and so on - all want to buy private advantage at the expense of public interest. In this, the Democrats, however business-friendly they try to be, will always be outspent by the Republicans. The trick is to evade the formal laws on campaign finance by enlisting interest groups to advertise on your behalf, which as long as their adverts do not mention 'vote for' or 'elect', is deemed as soft money - and legal. In the last four weeks, the Republicans and their networks have outspent the Democrats two to one, literally trying to buy the election. It makes a mockery of democracy, as both Bill Bradley and John McCain - challenging for the nomination of the Democrat and Republican parties - argued in the primaries. But while Al Gore is pledged to attempt some reform of campaign finance, Bush is unapologetic. The state should not stand in the way of those who want to give money to politics. It is an indifference to the public domain and accompanying celebration of the private that is uniquely American - and which has deep roots in the experience of the early settlers and the expansion west. Extending citizenship rights beyond the narrow domain established by the eighteenth-century constitution and into the social and economic realm has always been fiercely contested by the American Right as 'unAmerican'. Yet the paradox is that Bush's challenge comes as a growing mass of ordinary Americans are ever more concerned about the harshness of their capitalism, the decline of their politics and the illiberality of much social policy. Religious attendance is falling as is support for capital punishment. There is no fall-away in the support for international engagement. Support for gun control mounts. There is no especial demand for more tax cuts; rather, there is a recognition, as in Britain, that necessary public goods have to be paid for. Without his stunning war chest or the 'integrity' issue after Lewinsky, Bush would be in trouble. But if he wins, or even narrowly loses on Tuesday, his campaign stands as a warning. Beware the powerful American Right - they menace us all.

      "body": "<b> Margherita Taylor: </b> It was a memorable first meeting. Dermot and I had been paired up on a pilot for a sports show, No Balls Allowed . It was a long day because it really wasn't working between us. He's a perfectionist, so we kept having to do things over and over again. And when he couldn't remember a line, he'd hit his head really hard with his shoe. It scared me - I didn't know him. After that, I didn't think we'd ever see each other again. <p> No Balls was low budget. We had to really rough it and that brought us closer together. By the time T4 started, we knew each other inside out. We both really wanted it to work. We're both passionate about what we do, so we'd put in the extra hours, make sure we knew the script backwards, and work on making it funnier and more creative. The banter was the way we were in real life, and we became these two exaggerated characters on screen. Dermot would muck things up and I'd tell him off. I was quite motherly. I was the one who would say, 'Let's rehearse this again. Have you done your homework?' Now I think we are much more equal: what you see on screen is 100 per cent what you get off screen. </p> <p>We rely on each other a lot. When you're live in front of a couple of million people, you need to make sure the person sitting next to you is going to cover your back if you get it wrong. Dermot knows how I'm going to finish a sentence or how I'm going to start it. I trust him 100 per cent. </p> <p>Dermot's a real pro. I rate him among the top five presenters in the country, along with Johnny Vaughan and Chris Evans. Now, after he's done The Big Breakfast, people are finally seeing how talented he is. </p> <p>In a recent interview, he described me as 'his mum, his girlfriend and his sister rolled into one'. It's true. I was very nervous when I had to present the Dancestar 2000 Awards and I needed a hug from Dermot, in the same way a girlfriend would want a hug from her boyfriend. But even though we're both single, it's best to keep our relationship as it is. We work well like that. I wouldn't want to find out that Dermot doesn't wash his socks or picks his nose. </p> <p> <b> Dermot O'Leary: </b> I'd seen Margherita on Videotec and heard her on Capital Radio. So when we both turned up for the No Balls pilot, people knew who she was. I've never felt star-struck with anyone, but there was this certain pressure, especially when you're trying to get a job. My Achilles heel has always been learning lines. I used to have a tendency to hit myself when I couldn't remember them. It was essentially a day of self-flagellation. I went away thinking: a) I haven't got the job, and b) I'm never going to work ever again, because that girl thinks I'm a lunatic. </p> <p>Although we had a really good time doing No Balls Allowed, the first T4 was what really broke the ice. It was our first live show. We'd meet up night after night, just panicking. It was mutual fear that brought us together. </p> <p>We have a very natural friendship. There's no sexual tension. I look at her and I think she looks fabulous, but I never once think, I'll ask her out. It would be like sleeping with your sister. She's one of the most attractive girls anyone could know, but I genuinely recoil at the thought of even kissing her. I'm not particularly laddish, but when I'm around her, you always sense there's a school mam in the room - in the nicest possible way. She's always telling me off. She tells me off for swearing. She's like Mary Poppins. MT is the black Mary Poppins. If I start flirting with girl guests, she'll warn them off. She's totally like my mum. </p> <p>MT is my safety net.

      "bodyText": "Margherita Taylor: It was a memorable first meeting. Dermot and I had been paired up on a pilot for a sports show, No Balls Allowed . It was a long day because it really wasn't working between us. He's a perfectionist, so we kept having to do things over and over again. And when he couldn't remember a line, he'd hit his head really hard with his shoe. It scared me - I didn't know him. After that, I didn't think we'd ever see each other again. No Balls was low budget. We had to really rough it and that brought us closer together. By the time T4 started, we knew each other inside out. We both really wanted it to work. We're both passionate about what we do, so we'd put in the extra hours, make sure we knew the script backwards, and work on making it funnier and more creative. The banter was the way we were in real life, and we became these two exaggerated characters on screen. Dermot would muck things up and I'd tell him off. I was quite motherly. I was the one who would say, 'Let's rehearse this again. Have you done your homework?' Now I think we are much more equal: what you see on screen is 100 per cent what you get off screen. We rely on each other a lot. When you're live in front of a couple of million people, you need to make sure the person sitting next to you is going to cover your back if you get it wrong. Dermot knows how I'm going to finish a sentence or how I'm going to start it. I trust him 100 per cent. Dermot's a real pro. I rate him among the top five presenters in the country, along with Johnny Vaughan and Chris Evans. Now, after he's done The Big Breakfast, people are finally seeing how talented he is. In a recent interview, he described me as 'his mum, his girlfriend and his sister rolled into one'. It's true. I was very nervous when I had to present the Dancestar 2000 Awards and I needed a hug from Dermot, in the same way a girlfriend would want a hug from her boyfriend. But even though we're both single, it's best to keep our relationship as it is. We work well like that. I wouldn't want to find out that Dermot doesn't wash his socks or picks his nose. Dermot O'Leary: I'd seen Margherita on Videotec and heard her on Capital Radio. So when we both turned up for the No Balls pilot, people knew who she was. I've never felt star-struck with anyone, but there was this certain pressure, especially when you're trying to get a job. My Achilles heel has always been learning lines. I used to have a tendency to hit myself when I couldn't remember them. It was essentially a day of self-flagellation. I went away thinking: a) I haven't got the job, and b) I'm never going to work ever again, because that girl thinks I'm a lunatic. Although we had a really good time doing No Balls Allowed, the first T4 was what really broke the ice. It was our first live show. We'd meet up night after night, just panicking. It was mutual fear that brought us together. We have a very natural friendship. There's no sexual tension. I look at her and I think she looks fabulous, but I never once think, I'll ask her out. It would be like sleeping with your sister. She's one of the most attractive girls anyone could know, but I genuinely recoil at the thought of even kissing her. I'm not particularly laddish, but when I'm around her, you always sense there's a school mam in the room - in the nicest possible way. She's always telling me off. She tells me off for swearing. She's like Mary Poppins. MT is the black Mary Poppins. If I start flirting with girl guests, she'll warn them off. She's totally like my mum. MT is my safety net. When we go out live, we both back each other up. She'll always pick up where I left off. I act like a football manager to her and she to me; we're always giving each other little hugs. We bring out the best in each other: she's taught me a lot about professionalism and I hope I've taught her to enjoy it a bit more. We relate to our audience. We're the sort of people that would watch T4 anyway. There's a good chemistry between us, and I think we do a good job.

'Sorry, only room for two,' he smoothes, before revving his free 'n' easy way off into the sunset. In Thelma and Louise , Louise's car is a whip-that-demi-wave cabriolet, its lack of roof showing a new-found freedom, an escape from domineering men, two women's ride into a new, wild, unattached life. In Get Carter , the blonde driving the soft-top Sunbeam indicates her sexually single status simply by being at the wheel of such a machine. Unfortunately, she dies in it, too - as, of course, do Thelma and Louise in their car. But that says more about celluloid attitudes towards wayward women than it does about the joy of driving with the breeze in your barnet. </p> <p>I've owned five cars in my time, and four of them have had a tent as a top. As soon as I owned my first (a 70s Peugeot 304), I knew I'd never again consider a solid ceiling job - despite the rust, the mould, the ridicule inherent in a cabriolet, despite the (often physical) pain of actually putting the roof up and down.

Even if it does turn your hair into wire wool. </p> <p>Luckily for me (and you), over the last 10 years car manufacturers have cottoned on to the cabrio way of thinking. They've offered us climate-mockers more roofless beauties than ever before. So we've been treated to the Mazda MX5, the new MG, the Mercedes SLK, the BMW Z3, and now Ford's Street Ka. All sans roof, and all (except for the SLK) eminently affordable. The Street Ka is likely to retail for as little as \u00a311,000. </p> <p>The joys of convertible motoring? The sun, the wind, the view - not just of scenic A-road mountains, but also the unrestricted vista around tricky corners during the school run. You get a sense of speed that just can't be realised in a hard top. You get a sense of real driving, too, rare in these hermetically sealed days of air-con and CD changers and whispering engines. The disadvantages? It makes you go deaf. And blind, if your wire-wool hair keeps whipping into your eyes. It's also much more tiring than cruising along in a sealed tin can. That heightened sense of driving can make you scared: the road is close and concrete and whizzing past at an impossible gallop. And a soft top's look-at-me sex appeal can easily be mistaken for swinishness. Or smugness. Or just plain utter twattiness. </p> <p>Which brings me to the TT. I've driven a TT before, a hard top, and remember it as a solid, masculine drive, with room for two-and-a-half. I took it camping, and locked the keys inside, thus testing its security, which was frustratingly fine. The soft-top version is, naturally, less secure (just stick a knife in the roof and away you go), but just as macho, though the one that arrived outside my front door lacked the previous version's red overstitching on the black leather seats (ooh, sir). Actually, I think Audi's desire to make the TT a chap's car just makes it camper than Christmas: all those studded metal circles, the straighter- than-thou dashboard (no girly curves allowed), the firm but gentle feel of the knobs and buttons_ The soft-top TT is a hairdresser's car, a divorc\u00e9's car, an A-Gay car. Looks pretty good on a girl, though. </p> <p>And, shiver me Schumachers, it's fast. Not too frisky - still a solid drive - but when you get into sixth gear (yes, you did read that right), you find yourself cruising on a cushion of air at over 100mph. I took it for a spin on the M40. 'How fast do you think we're going?' I asked my companion. </p> <p>'About 75?' he hazarded. </p> <p>The dial said 60mph more. Ha! Still, this was a singles test, rather than a check-your-internal-speedometer test, so I asked the companion if the TT ride made him, well, more interested than usual. He said: 'Can I switch on the seat-heater?' A few minutes later, he said: 'Mmm, yeah, maybe.' </p> <p>Such a reaction is to be expected when you're used to each other. So I thought I'd ask a genuine singleton what the TT can do. My flatmate, a desirable yet currently available man, took on the challenge and revved it to work, top down. The reaction to him was varied, and illuminating. The drivers of two different white vans called him a wanker; he got eyed up by posh girls in Kensington; and then, when he arrived at work, he was allowed by the security man to park right outside the office in a space usually banned to his 3 series. </p> <p>During lunch, my flatmate took the opportunity of taking a young lady for a spin. Her response? Within five minutes, she'd asked him to marry her. She was insistent that it had to be in Gretna Green (a fairly long drive from Earl's Court).

      "body": "<p>JP, as he is known to his friends, lives in a spacious one-bedroom flat in leafy, Belsize Park in north London. He loves to entertain, and had his kitchen designed so that it could be a place for both good cooking and socialising. After 12 years, his home is just as he likes it - comfortable, luxurious, dark and cosy. After a hard day at work, he will come home, put on an opera CD, relax and spend some time cooking. It's therapeutic. His favourite dish at the moment is a slow-roasted fillet of beef. </p> <p>Over in central London - so central it's just a stone's throw from Piccadilly Circus - Paul Poole lives in a studio flat so tiny that you could just about swing a mouse. A very small mouse. Open the oven in his galley kitchen and you find that the shelves are still wrapped in plastic. He never cooks. He hates to entertain at home. And he can't remember the last time he ate even a takeaway at home. In the past year that he's been renting the flat, he has spent all of eight weeks in the UK. And during those eight weeks, the longest he has spent at home, apart from when he's sleeping, is about an hour and a half - just long enough to watch the EastEnders omnibus. After a hard day at work, he goes out. He eats out. Drinks out. Watches movies out. </p> <p>Both JP, 36, and Paul Poole, 30 ('going on 16'), have one thing in common: their homes are bachelor pads. You can almost smell the testosterone (or you would at the Poole pad if he was there long enough). </p> <p>'I'd much rather have a bird on board,' confesses JP, as he shows me round the flat that he has been slowly but surely decorating and tweaking over the years to get just right. 'Any single person who says they're living a full life is talking rubbish.' </p> <p>JP works in property finance. And his taste is very, well, masculine. There is a strong use of quality materials - copper, leather, wood - from the kitchen through to the bedroom. The living room has the feeling of a gentlemen's club, with its leather sofa (a bargain from the Conran Shop) and two leather armchairs from the 40s (his father's). The Venetian blinds are wooden (a present from a lodger) and the elaborate radiator cover was built by a friend. It matches the David Wainwright coffee table in the centre of the room. There's a colonial feel about the place. It's a real smoking room - all that's missing is JP's velvet smoking jacket and a humidor. </p> <p>For JP, however, the kitchen is the focal point of the flat: 'The kitchen was always the centre of our family - we lived around the Aga.' Between them, the cooker and the oversized fridge are worth a small fortune - more than the Jaguar XJS that he managed to write off the previous week. So, too, are the B&amp;B Italia leather chairs, complete with sprung backs for extra comfort. 'I wanted the kitchen to be an area for entertaining,' he says. The units are all covered in copper, and the worktops are green marble. 'What it really needs is some nice pictures,' he says. 'I was going to buy some flowers for this shoot, but I thought you'd see right through me.' And he's right. It's just not a flowery kind of flat. </p> <p>The 'feminine touch' has no place here. Even the early-70s bathroom sink is macho. It's huge and shiny in dark blue. He found it shortly after he moved into the flat. 'I suspect that's the biggest sink ever made,' he boasts. It would be interesting to see what Freud, whose picture hangs in the living room between photographs of JP's mother and father, would have made of it. </p> <p>It is impossible to resist having a nose in JP's bedroom. It is all low light, heavy velvet curtains and soft, textured walls. There are candles on the lazy man's bedside table (it swivels), which add to the glow of the copper headboard. Along one side is his clothes rail, packed with crisply pressed shirts (he has a cleaner who does the ironing) from his friend and favourite tailor, Timothy Everest, and the odd Gucci leather jacket. He rides a scooter, a Gilera 180, around town, and buys his biker leathers from Nick Ashley in Westbourne Grove. On the purpose-built shoe rack is a pair of black leather, \u00a3450 Berluti shoes ('a present to myself'), which have rarely been worn because they are half a size too small. </p> <p>For Paul Poole, however, wardrobe space and shoe racks are not a problem. He can fit the entire contents of his Muji stacking boxes - containing a couple of pairs of vintage Levi's, some 60s denim jackets and a few pieces of Smedley knitwear - into a suitcase, which is just as well, as he has itchy feet and likes to travel. As a marketing and communications director, he is lucky that his job involves travel. 'I don't give a damn about any of my possessions,' he says over a coffee in a nearby cafe, because we can't both fit in the flat with the photographer, the assistant and their equipment at the same time. 'The things we own end up owning us. I really don't like things. I'm very throwaway.' </p> <p>He even chucks out the box when he buys a new CD and transfers the disc into his streamlined plastic storage albums - 'There's not enough room for boxes.' It's quite appropriate that Poole likes Muji storage systems, because the way he lives - in such a confined space in the centre of town - is very Japanese. Instead of tatami mats, he has a big fluffy bed, but the rest - the orange Schwinn bike he has never ridden, the PlayStation and state-of-the-art DVD player - are all typical Tokyo living. </p> <p>'I'd rather be really central, in the thick of things,' he says. 'If I wanted a larger place, I would probably live outside London. I've never enjoyed entertaining at home - it's much better to go out. If I had a wife or partner, it would be different.' As it is, the flat is simply a place to sleep (maximum five hours a night) and to make the odd bloody Mary before going to work. Poole's fridge is bare except for some glasses, a couple of bottles of vodka and some tomato juice. He rented the place without even seeing it, knowing that he was about to travel in Thailand and Cambodia for four months. 'I couldn't go away without knowing I had somewhere to come back to - an anchor.' Poole claims that what he saves in taxi fares pays for the rent. </p> <p>'If I was messy it would be different,' he says. But he says he likes folding and is meticulously organised. And while he still has the energy to work hard and play even harder every night, it's the perfect - pint-sized - bachelor pad.</p>",

After a hard day at work, he goes out. He eats out. Drinks out. Watches movies out. Both JP, 36, and Paul Poole, 30 ('going on 16'), have one thing in common: their homes are bachelor pads. You can almost smell the testosterone (or you would at the Poole pad if he was there long enough). 'I'd much rather have a bird on board,' confesses JP, as he shows me round the flat that he has been slowly but surely decorating and tweaking over the years to get just right. 'Any single person who says they're living a full life is talking rubbish.' JP works in property finance. And his taste is very, well, masculine. There is a strong use of quality materials - copper, leather, wood - from the kitchen through to the bedroom. The living room has the feeling of a gentlemen's club, with its leather sofa (a bargain from the Conran Shop) and two leather armchairs from the 40s (his father's). The Venetian blinds are wooden (a present from a lodger) and the elaborate radiator cover was built by a friend. It matches the David Wainwright coffee table in the centre of the room. There's a colonial feel about the place. It's a real smoking room - all that's missing is JP's velvet smoking jacket and a humidor. For JP, however, the kitchen is the focal point of the flat: 'The kitchen was always the centre of our family - we lived around the Aga.' Between them, the cooker and the oversized fridge are worth a small fortune - more than the Jaguar XJS that he managed to write off the previous week. So, too, are the B&amp;B Italia leather chairs, complete with sprung backs for extra comfort. 'I wanted the kitchen to be an area for entertaining,' he says. The units are all covered in copper, and the worktops are green marble. 'What it really needs is some nice pictures,' he says. 'I was going to buy some flowers for this shoot, but I thought you'd see right through me.' And he's right. It's just not a flowery kind of flat. The 'feminine touch' has no place here. Even the early-70s bathroom sink is macho. It's huge and shiny in dark blue. He found it shortly after he moved into the flat. 'I suspect that's the biggest sink ever made,' he boasts. It would be interesting to see what Freud, whose picture hangs in the living room between photographs of JP's mother and father, would have made of it. It is impossible to resist having a nose in JP's bedroom. It is all low light, heavy velvet curtains and soft, textured walls. There are candles on the lazy man's bedside table (it swivels), which add to the glow of the copper headboard. Along one side is his clothes rail, packed with crisply pressed shirts (he has a cleaner who does the ironing) from his friend and favourite tailor, Timothy Everest, and the odd Gucci leather jacket. He rides a scooter, a Gilera 180, around town, and buys his biker leathers from Nick Ashley in Westbourne Grove. On the purpose-built shoe rack is a pair of black leather, \u00a3450 Berluti shoes ('a present to myself'), which have rarely been worn because they are half a size too small. For Paul Poole, however, wardrobe space and shoe racks are not a problem. He can fit the entire contents of his Muji stacking boxes - containing a couple of pairs of vintage Levi's, some 60s denim jackets and a few pieces of Smedley knitwear - into a suitcase, which is just as well, as he has itchy feet and likes to travel. As a marketing and communications director, he is lucky that his job involves travel. 'I don't give a damn about any of my possessions,' he says over a coffee in a nearby cafe, because we can't both fit in the flat with the photographer, the assistant and their equipment at the same time. 'The things we own end up owning us. I really don't like things. I'm very throwaway.' He even chucks out the box when he buys a new CD and transfers the disc into his streamlined plastic storage albums - 'There's not enough room for boxes.' It's quite appropriate that Poole likes Muji storage systems, because the way he lives - in such a confined space in the centre of town - is very Japanese. Instead of tatami mats, he has a big fluffy bed, but the rest - the orange Schwinn bike he has never ridden, the PlayStation and state-of-the-art DVD player - are all typical Tokyo living. 'I'd rather be really central, in the thick of things,' he says. 'If I wanted a larger place, I would probably live outside London. I've never enjoyed entertaining at home - it's much better to go out. If I had a wife or partner, it would be different.' As it is, the flat is simply a place to sleep (maximum five hours a night) and to make the odd bloody Mary before going to work. Poole's fridge is bare except for some glasses, a couple of bottles of vodka and some tomato juice. He rented the place without even seeing it, knowing that he was about to travel in Thailand and Cambodia for four months. 'I couldn't go away without knowing I had somewhere to come back to - an anchor.' Poole claims that what he saves in taxi fares pays for the rent. 'If I was messy it would be different,' he says. But he says he likes folding and is meticulously organised. And while he still has the energy to work hard and play even harder every night, it's the perfect - pint-sized - bachelor pad.",

      "body": "<p>There is fairly strong evidence that living in a committed partnership is good for both your mental and physical health. Married people, men in particular, live longer and enjoy better health than their divorced, widowed or never-married peers. Married women rate their physical and emotional health higher than single, divorced or widowed women, especially when they get older, says Linda Waite, a sociology professor at the University of Chicago and co-author of The Case for Marriage (\u00a317, Doubleday).</p> <p>But don't let your mother dash out to buy a hat just yet. Marriage by itself is no magic shield against the world's ills. It's living in a loving and supportive environment that counts, especially, it seems, if you are a woman. An unhappy union can do more than get you down; it can even depress your immune system and make you prone to stress and illness. By cultivating healthy habits and making sure that they have good social support, single people can get many of the health benefits enjoyed by couples without having to say, 'I do.'</p> <p>As for married couples, one of the reasons they are sometimes healthier has to do with economics. Married couples often have a joint income, and so are wealthier than singles. If you have a higher income, live in a nice neighbourhood, own your own home and have access to private health care, you're bound to be better off. Sociologists also think that healthy people are more likely to marry in the first place, as they are more attractive to prospective partners, which skews the figures for single people's health.</p> <p>Couples also look out for each other. Living with someone who nags you to go to the doctor, eat well and exercise might get up your nose, but will be doing you a favour in the long run. In the good old days, men benefited most, as their wives encouraged them to calm down, and end their wild, youthful habits of boozing, smoking and unsafe sex. But as women have come to equal men, so they have picked up on some of their bad habits. 'Single women are now entering into the risky behaviours of single men,' says Penny Mansfield, director of One Plus One Marriage and Partnership Research. Isn't it time we all settled down?</p> <p>Emotional back-up is key to both mental and physical wellbeing. 'We're beginning to realise just how much mental health is connected to physical health,' says Mansfield. Patients recover faster from heart disease and cancer if they have a supportive partner. New mothers are less likely to suffer long-term post-natal depression if they have a happy relationship with their other halves. Given that happy people equals better health equals economic prosperity for society, there's a strong case for introducing some form of marriage for gay and lesbian couples on these grounds alone. What used to be a moral argument for promoting stable relationships has now become a health issue.</p> <p>But do you really have to be married to your lover to be healthy? Waite argues that you do. 'Living with a partner gives you some of the benefits of marriage, but not all of them,' she says. Cohabiting couples are generally less likely to share financial resources, and in many cases are unable to share perks like health insurance. The main difference, says Waite, is down to the dreaded C word - commitment. Still, there are plenty of cohabitees who have lived in unwedded bliss for years who could teach us all a thing or two about that. 'These are all averages, and you can't always make your personal life decisions based on statistics,' argues Dorian Solot, executive director of the Alternatives to Marriage Project, a Boston-based organisation for unmarried people. 'If we as a society really cared about people's health, then the answer is not to urge everyone to get married but to try to support people, whatever their needs are.'</p> <p>Although statistical studies are based on keeping up with the averages, they do reveal intriguing insights into human nature and why marriage seems to have such a positive effect. One of the key findings is that we all need a close confidante - someone who can help share our burden of worldly troubles. This seems to be especially true of men. Mr Average's stiff-upper-lip machismo is his Achilles' heel when it comes to his mental health. Young men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women, because they find it hard to seek help if they have personal problems. A government survey on mental health attributed about a quarter of the rise in suicides among young men to the fact that they weren't getting married, says Mansfield. Women not only offer a shoulder to cry on, but also seem to calm men down and give them a sense of purpose, she adds. But what's in it for the girls?</p> <p>This is where it gets complicated. Although married women enjoy better health than their unmarried peers, the benefit is smaller than it is for men. Just being married has a powerful effect on men, but for women the quality of the relationship really matters. One study has shown that women who felt they couldn't confide in their husbands were more prone to depression. But people in poor relationships lose more than their peace of mind. Recent research suggests that couples can actually affect each other's physiology, for better and for worse. Scientists at Ohio State University prodded couples into picking fights in their labs. They found that husbands and wives who rowed with their gloves off, using sarcasm, put-downs and general nastiness showed signs of weakened immune systems, with the women being more affected than their husbands. 'Women are more sensitive to emotion in marriage,' suggests Tamara Newton, a psychologist at the University of Louisville who worked on the study. Even just recalling the memory of a row can make a wife's blood pressure rise.</p> <p>But although being happily single is better than being unhappily attached, it might not always seem that way. You're surrounded by smug marrieds, the world is blind to your charms, and even your lucky knickers have temporarily lost their love magnetism. What to do? Don't panic. A wedding ring holds no mystical magic. It's the social and emotional support that counts, and wily singles can get this in spades, if they know where to look. Finding people to trust to share your confidences is key. A sympathetic ear helps you make sense of life and cope with the world. Women tend to be good at supporting each other. For men, forming close friendships with women, especially family members who can give them advice, is particularly important.</p> <p>On a practical level, friends and neighbours can also help, if you share out burdens, like taking turns with the shopping, or ferrying the kids to school. In a world where more and more of us have moved away from our families to study and work, creating 'families of choice' from our closest friends is key to staying healthy and happy. But that isn't to say that your own family is out of touch. Picking up the phone is an important way for family members to look out for each other. It's the little things, like someone asking after you, that count.</p> <p>But if you really want to get ahead, get a cat. Karen Allen, a psychology professor at the State University of New York has discovered that pets are better at helping people cope with everyday stress than their spouses or friends are. Elderly women with pets get the same benefits in terms of stable blood pressure as those who have lots of friends. Again, the key is having someone, or something, to talk to. 'Pets are always non-judgmental,' says Allen. No matter what the problem, Fluffy will always love you. But canine confidantes can do more than reduce stress - they can also play cupid. Scientists at Warwick University have found that taking a walk with a dog can triple your chances of meeting people of both sexes. Still, if the thought of anything furry brings you out in a rash, try keeping a journal. Confiding your troubles to a diary really helps, says Waite.</p> <p>Researchers in the States have discovered that people who belong to lots of different social groups, such as sports clubs and church congregations, live longer and have healthier immune systems. 'People who are socially active in different ways are generally better off in terms of their health,' says Sheldon Cohen, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who led the research.</p> <p>Personal relationships might be complicated, but they are our most valuable assets. The health implications of relationship breakdown are so great that government health policy should take it into account, says Mansfield. This will become especially important as the current generation of singles ages. But as well as picking up the pieces when things go wrong, we need to improve the quality of existing partnerships, as well as supporting people who live alone. Splendid isolation might not be ideal, but you'll get by - with a little help from your friends.</p>",

But that isn't to say that your own family is out of touch. Picking up the phone is an important way for family members to look out for each other. It's the little things, like someone asking after you, that count. But if you really want to get ahead, get a cat. Karen Allen, a psychology professor at the State University of New York has discovered that pets are better at helping people cope with everyday stress than their spouses or friends are. Elderly women with pets get the same benefits in terms of stable blood pressure as those who have lots of friends. Again, the key is having someone, or something, to talk to. 'Pets are always non-judgmental,' says Allen. No matter what the problem, Fluffy will always love you. But canine confidantes can do more than reduce stress - they can also play cupid. Scientists at Warwick University have found that taking a walk with a dog can triple your chances of meeting people of both sexes. Still, if the thought of anything furry brings you out in a rash, try keeping a journal. Confiding your troubles to a diary really helps, says Waite. Researchers in the States have discovered that people who belong to lots of different social groups, such as sports clubs and church congregations, live longer and have healthier immune systems. 'People who are socially active in different ways are generally better off in terms of their health,' says Sheldon Cohen, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who led the research. Personal relationships might be complicated, but they are our most valuable assets. The health implications of relationship breakdown are so great that government health policy should take it into account, says Mansfield. This will become especially important as the current generation of singles ages. But as well as picking up the pieces when things go wrong, we need to improve the quality of existing partnerships, as well as supporting people who live alone. Splendid isolation might not be ideal, but you'll get by - with a little help from your friends.",

An hour or so before I meet my friends Beverley, Rosalind, Lauren and Berenice in the Zinc Bar and Grill in London's West End for the first leg of our girls' night out, and I'm still padding about with a towel on my head, wondering what to wear. Then something strange happens - Lauren bails out and the others make concerted efforts to do likewise. Anyone would think they didn't want to go for a tacky, expensive night out on a freezing November Saturday in central London. </p> <p> <strong> 9pm </strong> Sitting in the Zinc Bar. So far, the 'vibes' could be better. The table is dingy, the food so-so, and the drinks are taking so long to arrive a gal could dehydrate between courses. All around us, the clientele are doing that not-looking-at- each-other-but-really-looking-at-each- other thing you thought went out with the school disco. It would be sweet if they weren't all shrieking into mobile phones which match their outfits. The good news is that our next stop, Momo, the exclusive members-only bar, is mere yards away. As we leave, a waitress treads on Berenice's foot, and fails to apologise. </p> <p> <strong> 9.50pm </strong> Standing outside Momo. 'We are on the list,' I keep intoning in the style of a mantra. 'It is all arranged.' The man on the door gives me a superior look, as if to say: 'Things can always be disarranged.' Finally, we are ushered through the door and into a small sumptuously furnished room - a kind of bonsai Sultan's Palace. The place is so tiny and packed, people at the bar are sitting on the heads of the people at the tables. 'You can only have a table for one hour,' snaps the man from the door. Fine, I think, then Momo can only have us for one hour. </p> <p> <strong> 10.10pm </strong> We've had a couple of rounds of drinks which cost more than \u00a360. Maybe Momo can only have us for half an hour. </p> <p> <strong> 10.20pm </strong> The not-looking-at-each-other-but- really-looking-at-each-other carry-on is really popular here, too. Things are hotting up, thanks to the vodka martinis, whisky macs and, of course, our natural joie de vivre. Beverley and I have joint-'scored' with a sweet gay man, who exclaims over her Prada shoes and my Jane Doe top. On the way back from the loo, Rosalind has a minor flirtation with a young blade. 'He was one of those internet guys - he asked where I worked before he asked my name,' she reports back. We all shiver - what kind of people were out there these days? It suddenly occurs to me that I have never met a Significant Other on a night out like this. It's time to leave, before we suffer the indignity of being kicked out of our seats. Next stop, trendy dance club Chinawhite, where, hopefully, we won't be treated like we have some rare form of social rabies. </p> <p> <strong> 10.50pm </strong> 'We are on the list. It's all arranged.' The Chinawhite doorman is sweet, but it turns out that the long snaking queue we're so keen to avoid is the line for the guest list. We stand shivering in the street for what seems like the longest time. </p> <p> <strong> 11.05pm </strong> A drunk tries to harass me into sharing his spliff. 'Go on,' he slurs, hiccuping. 'Gurrr unnn.' I appear to have found my level. </p> <p> <strong> 11.20pm </strong> Still standing in the street being hassled by the spliff-wielding drunk. I would quite like to die now please. Is this why unhappy couples stay together, to avoid the living hell of socialising? Suddenly, there's a shout from Rosalind. She's sick of waiting around. We're going to this great club she knows at the Great Eastern Hotel in Liverpool Street. Only problem is, we're being driven there by a complete stranger, whose car she just flagged down in the street, and who could turn out to be a serial killer. Sounds good to me. </p> <p> <strong> 12.45am </strong> Coming to the Great Eastern was the best idea I never had. At least we're able to drink and have a dance. 'You all right?' sweaty, smiling men keep enquiring. 'No,' I'm tempted to say. 'I'm dying, but I thought I'd pop in here for a drink on the way to the hospital.' Still, everyone is friendly, and nobody talks 'careers'. In the bar we join some guys from Bow for a few rounds of slammers. It's a mistake - I'm not used to tequila. When I stand up, the room swims and I can feel cold sweat prickling my forehead. Beverley is saying something to me, but I can't hear her. It occurs to me, with a pang, that, what with one thing or another, I haven't really heard much from my friends all evening. 'You all right?' mouths one of the Bow guys, only this time it's a genuine medical enquiry. I weave my way out of the club and stand in the hall to clear my head. Which is when I have my brainwave. </p> <p> <strong> 1.50am </strong> I've got us a suite for the night at the Great Eastern Hotel. No snotty doormen, no shivering on pavements, no drunks with spliffs, no Bad Stuff, period. Here, at last, we can talk properly, catch up with each other, sit in comfort on the sofas, and sprawl exhausted on the luxurious bed, when the night starts turning into morning. </p> <p> <strong> 3.40am </strong> Our big night out turns into an even better night in. In our huge beautiful suite, we get to play like children. Room service treats us like queens, bringing us all the champagne, wine and cigarettes we can handle, as well as a selection of CDs. We play the Stones and take photographs of each other in the bath, hoping we'll look like hardcore rock chicks but ending up looking like, well, drunk women sitting in a bath. Later, we dance around to reggae and hiphop, barking our shins bloody against the glass coffee table. Other times, we just lie around, drinking and talking. This is sublime. We have everything we need here, except perhaps male company, and right now that seems a small trade-off for a bathroom with no queue. </p> <p> <strong> 5.30am </strong> Beverley and Berenice fade away, back to the real world. Only Rosalind and I remain, snuggled up under the duvet, drinking wine, smoking cigarettes, and discussing past loves, future hopes, life, the universe and everything. 'It was a good night in the end, wasn't it?' says Rosalind, sleepily, her glass sliding out of her hand, and tipping wine on to the sheet. 'Yeah,' I reply. 'It was.'

      "body": "<p>Being single is more a state of mind than a state of matrimony. Every one of us has the potential to be single in our head while being in a relationship and, conversely, there are many singles craving a rela tionship and living every area of their life in a way that reflects that. The truly happy are those who do single successfully - or who understand what being a couple is all about. So which are you? Take our test to find out:</p> <p><b>How do you view your parents' marriage?</b><br> A You can see the flaws <br> B Very happy - they never row <br> C They divorced, or should have done <br> D Tricky at times, fantastic at others - they worked through things well</p> <p><b>Which of these possessions would mean the most to you?</b><br> A Skis, walking boots, passport - the reminders of pursuits that make you happy <br> B Your pets - guaranteed to cheer you up when you're down <br> C Your car - in it you can just get away from anyone and everyone <br> D Old photos, tickets from dates - sentimental stuff</p> <p><b>Describe your circle of friends?</b><br> A Varied - you have different friends for different interests <br> B Huge - you happily share your life with plenty of old friends, including the nice man from the corner shop <br> C Variable - it's mainly work colleagues and a few old friends <br> D Small - often old friends you know you could rely on in a crisis</p> <p><b>You're single. You've got to go for some health tests and you're worried about the outcome.

You're due home soon, but the next round comes up. What do you do?</b><br> A You go home - the relationship is important to you <br> B You call your partner and invite them along - they could meet your workmates <br> C You go home late with a bunch of flowers <br> D Call home and say you'll be late</p> <p><b>You have a row with a colleague at work.

That doesn't mean you're not in a relationship right now, but if that relationship went wrong tomorrow, you'd survive. However, chances are you're not paired up.</p> <p>According to Dr Michael Broder, author of The Art of Living Single (\u00a35.99, Avon), one thing that successful singles have learned (normally from past bad relationships, or from analysing what went wrong with their parents') is that it's OK to be alone, but not OK to be unhappy. 'This doesn't mean you won't let yourself fall in love again,' says Broder. 'There are very few people in this life who are born to be single. But what it does mean is that you won't accept second best. You have a firm, clear idea of what a relationship should involve for you - and unless you find that, you'd rather be alone.'</p> <p>This need for relationships to deliver also determines how you function in other areas of your life. If you have a problem, you deal with it and move on, which makes you forthright and focused.</p> <p>In terms of friends, you have different people to supply support or help you with your many interests - because you do have many interests. Successful singles realise that life is for living, and that this is one time you have the freedom to do what you like. However, this is where you can fall down. You have to draw a line between self-fulfilled and selfish, and not become too insular. 'We need people around us for support,' says Broder. 'Don't start to overshadow the needs of others with your own agenda - see them as a balance. And re-evaluate your life and goals regularly. Your ability to focus and not settle for second best means you can get set in your ways. However, things change as we age or our circumstances alter. You need to reflect and adapt to this or you could find yourself living a lonely old age.'</p> <p><b>Mostly B's</b></p> <p>You're relationship needy. If you're single, you're looking - if you're not, chances are you're in a relationship that's not really fulfilling you but you'll stick with it until something better turns up. 'Some people need a high level of intimacy and partnership in their lives and you're one of them,' says Dr Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, co-director of The Marriage Project at Rutgers University, New York. This shows primarily through other people's amazement at the size of your social circle - you seem to make friends with everyone. They probably also envy your relationship with your parents, which is likely to be close and consultative even in adulthood.</p> <p>'This need for consultation is key to needers,' says Whitehead. 'The more people can help you with problems the more you like it, as you find it hard to make decisions and move forward.' One reason for this is that you can be tempted to live your life for a day in the future. Despite your friends and seemingly active social life, you're often not fulfilled because you think everything you're doing would be better if you had partner on your arm. Also, you may not reach your full potential in your career or home life because you feel in a state of transition. 'I've interviewed many single females who won't buy a house because they want to wait to do things like that until they find their soulmate to buy with,' says Whitehead. 'If you are single, but dearly want to be in a relationship, it's not a human failing - it's natural. But it's dangerous if it stops you living the life you do have now.'</p> <p>It's also dangerous if the quest for a partner brings you into negative relationships - which it often can, as you tend to edit out the bad in prospective partners, and look only at the good elements. To change things, take a leaf out of the book of the successful single. Look at what you realistically want from life and make sure you're getting that. Once you are, only accept a partner who'll enrich it further - if you feel you still need them, that is!</p> <p><b>Mostly C's</b></p> <p>You're a lone partner. You're likely to be in a relationship physically, but mentally it's a different story. In your head, you're independent, individual and free to make a break at any time. 'And while this sounds good to you, it means you're always keeping part of yourself away from your partner and stopping you both from being truly happy,' says Dr Frank Pittman, author of Grow Up! How Taking Responsibility Can Make You A Happy Adult (\u00a316, Golden). According to Pittman, most lone partners develop a distrust for the opposite sex due to problems in their parents' marriage - either through parents divorcing badly or living in conflict.</p> <p>'This teaches you that commitment is about losing control of some part of your life,' says Pittman. 'And as a result, lone partners make it their aim to retain control by asserting power. Little things, like not calling to say you're going to be late, and then making it up to them with flowers or something.' This bouquet defence also prevents conflict, which you avoid at all costs. The reason again is loss of control; rather than seeing compromise as a necessary part of relationships, you see it as win/lose situation, and to prevent you losing you avoid rows completely.</p> <p>Chances are you're reading this now and saying: 'It's my right as an individual to go out late.' True but, as Pittman points out, a successful relationship doesn't mean losing individuality - you should still do what you want - but it does mean fitting that around your partner, too. 'It's like looking through binoculars,' he explains. 'One eye sees your action, one sees your partner's reaction to that. The whole picture is looking at the happy compromise for both of you - that's when you really develop control, when the fear goes away. Otherwise you'll only benefit from your attitude if your partner dies or runs off and leaves you, as it won't hurt so much. But should you really wait till your partner dies to be happy? You need to look at where you learned your distrust and tackle it.'</p> <p><b>Mostly D's</b></p> <p>You're couple comfortable. You're probably in a relationship now, and that relationship is happy and stable. If you're single, chances are most of your other relationships have been firey and short-lived - or long term and stable - all of which is down to your maturity at handling what a relationship really means.</p> <p>'You understand that a good relationship is as much to do with the way you act within it, as it is finding your perfect partner,' says Frank Pittman. 'You've realised that successful partnerships are like a debate. There's no problem if there are silences, or shouting, so long as both people get to express their point of view, and that you compromise.'</p> <p>Again, parents who had a down-to-earth attitude to their relationship are often the key to finding this harmony with others, but often this affinity comes with history. Research shows that couples who fit together best are those who develop a history and remember it, who recall other bad times to get them through tough patches - and have good memories to sustain them as they do this (which is why those old photos mean so much to you).</p> <p>You realise that when you're in a relationship your partner is the most important person in your life. 'This is why people who do well in relationships tend to have few close friends,' says Pittman. 'They feel that the person they should be sharing things with is their partner.' Of course this doesn't mean you lose your individuality - couples where the partners never go out alone tend to be run on insecurity rather than true love (though romantic needers think otherwise).</p> <p>Being couple comfortable is a good mental state. If you're single, knowing who you are and what you want means you won't be afraid to live life. In a relationship, it means you can focus on making things work. The two combined make you a good person to be.</p> <p><b> Two become one: the celebrity singletons</b></p> <p><b> Caroline Aherne </b><br> 'I actually enjoy being single for a change, and I'm happy on my own. Men aren't the answer to problems. I'm just glad I've found happiness in myself. Anyway, if a man had taken me on last year, he would have been in for a rough ride.'</p> <p><b> Liz Hurley </b><br> 'When you're going out with a boy, they always insist on eating dinner, but if you're by yourself, you can go back to your room and just eat pretzels and drink wine.

Mostly A's You're a successful single. That doesn't mean you're not in a relationship right now, but if that relationship went wrong tomorrow, you'd survive. However, chances are you're not paired up. According to Dr Michael Broder, author of The Art of Living Single (\u00a35.99, Avon), one thing that successful singles have learned (normally from past bad relationships, or from analysing what went wrong with their parents') is that it's OK to be alone, but not OK to be unhappy. 'This doesn't mean you won't let yourself fall in love again,' says Broder. 'There are very few people in this life who are born to be single. But what it does mean is that you won't accept second best. You have a firm, clear idea of what a relationship should involve for you - and unless you find that, you'd rather be alone.' This need for relationships to deliver also determines how you function in other areas of your life. If you have a problem, you deal with it and move on, which makes you forthright and focused. In terms of friends, you have different people to supply support or help you with your many interests - because you do have many interests. Successful singles realise that life is for living, and that this is one time you have the freedom to do what you like. However, this is where you can fall down. You have to draw a line between self-fulfilled and selfish, and not become too insular. 'We need people around us for support,' says Broder. 'Don't start to overshadow the needs of others with your own agenda - see them as a balance. And re-evaluate your life and goals regularly. Your ability to focus and not settle for second best means you can get set in your ways. However, things change as we age or our circumstances alter. You need to reflect and adapt to this or you could find yourself living a lonely old age.' Mostly B's You're relationship needy. If you're single, you're looking - if you're not, chances are you're in a relationship that's not really fulfilling you but you'll stick with it until something better turns up. 'Some people need a high level of intimacy and partnership in their lives and you're one of them,' says Dr Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, co-director of The Marriage Project at Rutgers University, New York. This shows primarily through other people's amazement at the size of your social circle - you seem to make friends with everyone. They probably also envy your relationship with your parents, which is likely to be close and consultative even in adulthood. 'This need for consultation is key to needers,' says Whitehead. 'The more people can help you with problems the more you like it, as you find it hard to make decisions and move forward.' One reason for this is that you can be tempted to live your life for a day in the future. Despite your friends and seemingly active social life, you're often not fulfilled because you think everything you're doing would be better if you had partner on your arm. Also, you may not reach your full potential in your career or home life because you feel in a state of transition. 'I've interviewed many single females who won't buy a house because they want to wait to do things like that until they find their soulmate to buy with,' says Whitehead. 'If you are single, but dearly want to be in a relationship, it's not a human failing - it's natural. But it's dangerous if it stops you living the life you do have now.' It's also dangerous if the quest for a partner brings you into negative relationships - which it often can, as you tend to edit out the bad in prospective partners, and look only at the good elements. To change things, take a leaf out of the book of the successful single. Look at what you realistically want from life and make sure you're getting that. Once you are, only accept a partner who'll enrich it further - if you feel you still need them, that is! Mostly C's You're a lone partner. You're likely to be in a relationship physically, but mentally it's a different story. In your head, you're independent, individual and free to make a break at any time. 'And while this sounds good to you, it means you're always keeping part of yourself away from your partner and stopping you both from being truly happy,' says Dr Frank Pittman, author of Grow Up! How Taking Responsibility Can Make You A Happy Adult (\u00a316, Golden). According to Pittman, most lone partners develop a distrust for the opposite sex due to problems in their parents' marriage - either through parents divorcing badly or living in conflict. 'This teaches you that commitment is about losing control of some part of your life,' says Pittman. 'And as a result, lone partners make it their aim to retain control by asserting power. Little things, like not calling to say you're going to be late, and then making it up to them with flowers or something.' This bouquet defence also prevents conflict, which you avoid at all costs. The reason again is loss of control; rather than seeing compromise as a necessary part of relationships, you see it as win/lose situation, and to prevent you losing you avoid rows completely. Chances are you're reading this now and saying: 'It's my right as an individual to go out late.' True but, as Pittman points out, a successful relationship doesn't mean losing individuality - you should still do what you want - but it does mean fitting that around your partner, too. 'It's like looking through binoculars,' he explains. 'One eye sees your action, one sees your partner's reaction to that. The whole picture is looking at the happy compromise for both of you - that's when you really develop control, when the fear goes away. Otherwise you'll only benefit from your attitude if your partner dies or runs off and leaves you, as it won't hurt so much. But should you really wait till your partner dies to be happy? You need to look at where you learned your distrust and tackle it.' Mostly D's You're couple comfortable. You're probably in a relationship now, and that relationship is happy and stable. If you're single, chances are most of your other relationships have been firey and short-lived - or long term and stable - all of which is down to your maturity at handling what a relationship really means. 'You understand that a good relationship is as much to do with the way you act within it, as it is finding your perfect partner,' says Frank Pittman. 'You've realised that successful partnerships are like a debate. There's no problem if there are silences, or shouting, so long as both people get to express their point of view, and that you compromise.' Again, parents who had a down-to-earth attitude to their relationship are often the key to finding this harmony with others, but often this affinity comes with history. Research shows that couples who fit together best are those who develop a history and remember it, who recall other bad times to get them through tough patches - and have good memories to sustain them as they do this (which is why those old photos mean so much to you). You realise that when you're in a relationship your partner is the most important person in your life. 'This is why people who do well in relationships tend to have few close friends,' says Pittman. 'They feel that the person they should be sharing things with is their partner.' Of course this doesn't mean you lose your individuality - couples where the partners never go out alone tend to be run on insecurity rather than true love (though romantic needers think otherwise). Being couple comfortable is a good mental state. If you're single, knowing who you are and what you want means you won't be afraid to live life. In a relationship, it means you can focus on making things work. The two combined make you a good person to be. Two become one: the celebrity singletons Caroline Aherne 'I actually enjoy being single for a change, and I'm happy on my own. Men aren't the answer to problems. I'm just glad I've found happiness in myself. Anyway, if a man had taken me on last year, he would have been in for a rough ride.' Liz Hurley 'When you're going out with a boy, they always insist on eating dinner, but if you're by yourself, you can go back to your room and just eat pretzels and drink wine. And I can eat in bed. Hugh hated sleeping in crumbs - but if it was up to me I'd sleep in crumbs and an inch of dog hair.' Donna Air 'Did I mention that I'm single at the moment? I'm enjoying it, no distractions. Just work, work, work. And, occasionally, some sleep'. Germaine Greer 'The absurdity of the notion that there is someone \"out there\" for everybody is obvious to anyone who has thought about it for more than five seconds.' George Clooney On the breakdown of his relationship with Celine Balitran: 'Did I work too much? Probably. Did I treat my relationship with her too cavalierly? Yes. I suppose I blew it because I didn't want to deal with the issue of how all the time we were spending away from each other was hurting her. OK, I admit it, I blew it.' Matt Damon 'There are times I've been rejected that would spin your head around.' JK Rowling 'Seven years after becoming a lone parent, I feel qualified to look anyone in the eye and say that people bringing up children single-handedly deserve not condemnation but congratulations.' Geri Halliwell 'I made a pledge to myself that I wouldn't be romantically linked with anyone because sex stills my creativity. Too much sex tends to get in the way, and I wanted to put every drop into the album.' Patsy Kensit 'This is probably the first time in my life that I feel like I don't need anyone. I don't mind my own company. I'm not afraid to go to the cinema on my own. I'm certainly not interested in another relationship. There's just not room for that. There are only two men in my life: James and Lennon.' Jon Favreau 'The irony is I wrote Swingers because I felt like an outsider on the singles scene. So here I am, this guy who really doesn't know what I am doing, telling everybody else how to handle themselves.'",

      "body": "<p>'About a year ago, I was out with a girlfriend and some friends of hers. It was a fairly drunken affair, and there was a guy there who made it quite obvious that he fancied me. Anyway, we flirted and chatted and I found out that he liked the same music as me and read The Guardian - he wasn't an axe murderer, in other words - so when he suggested going on somewhere for another drink, I surprised myself by suggesting we go straight to his flat around the corner. When we got there, I started kissing him and initiated full-on sex, and it was good sex, urgent and passionate.' </p> <p>Afterwards, Kate, 31, surprised herself further. 'I found I just wanted to leave; I'd got what I wanted, but he got all cuddly and wanted to hold me, while I just wanted to get dressed and go. As I was leaving, he asked if he could see me again. I said, \"Yes\" and took his number, but I knew I'd never call him. On the way home, I was actually a bit taken aback by what I'd done, but also rather pleased with myself. For the first time ever, I'd picked someone up, done the whole role-reversal thing - and I enjoyed it. So if the mood takes me, I'll do it again.' </p> <p>That nice girls do is nothing new, but still some of us are rather slow to get our heads around the new woman who openly admits a pragmatic approach towards answering her sexual needs. When Kate told a close girlfriend about this episode, she was shocked to hear her experience disapprovingly likened to 'a lunch-time abortion'. A response, psychologist Penny Rennie-Peyton says, that echoes 'a mistake that has long been made that women only want \"approved-of\" sex, within a relationship or marriage'. It's precisely because attitudes like this still prevail that, even in the year 2000, it doesn't actually go without saying that somewhere between new wave virginity - \u00e0 la Britney Spears - and so-called stiletto feminism lies a genuine shift in real women's sexual behaviour. As increasing numbers of women delay, or even forgo, traditional concepts of commitment, they are articulating and answering their sexual needs in ways that are more usually associated with men. </p> <p>Emma, 29, is between partners at the moment, and quite prepared to approach men specifically with sex in mind. 'Never strangers, though; I always know them somehow, through a friend or whatever. I tend to just say, \"Do you want to come home with me\", and generally they do. I find myself less inhibited sexually in these casual encounters, because there's no pressure, and so some of the sex is great. It really is a myth that you have to be in love to have great sex, although love does make the morning after nicer. Sometimes I feel bad about it, though - one guy keeps ringing me but I don't want to see him, and I do feel a bit awful about that.' </p> <p>A lot of the impetus for women having sex on their own terms - whatever they may be - comes from the fact that, as Dr Terri Apter, a social psychologist at Cambridge University, puts it, 'Women have a wider area of feedback for identity satisfaction nowadays. They have a greater sense of being in control of their lives, both at home and in the workplace, so they don't feel that so much is invested in a man's approval, affection or bond.' She suggests, though, that we interpret this new mood with care. 'When women now say that no-strings sex makes them happy, there is no reason to disbelieve them. But I think the truth is that women do tire of this behaviour more quickly than men. So while it is true that women are now more able to separate physical and emotional needs - which is making them less exclusive and more mobile in their partnerships - that this separation is clear and unproblematic is usually not the case long term. We simply are not as good at separating our feelings as men are. Men are better at compartmentalising feelings, or perhaps they're better at denial.' </p> <p>Similarly, Dr Janet Reibstein, a psychologist at Exeter University, feels it would be an error to mistake these women for men. Yes, she says, more women are having relationships that are casual, 'ie they include sex but are not necessarily about marriage or staying together', and yes, they are playing the field and delaying commitment in a way that men have always done. But she believes that, essentially, women do feel differently about sex to men. 'I think women think, \"I can have friendship with sex because it's a different kind of love\", or \"It's all right to have sex without love, but I'm still looking for the right person\" - patterns of thinking that are really quite different from the way men think about sex and relationships.' Co-author of a study of women in affairs, she suggests there is a correlation. 'I discovered that there has been a rise in the number of women having affairs, which goes along with a general change in the way women view sex without love.' But crucially, she found that 'these women still felt responsible for others feelings; they thought about the consequences of their actions in a way the men we interviewed didn't.' </p> <p>Ultimately, she feels the fact that women are capable of having children will always be an issue. In other words, we are almost pre-programmed to eventually seek out a relationship with a man who will care for our child. 'And that makes women different. Although it's also true to say that our increasing ability to postpone the biological clock is certainly giving women a longer lead time.' </p> <p>But what about women for whom children aren't an issue? Who either never wanted them, or who have them already? Jane is 41 and has two children of eight and five. She lived with their father up until four years ago and, despite being basically single ever since, has a healthy and ongoing sex life. </p> <p>'I don't do relationships because of the children... I don't want anyone \"moving in on them\", so to speak. I also feel a certain amount of \"been there, done that\"... But I definitely want a sex life, I need one; I get uptight if I don't have sex, so I have sex casually. If the men I see do want more, they get told they can't have it, and they don't seem to mind, maybe because I choose them quite carefully. I tend to steer clear of intellectual men - too much baggage. The men I sleep with don't tend to have much to say, but that's fine. I certainly wouldn't want to take on the guy I'm seeing at the moment. I met him when he came to do odd jobs for me, and he really is just a bit of rough, just a shag, which is perfect... I call it shagging without ironing.' </p> <p>Terri Apter believes that it is single women like Jane, in their forties and fifties, who are particularly comfortable with the idea of sex for its own sake. 'I think these women are able to be stronger about their sexual needs. They're very comfortable with them.' And you can see her logic - older women are quicker to identify what it is they really want generally and to think that what they want really matters. 'This is very marked in women in their mid-forties on, and this applies to not having sex as much as having sex; they have sex on their own terms, and equally they are celibate on their own terms.' </p> <p>Ex-Cosmo editor Marcelle D'Argy Smith, now in her fifties, is far from celibate and says that she really came into her own as a single woman in her forties. 'Even though I never saw marriage as a pressure - I mean, how do people stagger on in some of them? - and I was lucky in that I knew I didn't want children, my thirties were awful. It wasn't until I got to 40 that I knew I was going to be OK. I love being single - let me tell you, I know where to locate great sex in this town. I have sex with friends; that is, we have friendships and we have great sex, but nothing more. The thing about being single is that I've never had bad sex... I've had long periods of no sex, but when I'm up for it, when I choose to, I have great sex. No one has ever shoved their elbow into my ribs in the middle of the night and said, \"Come on.\" D'Argy Smith's comments mark another change in attitude: we are fast approaching a point where there is almost less stigma attached to being a spinster than there is to being married. Or to being in a bad marriage, at least. As one expert put it: 'Women now feel the same as men - that they don't have to buy the cow, so to speak, they can just take the milk, which might mean sex and not committing.' </p> <p>Eleanor, 50, was in a bad marriage but separated from her husband two years ago. She has been single ever since and says she has never been happier. 'I'm a young 50... I drink too much, smoke too much and, when I feel like it, I fuck too much.' For her, freedom has meant resigning herself to the fact that she won't have children. 'I had a miscarriage during my marriage, which was devastating, but I believe it just wasn't meant to be. Nowadays, I try to do exactly what I want to do when I want to, and obviously it's a bloody bore if I'm financially restrained, but I don't feel restrained in any other way. There will always be sex in my life; I can't imagine not being sexually active, but I don't want a relationship.' It took her a long time to get over the last one. 'Obviously they're great when they're good, but when they're bad, they're draining, you're in turmoil and it's hideous.' She has had two sexual relationships since her marriage ended. Both with friends. Or 'sex buddies', as Penny Rennie-Peyton quaintly calls them. 'Neither is with a view to anything permanent, which is fine by me,' she says. 'One is younger and bisexual, so no commitment there. We were friends and then sex came in to it, and it's a lot of fun. The other one is a friend who's married, so we have sex as and when.' </p> <p>It seems appropriate to end on what men might be making of all this. Surely this balancing of the sexual scales is contributing to their much-discussed vulnerability and confusion? Maybe I talk to the wrong ones. Richard Parry, 33, was in a pub in Brixton one night when 'a woman came up to me at closing time and said, \"Get your coat, we're going.\" I asked if she was serious, and she was.' He didn't find it confusing at all. 'I was quite surprised by the whole thing, but pleasantly so. As we walked down the street together, she then assured me that she was going to take me home and fuck me, which she did.' </p> <p>Richard took her number the next morning but never rang. 'I got the distinct impression that she couldn't give a toss whether I called her or not!'</p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed.</p>",

There will always be sex in my life; I can't imagine not being sexually active, but I don't want a relationship.' It took her a long time to get over the last one. 'Obviously they're great when they're good, but when they're bad, they're draining, you're in turmoil and it's hideous.' She has had two sexual relationships since her marriage ended. Both with friends. Or 'sex buddies', as Penny Rennie-Peyton quaintly calls them. 'Neither is with a view to anything permanent, which is fine by me,' she says. 'One is younger and bisexual, so no commitment there. We were friends and then sex came in to it, and it's a lot of fun. The other one is a friend who's married, so we have sex as and when.' It seems appropriate to end on what men might be making of all this. Surely this balancing of the sexual scales is contributing to their much-discussed vulnerability and confusion? Maybe I talk to the wrong ones. Richard Parry, 33, was in a pub in Brixton one night when 'a woman came up to me at closing time and said, \"Get your coat, we're going.\" I asked if she was serious, and she was.' He didn't find it confusing at all. 'I was quite surprised by the whole thing, but pleasantly so. As we walked down the street together, she then assured me that she was going to take me home and fuck me, which she did.' Richard took her number the next morning but never rang. 'I got the distinct impression that she couldn't give a toss whether I called her or not!' \u0095 Some names have been changed.",

More often than not, they arrive home at the end of the day feeling shattered, and then can't be bothered to cook for themselves, or else have difficulty shopping for the right amount of food, often buying either too little or too much. One useful tip is that milk and bread freeze particularly well.</p> <p>You may also find yourself throwing away half of the fruit and vegetables that you've bought because they've gone off before there was time to use them. This is one of the reasons why single people tend not to eat enough vegetables and fruit, which ultimately means that their bodies are likely to be deficient in such essential antioxidant vitamins and minerals as vitamin C, selenium and betacarotene, which can result in a lack of energy, a weak immune system and feeling generally below par. If you recognise this scenario, remember that frozen vegetables frequently contain more nutrients than their so-called 'fresh' counterparts, because they will have been frozen very quickly after picking.</p> <p>One way of saving time during a busy week is to plan ahead and freeze fresh produce yourself. Microwaving vegetables, rather than boiling them, enables them to retain higher quantities of vitamins and minerals because the short cooking process preserves their time-sensitive nutrients, while their water-soluble vitamins, including vitamin C, are rarely lost. Making or buying vegetable soups, juices and dried fruits are other easy ways to boost your antioxidant intake. Because chilled or frozen soups and juices will not usually have been subjected to rigorous processing treatments, they are far more nutritious than tinned products, whose nutritional values will have been diminished by processing, while the amount of sugar and salt - two of the most common preservatives - that they contain will have been increased.</p> <p>People worry about the quantity of salt (sodium chloride) in ready-made, processed foods - and quite rightly: an increased salt intake can aggravate high blood pressure, increase the risk of heart disease and exacerbate fluid retention and breast tenderness in premenstrual women. One way of counteracting high salt levels is to increase your intake of potassium, a mineral that lowers the concentration of sodium chloride in the body, which is found in vegetables and fruits, particularly bananas, orange juice, dried apricots and prunes. Drinking plenty of water also helps the body to rid itself of excess salt and to glean beneficial nutrients from food.</p> <p>Another nutritional area which single people often neglect is the amount of protein they eat. The body needs protein from either an animal or vegetable source every day. Cheese is a practical source of protein, as are tinned fish such as tuna and sardines. Also, stock up on cooked or raw chicken pieces, pre-prepared roasted meats, or lamb chops. Eggs provide the body with all of the essential amino acids that it needs; as well as staying fresh for quite a long time, they're quick and easy to cook and, contrary to popular belief, don't increase 'bad' cholesterol levels.</p> <p>Women who live on their own tend to cook less red meat than men, instead preferring pastas and other vegetarian dishes. Yet if your diet is deficient in red meat, you may develop iron-deficiency anaemia. Other useful sources of iron include green, leafy vegetables, such as spinach (fresh or frozen), broccoli, eggs, oily fish and lentils and pulses, including baked beans - one of my favourite treats when I'm on my own.</p> <p>Don't feel that eating healthily is too much hassle. If you don't feel that you can fit more than a few simple nutritional strategies into your busy single life, turn to my Bodyfoods basics. Even if you manage little else, your body should feel and remain healthier if you do the following: * Aim to drink 2.5 litres of water every day. * Restrict your intake of caffeine to a maximum of three shots a day.</p> <p>\u0095 Try not to drink any alcohol until you have eaten something.</p> <p>\u0095 Make the effort to bring out the flavours of food. If your food is appetising, your hypothalamus, the 'fullness' centre within the brain, will be satisfied.</p> <p>\u0095 Eat slowly and concentrate on the eating experience. Eating in front of the TV is fine, but savour, and don't ignore, your food, otherwise you won't feel full when you should and will be tempted to overeat. * Eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. An apple packs more antioxidant punch than three 500mg vitamin C tablets, while tomatoes, which are rich in the antioxidant lycopene, have been shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of cancer of the prostate, and probably also of the breast.

      "body": "<p>I hate the patronising way single parents are always portrayed as victims, when the truth is that it suits some of us down to the ground. Personally, I was born to be an SP. Not literally, of course - the midwife didn't say to my mother: 'Congratulations, it's a leech on society.' Nor did I plan it, it just seems to be my way. Thinking about it, everything in my life tends to err towards the solitary existence - I ran screaming from office culture into the shadowy world of home working, where I get to wear dressing gowns, one sock, and my fringe in a ponytail while pontificating grandly on life's mores. Similarly, I've never enjoyed men coming into my home, spreading their 'guy vibes', wiping their big bloke-boots all over my psychic space, until everything is gone and nothing is mine. So, these days, they don't. It's 'their place', neutral territory, or nothing. And 'nothing' and an ear-bashing about my alleged craziness is what I usually get. </p> <p>Even with my friends, I'm like an agoraphobic space shuttle, needing several weeks' notice to prepare for re-entry into the public orbit. It's not that I dislike going out, just that, nine times out of 10, bad things happen to me - or, should I say, bad things happen because of me. One of the side effects of being a single parent is that you get childishly overexcited when other grown-ups are around, but I've got a hunch that for me it was always thus. To avoid arrest, and unexpected sex, I've learned to ration my congeniality, conduct 70 per cent of my social life on the phone, worship at the altar of 'alone'. It's like the ghost of Peter Cook is acting as social secretary in my head, readjusting his immortal line: 'I'm sorry you can't make that - you're watching television that evening.' The only difference is that now, 'alone' means me and my daughter. And that's a special kind of 'alone' - that's an 'alone' I'd be lonely without. </p> <p>That's the point, really. There's nothing remotely 'single' about being a single parent. Just as with couple-parenting, you are never properly alone. Even when my daughter isn't home, she is with me in spirit, her essence hanging in the air like a bewitching perfume. Usually, this ghost-daughter is holding up a long list of 'Things Mummy Must Do To Keep Me Happy'. Or a series of Gillian Wearing-style placards, from the mournful ('I have nits - bad mother, you have failed me') to the opportunistic ('Buying a child's love has received a very bad press, but frankly I'd prefer it'), to the heartwarming ('After school, we will cuddle, watch The Simpsons and discuss the wonder of me, just like we always do'). When she is there physically, it is the same but different - a kind of colourful, knackering whirlwind of aimless mooching, crazed outbursts of activity (drama, choir, play-teas, sleepovers), and being sat on, 'because you're warmer than the chair'. </p> <p>Isn't this what parents, single or otherwise, are for? Maybe not to be literal armchairs, but to be part of the furniture - cosy, unthreatening backdrops to the real deal of their child's life. When my daughter was born, I felt like I'd given birth to my best friend - but that's my reality, she may have other plans. Certainly, while she started off proclaiming that she wanted to marry me and live with me forever, I have since been steadily demoted to the point where I am now living out my old age in a shed in her back garden, popping in occasionally as a kind of unpaid maid service. Soon enough, we will probably be talking in terms of nursing homes, or the gutter. I will be reduced to poignantly pressing my nose against the window of her life in the manner of Joan Crawford as the ditched mother in Stella Dallas. Alternatively, I could just stop being so melodramatic, and take up my rightful position on the sidelines, cheering my 'baby' on, jumping up and down with pride and excitement, screaming: 'Go, girl, go!' </p> <p>That is one of the true perils of single parenthood. You're so used to being the main event, the dish du jour, of your children's life, it's odd to think that there will come a time when your screeched demands for them to finish their homework, clean their teeth and work towards becoming Leader Of The Free World may no longer be strictly necessary. The other perils of SP-dom are well documented - time and money are an issue for everyone, but, for single parents, it's as if Moses came knocking on your door, bearing a tablet of stone, reading: 'Nothing you do is good enough, you will never have peace of mind again.' When the government and society as a whole start joining in, waving their 'naughty stick' and tsk-tsking at the notion of familial breakdown, that's the point at which I, JK Rowling and every other single parent in the country blows a big, wet raspberry. </p> <p>The logic behind the anti-SP argument is curious at best. If you're a couple with children, and you bring them up, then you're an icon of respectability. However, if you manage to do the same thing on your own, then you're an irresponsible idiot, and your children are subhuman spawn. As with everything, there's a wealth pecking order with single parents - some I know are far better off than me; others, like some of my best friends, are having it hard, through no real fault of their own. </p> <p>However, I'm sure all of us, male or female, rich or poor, media bore or teenager on council estate, would agree that being attacked ourselves is not so bad, but seeing our children vilified is hell on earth. Apart from the grinding poverty that afflicts so many of us, that's the main reason single parents get so depressed and angry. Call us all the names you want, wag fingers all you like, but don't sit around crucifying our children in your think-tanks and at your dinner parties. Do that, pal, and you're asking for a slap. </p> <p>Of course, most of the time, single parents don't even think of things like that. It's just a hornet's nest buzzing away annoyingly in the mid-distance as, day by day, second by second, you deal with the real stuff of life. And all things considered - money problems shoved to one side, throbbing exhaustion shrugged off, childcare jigsaws falling apart - my life as a single mother in Britain Year 2K is pretty good. I get to be 'alone' without ever feeling lonely. I get to make all my decisions myself, without having to kowtow to some claustrophobic 'couply' committee. And, best of all, I get what all single parents get, by definition - the child. My daughter is beautiful, clever, funny and kind, a work of art all of her own making, and I get to hang out with her more than anybody else on earth. No one's ever going to convince me that I haven't got it made.</p>",

One factor is increased life expectancy, so you'll have more men over 60 living alone. Then there is the increase in the break up of personal relationships. Not divorce - the divorce rate will actually go down over the next 10 years, but just a churning of partners. </p> <p>And then there is the fact that more women are choosing to live alone and having the earning capacity to do so. We take that for granted now, but it's a huge change that's occurred over the last 10 years. And if we look at those going in and out of relationships, the experience for men and women is very different. Going into a relationship is good news for men, bad news for women - as measured in terms of psychological health and incidence of illness. And coming out of a relationship is good news for women - they get happier, healthier and fitter, while men get sadder, more depressed and indeed, more prone to suicide than any category of the population. </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Most of my research work, when I started writing, was in depression, and the statistics haven't changed in the last century, and are not likely to change. The one group of women prone to depression are married women; the one group of men not prone to depression are married men! </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But don't you think that's odd, in terms of what you read in magazines or books, the idea is always that all women are pushing for marriage and all men aren't, and just want to carry on shagging different women?</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Well, women had to get married when they were economically dependent on men.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But they still do it now.</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> That's cultural, though. Young girls are still taught to think about marriage and the fairy-tale dress, because they are being taught by their parents' generation, who were probably economically dependent in a way the current generation isn't. The next generation of young girls will have a different attitude. I was going round a primary school yesterday and I saw list entitled 'My Ideal World'. One 10-year-old girl had written: 'Enough money so that I can do what I want.' I suspect I wouldn't have seen that 20 years ago from a 10-year-old girl. And a survey by a young women's magazine showed that the number of girls saying they wanted to be nurses was now statistically insignificant. 'You must be joking,' they said, 'nurses don't earn enough money.' I think one of the reasons why married women are more likely to be depressed is because they take on a disproportionate share of the childcare. Actually, the group most at risk from depression, as far as I know, is women who have children under the age of five.</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Who have a confining relationship and no outside job...</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> And that's when the divorce rate really kicks in. American figures reveal that one in four women in their twenties are now saying that they will remain childless. We don't know if that will happen, but we do know that 21-year-old women are getting sterilised because they are worried about the impact on jobs.</p> <p>And so they should be worried: 90 per cent of 40-year-old American male senior executives have children, while 30 per cent of 40-year-old female senior executives have children, so women in America have learned the lesson that there is a trade-off between economic independence and having children. They are being forced to choose between a rock and a hard place, and that will remain the case until men change.</p> <p> <b> Scase </b> And you don't have to look to the States - you get the same patterns in the UK. And it is having the first child when depression kicks in the strongest.</p> <p><b>Maybe babies</b></p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Is that because women are choosing to have children later, and therefore have a lifestyle that is more likely to be disrupted?</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Very much so. When you are just working, you feel you are in control of a large part of your life. But once you become a mother, you have no control over life ever again. And for many of us, that's very difficult.</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> It also holds people in relationships in a way that doesn't happen when you have no children.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> I'm 33, and if you want to go out with someone who is, say, 36 or 37, then there's a high chance they've already got kids, so it impacts on your relationship anyway.</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> How do you feel about being a stepmother, Miranda? [Miranda is in a relationship with a man who has children]</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> Well, you just get on with it, don't you? The kids are nice, and so that's fine. There are just certain things that you don't do on certain days because the kids are coming home!</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Kids are a big subject, but before we get caught up in that, I think it would be good to pick up on what the Richards were saying: is increased singleness primarily an economic trend driven by a rather fortunate section of society who can afford to choose whether or not to be in relationships, based on their earnings?</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> Undoubtedly so. The data I've been referring to relates to managerial and professional women who have access to the private housing market. On the other hand, there is a very large category of women - probably a larger one - who are increasingly dependent, moving in and out of relationships, left with the kids, probably also with elderly parents and doing part-time jobs with insufficient childcare. This is the 20 per cent of the population that is in the poverty trap.</p> <p> <b> Scase </b> Though, in some ways, a combination of higher salaries at the top end and a rise in the welfare state at the bottom end has given women a choice about whether or not to stay in a relationship with a man. And women are reaping the rewards of that by saying, 'Well, I'm going to earn enough money so that I can choose whether or not to be in a relationship', which probably makes for better relationships when you do enter into them.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> Look at Linda Evangelista! She wouldn't move to Manchester!</p> <p><b>So, what is 'single'?</b></p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> I don't think we've even defined 'single' yet. I was going out with a girl for a few years and three months ago we split up. I'm not celibate, but I don't have an emotional commitment, I just see a few girls every couple of weeks. I think I'm single. Until a casual sexual relationship develops and I find myself being more keen to see someone and think: 'Let's go away for the weekend...' then I'm in trouble. Then I'm starting to fall in love. Then I'll stop being single.</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> That's interesting, that you describe the process of becoming 'not-single' as a casual sexual relationship developing ties.</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> It's probably going to start as a casual relationship.</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> I've got four dates this week and I'm so excited. But if I see one of them and it turns out to be really nice and I see him next week, and a third week for dinner again, then am I still single?</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> When you go out on these dates, do you necessarily expect to sleep with the person at the end of it?</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> No.</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> All the blokes would. You'd be thinking: 'Sex columnist. I can't wait until the meal's over!'</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Yes, but it can put some people off!</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> As I get older, something atavistic within me makes me believe that sowing wild oats is all very well, but I feel more inclined to look for something more, because I do quite like the idea of having kids. I think it's a kind of a moral duty for most people.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> God, I feel completely the opposite.</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> It's different for men. A single woman can have children whatever the circumstances, whereas if a man wants children, he has to get into a wonderful relationship. It is out of his control.</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Perhaps more men are looking to get married because fewer women are.</p> <p><b>Lad culture</b></p> <p> <b> Scase </b> Up until maybe 10 years ago, men could dictate the rules of the game, because they had the earning capacity. Whereas women had the choice to get married or end up looking after elderly parents. Now, women can choose to live independently, and in the next 10 years, women are going to become the dominant half, they are going to be 'the daters' and dictate the rules.</p> <p> <b> Simpson </b> But isn't that part of the whole 'New Lad' thing, of which Piers is such an evangelist? Catering to this need for straight, single men today to have at least the illusion of independence? Heterosexual relationships are becoming more like gay relationships in the sense that it's between two equals, and children need not be part of the equation, so there's less responsibility. Traditional heterosexuality has been replaced by what I like to call 'metrosexuality' - people are becoming more narcissistic, more consumerist and more independent, whether they like it or not. And straight women, too, are becoming more like gay men, in the sense that they don't necessarily consider themselves 'incomplete' because they are single. But I don't want to sound too upbeat about it, because the gay condition does tend to be a lonely one. Though there may be a lot of friends and socialising, I think gays, like straight people today, have what used to be called a God-shaped hole in our lives - only now it's a love-shaped hole. We are a generation for whom family relationships don't seem to work in the way that they did in the past. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But, at the same time, relationships are incredibly idealised. Once God is out of the equation, the one thing that's left is romantic love.</p> <p><b>Wake up, and smell the cappucino</b></p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> When we think of 'singles', we think of people in their twenties and thirties, but now what you see happening, with an increase in life expectancy, is that people are getting to their early fifties, seeing that they have another 30 years to go, taking early retirement and getting a life. They're looking at someone across the breakfast table and saying to themselves, 'No, I don't think so...'</p> <p> <b> Simpson </b> And women are more discriminating now, aren't they? It's partly a process of education - or brain-washing, if you like, by advertising - but women have been told to desire a man with Brad Pitt pecs and a washboard stomach.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> It's a long time since I've shagged anyone with a washboard stomach.</p> <p> <b> Simpson </b> But I do think that the advertising industry in the 80s did foist on to women what was effectively a gay way of looking at men. A lot of men really do believe that that is the way women look at them nowadays.</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> But if this greater economic power allows women to stop putting up with a bloke who is ugly just because he's got money, then hurrah for that! I think the media reflects - not always accurately - real changes that are happening within society. And though I speak as somebody who is in a relationship which is the most precious thing in my life, I also think we need to be militant about the advantages of being single. There's that line in Jerry McGuire , 'You complete me', which echoes a kind of nostalgic ideal that we are all two halves of a whole. And I think the quicker we debunk that myth, the better.</p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> Going back to the emotional impact on single men, I think one of the main differences is that a single woman is able to get an enormous amount of emotional support from her network of friends, while single men are very isolated emotionally.</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> The thing I have discovered about being single is that on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, when I'm out and about, dating, coming home late and not having to tell anyone where I've been or worry about where they've been... that's all fine. But Sundays I struggle with.</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> You need a dog, Piers!</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> If you look at under-25s, their whole modus operandi is a bit like getting on and off a bus. But now older people are getting on and off the bus, too, having serial relationships, so no one is single for a very long time - or in a relationship for very long.</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> How do you define a 'long time'?</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> About eight to 10 years.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> I've never been with anyone for eight to 10 years! </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Me neither. </p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> The thing I find very sinister is the people who cannot come out of a relationship without having another one to go into. Being single is a totally necessary, regenerative thing, allowing you to recharge your emotional batteries. </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> That is interesting. That is the major difference between you and older generations of men, because I knew only one man who left his wife before he had another woman lined up. And I'm talking about the 50s, 60s, 70s. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But if marriages break up, there tends to be someone else lined up, because it's a more serious break. I always think that women, even if they're really happy, are constantly assessing a relationship: 'Is this OK?', 'Are we doing this right?', 'I want to talk about this...' </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> And when she walks out, then the man will assess what it has meant and why it went wrong, but not any earlier. </p> <p><b>Friends</b></p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> Apart from all the pain and grief of breaking up with somebody, a lot of your support systems fall away, because we tend to congregate with like-minded people. And so you go through a couple of years of re-finding and redefining a new network. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> And by the time you've redefined that network, you're probably so damn proud of what you've achieved that you're going to hang on to your single status for as long as you can! </p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> About three days ago, a friend of mine invited me and some other male friends for a curry on his birthday. And I went along and I had one of the most miserable nights of my life. There were 10 of my mates there, and 10 of their bloody girlfriends. I was getting incensed by their smug togetherness and, being the only one on my own, I was resented by every one of the females. Like I'm Jack the Lad, likely to lead their blokes astray - go out for a drink with them and say, 'Come on, let's pull a woman.' </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> And all the blokes thought you were hitting on their girlfriends. But it's also a nightmare if you are going out with someone and all you do is see other couples. </p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> In Victorian times, a man was supposed to cut off his single male friends once he got married. </p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> It's still like that! </p> <p><b>Nature vs nurture</b></p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Geri Halliwell said she doesn't want a relationship, because she wants to put all the effort into her work. I've noticed that when I've got a new boyfriend I phone up GQ and say, 'I'm really sorry, but my column's bound to be late!' </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> When I was a teenager, I really envied boys for the way they could just concentrate on whatever they were interested in, whereas I was expected to help my mother and pay attention to what other people needed before I could do the things I was interested in. The joy of living on my own is that now I just do those things! </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> Do you think women are taught that? I think women walk into a room and always check the emotional temperature. </p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> There's a famous experiment in which a tape of a baby crying was played to a classroom of pre-adolescents who were videotaped while wearing heart and blood pressure monitors. When the baby cried, all the young girls showed visible signs of distress and all the boys just sat back. But the monitors told a different story: the boys' heart rate and blood pressure went up just as quickly as the girls'. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But they didn't do anything about it! </p> <p> <b>Fools rush in</b></p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Dorothy, are we seeing more sad people rattling around on Prozac as a result of an increase in singleness, or is it purely coincidence? </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Well, it's not what happens to us that determines our behaviour, but how we interpret what happens to us. </p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> It's also about looking outside yourself. If you say, 'I'm lonely because I'm single', it's misunderstanding the point. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> That you're lonely because you're lonely? </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> An awful lot of people make themselves extremely unhappy because they believe that we live in a just world, where goodness is ultimately rewarded and badness is punished. So when they are not getting the rewards they believe they're entitled to, they get very miserable. Earlier in our conversation, the question of envy came up - of single people envying couples and couples envying single people and, you know, envy is universal. </p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> It seems easier to see happiness in others than to see it in yourself. But I don't want to give up on the pursuit of happiness - I want to give up on the idealisation or the expectation of it. It's very important that the US constitution talks about 'the right to the pursuit of happiness' but it does not say 'the right to happiness'. One way to pursue happiness is through a relationship with somebody with whom you can share an inspirational and fulfilling life, the other route is by finding your own journey. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> I find, among people I know, that they are really keen to see certain people's relationships as fantastic, but in fact, you never know what's happening in other people's relationships, do you? </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Some of my friends were particularly upset by the end of my marriage because they had invested a part of themselves in its success. </p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Yes, they wanted it to work out because that gives them hope that it might work out for them. </p> <p><b>Happy ever after</b></p> <p> <b> Flett </b> So what is the prognosis for an ageing, single society? </p> <p> <b> Scase </b> Anthony Storr's book Solitude , published about 10 years ago now, reflects that there has been a change in society's attitude towards individuals. Storr argues that people who weren't in couple relationships used to be seen to be psychologically immature, but then he gives examples - in science, the arts, all sorts of spheres in all periods of history - that the great writers, artists and scientists were all single people. And he goes on to argue that the reason why they were so creative was because they had emotional maturity. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Or maybe they just had a lot more time on their hands in which to paint the Sistine chapel ceiling... </p> <p> <b> Scase </b> I think, as we move into the 21st century, people are developing a far greater degree of emotional maturity, and the outcome of that is an increasing stratum of people who are choosing to live alone on the grounds that this is the safest, most secure way to be. And I think that a lot of the things we've been talking about in terms of gender roles and identities are to do with the UK. If you go to Scandinavia, for example, or some of the anthropological societies, you have very different relationships between men and women. The UK, as an industrial or information society, hasn't adapted to this single-person lifestyle. It's changing, but it hasn't kept up with the trends we've been talking about today. </p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> Having been a single parent myself, I do still think that it is better for children to be brought up in a family unit or, at the very least, in a stable extended sort of family. </p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Expectations of marriage are going to keep going up. We're allowed to rent people now, so if you want to buy one you need to make sure it's a long-term relationship. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> So again, it comes back to this consumerist notion of wanting something that's difficult to buy, like the latest Prada handbag. </p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> I think we'll know we've made progress when the very question we're addressing today has ceased to be relevant. I do think the real possibility offered by a society in which more people are capable of being single is not only that it becomes a legitimate lifestyle choice but that it enriches the relationships that are around. I can't imagine a world in which people, gay or straight, don't want to be, at least for part of their lives, in relationships with other people. </p> <p>There's a very good chapter in Susie Orbach's book, The Impossibility of Sex , about a lesbian couple who find it very difficult to remain sexually attracted to each other because they have become so intertwined that they cease to see 'the other'. Keeping a sense of otherness in relationships is crit- ical to the chance of those relationships surviving. The ideal partner, I think, is somebody who you know could be perfectly happy as a single person. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> That's a fantastic place to end. Thank you all very much.</p>",

A single woman can have children whatever the circumstances, whereas if a man wants children, he has to get into a wonderful relationship. It is out of his control. Taylor Perhaps more men are looking to get married because fewer women are. Lad culture Scase Up until maybe 10 years ago, men could dictate the rules of the game, because they had the earning capacity. Whereas women had the choice to get married or end up looking after elderly parents. Now, women can choose to live independently, and in the next 10 years, women are going to become the dominant half, they are going to be 'the daters' and dictate the rules. Simpson But isn't that part of the whole 'New Lad' thing, of which Piers is such an evangelist? Catering to this need for straight, single men today to have at least the illusion of independence? Heterosexual relationships are becoming more like gay relationships in the sense that it's between two equals, and children need not be part of the equation, so there's less responsibility. Traditional heterosexuality has been replaced by what I like to call 'metrosexuality' - people are becoming more narcissistic, more consumerist and more independent, whether they like it or not. And straight women, too, are becoming more like gay men, in the sense that they don't necessarily consider themselves 'incomplete' because they are single. But I don't want to sound too upbeat about it, because the gay condition does tend to be a lonely one. Though there may be a lot of friends and socialising, I think gays, like straight people today, have what used to be called a God-shaped hole in our lives - only now it's a love-shaped hole. We are a generation for whom family relationships don't seem to work in the way that they did in the past. Sawyer But, at the same time, relationships are incredibly idealised. Once God is out of the equation, the one thing that's left is romantic love. Wake up, and smell the cappucino Reeves When we think of 'singles', we think of people in their twenties and thirties, but now what you see happening, with an increase in life expectancy, is that people are getting to their early fifties, seeing that they have another 30 years to go, taking early retirement and getting a life. They're looking at someone across the breakfast table and saying to themselves, 'No, I don't think so...' Simpson And women are more discriminating now, aren't they? It's partly a process of education - or brain-washing, if you like, by advertising - but women have been told to desire a man with Brad Pitt pecs and a washboard stomach. Sawyer It's a long time since I've shagged anyone with a washboard stomach. Simpson But I do think that the advertising industry in the 80s did foist on to women what was effectively a gay way of looking at men. A lot of men really do believe that that is the way women look at them nowadays. Reeves But if this greater economic power allows women to stop putting up with a bloke who is ugly just because he's got money, then hurrah for that! I think the media reflects - not always accurately - real changes that are happening within society. And though I speak as somebody who is in a relationship which is the most precious thing in my life, I also think we need to be militant about the advantages of being single. There's that line in Jerry McGuire , 'You complete me', which echoes a kind of nostalgic ideal that we are all two halves of a whole. And I think the quicker we debunk that myth, the better. Litvinoff Going back to the emotional impact on single men, I think one of the main differences is that a single woman is able to get an enormous amount of emotional support from her network of friends, while single men are very isolated emotionally. Hernu The thing I have discovered about being single is that on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, when I'm out and about, dating, coming home late and not having to tell anyone where I've been or worry about where they've been... that's all fine. But Sundays I struggle with. Flett You need a dog, Piers! Reeves If you look at under-25s, their whole modus operandi is a bit like getting on and off a bus. But now older people are getting on and off the bus, too, having serial relationships, so no one is single for a very long time - or in a relationship for very long. Flett How do you define a 'long time'? Reeves About eight to 10 years. Sawyer I've never been with anyone for eight to 10 years! Flett Me neither. Hernu The thing I find very sinister is the people who cannot come out of a relationship without having another one to go into. Being single is a totally necessary, regenerative thing, allowing you to recharge your emotional batteries. Rowe That is interesting. That is the major difference between you and older generations of men, because I knew only one man who left his wife before he had another woman lined up. And I'm talking about the 50s, 60s, 70s. Sawyer But if marriages break up, there tends to be someone else lined up, because it's a more serious break. I always think that women, even if they're really happy, are constantly assessing a relationship: 'Is this OK?', 'Are we doing this right?', 'I want to talk about this...' Rowe And when she walks out, then the man will assess what it has meant and why it went wrong, but not any earlier. Friends Litvinoff Apart from all the pain and grief of breaking up with somebody, a lot of your support systems fall away, because we tend to congregate with like-minded people. And so you go through a couple of years of re-finding and redefining a new network. Flett And by the time you've redefined that network, you're probably so damn proud of what you've achieved that you're going to hang on to your single status for as long as you can! Hernu About three days ago, a friend of mine invited me and some other male friends for a curry on his birthday. And I went along and I had one of the most miserable nights of my life. There were 10 of my mates there, and 10 of their bloody girlfriends. I was getting incensed by their smug togetherness and, being the only one on my own, I was resented by every one of the females. Like I'm Jack the Lad, likely to lead their blokes astray - go out for a drink with them and say, 'Come on, let's pull a woman.' Sawyer And all the blokes thought you were hitting on their girlfriends. But it's also a nightmare if you are going out with someone and all you do is see other couples. Litvinoff In Victorian times, a man was supposed to cut off his single male friends once he got married. Hernu It's still like that! Nature vs nurture Taylor Geri Halliwell said she doesn't want a relationship, because she wants to put all the effort into her work. I've noticed that when I've got a new boyfriend I phone up GQ and say, 'I'm really sorry, but my column's bound to be late!' Rowe When I was a teenager, I really envied boys for the way they could just concentrate on whatever they were interested in, whereas I was expected to help my mother and pay attention to what other people needed before I could do the things I was interested in. The joy of living on my own is that now I just do those things! Sawyer Do you think women are taught that? I think women walk into a room and always check the emotional temperature. Reeves There's a famous experiment in which a tape of a baby crying was played to a classroom of pre-adolescents who were videotaped while wearing heart and blood pressure monitors. When the baby cried, all the young girls showed visible signs of distress and all the boys just sat back. But the monitors told a different story: the boys' heart rate and blood pressure went up just as quickly as the girls'. Sawyer But they didn't do anything about it! Fools rush in Flett Dorothy, are we seeing more sad people rattling around on Prozac as a result of an increase in singleness, or is it purely coincidence? Rowe Well, it's not what happens to us that determines our behaviour, but how we interpret what happens to us. Litvinoff It's also about looking outside yourself. If you say, 'I'm lonely because I'm single', it's misunderstanding the point. Flett That you're lonely because you're lonely? Rowe An awful lot of people make themselves extremely unhappy because they believe that we live in a just world, where goodness is ultimately rewarded and badness is punished. So when they are not getting the rewards they believe they're entitled to, they get very miserable. Earlier in our conversation, the question of envy came up - of single people envying couples and couples envying single people and, you know, envy is universal. Reeves It seems easier to see happiness in others than to see it in yourself. But I don't want to give up on the pursuit of happiness - I want to give up on the idealisation or the expectation of it. It's very important that the US constitution talks about 'the right to the pursuit of happiness' but it does not say 'the right to happiness'. One way to pursue happiness is through a relationship with somebody with whom you can share an inspirational and fulfilling life, the other route is by finding your own journey. Sawyer I find, among people I know, that they are really keen to see certain people's relationships as fantastic, but in fact, you never know what's happening in other people's relationships, do you? Flett Some of my friends were particularly upset by the end of my marriage because they had invested a part of themselves in its success. Taylor Yes, they wanted it to work out because that gives them hope that it might work out for them. Happy ever after Flett So what is the prognosis for an ageing, single society? Scase Anthony Storr's book Solitude , published about 10 years ago now, reflects that there has been a change in society's attitude towards individuals. Storr argues that people who weren't in couple relationships used to be seen to be psychologically immature, but then he gives examples - in science, the arts, all sorts of spheres in all periods of history - that the great writers, artists and scientists were all single people. And he goes on to argue that the reason why they were so creative was because they had emotional maturity. Flett Or maybe they just had a lot more time on their hands in which to paint the Sistine chapel ceiling... Scase I think, as we move into the 21st century, people are developing a far greater degree of emotional maturity, and the outcome of that is an increasing stratum of people who are choosing to live alone on the grounds that this is the safest, most secure way to be. And I think that a lot of the things we've been talking about in terms of gender roles and identities are to do with the UK. If you go to Scandinavia, for example, or some of the anthropological societies, you have very different relationships between men and women. The UK, as an industrial or information society, hasn't adapted to this single-person lifestyle. It's changing, but it hasn't kept up with the trends we've been talking about today. Litvinoff Having been a single parent myself, I do still think that it is better for children to be brought up in a family unit or, at the very least, in a stable extended sort of family. Taylor Expectations of marriage are going to keep going up. We're allowed to rent people now, so if you want to buy one you need to make sure it's a long-term relationship. Flett So again, it comes back to this consumerist notion of wanting something that's difficult to buy, like the latest Prada handbag. Reeves I think we'll know we've made progress when the very question we're addressing today has ceased to be relevant. I do think the real possibility offered by a society in which more people are capable of being single is not only that it becomes a legitimate lifestyle choice but that it enriches the relationships that are around. I can't imagine a world in which people, gay or straight, don't want to be, at least for part of their lives, in relationships with other people. There's a very good chapter in Susie Orbach's book, The Impossibility of Sex , about a lesbian couple who find it very difficult to remain sexually attracted to each other because they have become so intertwined that they cease to see 'the other'. Keeping a sense of otherness in relationships is crit- ical to the chance of those relationships surviving. The ideal partner, I think, is somebody who you know could be perfectly happy as a single person. Flett That's a fantastic place to end. Thank you all very much.",

      "body": "<b>The widow</b> <p><b>Margot Barnard, 80, a founder member of the Bonn Zionist Youth Movement, left Germany for Palestine in 1936. Five years later, she met a British soldier who she later married; they returned to england in 1945. He died in 1964 and she's been single ever since. She gives talks in schools and universities about the Holocaust.</b></p> <p> 'I remember thinking in my forties that things had turned out pretty good. I'd spent most of my marriage as an army wife and enjoyed helping him with stage work. He was an entertainer. We had two teenage sons, a lovely home and a car. \"I've got everything I've ever wanted,\" I thought. But two months later, Ted was dead. It was 1964, and he died following one of the first open heart operations in England. People couldn't cope with death in those days, and I was ignored completely. An added problem was that I was still a good-looking woman, so the neighbours saw me as a threat and didn't want to know. For several months, I sat quietly in my room but then I thought, \"You've got to fight back.\" I didn't want to become a sad and lonely person. </p> <p>The first thing I did was to go away with my eldest son, then 18, on a package tour to Italy. I came back replenished, sold our house in Bexleyheath and moved to a flat in London. Although at first I found decision-making daunting, I soon came to enjoy it. </p> <p>At first I couldn't find an entrance ticket into the London social scene because I had no profession and people had no label with which to describe me. I remember one well-known writer introducing me to her friends with the words, \"This is Margot Barnard... but she's very nice.\" </p> <p>I knew I had to make some money, so I took in a German student as a lodger. That was how I started to make contact with the German youth. I wanted to stretch out my hand to the next German generation. </p> <p>I never feel lonely because I love being able to do what I want to do. I've always loved my independence: I even ran away from home at age 14 because my parents disapproved of my Zionist activities. I have lots of young friends, I go out a lot and still give talks in English and German schools. </p> <p>Since being widowed, I've had only one boyfriend, but it finished when he asked me to marry him. I liked my independence too much.' </p> <p><b>The gay man</b></p> <p><b> Jeremy Haneman, 28, is a musician and arts editor working on the launch of Queercompany.com, an e-commerce facility designed for the gay community</b> </p> <p> 'I've never been in a long-term relationship. The longest I've ever been with a person is five months. I like being single - it suits my state of mind, which is generally to be free and happy. But I'm not discounting a relationship. If someone comes along, brilliant, but I'm really happy the way I am. </p> <p>People tend to think that gay men aren't good at forming relationships, but I'm not sure if that's because they're gay or simply because there's a lot more pressure on heterosexuals to settle down. I think people can sense if you're desperate for a relationship and they steer clear because they don't find it attractive. Also, lots of people have hidden agendas: they want to be in a relationship because it's good for their self-image or because everyone else has a partner or because they don't want to be alone. About 50 per cent of my friends are in relationships, but there aren't that many who I actually envy. I see a lot of deception going on. Of course it would be lovely to form an amazing relationship with someone I loved, but I won't do it as a compromise to social pressure. </p> <p>I like being able to do what I want to do. I go out a lot to clubs, bars and restaurants, and I like having the sexual freedom to see whoever I want. But I also like being alone.' </p> <p><b>The Thirtysomething</b></p> <p><b> Anna Rickard, 31, is a quality officer for air pollution. She's been single for three years</b> </p> <p> 'People have said I have too high expectations. In the past I've tried to compromise, thinking may be I'll grow to like them, but it's never worked. Now I think, \"What's the point?\" The older you get the more you want from a relationship. I'm looking for a man who's dynamic, open, sensitive - and it's difficult to meet someone with those criteria. Also, I've got used to being by myself and the idea of sharing my life feels quite alien. You get selfish because you haven't had to consider someone else's feeling for a long time. </p> <p>The relationships I've had have all ended for different reasons, though I've initiated quite a few of the break ups. I tend to get bored. A long-term relationship can become mundane at times, and you have to work at it. I like the freedom of being single, of being able to live the lifestyle I like, and I've had the odd fling in the past three years. I meet blokes if I go out to a bar, but none of them has worked out. </p> <p>My friends provide me with all the friendship and companionship I need. I have male and female friends, some single and others in relationships. We go out in a big gang and have a good time together drinking, cycling, diving. </p> <p>I'm very happy hanging out with my friends, going off on exciting holidays when I want to, but I wouldn't want the lifestyle of my friends who have settled down and had babies. I think I'd feel trapped. I can see how much you have to compromise and give up when you have a baby. I'm probably a bit selfish for that right now. That's not to say I wouldn't like the close company of a boyfriend, but it's not top of my agenda. On the other hand, if I'm in this situation in five years' time, I might be slightly worried. </p> <p>I don't like being the only single person in a room full of couples, especially if it's all lovey dovey or baby talk. I feel quite alien to that, and I guess it brings it home to me that... oh my God, will I be left on the shelf? But I don't worry for long. I like my life, and I don't want what they've got right now.' </p> <p><b>The Commitmentphobe</b></p> <p><b>Josh Howie, 24, is a music-video rep. He is the son of Lynne Franks and Paul Howie</b></p> <p> 'I have a low attention span, and while I've slept about a bit, I find it hard to maintain a relationship for long. After a couple of weeks I stop returning the phone calls, and the big phase out begins. I'm not good at confrontation. The trouble is, while I might find a girl my age attractive, once my sexual appetite has been satisfied I get bored. Often it seems that the better looking the girl, the less need they've had to develop their personality because they've been able to manipulate men by playing on their looks all their life. </p> <p>For me, relationships are all about learning something and being with someone who can bring out the best in you. Younger girls don't have that ability. I've been with older women too, and certainly they have more interesting stories to tell. They've been around the block; they know all the crappy ways you're thinking because they've been there. </p> <p>I go out a lot and I'm constantly ready. My antennae are always up and I'm all set to bring on the charm. I was a very late developer and for years had to put up with constant rejection. Then suddenly the acne disappeared, I was 6ft tall and everyone wanted to know me. Perhaps my slight misogynist tendency comes from years of rejection. </p> <p>I like to think I've given a woman the best night of her life - it's a kind of \"look at me, I'm a stud\" mentality. But also on some level I'm paranoid I'm a fake. I find it hard to respect someone I've slept with. I show them my best side and still feel fake and think, \"Oh, you didn't spot that. I can't quite believe you bought my bullshit.\" </p> <p>A lot probably stems from insecurity. If I talk about my fear of intimacy with a girl who I'm trying to chat up, sometimes that just feels like another tactic - \"the honest trip\" - whereas they're thinking, \"I'm going to change this guy.\" So you can't win.'</p> <p><b>The Divorc\u00e9e</b></p> <p><b>Patty Deppe-Greenall, 39, was married for 14 years until last year, when she divorced her husband. She is a consultant astrologer who writes two columns for internet sites and has two children, Daisy, 11, and William, eight.</b></p> <p> 'People look on me as the baddy because I divorced my husband, but it takes a lot of courage to leave a 14-year marriage. I started studying astrology a few years ago after not having worked for 10 years. It wasn't my aim to become independent and support myself, but that proved very useful. As the marriage failed, I started working with clients and teaching. I built up my confidence by consulting over the phone. </p> <p>At first I was afraid of being on my own, but the quality of my life has improved immensely. I don't have to fight all the time or constantly clean up. Now I'm able to pay for the mortgage and the bills myself. Sometimes I spend more than I make and I'm always thinking of ways to make money, but at least I have a good time. </p> <p>When I was with my husband, I didn't have any drive or energy. Everything I did seemed to be constantly defeated. But now I'm getting things done. I've even mended the heating, which broke down three years ago, and put in a new carpet: people say the atmosphere is great in the flat now. I go out a lot more, too - to films, restaurants and bars. Before, there was never the money to do anything because my husband felt we had none. That attitude is very infectious. </p> <p>At first when I found myself single again, I couldn't bring myself to date. The first time I had a date I made it for three weeks ahead and then cancelled the day before. Now I've gone on a few dates and it feels much more comfortable. </p> <p>My astrology has a lot to do with becoming free. Part of the problem of getting married at 23 is that you don't know if you're compatible. In our case, we weren't. Over the last few years I've been finding myself again, and now I'm happier than I've been for a long time.' </p> <p><b>The Twentysomething</b></p> <p><b> Lisa Sanders, 21, lives at home. She is currently helping out in her father's double-glazing business, but is planning to start her own ironing business</b> </p> <p> 'When I was about 17, I had a one-and-a-half year relationship. It ended because it all got too routine. We'd stay in or go to the cinema, all of which I found quite boring. When it was over I felt liberated. </p> <p>Now, about three or four nights a week, I go out drinking and clubbing with the girls. We get merry but never loud and drunk. There are about 10 of us, and we're out to have fun. I've been around these girls since primary school, so we know each other inside out. If one of us has a problem, we rally round and support each other. Recently we all went on holiday to Cyprus and then to Dublin for a friend's birthday. I like having a laugh and going shopping with my friends. We get our hair done and buy stuff. Most weeks I'll buy clothes and shoes. I've got loads of shoes, probably about 80 pairs. </p> <p>What I love about being single is that you can do what you want. If it happens, it happens. I enjoy male company, but only as friends. I've got a couple of close male friends who come out with us and who I treat just like the girls. Sometimes I meet other guys while we're out but I never go off with any of them. I wouldn't without getting to know someone first. If they're good company, I'll take their number and meet them another time. </p> <p>If a boy wants to have a relationship, I tell him, \"I don't want one, but if you can handle being friends, let's go out and have a laugh.\" They don't seem to find that too much of a rejection because I'm not saying, \"I don't like you\", I'm just saying, \"I don't want a relationship.\"' </p> <p><b>The single mother</b></p> <p><b> Jacqueline Keiza, 32, is a single parent with an 11-year-old son, Francis. She is currently studying psychology and counselling</b> </p> <p> 'When I met Francis's father at 17, I slowly gave up one thing after another because he didn't like them. When I left him at 21, I remember thinking, \"Where are my hobbies, what did I used to do?\" It was like having a blank page. By 25 I was listening to my rock music again, watching black-and-white movies and doing sculpture - all the things he's made me give up. </p> <p>I've been single for 10 years, and during that time I tried to spend as much time with Francis as possible. When he was four, I got a job as a night-care officer so I could still be with him during the day. I would never bring a man back to the house because I didn't want my son to grow up with the notion that women are easy. </p> <p>At 20 I was very traditional. I thought you had to be in love before you slept with someone. But when I was 23, I met an Irishman and had my first one-night stand. It was great and gave me a taste for that kind of thing, although I haven't had sex for five years. I think I frighten men because I'm so assertive and independent. My sense of self comes from having regained my independence since leaving the long-term relationship with Francis's father, which stifled me. </p> <p>I love my freedom. I love going to hear rock bands, though I usually go alone - my friends don't like loud music. I don't believe in the traditional type of relationship where people live together. I think people are just conditioned to want that. </p> <p>If I were to enter into a relationship, we'd have to live separately. I don't want to make someone else stay up late, listen to music and watch black-and-white movies. Equally, I don't want to be made to watch football. People need their own space, and if they don't get it, they end up looking and sounding like their partner. Living up to someone's expectations drowns you. </p> <p>I love being alone and am far too busy to get lonely. My aim is to be a little bit selfish. It's important to do something for yourself sometimes instead of constantly giving to another person. You don't have to make sacrifices to raise perfectly happy children.' </p> <p><b>The Bachelor</b></p> <p><b> Tom Holmes, 42, was last in a long-term relationship 'a long time ago'. He gave up his job as executive vice president of a global advertising agency last year to get involved in two internet start-up companies, Effcom.net and creativebrief.com. He is a single father and looks after his daughter, Molly, 5, most weekends</b> </p> <p> 'I've never been married, but I have been in three long-term relationships and have always wanted a degree of independence. Now I've reached a state of equilibrium. A lot of my friends who married young are getting divorced, and I see them suffering both financially and emotionally. And I'm very glad I'm not in their position. But I do sometimes miss the intimacy and companionship of a steady relationship. When I worked in advertising with a large salary, it was easier to maintain one. Now I have a more erratic lifestyle, with unsociable hours. At this time of my life, I need to be focused - on my work during the week and being a dad on the weekends. Also, women of my age expect stability and commitment from a man, which I find difficult to give. I'd find it hard to put my heart and soul into a relationship, unless I met a woman who was understanding, stunning and not high maintenance. I want to start a relationship from a base of security when I've achieved some of my business ambitions. Otherwise I'll be doing it on the run, which I used to do - that usually leads to fairly shallow flings. </p> <p>I may not have much of a social life because I'm working hard, but I enjoy the freedom. I'm more comfortable in myself, more in control of my life. And I have a great time sharing Molly's experiences. </p> <p>A lot of people talk with desperation about finding the right partner, as if time is running out. I'm not worried about that - I enjoy living my life as a single person.'</p>",

It was 1964, and he died following one of the first open heart operations in England. People couldn't cope with death in those days, and I was ignored completely. An added problem was that I was still a good-looking woman, so the neighbours saw me as a threat and didn't want to know. For several months, I sat quietly in my room but then I thought, \"You've got to fight back.\" I didn't want to become a sad and lonely person. The first thing I did was to go away with my eldest son, then 18, on a package tour to Italy. I came back replenished, sold our house in Bexleyheath and moved to a flat in London. Although at first I found decision-making daunting, I soon came to enjoy it. At first I couldn't find an entrance ticket into the London social scene because I had no profession and people had no label with which to describe me. I remember one well-known writer introducing me to her friends with the words, \"This is Margot Barnard... but she's very nice.\" I knew I had to make some money, so I took in a German student as a lodger. That was how I started to make contact with the German youth. I wanted to stretch out my hand to the next German generation. I never feel lonely because I love being able to do what I want to do. I've always loved my independence: I even ran away from home at age 14 because my parents disapproved of my Zionist activities. I have lots of young friends, I go out a lot and still give talks in English and German schools. Since being widowed, I've had only one boyfriend, but it finished when he asked me to marry him. I liked my independence too much.' The gay man Jeremy Haneman, 28, is a musician and arts editor working on the launch of Queercompany.com, an e-commerce facility designed for the gay community 'I've never been in a long-term relationship. The longest I've ever been with a person is five months. I like being single - it suits my state of mind, which is generally to be free and happy. But I'm not discounting a relationship. If someone comes along, brilliant, but I'm really happy the way I am. People tend to think that gay men aren't good at forming relationships, but I'm not sure if that's because they're gay or simply because there's a lot more pressure on heterosexuals to settle down. I think people can sense if you're desperate for a relationship and they steer clear because they don't find it attractive. Also, lots of people have hidden agendas: they want to be in a relationship because it's good for their self-image or because everyone else has a partner or because they don't want to be alone. About 50 per cent of my friends are in relationships, but there aren't that many who I actually envy. I see a lot of deception going on. Of course it would be lovely to form an amazing relationship with someone I loved, but I won't do it as a compromise to social pressure. I like being able to do what I want to do. I go out a lot to clubs, bars and restaurants, and I like having the sexual freedom to see whoever I want. But I also like being alone.' The Thirtysomething Anna Rickard, 31, is a quality officer for air pollution. She's been single for three years 'People have said I have too high expectations. In the past I've tried to compromise, thinking may be I'll grow to like them, but it's never worked. Now I think, \"What's the point?\" The older you get the more you want from a relationship. I'm looking for a man who's dynamic, open, sensitive - and it's difficult to meet someone with those criteria. Also, I've got used to being by myself and the idea of sharing my life feels quite alien. You get selfish because you haven't had to consider someone else's feeling for a long time. The relationships I've had have all ended for different reasons, though I've initiated quite a few of the break ups. I tend to get bored. A long-term relationship can become mundane at times, and you have to work at it. I like the freedom of being single, of being able to live the lifestyle I like, and I've had the odd fling in the past three years. I meet blokes if I go out to a bar, but none of them has worked out. My friends provide me with all the friendship and companionship I need. I have male and female friends, some single and others in relationships. We go out in a big gang and have a good time together drinking, cycling, diving. I'm very happy hanging out with my friends, going off on exciting holidays when I want to, but I wouldn't want the lifestyle of my friends who have settled down and had babies. I think I'd feel trapped. I can see how much you have to compromise and give up when you have a baby. I'm probably a bit selfish for that right now. That's not to say I wouldn't like the close company of a boyfriend, but it's not top of my agenda. On the other hand, if I'm in this situation in five years' time, I might be slightly worried. I don't like being the only single person in a room full of couples, especially if it's all lovey dovey or baby talk. I feel quite alien to that, and I guess it brings it home to me that... oh my God, will I be left on the shelf? But I don't worry for long. I like my life, and I don't want what they've got right now.' The Commitmentphobe Josh Howie, 24, is a music-video rep. He is the son of Lynne Franks and Paul Howie 'I have a low attention span, and while I've slept about a bit, I find it hard to maintain a relationship for long. After a couple of weeks I stop returning the phone calls, and the big phase out begins. I'm not good at confrontation. The trouble is, while I might find a girl my age attractive, once my sexual appetite has been satisfied I get bored. Often it seems that the better looking the girl, the less need they've had to develop their personality because they've been able to manipulate men by playing on their looks all their life. For me, relationships are all about learning something and being with someone who can bring out the best in you. Younger girls don't have that ability. I've been with older women too, and certainly they have more interesting stories to tell. They've been around the block; they know all the crappy ways you're thinking because they've been there. I go out a lot and I'm constantly ready. My antennae are always up and I'm all set to bring on the charm. I was a very late developer and for years had to put up with constant rejection. Then suddenly the acne disappeared, I was 6ft tall and everyone wanted to know me. Perhaps my slight misogynist tendency comes from years of rejection. I like to think I've given a woman the best night of her life - it's a kind of \"look at me, I'm a stud\" mentality. But also on some level I'm paranoid I'm a fake. I find it hard to respect someone I've slept with. I show them my best side and still feel fake and think, \"Oh, you didn't spot that. I can't quite believe you bought my bullshit.\" A lot probably stems from insecurity. If I talk about my fear of intimacy with a girl who I'm trying to chat up, sometimes that just feels like another tactic - \"the honest trip\" - whereas they're thinking, \"I'm going to change this guy.\" So you can't win.' The Divorc\u00e9e Patty Deppe-Greenall, 39, was married for 14 years until last year, when she divorced her husband. She is a consultant astrologer who writes two columns for internet sites and has two children, Daisy, 11, and William, eight. 'People look on me as the baddy because I divorced my husband, but it takes a lot of courage to leave a 14-year marriage. I started studying astrology a few years ago after not having worked for 10 years. It wasn't my aim to become independent and support myself, but that proved very useful. As the marriage failed, I started working with clients and teaching. I built up my confidence by consulting over the phone. At first I was afraid of being on my own, but the quality of my life has improved immensely. I don't have to fight all the time or constantly clean up. Now I'm able to pay for the mortgage and the bills myself. Sometimes I spend more than I make and I'm always thinking of ways to make money, but at least I have a good time. When I was with my husband, I didn't have any drive or energy. Everything I did seemed to be constantly defeated. But now I'm getting things done. I've even mended the heating, which broke down three years ago, and put in a new carpet: people say the atmosphere is great in the flat now. I go out a lot more, too - to films, restaurants and bars. Before, there was never the money to do anything because my husband felt we had none. That attitude is very infectious. At first when I found myself single again, I couldn't bring myself to date. The first time I had a date I made it for three weeks ahead and then cancelled the day before. Now I've gone on a few dates and it feels much more comfortable. My astrology has a lot to do with becoming free. Part of the problem of getting married at 23 is that you don't know if you're compatible. In our case, we weren't. Over the last few years I've been finding myself again, and now I'm happier than I've been for a long time.' The Twentysomething Lisa Sanders, 21, lives at home. She is currently helping out in her father's double-glazing business, but is planning to start her own ironing business 'When I was about 17, I had a one-and-a-half year relationship. It ended because it all got too routine. We'd stay in or go to the cinema, all of which I found quite boring. When it was over I felt liberated. Now, about three or four nights a week, I go out drinking and clubbing with the girls. We get merry but never loud and drunk. There are about 10 of us, and we're out to have fun. I've been around these girls since primary school, so we know each other inside out. If one of us has a problem, we rally round and support each other. Recently we all went on holiday to Cyprus and then to Dublin for a friend's birthday. I like having a laugh and going shopping with my friends. We get our hair done and buy stuff. Most weeks I'll buy clothes and shoes. I've got loads of shoes, probably about 80 pairs. What I love about being single is that you can do what you want. If it happens, it happens. I enjoy male company, but only as friends. I've got a couple of close male friends who come out with us and who I treat just like the girls. Sometimes I meet other guys while we're out but I never go off with any of them. I wouldn't without getting to know someone first. If they're good company, I'll take their number and meet them another time. If a boy wants to have a relationship, I tell him, \"I don't want one, but if you can handle being friends, let's go out and have a laugh.\" They don't seem to find that too much of a rejection because I'm not saying, \"I don't like you\", I'm just saying, \"I don't want a relationship.\"' The single mother Jacqueline Keiza, 32, is a single parent with an 11-year-old son, Francis. She is currently studying psychology and counselling 'When I met Francis's father at 17, I slowly gave up one thing after another because he didn't like them. When I left him at 21, I remember thinking, \"Where are my hobbies, what did I used to do?\" It was like having a blank page. By 25 I was listening to my rock music again, watching black-and-white movies and doing sculpture - all the things he's made me give up. I've been single for 10 years, and during that time I tried to spend as much time with Francis as possible. When he was four, I got a job as a night-care officer so I could still be with him during the day. I would never bring a man back to the house because I didn't want my son to grow up with the notion that women are easy. At 20 I was very traditional. I thought you had to be in love before you slept with someone. But when I was 23, I met an Irishman and had my first one-night stand. It was great and gave me a taste for that kind of thing, although I haven't had sex for five years. I think I frighten men because I'm so assertive and independent. My sense of self comes from having regained my independence since leaving the long-term relationship with Francis's father, which stifled me. I love my freedom. I love going to hear rock bands, though I usually go alone - my friends don't like loud music. I don't believe in the traditional type of relationship where people live together. I think people are just conditioned to want that. If I were to enter into a relationship, we'd have to live separately. I don't want to make someone else stay up late, listen to music and watch black-and-white movies. Equally, I don't want to be made to watch football. People need their own space, and if they don't get it, they end up looking and sounding like their partner. Living up to someone's expectations drowns you. I love being alone and am far too busy to get lonely. My aim is to be a little bit selfish. It's important to do something for yourself sometimes instead of constantly giving to another person. You don't have to make sacrifices to raise perfectly happy children.' The Bachelor Tom Holmes, 42, was last in a long-term relationship 'a long time ago'. He gave up his job as executive vice president of a global advertising agency last year to get involved in two internet start-up companies, Effcom.net and creativebrief.com. He is a single father and looks after his daughter, Molly, 5, most weekends 'I've never been married, but I have been in three long-term relationships and have always wanted a degree of independence. Now I've reached a state of equilibrium. A lot of my friends who married young are getting divorced, and I see them suffering both financially and emotionally. And I'm very glad I'm not in their position. But I do sometimes miss the intimacy and companionship of a steady relationship. When I worked in advertising with a large salary, it was easier to maintain one. Now I have a more erratic lifestyle, with unsociable hours. At this time of my life, I need to be focused - on my work during the week and being a dad on the weekends. Also, women of my age expect stability and commitment from a man, which I find difficult to give. I'd find it hard to put my heart and soul into a relationship, unless I met a woman who was understanding, stunning and not high maintenance. I want to start a relationship from a base of security when I've achieved some of my business ambitions. Otherwise I'll be doing it on the run, which I used to do - that usually leads to fairly shallow flings. I may not have much of a social life because I'm working hard, but I enjoy the freedom. I'm more comfortable in myself, more in control of my life. And I have a great time sharing Molly's experiences. A lot of people talk with desperation about finding the right partner, as if time is running out. I'm not worried about that - I enjoy living my life as a single person.'",

So I had every reason to encourage him to expand his social circle in the same way. Not that he needed my encouragement. After all, if there are 2m people registered with dating agencies in this country, there must be twice as many using contact ads. The only sad part of this trend, in my opinion, is the decline of the letter-based Lonely Hearts as the so-called Talking Hearts (with their premium-rate phone lines) take over.</p> <p>After all, the Lonely Hearts are out there for everyone, which is partly what makes them such compelling reading. They can be banal. But they can also be intriguing: 'Delicate flower, in interesting modern colours, WLTM vibrant male with gentle hands to pluck her and cherish her forever.' Not to mention comical, childish, bitter, egotistical, sweet or hopelessly specific. They deserve a considered response - not a two-sentence recorded message.</p> <p>I had always been a browser. It was when I hit 30 and had to acknowledge that most of my friends had paired off and moved to the suburbs with a cat and a full set of china that I decided to write my own ad. Placing it seemed expensive - but not as expensive as membership of a dating agency, most of which I suspected were top-heavy with lonesome females. And the alternative strategies - 'Riverboat discos for the unattached' or 'Musical chairs, a new fun way to meet from the USA. Meet someone different every five minutes' - sounded too exhausting. So I wrote: 'Arts journalist, 30, dark hair, green eyes, seeks intelligent, emotionally articulate male for long conversations, literary pursuits and possible romance.

It was perfect; the garden was perfect; the dinner was perfect. Only I was not perfect, I felt, to fit into this model scheme of domesticity.</p> <p>Eventually I devised a plan for the men whom I had dated and found wanting. I invited them to a singles' picnic on Hampstead Heath for the salvation of my single women friends. I should have known better. The event was every bit as exhausting as a river disco, without the benefit of either darkness or drop-off points. The unkindest cut of all was that the women who had complained most about the lack of boyfriend material in their orbit were the ones who failed to turn up, leaving a posse of disappointed males to trade competitive insults over the rocket salad.</p> <p>This isn't to say that I never met anyone I wanted to go out with. I took to answering ads on a word processor so as to increase my response rate. In the first year I dated Robert, a gorgeous psychotherapist who drove me to distraction analysing our relationship, and Michael, the classical guitarist whose slovenly housekeeping and habit of asking what was for dinner meant he had to go - even if he did have a GSOH and once serenaded me while I cleaned his toilet. Over three years I found five lovers through the contact ads, including the one I married.</p> <p>I don't regret the time I spent with men I met only once, either. I had the best service ever in a restaurant where I had dinner with the editor of an S&amp;M magazine, after he explained that the 'woman with attitude' he sought was not the average stroppy cow I took it to mean. There were less amusing companions. But the situation lends itself to confidences. Like a passenger on a train who knows his destination is not the same as that of his fellow travellers, I have been privy to the innermost thoughts and feelings of strangers for whom I was not the answer - but I wish them well. Just occasionally, I spot an ex-blind date in a concert hall or on a station platform with another woman. If they catch my eye, I always smile. And then I find myself wondering if they met, as we say in Lonely Hearts circles, 'in the usual way'.</p>",

It was perfect; the garden was perfect; the dinner was perfect. Only I was not perfect, I felt, to fit into this model scheme of domesticity. Eventually I devised a plan for the men whom I had dated and found wanting. I invited them to a singles' picnic on Hampstead Heath for the salvation of my single women friends. I should have known better. The event was every bit as exhausting as a river disco, without the benefit of either darkness or drop-off points. The unkindest cut of all was that the women who had complained most about the lack of boyfriend material in their orbit were the ones who failed to turn up, leaving a posse of disappointed males to trade competitive insults over the rocket salad. This isn't to say that I never met anyone I wanted to go out with. I took to answering ads on a word processor so as to increase my response rate. In the first year I dated Robert, a gorgeous psychotherapist who drove me to distraction analysing our relationship, and Michael, the classical guitarist whose slovenly housekeeping and habit of asking what was for dinner meant he had to go - even if he did have a GSOH and once serenaded me while I cleaned his toilet. Over three years I found five lovers through the contact ads, including the one I married. I don't regret the time I spent with men I met only once, either. I had the best service ever in a restaurant where I had dinner with the editor of an S&amp;M magazine, after he explained that the 'woman with attitude' he sought was not the average stroppy cow I took it to mean. There were less amusing companions. But the situation lends itself to confidences. Like a passenger on a train who knows his destination is not the same as that of his fellow travellers, I have been privy to the innermost thoughts and feelings of strangers for whom I was not the answer - but I wish them well. Just occasionally, I spot an ex-blind date in a concert hall or on a station platform with another woman. If they catch my eye, I always smile. And then I find myself wondering if they met, as we say in Lonely Hearts circles, 'in the usual way'.",

A hundred flashbulbs exploded as the pack, flown in by helicopter, craned for a clear view through a cloud of dry ice. There, at the end of the catwalk, was... a washing machine. </p> <p>Waiting to greet his latest proteg\u00e9 was the machine's creator James Dyson, the man who turned the vacuum cleaner into a culture statement. He would shudder at such a suggestion, arguing that the products his company manufactures are the result of intelligent design, not fashion. </p> <p>Arms flailing like Peter Snow after too much caffeine, Dyson launches into salesman mode. He explains how, apparently, today's washing machines are practically useless when it comes to delivering your whites whiter than white. It's all to do with the wringing action. Only by flexing the fabric can those oh-so-stubborn stains be removed properly. </p> <p>'We think things can be done better,' he says. 'Handwashing produces better results than washing machines which don't have the wonderful manipulating action.' </p> <p>Originally, Dyson toyed with putting a paddle into his prototypes - 'all very Heath Robinson' - in a bid to move the load around. His eventual solution was to create a machine with two drums that spin in opposite directions, helping the fabrics to move around and dirt to shift faster. </p> <p>Dyson's company, based in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, has spent \u00a325 million developing the new machine, which has taken a million man hours to produce. More than 300 staff will be taken on at the company's factory as a result. By the end of next year Dyson estimates it will employ 3,000. </p> <p>Everything seems to be going swimmingly as Dyson, Pied Piper-like, leads the press on a tour of the company's research and development building. Currently, 16 per cent of turnover is spent on R&amp;D - reflected in the numerous prototypes it played with before launching the catchily titled Contrarotator. But then someone has the temerity to ask how much the new device will cost. '\u00a31,000,' comes the unabashed answer. Pens hover while everyone does mental arithmetic. 'That's three times the price of a normal washing machine,' someone says. 'Most machines are around \u00a3500,' Dyson retorts, 'but we believe that people will pay for ours.' He claims that the new device will mean weekly wash cycles will be practically halved. </p> <p>The company is banking on the Dyson magic working a second time. Five years ago he revolutionised the vacuum cleaner market when he launched his 'dual cyclone' bagless machine, the fruit of 15 years' labour. Dyson, a design graduate from the Royal College of Arts, had looked at more than 5,000 prototypes before launching the model that now corners more than half of the UK market. </p> <p>He and a handful of employees developed their first cleaner in the back garden of his house near Bath. He had moved to the West Country from his East Anglian birthplace to develop a new type of amphibious craft. And by this stage he had also devised the Ballbarrow wheelbarrow - which he subsequently sold on to another firm. </p> <p>Having developed the cleaner, Dyson toured all the big vacuum manufacturers looking to cut a deal, but to no avail. The City, too, ignored his pleas for cash. Eventually, Dyson borrowed more than \u00a31m and struck out alone. The suits must be kicking themselves now. The company, which has a turnover of about \u00a3420m, will make 1.3m Dyson vacuum cleaners this year - a 10 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. </p> <p>So successful did the product - originally sold only in Comet and Currys stores and by mail order - become that it attracted the attention of Hoover, which copied parts of the Dyson design. Last month a judge ruled that Hoover could not sell or manufacture its Triple Vortex cleaners in the UK. Dyson's claims for millions in damages will be assessed in the future. </p> <p>The court case served as a reminder that Dyson is something of an outsider who likes to question business's status quo. The washing machine is no exception. 'I don't think other manufacturers are trying to develop better products. They're just following the market,' he says. </p> <p>But does Dyson get tired of being labelled a maverick inventor, the classic British eccentric beavering away in the wood shed? 'It's a bit of a misnomer. There are lots of engineers who work here and invent things,' Dyson says in the disarming way which has turned him into one of the UK's favourite surrogate uncles and has earned him numerous invitations to sit on prestigious design and arts boards up and down the land. </p> <p>He believes a new generation of inventors might find the going easier. 'There's more money for new ventures in the form of internet start-ups. Maybe now the gloss has gone off the sector it will come back to technology.' </p> <p>Dyson is scathing about the dotcom world and hates the way his sector is seen as its ugly sister. 'I think we can be creative in manufacturing. It's just a pity we don't have a minister. We have a minister for e-commerce. Manufacturing is far more important than the internet.' </p> <p>The Government gets another ticking off for taking the design and technology GCSE off the compulsory studies list. 'I'm afraid that girls might give up on it as they have done in Wales where it was made non-compulsory four years ago. There could be a real gender imbalance. Design and technology is the fourth most popular GCSE and has the lowest truancy levels.' </p> <p>Other products, including a robot vacuum cleaner, will inevitably receive the Dyson treatment in the not too distant future. The bad news for those who loathe vacuuming is that the robot is taking longer to develop than hoped: the company has found it difficult to attract software and technology engineers to look beyond London. </p> <p>Those staff who do join seem to be happy with their decision. One of Dyson's staff, who has been with him right from the start, says: 'I don't think I could work anywhere else now.' Another employee who joined recently, says: 'Everyone wears casual clothes, there's no hierarchy, it's all open-plan offices.' </p> <p>Such a laid-back atmosphere might be difficult to achieve if Dyson were responsible to shareholders. Would he look to float? 'I'm not hostile to it,' he says, but then points out that the City might take a different view of the way profits are ploughed back into R&amp;D. He rules out licensing the brand and waxes lyrical about the fact that Dyson doesn't spend too much money on advertising. 'We'd rather we sold products through recommendations. It's always been that way.' </p> <p>For one fleeting moment he sounds like a traditionalist. But, deep down, Dyson is of the old school: a manufacturer, and proud of it. </p> <p><strong>Vital signs</strong><br><strong> Subject </strong> James Dyson </p> <p><strong> Age </strong> 53 </p> <p><strong> Job title </strong> Founder and Chairman, Dyson </p> <p><strong> Other directorships </strong> Sits on the Council of the Royal College of Arts and the Design Council.

Maybe now the gloss has gone off the sector it will come back to technology.' Dyson is scathing about the dotcom world and hates the way his sector is seen as its ugly sister. 'I think we can be creative in manufacturing. It's just a pity we don't have a minister. We have a minister for e-commerce. Manufacturing is far more important than the internet.' The Government gets another ticking off for taking the design and technology GCSE off the compulsory studies list. 'I'm afraid that girls might give up on it as they have done in Wales where it was made non-compulsory four years ago. There could be a real gender imbalance. Design and technology is the fourth most popular GCSE and has the lowest truancy levels.' Other products, including a robot vacuum cleaner, will inevitably receive the Dyson treatment in the not too distant future. The bad news for those who loathe vacuuming is that the robot is taking longer to develop than hoped: the company has found it difficult to attract software and technology engineers to look beyond London. Those staff who do join seem to be happy with their decision. One of Dyson's staff, who has been with him right from the start, says: 'I don't think I could work anywhere else now.' Another employee who joined recently, says: 'Everyone wears casual clothes, there's no hierarchy, it's all open-plan offices.' Such a laid-back atmosphere might be difficult to achieve if Dyson were responsible to shareholders. Would he look to float? 'I'm not hostile to it,' he says, but then points out that the City might take a different view of the way profits are ploughed back into R&amp;D. He rules out licensing the brand and waxes lyrical about the fact that Dyson doesn't spend too much money on advertising. 'We'd rather we sold products through recommendations. It's always been that way.' For one fleeting moment he sounds like a traditionalist. But, deep down, Dyson is of the old school: a manufacturer, and proud of it.

      "body": "<p>No two men since the explorers Lewis and Clark have set out to shrink America as have George Bush and Al Gore during the final, frantic week of their nail-biting election campaign.</p> <p>Dispatched by Thomas Jefferson, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out on their odyssey of 1805 to prove that the uncharted deserts and mountains of the continent were navigable by man.</p> <p>Last week Bush and Gore demonstrated that it can be criss-crossed like a village green, with a furious offensive of stump-speeches, mass-mailing, media carpet-bombing, aircraft pilots, palm pilots and dot.communion with the voters of America. It's a tribute to Air Traffic Control that their campaign jets have not crashed into one another; in fact, the two motorcades carrying Bush and Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman did cross paths, by pure chance, in Missouri.</p> <p>And Bush himself came close to a nasty crash on Thursday, when it emerged that he had successfully hidden a drunken driving conviction, picked up after a session in a bar in Maine during 1976.</p> <p>Bush was still fighting what appeared to be a successful counter-attack yesterday, winning loud cheers for his condemnation of 'gotcha' politics and helped by the fact that the tip-off to Maine's WPXT TV station - which revealed the conviction - came from Tom Connolly, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the state and delegate to the party's convention in August, who concedes he was out to inflict political damage.</p> <p>Rather than try to capitalise on the revelation, Gore himself - campaigning in his home state of Tennessee - was anxious yesterday to keep a safe distance, forcefully denying any involvement in the leak.</p> <p>Bush's conviction, however, took second place to the question of his honesty, as a Dallas Morning News reporter, Wayne Slater, came forward on Friday to say that in an interview two years ago, Bush denied he had ever been arrested after 1968 - when he got in trouble for a drunken college prank. But Slater - whose paper is among the few to enthusiastically endorse Bush - was shy to pursue the point yesterday, saying the Texas governor was shut up by his press aide.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the campaign cavalry charged on. Apart from dodging scandal and gathering air miles, the Bush camp sent 110 million letters and made 62 million phone calls in five days; Gore's only a few less. Every local radio show has been meticulously targeted: hip-hop stations for rants against police racial profiling (Gore); Country 'n' Western frequencies with dire warnings against gun control (Bush).</p> <p>'The man who can right himself by a vote will never resort to a musket,' wrote James Fenimore Cooper in the American Democrat of 1838. That's as may be, but the virulence of last week's advertise-ments knew no precedent as Tuesday's showdown neared. Each candidate has run dry of policies to attack, so the ads counter-attack the other's attack ads.</p> <p>The burgeoning campaign coffers, apparently bottomless even before last week - have somehow found room for more, as further millions pour into both from corporations, millionaires, trade unions and interest groups.</p> <p>Daily, the two men move further apart over the clues and contradictions as to what kind of President each would make. Methodical Gore; intuitive Bush. Gore the combative policy-cannibal; Bush with his peaceful, easy feelin' - 'What, Me Worry?' Bush has been flattering 'the American people' like his father and Ronald Reagan before him, appealing to their Samaritan instincts while arranging to reward their financial greed. Gore, apparently free of his spin-doctors' chains and master of his own speeches, has become a rat-a-tat soap-box orator, palpitating with zeal. In an increasingly gravelly and imploring voice, he harangues 'the American people', urging them to greater things.</p> <p>Bush's standard speech has boiled down to 'Gore trusts Washington; I trust the people' and 'Gore is a liar; I tell the truth'. Gore's is about fighting for the common man and woman against 'special interests' and 'billionaires'.</p> <p>Their policies are likewise at loggerheads. There is no compromise over who is 'waging class warfare' (of which one accused the other all last week). No middle ground over their collision-course tax policies, plans for social security, healthcare and education, pitched against one another like fighting cocks.</p> <p>The fight itself, however, could not be closer: all that is certain is that on Tuesday the United States of America will elect a new President. Unlike all past elections since opinion polls began in the 1940s, neither candidate is stealing even a nose on the final lap. The vote will go to the wire. Although most polls show Bush creaking ahead in percentage terms, they also give each candidate around 200 votes apiece in the electoral college, with some 130 still to fight for.</p> <p>All the rules have been broken: the number of battleground states up for grabs is even this weekend expanding rather than contracting, forcing the candidates to spread themselves rather than hone in on a slither of voters. The final round is further complicated by the Greens' Ralph Nader, whose ego-maniacal refusal to step down has made him Bush's cherished ally, as he steals votes and time from Gore in the 'swing states'.</p> <p>America was invented in the most crucial of those states, Pennsylvania. Jefferson wrote his declaration in a Philadelphia pub; Lincoln rescued the Union at Gettysburg and industrial barons built the modern nation in Pittsburgh. Fitting, then, that both candidates began their week by blowing through the Keystone State.</p> <p>Bush's speeches were geared to give an aura of inevitable victory. He is not selling a package any longer, he just wants to look like a winner because, in the final hour, that is what people want to back. A curious fact about American elections is that in their aftermath, more people say they voted for the new President than actually did. Bush - although performing to audiences of devotees, Boy Scouts and Christian militants - is sticking to a conservative agenda without using conservative buzzwords.</p> <p>Gore, breezing into Pittsburgh from West Virginia, toured the heartland of the old industrial economy talking about the new one, promising 10 million high-tech jobs in the next decade. Then he nipped to California for some defensive work in the state he must and should win, and to record a Jay Leno talk show.</p> <p>Here we saw the man who wrote his degree thesis on how politicians use television: Gore quipped that voters were like a person with a sick dog, deciding whether to go to the vet or the taxidermist. 'Either way, you get your dog back.'</p> <p>Bush also swung to the West Coast, tearing up the San Andreas fault line faster than any earthquake could, and seeking to rupture California with its biggest on record - a victory for himself. In Oregon, he struck his favourite note: 'Tell them I'm from the West. Okay, it's West Texas. But Texas is a whole lot closer to Oregon than Washington DC.'</p> <p>Riding the general distrust of government, Bush talks about 'Washington' not as a place but a concept, a cabal operating against the interests of 'the people'. Absent from this construct, however, are the size of his spending programme, his own roots in the Northeastern aristocracy and the fact that the wheels driving him to next Tuesday could not have been better oiled than by the Texas-Washington axis.</p> <p>Gore followed the fault line, too, turning one of Bush's favourite lines against him - 'class warfare on behalf of billionaires' - and making voters aware of 'the big choice' facing them, as well he might so far as the rival manifestos are concerned. He joked that he would go to a Hallowe'en party as 'his own man - no mask'. It's his favourite line, but also a bitter one.</p> <p>Gore should by rights win this election - and still could, riding as he does on a magic carpet of unprecedented national well-being. And for a moment during this campaign he held victory in the palms of his hands, but let it slip. That was in Los Angeles, at the Democratic Convention in August, when he was - for once, and as he kept saying - 'his own man'.</p> <p>But Gore's history is one of allowing himself to be moulded and packaged, and after LA he reverted to type. Rather than stick to his newly assertive self-confidence, Gore followed the spinners' instructions and was once again lost between his 'nerd' and his Sopranos acts, neither of which is popular with the voters. Only last week did he again found his authenticity - the premium quality in this election.</p> <p>Next stop, Florida - a contested, glittering prize with Bush this time under pressure, struggling to rally his own faithful. Gore departed the Sunshine State leaving behind his (importantly elderly and Jewish) deputy, Joe Lieberman, returning again to Pennsylvania as Bush made another sweep across the Midwest.</p> <p>'The Shrub' had breezed through Chicago and was in Iowa by the time a drunken driving conviction had been awkwardly (and potentially explosively) revealed, while Gore also hit the Windy City - via New Mexico - in time to find the newsstands splattered with an Esquire cover showing his former boss snapped at crotch level, blue tie pointing towards the organ that kept Ken Starr busy for so long.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the pace will quicken; more Florida, more West Coast, more Midwest, more swing states. Why this frantic, and this close? The answer lies, for the most part, in demographic uncertainties. More than any past election, this one charts the new political map of America, one in which huge swaths of new 'Major Metro' areas are swinging some states for the Democrats, while former bastions of rural liberalism turn to the Republicans.</p> <p>Bush's father won 61 per cent of Florida in 1988, with Gore now showing a narrow lead. New Jersey, once a key 'swing' state, is safely Democratic. Even Ronald Reagan's California should finally settle for Gore. These are states of urban and suburban sprawl - now peaked - where issues like abortion choice and gun control are popular among the 'waitress moms' and their families, important to this election.</p> <p>Meanwhile: Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, West Virginia and others won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988 are either contested or lining up for Bush: they are religious states, independent and bloody-minded, and offended by the Clinton administration. And in between are the places where this election will be won and lost: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri. Until Tuesday, it won't be quite clear who the new demographic map favours.</p> <p>The fact that the Democrats are not poised for any certain victory - White House, Senate or House - is itself a historical anomaly, given the state of the economy and the cultural, generational values set by the Clinton years.</p> <p>As a potential Bush victory, Election 2000 is rather like a reversal of 1976 - a blip won by Jimmy Carter during a period of Republican hegemony, with things put back to rights by the election of Reagan four years later.</p> <p>The seeds of the Democrats' problems at a time they should be riding a roller-coaster were sown during the second Clinton administration: the distractions of scandal and impeachment, but more importantly the inability of that administration to turn its victory of 1996 into an unassailable, popular majority politics consolidating the white working class, urban and rural - a failure on which Bush now rides.</p> <p>The other reasons for the dead heat are the candidates and campaigns themselves. There are two prisms through which to look at Bush: you can either see him as the man who spent more money than any other politician in history, only to squander it along with a 17-point lead - or else the man whom the punditocracy backs to be elected President next Tuesday. Behind Bush's success - first and foremost - there is money, as there always has been. All his ventures in business, from oil drilling to the Texas Rangers baseball team, were underwritten and invariably bailed out by big tycoons who were anxious to lubricate their connections to his father.</p> <p>This created the financial base for his governorship of the oil kingdom of Texas, and eventually the present campaign.

      "bodyText": "No two men since the explorers Lewis and Clark have set out to shrink America as have George Bush and Al Gore during the final, frantic week of their nail-biting election campaign. Dispatched by Thomas Jefferson, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out on their odyssey of 1805 to prove that the uncharted deserts and mountains of the continent were navigable by man. Last week Bush and Gore demonstrated that it can be criss-crossed like a village green, with a furious offensive of stump-speeches, mass-mailing, media carpet-bombing, aircraft pilots, palm pilots and dot.communion with the voters of America. It's a tribute to Air Traffic Control that their campaign jets have not crashed into one another; in fact, the two motorcades carrying Bush and Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman did cross paths, by pure chance, in Missouri. And Bush himself came close to a nasty crash on Thursday, when it emerged that he had successfully hidden a drunken driving conviction, picked up after a session in a bar in Maine during 1976. Bush was still fighting what appeared to be a successful counter-attack yesterday, winning loud cheers for his condemnation of 'gotcha' politics and helped by the fact that the tip-off to Maine's WPXT TV station - which revealed the conviction - came from Tom Connolly, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the state and delegate to the party's convention in August, who concedes he was out to inflict political damage. Rather than try to capitalise on the revelation, Gore himself - campaigning in his home state of Tennessee - was anxious yesterday to keep a safe distance, forcefully denying any involvement in the leak. Bush's conviction, however, took second place to the question of his honesty, as a Dallas Morning News reporter, Wayne Slater, came forward on Friday to say that in an interview two years ago, Bush denied he had ever been arrested after 1968 - when he got in trouble for a drunken college prank. But Slater - whose paper is among the few to enthusiastically endorse Bush - was shy to pursue the point yesterday, saying the Texas governor was shut up by his press aide. Meanwhile, the campaign cavalry charged on. Apart from dodging scandal and gathering air miles, the Bush camp sent 110 million letters and made 62 million phone calls in five days; Gore's only a few less. Every local radio show has been meticulously targeted: hip-hop stations for rants against police racial profiling (Gore); Country 'n' Western frequencies with dire warnings against gun control (Bush). 'The man who can right himself by a vote will never resort to a musket,' wrote James Fenimore Cooper in the American Democrat of 1838. That's as may be, but the virulence of last week's advertise-ments knew no precedent as Tuesday's showdown neared. Each candidate has run dry of policies to attack, so the ads counter-attack the other's attack ads. The burgeoning campaign coffers, apparently bottomless even before last week - have somehow found room for more, as further millions pour into both from corporations, millionaires, trade unions and interest groups. Daily, the two men move further apart over the clues and contradictions as to what kind of President each would make. Methodical Gore; intuitive Bush. Gore the combative policy-cannibal; Bush with his peaceful, easy feelin' - 'What, Me Worry?' Bush has been flattering 'the American people' like his father and Ronald Reagan before him, appealing to their Samaritan instincts while arranging to reward their financial greed. Gore, apparently free of his spin-doctors' chains and master of his own speeches, has become a rat-a-tat soap-box orator, palpitating with zeal. In an increasingly gravelly and imploring voice, he harangues 'the American people', urging them to greater things. Bush's standard speech has boiled down to 'Gore trusts Washington; I trust the people' and 'Gore is a liar; I tell the truth'. Gore's is about fighting for the common man and woman against 'special interests' and 'billionaires'. Their policies are likewise at loggerheads. There is no compromise over who is 'waging class warfare' (of which one accused the other all last week). No middle ground over their collision-course tax policies, plans for social security, healthcare and education, pitched against one another like fighting cocks. The fight itself, however, could not be closer: all that is certain is that on Tuesday the United States of America will elect a new President. Unlike all past elections since opinion polls began in the 1940s, neither candidate is stealing even a nose on the final lap. The vote will go to the wire. Although most polls show Bush creaking ahead in percentage terms, they also give each candidate around 200 votes apiece in the electoral college, with some 130 still to fight for. All the rules have been broken: the number of battleground states up for grabs is even this weekend expanding rather than contracting, forcing the candidates to spread themselves rather than hone in on a slither of voters. The final round is further complicated by the Greens' Ralph Nader, whose ego-maniacal refusal to step down has made him Bush's cherished ally, as he steals votes and time from Gore in the 'swing states'. America was invented in the most crucial of those states, Pennsylvania. Jefferson wrote his declaration in a Philadelphia pub; Lincoln rescued the Union at Gettysburg and industrial barons built the modern nation in Pittsburgh. Fitting, then, that both candidates began their week by blowing through the Keystone State. Bush's speeches were geared to give an aura of inevitable victory. He is not selling a package any longer, he just wants to look like a winner because, in the final hour, that is what people want to back. A curious fact about American elections is that in their aftermath, more people say they voted for the new President than actually did. Bush - although performing to audiences of devotees, Boy Scouts and Christian militants - is sticking to a conservative agenda without using conservative buzzwords. Gore, breezing into Pittsburgh from West Virginia, toured the heartland of the old industrial economy talking about the new one, promising 10 million high-tech jobs in the next decade. Then he nipped to California for some defensive work in the state he must and should win, and to record a Jay Leno talk show. Here we saw the man who wrote his degree thesis on how politicians use television: Gore quipped that voters were like a person with a sick dog, deciding whether to go to the vet or the taxidermist. 'Either way, you get your dog back.' Bush also swung to the West Coast, tearing up the San Andreas fault line faster than any earthquake could, and seeking to rupture California with its biggest on record - a victory for himself. In Oregon, he struck his favourite note: 'Tell them I'm from the West. Okay, it's West Texas. But Texas is a whole lot closer to Oregon than Washington DC.' Riding the general distrust of government, Bush talks about 'Washington' not as a place but a concept, a cabal operating against the interests of 'the people'. Absent from this construct, however, are the size of his spending programme, his own roots in the Northeastern aristocracy and the fact that the wheels driving him to next Tuesday could not have been better oiled than by the Texas-Washington axis. Gore followed the fault line, too, turning one of Bush's favourite lines against him - 'class warfare on behalf of billionaires' - and making voters aware of 'the big choice' facing them, as well he might so far as the rival manifestos are concerned. He joked that he would go to a Hallowe'en party as 'his own man - no mask'. It's his favourite line, but also a bitter one. Gore should by rights win this election - and still could, riding as he does on a magic carpet of unprecedented national well-being. And for a moment during this campaign he held victory in the palms of his hands, but let it slip. That was in Los Angeles, at the Democratic Convention in August, when he was - for once, and as he kept saying - 'his own man'. But Gore's history is one of allowing himself to be moulded and packaged, and after LA he reverted to type. Rather than stick to his newly assertive self-confidence, Gore followed the spinners' instructions and was once again lost between his 'nerd' and his Sopranos acts, neither of which is popular with the voters. Only last week did he again found his authenticity - the premium quality in this election. Next stop, Florida - a contested, glittering prize with Bush this time under pressure, struggling to rally his own faithful. Gore departed the Sunshine State leaving behind his (importantly elderly and Jewish) deputy, Joe Lieberman, returning again to Pennsylvania as Bush made another sweep across the Midwest. 'The Shrub' had breezed through Chicago and was in Iowa by the time a drunken driving conviction had been awkwardly (and potentially explosively) revealed, while Gore also hit the Windy City - via New Mexico - in time to find the newsstands splattered with an Esquire cover showing his former boss snapped at crotch level, blue tie pointing towards the organ that kept Ken Starr busy for so long. Over the weekend, the pace will quicken; more Florida, more West Coast, more Midwest, more swing states. Why this frantic, and this close? The answer lies, for the most part, in demographic uncertainties. More than any past election, this one charts the new political map of America, one in which huge swaths of new 'Major Metro' areas are swinging some states for the Democrats, while former bastions of rural liberalism turn to the Republicans. Bush's father won 61 per cent of Florida in 1988, with Gore now showing a narrow lead. New Jersey, once a key 'swing' state, is safely Democratic. Even Ronald Reagan's California should finally settle for Gore. These are states of urban and suburban sprawl - now peaked - where issues like abortion choice and gun control are popular among the 'waitress moms' and their families, important to this election. Meanwhile: Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, West Virginia and others won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988 are either contested or lining up for Bush: they are religious states, independent and bloody-minded, and offended by the Clinton administration. And in between are the places where this election will be won and lost: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri. Until Tuesday, it won't be quite clear who the new demographic map favours. The fact that the Democrats are not poised for any certain victory - White House, Senate or House - is itself a historical anomaly, given the state of the economy and the cultural, generational values set by the Clinton years. As a potential Bush victory, Election 2000 is rather like a reversal of 1976 - a blip won by Jimmy Carter during a period of Republican hegemony, with things put back to rights by the election of Reagan four years later. The seeds of the Democrats' problems at a time they should be riding a roller-coaster were sown during the second Clinton administration: the distractions of scandal and impeachment, but more importantly the inability of that administration to turn its victory of 1996 into an unassailable, popular majority politics consolidating the white working class, urban and rural - a failure on which Bush now rides. The other reasons for the dead heat are the candidates and campaigns themselves. There are two prisms through which to look at Bush: you can either see him as the man who spent more money than any other politician in history, only to squander it along with a 17-point lead - or else the man whom the punditocracy backs to be elected President next Tuesday. Behind Bush's success - first and foremost - there is money, as there always has been. All his ventures in business, from oil drilling to the Texas Rangers baseball team, were underwritten and invariably bailed out by big tycoons who were anxious to lubricate their connections to his father. This created the financial base for his governorship of the oil kingdom of Texas, and eventually the present campaign. It was Republican big money that sought out George Bush for this moment, not the other way round. For that reason, the machine sponsoring Bush forgives him everything, even brazen draft-dodging during the Vietnam War (supposed to be the sacred measurement of a man in conservative circles) and even bare-faced lies about his service record after he jumped a line of 100,000 to join the Texas National Guard instead. These things have thus far not mattered, for the packaged Bush is, more than anything, a personification of interests.

      "bodyText": "Support for Al Gore was showing unexpected strength in key states last night as suggestions that George Bush had lied about a secret conviction for drunken driving dominated the US election race. First polls suggested that Bush's conviction 24 years ago was not an issue for two-thirds of the voters and that he was holding on to his slim lead. But in the 13 battleground states, which Bush must capture if he is to reach the White House, they showed Gore edging ahead. For Bush, whose campaign is based on 'trust', the drink-driving disclosures raise obvious questions about his trustworthiness and selective memory and recall President Bill Clinton's evasiveness in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Even Republican workers think he should have disclosed this conviction 15 months ago, at the start of his run for the presidency. Worse, his protestations about 'youthful' indiscretions sit uneasily with the fact that he was 30 at the time of his arrest, and with the fact that here, as in a previous drink-driving scrape, he had younger Bushes with him in the car. Drink is a special demon for substantial parts of the electorate in the more conservative states, where memories of the Prohibition era are by no means dead and laws preventing the sale of alcohol to teenagers are far more rigorously enforced than in Britain. The Democrats are not overtly exploiting the issue, fearing that it could rebound as a 'smear' or, as Bush put it, as 'gotcha politics'. In his home state of Tennessee, Gore denied any part in the leak to a TV station that Bush had been found guilty of drink-driving in 1976. The revelation came in defiance of an assurance by Bush to a reporter two years ago that he not been arrested since a college prank in 1968. Though Gore is standing well back, his aides said privately they hoped the question mark over Bush's honesty would affect voters' views of him, but agreed that it would be hard to measure.

      "body": "<p>The historic city of York was last night bracing itself for more chaos after escaping further devastation yesterday by just two inches. </p> <p>The worst flooding in nearly 400 years brought water almost 18 feet higher than normal, peaking just below the defences that surround the city centre. But weather forecasters warned that torrential rain will sweep across England and Wales throughout today in a severe gale that could swell water levels further. </p> <p>Police, soldiers and firefighters - who have already laid 65,000 sandbags around the city centre in recent days - were using the brief respite to reinforce defences. Police Chief Superintendent Gary Barnett said: 'We are on a knife-edge at the moment and it doesn't look like it's going to change for the next two or three days.' </p> <p>An extra 500 troops remain on standby to help out those already at work, many complaining of exhaustion. </p> <p>As the battle to save York was reaching its climax, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott flew in by helicopter and pledged to speed up and increase payments to local authorities to help pay for damage. The Government will now pay the total cost of repairs - rather than just 85 per cent - and it will make sure the local authorities get the money within 15 days. In York alone, more than 3,000 people have been made homeless from the floods so far. </p> <p>After an emergency Cabinet meeting in London, Prescott promised an additional \u00a351 million for improving flood defences over the next four years.

      "bodyText": "The historic city of York was last night bracing itself for more chaos after escaping further devastation yesterday by just two inches. The worst flooding in nearly 400 years brought water almost 18 feet higher than normal, peaking just below the defences that surround the city centre. But weather forecasters warned that torrential rain will sweep across England and Wales throughout today in a severe gale that could swell water levels further. Police, soldiers and firefighters - who have already laid 65,000 sandbags around the city centre in recent days - were using the brief respite to reinforce defences. Police Chief Superintendent Gary Barnett said: 'We are on a knife-edge at the moment and it doesn't look like it's going to change for the next two or three days.' An extra 500 troops remain on standby to help out those already at work, many complaining of exhaustion. As the battle to save York was reaching its climax, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott flew in by helicopter and pledged to speed up and increase payments to local authorities to help pay for damage. The Government will now pay the total cost of repairs - rather than just 85 per cent - and it will make sure the local authorities get the money within 15 days. In York alone, more than 3,000 people have been made homeless from the floods so far. After an emergency Cabinet meeting in London, Prescott promised an additional \u00a351 million for improving flood defences over the next four years. More money would be spent on research into climate change, and on examining the link between global warming and the current floods. 'Severe flooding could become more common as a result of global warming,' he predicted. Prescott visited victims of the flooding and told them he had 'great sympathy with houses and businesses which have been affected by the flooding. All we can do is give a warning [about the looming storm] and try to minimise the damage.' Railtrack warned that the new storm would lead to further turmoil to Britain's collapsing rail system, bringing delay to a huge programme of urgent maintenance planned for this weekend. More than 35,000 metres of track were due to be repaired over the two days, with most of the work taking place today.

These are testing targets for any business, never mind one that is operating in a fiercely competitive industry undergoing the fastest technological change ever. </p> <p>The question is, will he achieve it? McNamara, in the post for less than six months, certainly sounds a lot more convincing than either of his predecessors or some of his competitors. As a newcomer, he can be brutal about its faults.

He will specifically target the small business market, surely the most ripe for a bit of competition. And he will actively try to persuade customers to buy more from A&amp;L with the launch of products like the Premier current account, which gives preferential rates on everything from credit cards to insurance. </p> <p>A&amp;L believes holders will have an average of four products, almost three times the rate for existing customers, so if it achieves its aim of selling 150,000 of these next year and 500,000 within three years, that will be a lot of cross-selling. That will soon be followed by an internet-based money management service. </p> <p>Of course, A&amp;L is not alone in the realisation that the key to future profitability lies not in winning new customers but in selling more to existing ones. McNamara is confident that his products are more attractive than the many others which are already on the market - time will tell whether customers agree. </p> <p>Cost-cutting, too, is no longer a unique selling point: every business has to keep doing it simply to remain competitive. McNamara is realistic enough to expect that some of the cost savings will have to be given back to customers in the form of lower margins. </p> <p>A&amp;L remains the City's favourite financial-services bid target, associated with every predator from Prudential to Bank of Scotland. McNamara insists that it has a future as a nimble-footed independent, but his strategic review has underlined the opportunities it offers to an acquirer. If he does not deliver them, a new owner might. </p> <p><strong> Fayre's fair</strong><br> </p> <p> Last week's interim results from Whitbread shed a bit more light on what 'future' Whitbread will look like after it is shorn of its pubs business. The result, to quote the curate, is good in parts. Unfortunately, the part which is worst - restaurants - will make up two-thirds of the new-look group. </p> <p>Brewers Fayre, Pizza Hut, Caf\u00e9 Rouge and the other brands which make up Whitbread's eateries managed just a 2.2 per cent rise in sales in the six months to 2 September, well below the freshly baked target of 5 per cent sales growth and 10 per cent earnings growth across the group. Indeed, only two chains - Pizza Hut and Costa coffee - achieved it, while three of the brands - most notably TGI Fridays - reported sharp sales falls. </p> <p>Whitbread's solution, following the inevitable strategic review, is yet another brand shuffle. Some of the Caf\u00e9s Rouges will go, and many of the Brewers Fayres will be revamped and given new names like Out and Out or Grill Bar in a bid to lure back the punters. </p> <p>The hotels business looks a lot stronger, boosted by the success of its Travel Inn chain, which does seem to be tempting customers who would never normally contemplate a hotel. David Lloyd Leisure looked solid but is too small to make much of an impact on the group's performance. </p> <p>Big acquisitions to address this have, however, been all but ruled out - and sensibly so, given the pace of change recently. Following the disposal of the brewing business and the proposed sale of the pubs, the management will have to prove that they can actually make the leisure business perform. Until they have done so, the shares are probably high enough. </p> <p><strong> Tough old Boots</strong><br> </p> <p> Boots, on the other hand, continues to squeeze performance out of a business which everyone is determined to write off. Like-for-like sales growth of 1.4 per cent in its core high street chain may not be high enough to appease the bears but is still impressive enough in the current deflationary climate. More impressive is Boots's ability to convert that to an 8.5 per cent rise in profits, and a widening of its already healthy margins. The \u00a3100m cost-cutting programme now planned suggests it is determined that record will continue. </p> <p>The problem is that even such a solid performance is unlikely to be enough to persuade the City to change its attitude to the shares. Too many analysts fear that it is merely struggling to stave off the inevitable - a decline in both sales and margins. Both the management team and the record are among the strongest in the retail industry but that is not enough to propel the shares. </p> <p><strong> Bright future</strong><br> </p> <p> At Autonomy, by contrast, the problem is stopping the inexorable rise.

On Tuesday seven international flights touched down at the massive complex on the outskirts of Baghdad including aircraft from Turkey, Lebanon, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, all carrying officials and business delegations for the opening of the annual Baghdad trade fair, the biggest since it resumed business in 1995. Among those who were greeted by Iraqi press and officials and walked through the almost deserted arrivals area last Tuesday was an Irish MEP, Niall Andrews, who had travelled on the first flight since 1991 from Dublin. His journey via Bucharest to Baghdad in an eight-seater aircraft, carrying \u00a310,000 worth of medicines for the children of Iraq was, he admits, intended as a symbolic gesture against a sanctions regime he believes is redundant and repellent. Andrews could not ignore the most obvious evidence of the UN Security Council's rapidly unravelling sanctions regime against Iraq - a giant Tu-154 that arrived from Moscow with 50 parliamentarians and businessmen led by Pyotr Romanov, Communist Deputy Speaker of the Duma.

      "body": "<p>The timing is perfect. Just 48 hours before Chancellor Gordon Brown delivers what will probably be the last Pre-Budget Report before the general election, he faces business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry conference. </p> <p>If next year's March Budget is to provide Brown with a chance to charm the electorate with tax cuts, this week's report will be about getting UK plc firmly on his side. And with Treasury coffers overflowing with a larger than predicted surplus, the CBI audience in Birmingham will be expecting goodies. </p> <p>Director-General Digby Jones says: 'We believe that government could give some \u00a33 billion back to business.' </p> <p>Despite wobbles over manufacturing, the CBI and the Government have been riding in tandem. Since Jones's appointment last January, the CBI has been banging the drum for increased transport spending. 'We were delighted by the wonderful decision to invest \u00a3180bn on transport,' says Jones. 'If we're going to be more productive, we've got to get our goods to market.' </p> <p>The employers' leader warned against a resumption of the fuel protests because they 'won't work', will make a poor impression on investors and 'hurt wealth creation'. </p> <p>The pro-euro campaign by the CBI was handily placed on a backburner soon after Jones's arrival. He says: 'The Government's European policy is going down the right lines'. The current imperative is to iron out the workings of the single market, a view that will be echoed in the Chancellor's speech tomorrow. </p> <p>Jones even invokes the Treasury terminology about not returning the economy to 'boom and bust'. </p> <p>But aside from the mantra of macroeconomic stability, it is the UK's poor productivity that has preoccupied previous pre-Budget statements. Indeed this week's statement, to be entitled 'Building Long-term Prosperity for All', will set out the Government's approach to dealing with this medium-term question. </p> <p>And although the CBI has promised to work with the Government to tackle the productivity gap, their immediate approaches will differ. </p> <p>The employers will launch a major initiative to cut the red tape and regulation stifling the growth of small businesses. The Government, it says, has swamped firms with 16 new pieces of employment legislation since coming to power. 'We don't want any more,' says Jones. He wants Brown to 'walk the walk' after talking about getting government out of the way where its actions harm business. </p> <p>For the Chancellor, the report, aside from petrol and pensioners, will be about reviving entrepreneurship to energise economically de-funct urban areas, uniting the productivity and social justice agendas. </p> <p>But Brown, his pockets overflowing with as much as \u00a315bn in loose change, will be pressed to grant some form of tax cut to businesses. </p> <p>Tax competition has taken off across Europe, with Germany, Italy and France slashing companies' burdens to attract investment. International comparisons of the tax burden, however, show the UK faring reasonably well. </p> <p>Instead, the report will again focus on Brown's favoured business constituency: the revered hi-tech entrepreneurs, particularly those with a social conscience. There will be more microeconomic tinkering with tax credits to provide incentives for research and development, and skills investment. This follows a well-trodden path of micro adjustments to encourage productivity improvements. </p> <p>Following the recent Cohen report on 'social investment', there will be tax breaks to encourage venture capital and start-ups in deprived urban areas. </p> <p>Stamp duty on 'brownfield' developments is expected to be abolished, as recommended by Lord Rogers's Urban Task Force. </p> <p>The CBI's immediate priorities lie elsewhere, but it is not out of tune with this agenda. Jones says his organisation wants 'socially inclusive wealth creation', with more money and more control over planning for regional development agencies. </p> <p>This moves in the same direction: trying to prepare fertile ground for small businesses to grow in new industries. Many of the areas in need of regeneration, however, have suffered because of the decline of large-scale manufacturing. </p> <p>'Old economy' business leaders will want proof that their understated role in the development of new technology and higher productivity will be fully recognised, particularly after the dampening of dotcom fever. </p> <p>Employee share ownership may be less attractive now that the hi-tech sector has taken a pasting. But the long- awaited reform of approved share options schemes will be launched in the report. The current limit of 15 employees is expected to be lifted, and the total tax-free limit expanded to \u00a32.5m per company. Such schemes will allow all employees to share in the stellar performance of a listed small business. </p> <p>Business groups, however, are lobbying for a bolder move. The Computer and Software Services Association, for example, seeks a blanket simplification of the scheme featuring a basic rule on how long options need to be held to justify tax breaks. Such schemes now need to be approved by the Inland Revenue. Whenever the Chancellor gives to business with one narrowly targeted hand, as in this case, he invariably takes something back through extra red tape. </p> <p>As a rule of thumb, any tax breaks so specifically targeted need to be verified to prevent abuse, so adding to the complexity of the system. But in this case the stringent tax-avoidance rules affected the flexibility of high growth start-ups to offer capital stakes, rather than their dwindling cash funds, to attract and retain staff. </p> <p>Brown may decide this bureaucratic burden is relatively small beer compared to the low taxes paid by companies. Another factor is that the TUC, which lent crucial support to the Government during the fuel crisis, opposes the CBI's anti-red tape campaign, viewing the move as an attempt to restrict employees' rights. </p> <p>The employers also want the Chancellor to review the climate change levy, remove stamp duty on stock exchange transactions and make a major cut in vehicle excise duty on lorries. </p> <p>They are making a general plea for greater consultation on the minutiae of policy - a return to the original rationale for the pre-Budget report as the basis for at least four months' policy discussion. The single biggest cause of business distress, the strong pound, will not be the subject of consultation. Indeed exchange-rate woes and skills shortages are seen, in the Government's unspoken policy, as a spur to UK plc to use innovative technology and good management to get the most out of workers. Two years ago the UK exporters claimed the bearable DM exchange rate was 2.70. It now says that DM3 would not be too bad. That, and the trade surplus with the EU, shows manufacturers are making headway on productivity. </p> <p>But that is a medium and long-term challenge helped by public investment in transport and education. Right now, profit warnings are on the increase, the election is near and it is essential to retain business confidence. </p> <p>The Chancellor may rule out a return to the old short- termism, but perhaps this week will see the emergence of a politically expedient 'new' short-termism. </p> <p><strong>The CBI's wish list</strong><br>\u0095 Tax cuts of up to \u00a33bn to ease rising business costs </p> <p> \u0095 Slash red tape </p> <p> \u0095 Improve consultation on tax changes </p> <p> \u0095 Lower cost to business of road transport before next Budget </p> <p> \u0095 Reconsider National Insurance on unapproved share options </p> <p><strong>TUC</strong><br>\u0095 Pensions, not petrol </p> <p> \u0095 Increase in basic state pension </p> <p> \u0095 Age-related supplement for over-75s </p> <p> \u0095 Regional manufacturing aid fund, similar to the \u00a31.6bn agriculture fund </p> <p> \u0095 No justification for across-the-board tax cuts </p> <p><strong>IoD</strong><br>\u0095 Lighten tax and regulatory load on business </p> <p> \u0095 Abandon plans for Employment tax credit </p> <p> \u0095 1p a litre cut in fuel duties </p> <p> \u0095 A cap on the the tax/GDP ratio </p> <p>\u0095 Maintain fiscal prudence </p> <p><strong>Computer and Software Services Association</strong><br>\u0095 Review National Insurance on unapproved share options </p> <p> \u0095 Expand and simplify approved share-option schemes </p> <p> \u0095 Reform IR35 to protect solo contractors </p> <p><strong>Assorted fuel lobbies and hauliers</strong><br>\u0095 26p off fuel duty, but would settle for 15p </p> <p> \u0095 Reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty </p> <p> \u0095 Foreign hauliers to pay special tax for using UK roads </p> <p><strong>National Pensioners' Convention</strong><br>\u0095 Substantial increase in the basic state pension to make up for the \u00a330 a week that pensioners have lost since the earnings link was abolished in 1980 </p> <p> \u0095 Restoration of the earnings link</p>",

All it needed was a period of strong economic growth to boost the cyclical position - through lower unemployment and other benefit costs and a higher tax take - for people to start talking the way they did in 1987 and 1988.

But mindful of 1987-88 - when Balls maintains that people were deluded into believing the trend rate of growth was 3.5-4 per cent - the Treasury is sticking with caution. </p> <p>The revolt against ever higher fuel taxes provides an example of why, whatever the underlying growth rate, the Treasury should also be cautious about assuming revenue buoyancy can continue. Quieter rebellions against duty on tobacco and alcohol also provide a warning. </p> <p>But the most important reason of all for caution in the forthcoming Budget lies in the Government's own spending plans. Having earned a reputation for 'credibility' that has eluded most previous Labour governments, it now wants to do all those things with schools, hospitals and railways that it was elected to do. Public spending is already budgeted to rise at well above any conceivable growth rate of productivity, as feast follows famine; and, on present plans, the budget surplus will disappear completely within three years or so. </p> <p>The announcement of these plans earlier this year was enough to frighten a number of City commentators, who forecast that inter est rates could rise as a direct consequence of the spending plans. In practice the Chancellor is in no position to 'spend' a surplus of \u00a315bn. on the lines being speculated about. With the economy approaching full employment and concern mounting about possible inflationary pressures, the Chancellor will not wish to be interpreted as having given a boost to demand in the forthcoming Budget. </p> <p>The official forecasts to be published on Wednesday are expected to show a slowing in the growth of gross domestic product from 2.75-3.25 per cent this year to 2.25-2.75 per cent in 2001. This will hardly sound any alarm bells in the City; but a \u00a315bn boost to demand on top certainly would. </p> <p>This said, the Chancellor is still in a remarkably comfortable position, in which he could stick to his spending plans and knock 1p off income tax (at a cost of less than \u00a33bn) without frightening the horses. In this respect shadow chancellor Michael Portillo has been clever in drawing attention to the fact that a choice could open up in future years between devoting quite so much to extra public spending, and combining less public spending with income tax cuts. </p> <p>Labour strategists are, as usual, somewhat ambiguous.

The truth is that, with oil tax revenues \u00a32bn higher than expected, 'targeted' concessions to the fuel lobby can be made painlessly. </p> <p>The real problem is that so far the Government has failed to get across the strong environmental and practical reasons why caving in to protesters would be a mistake - this Government is not as 'joined up' as it would have us think.

      "body": "<p>When NewsCorp officials gathered in the Hong Kong convention centre last March to unveil their latest Chinese internet investment, a tall woman handed out a business card that read 'News Corporation/Wendi Deng Murdoch'. </p> <p>Deng is not a NewsCorp employee. Once a junior executive at the company's Star TV in Hong Kong, Deng, 31, quit her post before marrying NewsCorp chairman Rupert Murdoch last year. Since then, she has been portrayed - by Murdoch and the company - as a traditional housewife who attends to decorating, her husband's diet and the like. </p> <p>But Deng is no homebody. Though she doesn't have a formal position with her husband's media empire, she has quickly asserted her influence over NewsCorp's operations and investments in Asia, its most important growth market. </p> <p>Working with her stepson, James Murdoch, 27, Deng has initiated or advocated Chinese internet investments totalling between $35 million and $45m, according to a top NewsCorp executive. With her advice, the company has also formed partnerships with cable companies in the region looking to upgrade their systems for high-speed video and internet access. </p> <p>Murdoch, who is 69, has never hesitated to put family members to work in his businesses. Last month, he named his eldest son, Lachlan, 29, deputy chief operating officer, in a move partly aimed at clarifying that he is his father's heir. James serves as chief executive of Star TV and has carved out Asia and the internet as his province. Even Murdoch's ex-wife, Anna Mann, whom he divorced last year, has an office and assistant at NewsCorp's New York offices, although she no longer has an active role with the company. </p> <p>Now, Deng is rising to a place of prominence in the family business. </p> <p>People within NewsCorp and outsiders involved in the Chinese internet and media industries say she identifies potential investments for her husband's company and acts as his liaison and translator in China. </p> <p>These people say Deng is well suited for this unusual role. The daughter of a factory director in Guangzhou, China, Deng came to the US 12 years ago with the aid of a California couple. The husband in that couple later left his wife for Deng. She mastered English, climbed from a California college to Yale's business school and eventually landed at Star TV in Hong Kong. </p> <p>Having left China in obscurity as a teenager, Deng is now returning in grand style, as the wife and adviser of a global media baron. </p> <p>'Wendi gives NewsCorp a Chinese face in China,' says Joseph Ravitch, co-head of the global media practice at Goldman Sachs Group, which advises NewsCorp on its Asia strategy. 'She represents not just the company but the owner, and that's critical in a country where families are very important.' </p> <p>Murdoch has long been fascinated by the potential of the Chinese market, and his Fox studio was a pioneer in the country. But at times, he has seemed to lack the feel for subtleties his wife is said to have. In 1993, shortly after he acquired control of Star TV, Murdoch made a still-notorious remark that satellite TV would prove 'an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere'. China immediately retaliated by banning private ownership of satellite dishes. Reception by private households of Star TV and its affiliate, Phoenix Satellite Television, remains illegal in China, though many cable operators and residential compounds defy the ban and carry the channels. </p> <p>Murdoch gradually repaired relations with the Chinese. He pulled the BBC from Star TV, making the channel more palatable to the Beijing government. He sold the South China Morning Post to a pro-Beijing businessman. And at his behest, NewsCorp's HarperCollins publishing unit killed a book contract with the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten. Today, NewsCorp's officially restricted Phoenix channel is a favourite among urban Chinese households, and the company has greater access to the mainland market than any of its competitors. </p> <p>With the exception of an odd mention in the newspaper gossip pages or a glossy magazine photo spread, Deng has stayed out of the public eye. She accompanies Murdoch on his worldwide jaunts and stayed at his side when he received prostate cancer treatment last summer. </p> <p>Shortly after they were married in June 1999, Murdoch told Vanity Fair magazine that his relationship with his new wife precluded her from working for NewsCorp. Instead Deng was 'busy working on decorating the new apartment' in Manhattan. He said his bride, a graduate of the Yale School of Management, was 'a bit frustrated' by the narrow scope of her activities, adding, 'We'll just have to resolve that somehow'. </p> <p>The resolution has taken Deng far beyond choosing upholstery. She has become a de facto diplomat on behalf of NewsCorp in China, a country where good relations with government officials is critical to success. Over the past year, she has met with politicians from President Jiang Zemin down. In one of her few answers to written questions, Deng said she had met the Chinese president only at large gatherings on 'formal occasions'. Deng also said she hadn't initiated any meetings with 'top level' Chinese government officials. </p> <p>In recent months, Deng has appeared with increasing frequency at the side of her husband and stepson James in NewsCorp business meetings. She sometimes intervenes to smooth over potentially awkward situations. In March, for example, she and the father-and-son Murdoch team met a well-connected Chinese businessman in Shanghai, in the hope of advancing NewsCorp's push into the Chinese TV market. The meeting got off to an uncomfortable start, at least partly because of the language barrier between the Murdoch men and their host, according to a participant. But Deng used her bilingual fluency to put everyone at ease,. </p> <p>Deng has become deeply involved in the company's analysis and negotiation of business transactions in China, according to people who have dealt extensively with NewsCorp. Entrepreneurs trying to interest the company in their ideas often go first to Deng, according to a person close to NewsCorp She has told this person she sometimes receives more than 100 emails a day from Chinese people with business proposals. She sometimes meets entrepreneurs at NewsCorp's offices in Beijing or at one of the city's business- gathering spots, such as the St Regis bar. </p> <p>NewsCorp executives say that among the deals Deng has helped forge is a recent multimillion-dollar company investment in Netease.com, one of the most popular web portals that target the mainland. Earlier this year, she worked with James Murdoch to negotiate NewsCorp's investment of more than $10m in the Chinese-language internet company renren.com, according to Anthony Cheng, founder of the website. Cheng recalls that at one meeting about renren.com, Deng displayed her deep involvement when she grilled him on the difference between the site's marketing strategies in Beijing and Shanghai. She calls him with ideas from time to time on how to improve his company, Cheng adds. 'She's very keyed into all the News Corp and Star TV properties and how to better link them,' he says. </p> <p>Deng initiated News Corp's investment last December in SinoBIT.com, a Beijing website that seeks to link entrepreneurs to investors online, according to Steve Sun, the site's co-founder. She did so by introducing Sun, whom she knew through mutual friends from Yale, to James Murdoch, Sun says. At the same time, people who have done business with Deng say she appears to take great pains not to overstep her unofficial role. Sun notes, for example, that she didn't attend a second meeting between him and James Murdoch, at which the terms of the investment in SinoBIT.com were finalised. 'She gave James the right to make the decision,' Sun says. </p> <p>Deng hasn't neglected the business of minding Murdoch, who has undergone the kind of change in appearance often associated with a man's marrying a much younger wife. </p> <p>Murdoch for decades preferred establishment addresses such as New York's Upper East Side and Bel Air in Los Angeles. But after remarrying, he and Deng set up home in Manhattan's trendy SoHo district, a few blocks from the apartment of Murdoch's son, Lachlan. Known for his British-style double-breasted business suits, the older Murdoch started sporting black turtlenecks. NewsCorp executives say that sometimes he even forgoes a tie at the office, once unthinkable. He told Vanity Fair he is pumping iron with a personal trainer at 6am and downing a morning concoction of fruit and soy protein. </p> <p>When Deng began appearing at Murdoch's side about two years ago, NewsCorp executives wondered where she had come from and how she got there. They knew nothing about her other than that she joined Star TV as an intern in 1996, shortly after obtaining an MBA from Yale. Deng herself hasn't commented in the press about her background. </p> <p>Born Deng Wen Di, in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou, her parents later moved to the southern city of Guangzhou. Deng was the family name. She later compressed her Chinese first name into 'Wendi'. Deng's father served as director of a machinery factory in Guangzhou. The family lived in a three-bedroom apartment, unusually large by Chinese standards. Wendi Deng has two sisters and one brother. A good student and champion volleyball player, Deng had enrolled in Guangzhou Medical College by the age of 16. </p> <p>Her ticket out of China came in 1987, when she met a Los Angeles couple, Jake and Joyce Cherry. Cherry, then 50, was working in Guangzhou, helping the Chinese to build a factory to make freezers for food-processing plants. The Cherrys' interpreter told them of a young woman who was looking for help with her English. Joyce Cherry, then 42, says she began tutoring the teenager. In the fall of 1987, Joyce Cherry returned to Los Angeles to enrol her two children in elementary school. Cherry stayed in China to finish the factory project. </p> <p>Soon after Joyce Cherry was resettled in Los Angeles, she says, her husband called to say that Deng wanted to come to the US to study. He asked Joyce Cherry to help complete the paperwork and get an application ready for a local college. The Cherrys sponsored Deng's bid for a student visa and agreed to put her up until she had established herself. The 19-year-old arrived at the Cherry home in February of 1988. She shared a bedroom and bunk beds with her hosts' five-year-old daughter. </p> <p>All was not well, however, between the elder Cherrys. Cherry, who arrived home shortly after Deng came to California, had grown physically ill in China from a combination of overwork and poor diet. The spouses' separation had strained the marriage, the Cherrys concur. At the same time, Joyce says she had grown increasingly suspicious about Deng's relationship with her husband. She recalls discovering photographs her husband had taken of Deng in coquettish poses in his hotel room in Guangzhou. Cherry confirms he became infatuated with the young woman. Once they were in Los Angeles, he says, Deng started making recommendations about his diet and wardrobe. </p> <p>When her husband and Deng didn't return home some evenings, Joyce says she concluded they were having an affair. She told Deng to leave, and Cherry left soon afterwards. He moved into a nearby apartment with Deng, who had enrolled at California State University at Northridge, a commuter college in the San Fernando Valley. </p> <p>The Cherrys divorced, and Cherry married Deng in February 1990. But that union didn't last. Cherry says that about four months after the wedding, he told Deng to leave because she had started spending time with a man named David Wolf. Cherry was 53 at the time. Wolf was in his mid-twenties, only a few years older than Deng. Wolf, who declined interview requests, worked in the early Nineties for an import-export company. He spoke some Chinese and was interested in a career in China, according to someone who knew him. </p> <p>Cherry says he and Deng were briefly reconciled at one point, but they split up for good when it became clear she was continuing to see Wolf. 'She told me I was a father concept to her, and it would never be anything else,' Cherry recalls. 'I loved that girl.' </p> <p>Divorce records filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court show that the Cherry-Deng marriage lasted two years and seven months. That was seven months longer than what was required for Deng to obtain a green card, allowing her permanently to live and work in the US as a resident alien. Cherry says he and Deng actually lived together for 'four to five months, at the most'. They haven't spoken since 1996, he adds. </p> <p>During the early Nineties when she was married to Cherry, and for a time after that, Deng on some occasions introduced the tall, well-dressed Wolf as her husband, according to people who knew Deng. Ken Chapman, a California State economics professor, recalls that the last time he saw his former student, in 1995, she handed him Wolf's business card and said she could be reached through her 'husband'. At 5'10\" herself, Deng and Wolf made a striking couple, according to people who knew them. They shared several addresses during the Nineties and told friends that they had met in China, when Wolf had been there on business. </p> <p>For a time in the early Nineties, the couple worked at a suburban Los Angeles gymnastics academy operated by Li Ning, a Chinese three-times Olympics gold medallist. Deng served as a liaison between the gym's Chinese coaching staff and parents of the school-age clientele; Wolf, as the gym's general manager. Today, Wolf works as a director in the Beijing office of Burson-Marsteller, a large PR firm. </p> <p>In 1996, Deng graduated from Yale and began looking for a job. Through a friend, she met Bruce Churchill, who then oversaw finance and corporate development at NewsCorp's Fox TV unit in Los Angeles. She lacked experience in the entertainment industry, but had an Ivy League business degree and was fluent in English and Mandarin, attributes of particular value to News Corp's struggling Asian satellite service, Star TV. Churchill, who was on his way to Star TV as deputy chief executive, offered Deng an internship in Hong Kong. That grew into a full-time job. </p> <p>Even though Deng was a relatively junior employee, she took an active role in planning Star TV's activities in Hong Kong and China, according to former NewsCorp colleagues. She helped build distribution in China for its Channel V music channel, for example, and explored interactive TV opportunities for the company's News Digital Systems arm. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch frequently talks to NewsCorp's business development executives around the globe, so it isn't surprising that one day he would cross paths with Deng.

Star TV's then-chairman, Gareth Chang, told Murdoch at the time that it was a bad idea for Deng to remain on staff, given her personal relationship with the parent company's chairman.

      "bodyText": "When NewsCorp officials gathered in the Hong Kong convention centre last March to unveil their latest Chinese internet investment, a tall woman handed out a business card that read 'News Corporation/Wendi Deng Murdoch'. Deng is not a NewsCorp employee. Once a junior executive at the company's Star TV in Hong Kong, Deng, 31, quit her post before marrying NewsCorp chairman Rupert Murdoch last year. Since then, she has been portrayed - by Murdoch and the company - as a traditional housewife who attends to decorating, her husband's diet and the like. But Deng is no homebody. Though she doesn't have a formal position with her husband's media empire, she has quickly asserted her influence over NewsCorp's operations and investments in Asia, its most important growth market. Working with her stepson, James Murdoch, 27, Deng has initiated or advocated Chinese internet investments totalling between $35 million and $45m, according to a top NewsCorp executive. With her advice, the company has also formed partnerships with cable companies in the region looking to upgrade their systems for high-speed video and internet access. Murdoch, who is 69, has never hesitated to put family members to work in his businesses. Last month, he named his eldest son, Lachlan, 29, deputy chief operating officer, in a move partly aimed at clarifying that he is his father's heir. James serves as chief executive of Star TV and has carved out Asia and the internet as his province. Even Murdoch's ex-wife, Anna Mann, whom he divorced last year, has an office and assistant at NewsCorp's New York offices, although she no longer has an active role with the company. Now, Deng is rising to a place of prominence in the family business. People within NewsCorp and outsiders involved in the Chinese internet and media industries say she identifies potential investments for her husband's company and acts as his liaison and translator in China. These people say Deng is well suited for this unusual role. The daughter of a factory director in Guangzhou, China, Deng came to the US 12 years ago with the aid of a California couple. The husband in that couple later left his wife for Deng. She mastered English, climbed from a California college to Yale's business school and eventually landed at Star TV in Hong Kong. Having left China in obscurity as a teenager, Deng is now returning in grand style, as the wife and adviser of a global media baron. 'Wendi gives NewsCorp a Chinese face in China,' says Joseph Ravitch, co-head of the global media practice at Goldman Sachs Group, which advises NewsCorp on its Asia strategy. 'She represents not just the company but the owner, and that's critical in a country where families are very important.' Murdoch has long been fascinated by the potential of the Chinese market, and his Fox studio was a pioneer in the country. But at times, he has seemed to lack the feel for subtleties his wife is said to have. In 1993, shortly after he acquired control of Star TV, Murdoch made a still-notorious remark that satellite TV would prove 'an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere'. China immediately retaliated by banning private ownership of satellite dishes. Reception by private households of Star TV and its affiliate, Phoenix Satellite Television, remains illegal in China, though many cable operators and residential compounds defy the ban and carry the channels. Murdoch gradually repaired relations with the Chinese. He pulled the BBC from Star TV, making the channel more palatable to the Beijing government. He sold the South China Morning Post to a pro-Beijing businessman. And at his behest, NewsCorp's HarperCollins publishing unit killed a book contract with the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten. Today, NewsCorp's officially restricted Phoenix channel is a favourite among urban Chinese households, and the company has greater access to the mainland market than any of its competitors. With the exception of an odd mention in the newspaper gossip pages or a glossy magazine photo spread, Deng has stayed out of the public eye. She accompanies Murdoch on his worldwide jaunts and stayed at his side when he received prostate cancer treatment last summer. Shortly after they were married in June 1999, Murdoch told Vanity Fair magazine that his relationship with his new wife precluded her from working for NewsCorp. Instead Deng was 'busy working on decorating the new apartment' in Manhattan. He said his bride, a graduate of the Yale School of Management, was 'a bit frustrated' by the narrow scope of her activities, adding, 'We'll just have to resolve that somehow'. The resolution has taken Deng far beyond choosing upholstery. She has become a de facto diplomat on behalf of NewsCorp in China, a country where good relations with government officials is critical to success. Over the past year, she has met with politicians from President Jiang Zemin down. In one of her few answers to written questions, Deng said she had met the Chinese president only at large gatherings on 'formal occasions'. Deng also said she hadn't initiated any meetings with 'top level' Chinese government officials. In recent months, Deng has appeared with increasing frequency at the side of her husband and stepson James in NewsCorp business meetings. She sometimes intervenes to smooth over potentially awkward situations. In March, for example, she and the father-and-son Murdoch team met a well-connected Chinese businessman in Shanghai, in the hope of advancing NewsCorp's push into the Chinese TV market. The meeting got off to an uncomfortable start, at least partly because of the language barrier between the Murdoch men and their host, according to a participant. But Deng used her bilingual fluency to put everyone at ease,. Deng has become deeply involved in the company's analysis and negotiation of business transactions in China, according to people who have dealt extensively with NewsCorp. Entrepreneurs trying to interest the company in their ideas often go first to Deng, according to a person close to NewsCorp She has told this person she sometimes receives more than 100 emails a day from Chinese people with business proposals. She sometimes meets entrepreneurs at NewsCorp's offices in Beijing or at one of the city's business- gathering spots, such as the St Regis bar. NewsCorp executives say that among the deals Deng has helped forge is a recent multimillion-dollar company investment in Netease.com, one of the most popular web portals that target the mainland. Earlier this year, she worked with James Murdoch to negotiate NewsCorp's investment of more than $10m in the Chinese-language internet company renren.com, according to Anthony Cheng, founder of the website. Cheng recalls that at one meeting about renren.com, Deng displayed her deep involvement when she grilled him on the difference between the site's marketing strategies in Beijing and Shanghai. She calls him with ideas from time to time on how to improve his company, Cheng adds. 'She's very keyed into all the News Corp and Star TV properties and how to better link them,' he says. Deng initiated News Corp's investment last December in SinoBIT.com, a Beijing website that seeks to link entrepreneurs to investors online, according to Steve Sun, the site's co-founder. She did so by introducing Sun, whom she knew through mutual friends from Yale, to James Murdoch, Sun says. At the same time, people who have done business with Deng say she appears to take great pains not to overstep her unofficial role. Sun notes, for example, that she didn't attend a second meeting between him and James Murdoch, at which the terms of the investment in SinoBIT.com were finalised. 'She gave James the right to make the decision,' Sun says. Deng hasn't neglected the business of minding Murdoch, who has undergone the kind of change in appearance often associated with a man's marrying a much younger wife. Murdoch for decades preferred establishment addresses such as New York's Upper East Side and Bel Air in Los Angeles. But after remarrying, he and Deng set up home in Manhattan's trendy SoHo district, a few blocks from the apartment of Murdoch's son, Lachlan. Known for his British-style double-breasted business suits, the older Murdoch started sporting black turtlenecks. NewsCorp executives say that sometimes he even forgoes a tie at the office, once unthinkable. He told Vanity Fair he is pumping iron with a personal trainer at 6am and downing a morning concoction of fruit and soy protein. When Deng began appearing at Murdoch's side about two years ago, NewsCorp executives wondered where she had come from and how she got there. They knew nothing about her other than that she joined Star TV as an intern in 1996, shortly after obtaining an MBA from Yale. Deng herself hasn't commented in the press about her background. Born Deng Wen Di, in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou, her parents later moved to the southern city of Guangzhou. Deng was the family name. She later compressed her Chinese first name into 'Wendi'. Deng's father served as director of a machinery factory in Guangzhou. The family lived in a three-bedroom apartment, unusually large by Chinese standards. Wendi Deng has two sisters and one brother. A good student and champion volleyball player, Deng had enrolled in Guangzhou Medical College by the age of 16. Her ticket out of China came in 1987, when she met a Los Angeles couple, Jake and Joyce Cherry. Cherry, then 50, was working in Guangzhou, helping the Chinese to build a factory to make freezers for food-processing plants. The Cherrys' interpreter told them of a young woman who was looking for help with her English. Joyce Cherry, then 42, says she began tutoring the teenager. In the fall of 1987, Joyce Cherry returned to Los Angeles to enrol her two children in elementary school. Cherry stayed in China to finish the factory project. Soon after Joyce Cherry was resettled in Los Angeles, she says, her husband called to say that Deng wanted to come to the US to study. He asked Joyce Cherry to help complete the paperwork and get an application ready for a local college. The Cherrys sponsored Deng's bid for a student visa and agreed to put her up until she had established herself. The 19-year-old arrived at the Cherry home in February of 1988. She shared a bedroom and bunk beds with her hosts' five-year-old daughter. All was not well, however, between the elder Cherrys. Cherry, who arrived home shortly after Deng came to California, had grown physically ill in China from a combination of overwork and poor diet. The spouses' separation had strained the marriage, the Cherrys concur. At the same time, Joyce says she had grown increasingly suspicious about Deng's relationship with her husband.

Whitbread's other big name restaurant chain, TGI Friday's, reported half year profits down 6 per cent on the previous year. Last Thursday it was revealed that Pizza Express was considering a hostile bid for City Centre Restaurants, which has seen its share price collapse following a profits warning. Pessimists in this sector might be forgiven for interpreting the welter of bad news as proof that good times do not lie ahead. The simple fact is that there are just too many restaurants for too few people. A shake-out could be on the cards.",

      "body": "<p>To ensure Britain's homes are watertight and its transport system trouble-free during future floods will cost billions of pounds, leading civil engineers and water managers are warning. </p> <p>Years of under-investment and short-term profiteering by the big housebuilders, rail companies and local councils have left Britain unable to deal with extreme weather. </p> <p>And we will have to play a massive game of catch-up if flood defences are to be sufficiently robust. </p> <p>\u2022 Roads may have to be dug up to fit drainage suction pumps which should have been installed when they were first built. </p> <p>\u2022 Tens of millions of pounds will have be spent shoring up electricity pylons and overhead electrical rail cables. </p> <p>\u2022 A major redesign of housebuilding methods could cost up to \u00a3150 million per year, adding thousands to the price of a new home. </p> <p>\u2022 Additional safety measures for tall buildings will also be introduced, adding to the rent burden of UK businesses. </p> <p>Of course, sceptics argue that five years ago droughts forced the water industry to consider piping water to eastern parts of Britain which were suffering severe shortages. Wait another five years and droughts will be back, they say. </p> <p>But a growing body of scientific evidence, culminating last Wednesday in a detailed European Commission report, suggests the effects in Britain of global warming will mean more sustained bursts of intense rainfall. So what are we going to do about it and how much will it cost? </p> <p>The Government's first move will be to restrict the building of new homes on flood plains. Possibly too little, too late. </p> <p>The Environment Agency (EA), which claims it is \u00a3100m million a year underfunded, says that there are 1.8m homes and 135,000 commercial premises in Britain built on flood plains. These are worth \u00a335 billion and were built mainly in the Seventies and Eighties. Of the four million new homes likely to be built by 2016, it is estimated that a quarter are zoned for flood plains. </p> <p>For example, up to 20,000 new homes are planned south-east of Ashford, Kent, close to the River Stour. This is an attractive location, but pressure is already on to get those homes shifted away from what is a hazardous area. </p> <p>'When I saw the site, I thought, \"Bloody hell, that's the last thing we want\",' said Geoff Mance, director of water management at the EA. In addition, many of the 33,000 homes that are planned in Sussex could be at risk. </p> <p>But a new planning policy guidance note from the Department of the Environment, likely to be issued within four months, will not ban flood plain development outright. Housebuilders have successfully argued that this would force up the price of land in risk-free areas at a time when the housing market has been rocketing for four years. In addition, pressure for new homes is intense, particularly in the flood-risk area of the South East. </p> <p>'A permanent ban of flood plain development might inhibit long-term alleviation methods,' argued Roger Lewis, director of the Berkeley Group, a leading housebuilder. Suggested 'alleviation methods' centre on the design of homes. These include the use of masonry walls instead of plasterboard which is cheaper but turns to mush when flooded. </p> <p>Homes may also have to use ground floors as storage space and lofts as living space. This will also offer better heat efficiency. Suspended floors allowing water to flood harmlessly under homes are also suggested. </p> <p>All new housing developments may soon have porous pavements and drives allowing rainwater to escape. Balancing ponds, which effectively catch rainwater, are increasingly a landscaped feature in new developments. </p> <p>'These techniques all make sense but they will add over \u00a310,000 to the price of an average house. It is a question of how much of this builders will pass on to the end-user,' said one senior executive of a mass volume housebuilder. </p> <p>'The trouble is we can't be totally sure that this intense weather is here to stay. What will force our hand is if insurers put premiums out of the reach of housebuilders unless we adopt these measures.' </p> <p>If new construction methods cost \u00a310,000 a house, a rough cost to housebuilders would be \u00a31.5bn a year, since there are more than 150,000 new homes built each year. </p> <p>For offices, particularly converted warehouses by rivers, the agency suggests placing canteens, meeting rooms or reception on the ground floor and basement. </p> <p>'Telephone switchboards, boilers and computers should be upstairs,' said the EA's Mance. 'We're trying to get the Government to include these suggestions in new building regulations. The idea is that if a business gets flooded it can start up again quickly.' </p> <p>The real battle to be fought, though, is to ensure that Britain's coasts and rivers have strong enough defences to withstand intense rainfall without compromising the environment. </p> <p>Today, \u00a3250m a year is spent on flood defence by the EA, which is funded by local councils as well as the Government. Despite a \u00a310m increase for three years starting next year, the agency is still underfunded. This is mainly because local authorities do not always pay into EA's pot. </p> <p>Flood Minister Elliot Morley said the situation was particularly bad in the South West: 'The Government is considering ring-fencing local authority money for flood defence.' </p> <p>The technology to counter flooding has not really changed for centuries: flood walls made either from concrete or soil are the main weapon. These suffer from seepage if not maintained and concrete walls also damage water ecology. </p> <p>To control water levels on rivers, sluices or low-lying dams are used to keep water back. But this can cause a build-up of water upstream. </p> <p>Similar methods are used to protect our coasts with defences generally made of sand or shingle. These will have to be taller. Creating beaches, which help to dissipate the effects of high tides, may have to be considered. </p> <p>'It's impossible to say how much the creating of new flood walls and their maintenance will cost,' said Terry Oakes, a leading independent consultant in water management. 'The industry has been pressing the Government for more money for a number of years. The new money announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review is not sufficient and there is a 12-month lead time. </p> <p>'Ministers' top priority is to prevent loss of life rather than avoiding flooding in the first place.' </p> <p>Britain's sewerage system - also the means by which urban floodwater is drained - is the responsibility of the privatised water industry and in need of urgent overhaul. Many sewers are more than 100 years old and will cost tens of millions to upgrade. </p> <p>To ensure Britain's rail network does not grind to a halt following strong winds and flooding would cost billions of pounds. Apart from unacceptable amounts of tree clearance, wholesale rewiring of the electrified network would be needed. This is out of the question. </p> <p>Instead, basic measures to shore up overhead rail cables in vulnerable areas, particularly on the East Coast mainline which is said to have been built on the cheap, would cost about \u00a320m, say transport experts. </p> <p>Critics say the road network has clearly been unable to cope with the weather of the last three weeks. Major roads built recently should have had drainage suction pumps underneath but these have been cut to save money. In any case, some roads with them failed to drain in last week's crisis. One transport expert said a suction pump that failed last week on London's North Circular Road had been checked just six weeks ago. </p> <p>Meanwhile, local authorities, starved of cash, have not been able to invest in suction-tank lorries. 'Where are these lorries?' said one South West councillor. 'We haven't got one. It's a legacy of the relentless financial pressure we're under. We can't justify servicing a machine we may only use once every 10 years.' </p> <p>If, despite the wringing of hands and purposeful Government rhetoric, there isn't even the cash for the occasional lorry, what chance is there of any other remedies? </p> <p><strong>Stormy weather - counting the cost of the deluge</strong></p> <p> * Last week's flood, which has swamped more than 3,000 homes, is now more extensive than the great flood of 1947 - the most devastating of recent times - when 750,000 acres were affected </p> <p>* The Meteorological Office has indicated that the UK is likely to face more intense storms </p> <p>* Insurance premiums may rise in flood-risk areas </p> <p>* Insurers have warned that householders in high-risk areas may be refused cover unless flood measures are implemented </p> <p>* Weather-related claims cost the insurance industry \u00a3860m last year </p> <p>* The insurance bill for this storm is estimated at \u00a3500m </p> <p>* Train operators are losing \u00a32m a day in income from fewer travellers and compensation payouts </p> <p>* Five million people live in flood-risk areas in England and Wales </p> <p>* Before the recent deluge 25 people in the UK had died in 30 separate flooding incidents during the past two years </p> <p>* The Environment Agency's Floodline is 0845 9881188</p>",

Instead, basic measures to shore up overhead rail cables in vulnerable areas, particularly on the East Coast mainline which is said to have been built on the cheap, would cost about \u00a320m, say transport experts. Critics say the road network has clearly been unable to cope with the weather of the last three weeks. Major roads built recently should have had drainage suction pumps underneath but these have been cut to save money. In any case, some roads with them failed to drain in last week's crisis. One transport expert said a suction pump that failed last week on London's North Circular Road had been checked just six weeks ago. Meanwhile, local authorities, starved of cash, have not been able to invest in suction-tank lorries. 'Where are these lorries?' said one South West councillor. 'We haven't got one. It's a legacy of the relentless financial pressure we're under. We can't justify servicing a machine we may only use once every 10 years.' If, despite the wringing of hands and purposeful Government rhetoric, there isn't even the cash for the occasional lorry, what chance is there of any other remedies? Stormy weather - counting the cost of the deluge * Last week's flood, which has swamped more than 3,000 homes, is now more extensive than the great flood of 1947 - the most devastating of recent times - when 750,000 acres were affected * The Meteorological Office has indicated that the UK is likely to face more intense storms * Insurance premiums may rise in flood-risk areas * Insurers have warned that householders in high-risk areas may be refused cover unless flood measures are implemented * Weather-related claims cost the insurance industry \u00a3860m last year * The insurance bill for this storm is estimated at \u00a3500m * Train operators are losing \u00a32m a day in income from fewer travellers and compensation payouts * Five million people live in flood-risk areas in England and Wales * Before the recent deluge 25 people in the UK had died in 30 separate flooding incidents during the past two years * The Environment Agency's Floodline is 0845 9881188",

      "body": "<p>Abbey National faces a humiliating defeat in its ambitions to woo the City into backing a hostile \u00a310 billion bid for Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>This week Abbey chief executive Ian Harley intends to do the City rounds after BoS rebuffed a takeover approach when word of talks dramatically leaked last Friday. </p> <p>The discussions have now put both banks firmly in play. This weekend Lloyds TSB is dusting off contingency plans for an Abbey bid after being rebuffed by Harley a year ago. </p> <p>Lloyds TSB chief Peter Ellwood can take his pick of massive City firepower, including advisers from Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan, who it has used before. </p> <p>Barclays is also among rivals now running the slide rule over BoS. It has held merger talks with the Scots firm before: it tried to recruit BoS chief executive Peter Burt before poaching Canadian banker Matt Barrett. </p> <p>A 'Pacman' defence by BoS, launching a hostile merger with Abbey, is also possible, bankers said. 'If Abbey thinks it's in the driving seat because it's bigger, it's naive,' one City banker said. 'It's not about size, but quality of management. If the City wants this deal, Harley may find himself dethroned.' </p> <p>Last year BoS lost a \u00a324bn bid for NatWest to rival Royal Bank of Scotland, but Burt emerged with his reputation intact. Harley, however, has been under intense pressure to do a deal after turning away approaches by Lloyds TSB, Barclays and, most recently, BoS itself. </p> <p>'The logic of an Abbey/BoS merger is still there,' one of the most powerful City fund managers said this weekend. 'The question is what makes Abbey think it can run the show better than BoS?' </p> <p>Another fund manager said: 'There's no way Harley can seriously contemplate going hostile for Abbey.

      "bodyText": "Abbey National faces a humiliating defeat in its ambitions to woo the City into backing a hostile \u00a310 billion bid for Bank of Scotland. This week Abbey chief executive Ian Harley intends to do the City rounds after BoS rebuffed a takeover approach when word of talks dramatically leaked last Friday. The discussions have now put both banks firmly in play. This weekend Lloyds TSB is dusting off contingency plans for an Abbey bid after being rebuffed by Harley a year ago. Lloyds TSB chief Peter Ellwood can take his pick of massive City firepower, including advisers from Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan, who it has used before. Barclays is also among rivals now running the slide rule over BoS. It has held merger talks with the Scots firm before: it tried to recruit BoS chief executive Peter Burt before poaching Canadian banker Matt Barrett. A 'Pacman' defence by BoS, launching a hostile merger with Abbey, is also possible, bankers said. 'If Abbey thinks it's in the driving seat because it's bigger, it's naive,' one City banker said. 'It's not about size, but quality of management. If the City wants this deal, Harley may find himself dethroned.' Last year BoS lost a \u00a324bn bid for NatWest to rival Royal Bank of Scotland, but Burt emerged with his reputation intact. Harley, however, has been under intense pressure to do a deal after turning away approaches by Lloyds TSB, Barclays and, most recently, BoS itself. 'The logic of an Abbey/BoS merger is still there,' one of the most powerful City fund managers said this weekend. 'The question is what makes Abbey think it can run the show better than BoS?' Another fund manager said: 'There's no way Harley can seriously contemplate going hostile for Abbey. The City just won't wear it.' On Friday, BoS's shares ended up 18p at 692p, while Abbey's leapt 74p to 1,042p. The market reaction suggests Harley has seriously miscalculated by turning aggressive, analysts said. BoS first approached Abbey in June with proposals for a Burt-led merger, but talks went nowhere. Instead, Abbey snapped up mutual insurer Scottish Provident in its biggest deal to date. Following a report in The Observer in September, citing City pressure to pull off a deal, Harley complained of a 'whispering campaign' and insisted that Abbey had an independent future. Secretly, however, at a board meeting before its autumn trading statement on 24 October, Abbey was preparing to turn the tables on BoS with a takeover approach putting Harley at the helm. The deal was spurned by BoS governor Sir John Shaw and Abbey chairman Lord Tugendhat at a meeting 10 days ago, but talks continued last week. This weekend Abbey said it would be seeking further talks. BoS sources indicated that they were pursuing 'alternative opportunities'; they declined to elaborate.",

On Sunday night, for example, as the nation tied Toto to a door handle and dug out that pair of ruby slippers last worn in autumn 1987, Channel 4 devoted an hour-and-a-half to the horrors of working at Leeds City Council's One Stop Shop, where 14 per cent of the workforce were diagnosed as suffering from something close to clinical depression.</p> <p>Like a latter-day Kingdom of Oz, the modern front office was awash with chirpy mission statements while the backroom resembled a set from Terry Gilliam's Brazil: wonky filing-cabinets in battleship grey and lighting that allowed even the perkiest of personnel to assume the pallor of the recently deceased. But, happily, after administering a Poppins-ish dose of flip-charts, questionnaires and sugar-coated homilies, a pair of stress-management gurus managed to drag most of the workforce back from the metaphorical window ledge.</p> <p>Even though, leaves on the line and gridlocked motorways notwithstanding, watching <strong>Stressed Out </strong>probably ensured high levels of miserablist absenteeism the following morning.</p> <p>No, on a Sunday night we don't want too much Cortisol pumping around our systems, so it was probably less disturbing to switch to BBC1's <strong>Black Bear Rescue</strong>, where Amanda Burton was to be found playing with orphaned black bear cubs in Idaho. A celebrity getting up close and personal with telegenic beasties is, I suspect, the dumbed-down future of wildlife documentaries, if only because the old-fashioned, hardcore teeth-and-claws stuff is becoming far too depressing.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, for example, in BBC2's Wild strand, we had seen hungry, tranquillised polar bears being airlifted away from their globally warmed (and therefore swiftly melting) Canadian ice-floes, followed by Rajasthani tigers dodging poachers keen to sell their aphrodisiacal penises to the Japanese. But why Amanda? Other than, perhaps, to reveal that, contrary to the evidence of every single episode of Silent Witness, she is entirely capable of smiling, preferably while stroking a big (tranquillised) bear and describing it as smelling 'piney, cosy, just like you'd expect a bear to be, really'.</p> <p>Still, Burton's ability to grin like a great big girly failed to be exploited any further in Wednesday's <strong>Little Bird</strong>, in which she was back to her old routine. If there were any Baftas for sitting pensively inside a car in the rain, Burton could expect to be nominated several times over (she even snuck a quick one into Black Bear Rescue), but in Little Bird - a turgid, ponderous, strangely unemotional drama about adoption, in which she played a social worker - Burton gave us quite a few variations on the themes of pensive, ever-so-slightly-angry and possibly-a-little-bit-sad, plus one or two completely-inscrutables, all in profile, in a car, in the rain.</p> <p>Admittedly, it wasn't Amanda's fault that this one-off ITV drama had followed hard on the heels of BBC1's riveting adoption documentary series, Love Is Not Enough, but it was unfortunate that her character, Rachel, parroted the line again. Perhaps 'Love is not enough...' is the mission statement Blu-Tacked to the walls of adoption agencies?</p> <p>In Monday's <strong>Equinox: The Science of Stress</strong>, the second of C4's 'Stop, Go Home' series, we learned that Cortisol was a very useful hormone in the days when we needed to escape from lions, but somewhat less so if you're stuck in front of a call centre's crashing computer screen. Today we live in 'a stress culture' in which 'technology is pushing us forward faster than we can adapt', which will have come as a surprise to, well, almost nobody. The only thing to do, apparently, is to 'craft a lifestyle to optimise our happiness'.</p> <p>Using actors playing a high-powered lawyer and his wife, a working mother, tips for 'optimising happiness' included chucking your mobile phone into the nearest swollen river, not accessing e-mails on planes, ignoring your boss's wholly unreasonable request to turn up for a meeting when you've just got off a long-haul flight on your wedding anniversary, and enjoying your downtime by reading a John Grisham, rather than Brad Thrust Jr's Ten Steps to Managerial Mightiness.</p> <p>Presumably, for those of us whose lives do not closely resemble a 1980s advertisement for British Airways Club Class, some homespun mission statements Blu-Tacked to the workstation may suffice: 'Work Is Not Enough', perhaps, or 'Pass The Prozac'.</p> <p>Incidentally, the latter got a brand name-check in last week's otherwise excellent <strong>Fat Friends</strong>, when one character offered another 'a Prozac, if it'll help...' Please don't try this at home, children: treating stress with 'a Prozac' would be only slightly less helpful than a shot of Paracetamol or a weekend seminar by Brad Thrust.</p> <p>Reassuring, though, to know that the show's writer, Kay Mellor, hasn't succumbed to medicated depression, which is more than can be said for most of Ruby Wax's Tuesday night dinner guests on <strong>Ruby</strong> - Roseanne, Lynda La Plante and David Baddiel, who dished up delicious dinner-party topics such as the pros and cons of anal sex and the fact that being bonkersly successful and having loads of money just doesn't make you very happy at all, really. Given the high whinge-quotient, this was still hugely entertaining, but perhaps a spoonful of medicine would help all that unpalatable sugary celebrity go down - a day optimising some latent happiness by working at Leeds City Council's One Stop Shop, for example. </p> <p>But even if you spent most of last week in a dinghy, rowing down the high street (and, incidentally, what was Steve Redgrave doing when the emergency services needed him? Announcing his retirement, that's what), moaning was not an option between the hours of 10.30 and 11.30 on Wednesday night, during <strong>Josie's Journey</strong>, in which the survivor of the brutal attack that killed her mother, Lin, and sister, Megan, revealed herself to be a refreshingly unsaintly, engagingly stroppy 13-year-old with a smile even bigger than Amanda Burton's. </p> <p>At times this was an unbearably poignant documentary, notably when Josie's father Shaun broke down at Lin and Megan's simple grave, but at others it left a slightly bitter taste. Despite a mutually beneficial 'relationship' with both the Sun and the Daily Mail (they get the Josie exclusives, the Russells get cash for her trust fund) and the savvy acknowledgement that 'a drip-drip-drip of little stories is enough to keep the media at bay...', it was also made clear by Shaun that '[Josie] is at the point of wanting to move away from further media offers' (she swiftly rejected an invitation to open a f\u00eate with a straightforward, non-negotiable and Kevin The Teenager-ish 'boring!').</p> <p> At the end of the programme, however, there was a plug for the accompanying BBC book, written by Shaun, and so one gets the feeling that, like the parents of Sarah Payne, Josie's father uses a sympathetic media, when it suits, as a balm for his indescribable loss. Josie herself had the last word, dismissing her bravery with a shrug and suggesting that, in the future, 'I'll just ask the press people to go away and leave me alone.' Nice try, Josie - but they will never leave you alone.</p> <p>Wrong channel, right time: on Thursday night, while solicitor-turned-postwoman Kate Heusser was becoming only the second contestant - and the first woman - to win \u00a3500,000 on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, I was over on BBC1, gripped while watching mild-mannered Margaret rack up a massive \u00a37,600 in last week's second edition of <strong>The Weakest Link: Champion's League</strong>. 'I've never seen a cheque like that in my life, ever...' she said, blinking like one of Wonderland's dormice. And while she could easily have gone the distance on WWTBAM , I'm not sure she would have looked any more delighted with the result. </p> <p>Incidentally, I was 'Whassuped?' three times last week (by middle-class, middle-youth, white English people. And the next one who tries it will, indeed, find out 'whassup'), but received only one 'You are the weakest link. Goodbye!' - though I fear it's still early days.</p>",

Louis Langree conducted a fervent account, played with spirit and enthusiasm by the GTO orchestra. Glyndebourne Rovers had the better team but the result of this virtual centenary rematch was a foregone conclusion: three nil to Puccini. If you've always wanted an alibi to visit Milton Keynes (Plymouth, Oxford, Stoke-on-Trent or, this week, Norwich) you'll never find a better one.",

Baird (along with his dummy) is among the guiding forces behind Oursler's disconcerting, magical projections in Soho Square just up the road.

Spooky computer-generated voices whisper transcripts from archived 'spirit voices' from under the eaves of the gazebo at the square's centre; text spat from Intel insides scrolled up and down one sycamore, the digitally mediated voice of the undead ('I am the spirit side manager of the team and was once in a popular rock and roll group...'); on another, a balding head 15 feet high, banged itself repeatedly against the tree trunk like a trapped naiad; and on the wall of the former hospital next to the Twentieth Century Fox building a five-storey clenched fist knock, knocked for admittance to the underworld. </p> <p>The soundtrack to this intriguing, and sometimes hypnotic video tableau - what Oursler is apt to call a 'psycho landscape' - was provided by a recording of a glass harmonica, an instrument invented in the 1700s, which involved a series of glass bowls that were made to resonate when rubbed with a finger (the bowls of the original instrument were made of lead, which poisoned its virtuosos, sending them insane). The glass harmonica is one element of an erudite homage to Gaspar Robertson - a typical figure in Oursler's arcane hinterland - a necromancer and showman, who established, in 1763, the first permanent moving image theatre in a crypt in Paris, and who used the harmonica to unnerve his audience as it watched his phantasmagoria. Another is the woman's face that is projected on to smoke and which provides - like a disembodied Beckett voice - an authorial commentary on the eerie and repetitive proceedings.

The look on Pete Townshend's face for the first few minutes of Thursday night's triumphant gig in Manchester is really quite disturbing - in a way that it wasn't when he was 25. It's the facade of serene respectability that makes Townshend's clenched jaw and frenzied windmilling arm seem more than an old rock star's stage tricks. You can practically see the demons seeping smokily from this fingertips. </p> <p>The Who, for me, are still several rungs below the truly great rock acts - The Beatles, Dylan, The Stones, The Clash, Bowie, Springsteen - not least because their albums (with the exception of Who's Next) don't stand the test of time. But as a live act, they are up there with the best. You can certainly see why America has embraced them so fervently in their autumnal years. And, professional and energetic as they are, the band's appeal has nothing to do with the supernaturally fresh-faced, full-voiced Roger Daltrey or the white-bearded, supple-fingered John Entwistle, nor the more recent additions - keyboard maestro John 'Rabbit' Bundrick, and Zac Starkey doing a credible impersonation of Keith Moon. It's all about Townshend. </p> <p>I've been reading his <a href=\"http://www.petetownshend.com\">internet diaries</a> recently and it's complex, fascinating stuff - pretentious and self-important at times, but bristling with an intelligence that I suspect you wouldn't find in many rock stars' journals. On 5 October, for instance, he tackled the age question. 'Although there is perhaps nothing so ridiculous as this ageing man endlessly regurgitating the passion of his youth, repeating vengeful accusations against the weary old man I myself rapidly become - there is nothing more painful than to be made suddenly aware that the awful secret of growing old (that the young can never, should never, understand) is that one day the old grow young... I am conscious that I am behaving more like someone who is young than I did when I was really young.' </p> <p>In other words, he is still talking 'bout his generation - and in a tone that is, unusually, neither apologetic nor smug. The fact that he didn't die before he got old does not invalidate the rebel rhetoric of 'My Generation'; rather, it gives the song another layer of meaning. Whereas Keith Richards more and more resembles some languid old bluesman, fossilised in his coolness, Townshend is visibly wiser and happier, but with the same core of volatility that sparked those three-minute mod anthems. When he tells the audience, many of whom are, like me, half his age, 'Please, please, do take care of yourselves - because every one of you is precious', it doesn't sound like sentimental flannel, but a sincere, paternal retraction of the nihilism of his youth. </p> <p>Weird as it may sound, this is perhaps the best way to experience The Who. With The Stones, fun as their live shows are, you would always rather listen to Beggars Banquet or Let It Bleed. With The Who, that doesn't apply. The 'greatest hits live' is as good as it gets. And even for someone of a younger generation, Townshend strikes me as having more to say about life than most of 'our' pop spokespeople. Listen to The Who's 'My Generation' next to Limp Bizkit's song of the same name, and then tell me youth is innately more vigorous than middle age. </p> <p>For all the explosive versions of old hits, all the show-off solos, the night's freshest moment is a tender reworking of 'The Kids Are Alright', dedicated to Townshend's own children. The NME may have taunted him for this heresy, but that's just blinkered, childless youth for you. Why don't he just f-f-f-fade away? Because people still dig what he's got to s-s-s-say.</p>",

It's not simply that they animate parts of the stage - and of the actors there - that most companies don't reach. Their fluid, anti-naturalistic style lets them chart territory which is usually dramatic desert. They're at home with the abstract, the speculative, the wild and the weird. </p> <p>All this was true of the illuminating Mnemonic, which next year arrives at the National, from where movement theatre has been culpably absent. And it's true of the rich, brooding <strong> Light</strong>, though at the moment (Complicite's productions are always evolving) this contains indigestible lumps. </p> <p>Complicite's artistic director, Simon McBurney and Matthew Broughton, have adapted Light from a novel by the Swedish writer Torgny Lindgren, one of whose books was filmed as Elvira Madigan. </p> <p>Lindgren's fable was prompted by a mixture of the bygone and the contemporary; by a village that rose from the ravages of plague, by the deaths of friends from Aids, and by medieval trials of animals. </p> <p>In Complicite's production, a grinning chat-show host introduces a group of villagers who, reduced to a handful by rabbit-borne disease, slide into anarchy. The white-suited compere gloatingly circles characters in dung-coloured costumes: one is toothless; one buggers his cow; one escapes terror by going into a trance. He circles them until they eject him. This is, among other things, a piece about the importance of telling your own story. </p> <p>There's a huge amount going on. Those animal trials, for instance. In true Complicite style, a major contributor to the action is a giant boar - magnificently played by Joseph Alessi as a steaming beast, who dominates the front of the stage, as he strains at his leash and rears up waving his trotters, long animal bones strapped to the actor's mud-spattered arms. This is a pig which is solemnly condemned to hang for eating a baby; a pig with a biography, a pig which sometimes looks like a bald, obliging baby, sometimes resembles a BNP thug, and which becomes a dangling lump. </p> <p>This story alone would be enough for most companies. But here it's intertwined with a larger debate about ways of coping with disaster: there are those who thrive on uncertainty and those who long for order; the play, which continually teases with the possibility that nothing it presents is true, opposes happy scavenger and troubled seeker after justice, but doesn't take sides. </p> <p>There are episodes in Light which aren't clear, and others which are plonkingly explained. But its inventive visualisation is a marvel. Twitching rabbits turn into hats in the wink of a magi cian's, or a butcher's, eye. A fighting couple are frozen in silent, perpetual pursuit. Hooded figures tweak eerie but appealing puppets, with the blackened limbs of mummies and the wide faces and huge eyes of ET; in doing so, they act out the narrator's manipulation of the story. </p> <p>As the curtain goes up on Polly Teale's Shared Experience production of <strong> A Doll's House</strong>, Anne-Marie Duff's arm waves through the window of a doll's house. In the closing moments, as she prepares to leave her husband and children, Duff unlatches a massive hook; the walls of her own house swing out - like those of a doll's house - on to a world of snow. </p> <p>The bold expressionism of Teale's direction and Angela Davies's design spells out Ibsen's shadows and snares. The Helmers' house is wanly lit; the walls are cracked; patches are rubbed bare; dead leaves blow across the floor. A sharp angle, against which Nora lolls like a broken marionette, divides the main room from a small chamber, in which trusty friends sit knitting, like tricoteuses beside the guillotine. Nora's fears and regrets assume palpable form: her tormenting debt-collector looms over her, or slumps in a corner; her dead father stalks the stage. </p> <p>This explicitness has one bad result: it causes some actors (the men - though not Pip Donaghy's Dr Rank) to be mouthy and over-emphatic. But it supplies an electrifying sense of danger. And it fuels Anne-Marie Duff's terrific performance, which swoops from giddy eagerness to washed-out determination; in the course of the evening her voice drops from reedy immaturity to adult dismay. </p> <p>For a few glorious days the Young@Hearts chorus from Massachusetts came to London - courtesy of LIFT - and took the audience with them on their <strong> Road to Heaven</strong>. The idea for their show is, like all brilliant ideas, simple. Like most brilliant ideas, it begins by sounding barmy, and ends by seeming essential. </p> <p>A group in their seventies and eighties performs pop songs. Not the songs of their youth - there are no quavering ballads - but the songs of subsequent generations. And not just the Beatles but the Stones; not just Dylan but Led Zeppelin. And the Clash. Not rocking-chair, but rock'n'roll. </p> <p>Picture-book - and show-biz - versions of old age are exploded. Forget roguish twinkles and apple-cheeks; forget 'indomitable' or 'crochety'. Against a design that suggests both hospital and asylum, three cowboys in ponyskin and fluorescent green chaps belt out 'Ghost Riders in the Sky'. 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' is performed by a drag queen batting barbed-wire eyelashes. With tutu and wobbly wand, a white-haired woman knowingly lisps: 'Nobody loves a fairy when she's 80'; 'We do,' shouted a voice on the first night. </p> <p>Every song takes on a different tinge: why have we assumed they're written for the young? Yelled by Jagger, 'Satisfaction' is a boast; it's rendered here as a considered, ferocious complaint. 'I didn't know what time it was' - usually a melancholy romance - becomes disturbing when delivered, with dry precision by a clever, elderly woman. This extraordinary, funny and stirring show must return. And surely London should be treated to the chorus's 'Louis Lou I', a retelling of the French Revolution through the songs of Sinatra.</p>",

In true Complicite style, a major contributor to the action is a giant boar - magnificently played by Joseph Alessi as a steaming beast, who dominates the front of the stage, as he strains at his leash and rears up waving his trotters, long animal bones strapped to the actor's mud-spattered arms. This is a pig which is solemnly condemned to hang for eating a baby; a pig with a biography, a pig which sometimes looks like a bald, obliging baby, sometimes resembles a BNP thug, and which becomes a dangling lump. This story alone would be enough for most companies. But here it's intertwined with a larger debate about ways of coping with disaster: there are those who thrive on uncertainty and those who long for order; the play, which continually teases with the possibility that nothing it presents is true, opposes happy scavenger and troubled seeker after justice, but doesn't take sides. There are episodes in Light which aren't clear, and others which are plonkingly explained. But its inventive visualisation is a marvel. Twitching rabbits turn into hats in the wink of a magi cian's, or a butcher's, eye. A fighting couple are frozen in silent, perpetual pursuit. Hooded figures tweak eerie but appealing puppets, with the blackened limbs of mummies and the wide faces and huge eyes of ET; in doing so, they act out the narrator's manipulation of the story. As the curtain goes up on Polly Teale's Shared Experience production of A Doll's House, Anne-Marie Duff's arm waves through the window of a doll's house. In the closing moments, as she prepares to leave her husband and children, Duff unlatches a massive hook; the walls of her own house swing out - like those of a doll's house - on to a world of snow. The bold expressionism of Teale's direction and Angela Davies's design spells out Ibsen's shadows and snares. The Helmers' house is wanly lit; the walls are cracked; patches are rubbed bare; dead leaves blow across the floor. A sharp angle, against which Nora lolls like a broken marionette, divides the main room from a small chamber, in which trusty friends sit knitting, like tricoteuses beside the guillotine. Nora's fears and regrets assume palpable form: her tormenting debt-collector looms over her, or slumps in a corner; her dead father stalks the stage. This explicitness has one bad result: it causes some actors (the men - though not Pip Donaghy's Dr Rank) to be mouthy and over-emphatic. But it supplies an electrifying sense of danger. And it fuels Anne-Marie Duff's terrific performance, which swoops from giddy eagerness to washed-out determination; in the course of the evening her voice drops from reedy immaturity to adult dismay. For a few glorious days the Young@Hearts chorus from Massachusetts came to London - courtesy of LIFT - and took the audience with them on their Road to Heaven. The idea for their show is, like all brilliant ideas, simple. Like most brilliant ideas, it begins by sounding barmy, and ends by seeming essential. A group in their seventies and eighties performs pop songs. Not the songs of their youth - there are no quavering ballads - but the songs of subsequent generations. And not just the Beatles but the Stones; not just Dylan but Led Zeppelin. And the Clash. Not rocking-chair, but rock'n'roll. Picture-book - and show-biz - versions of old age are exploded. Forget roguish twinkles and apple-cheeks; forget 'indomitable' or 'crochety'. Against a design that suggests both hospital and asylum, three cowboys in ponyskin and fluorescent green chaps belt out 'Ghost Riders in the Sky'. 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' is performed by a drag queen batting barbed-wire eyelashes. With tutu and wobbly wand, a white-haired woman knowingly lisps: 'Nobody loves a fairy when she's 80'; 'We do,' shouted a voice on the first night. Every song takes on a different tinge: why have we assumed they're written for the young? Yelled by Jagger, 'Satisfaction' is a boast; it's rendered here as a considered, ferocious complaint. 'I didn't know what time it was' - usually a melancholy romance - becomes disturbing when delivered, with dry precision by a clever, elderly woman. This extraordinary, funny and stirring show must return. And surely London should be treated to the chorus's 'Louis Lou I', a retelling of the French Revolution through the songs of Sinatra.",

Walter Pater, in the inflammatory conclusion to his 1873 study of the Renaissance, enjoined his readers not to form habits, which turn us into conventional, drearily moral creatures. Loosen reality, he urged; surrender to your senses; let the solid, workaday world dissipate into a hazy penumbra of impressions. This was a prescription for living hedonistically, relishing moments and acknowledging the supreme unimportance of being earnest. </p> <p>The National Gallery's new show, <strong> Impression</strong>, documents the pictorial style while ignoring the ethical imperatives behind it. The exhibition's subtitle is 'Painting Quickly in France, 1860-1890', and it invites us to concentrate on the breezy, gestural antics of brushwork rather than bothering about what the pictures mean. The curator, Richard R. Brettell, a Texan academic, likens this myopic gaze to 'the radically reductive methods of what literary historians called \"the New Criticism\"'. </p> <p>The New Criticism hasn't been new, alas, since the 1950s, when it was the fashion to analyse the verbal involutions of a poem without asking whether the words had anything to say. The approach, as Brettell admits, was reductive. It's therefore odd that he thinks it worth applying this discredited technique to visual art. But universities set a premium on such jargon, and if you can't come up with a genuinely new idea, you may as well resuscitate an old one. </p> <p>Brettell's thesis requires us to study the slapdash energy of the painters displayed - the fuzzy, fluent brush-strokes of Pissarro, Berthe Morisot's zigzags of pigment, the showers of liq uid paint with which Renoir dotted his canvases, the wet-in-wet dabblings of Sisley. </p> <p>There is a useful point to this, since the impressionists proudly advertised their facility, disregarding the laboured detail and impervious finish prized by their predecessors. Ruskin promised that his illustrations to The Stones of Venice would have an 'almost servile veracity'; he was scandalised by Whistler who, like the impressionists, transcribed the visual world so hazily and hastily. According to Ruskin, Whistler's nocturnes had no value as art because they were painted so quickly. Ruskin studies Venice with slavish verisimilitude; the Venice of Renoir, on view at the National Gallery, is a humid, shimmering mirage. </p> <p>The difference, however, goes beyond technique. Ruskin's veracity was pious. His description of St Mark's cathedral concludes by noticing that 'Christ and His angels' surmount the domes. For Renoir, the great church is no longer a testament to faith. Molten in the heat, it deliquesces; the impression is almost an illusion. Brettell's exclusive attention to the 'viscous strokes of white, beige, gray and brown' prevents him from seeing what Renoir has done to a cathedral and the religion it once upheld. </p> <p>The argument about speed of execution is extended implausibly to artists who should not be looked at in the fickle, fluttery way Impression proposes. Manet, for instance, appears here as an honorary impressionist, which he is emphatically not. His technique was painstaking because the world of work and political action he depicted was one in which pains had to be taken. His view of the Grand Canal in Venice is not a bombardment of sun spots, like Renoir's San Marco. He concentrates on the city inhab ited by artisans: a gondola resembles a foreshortened barge and the buildings behind it are a cliff of tenements. Manet can only be made to fit by exhibiting a negligent sketch for his painting of the bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re, which is better in its finished state, or a murky and imprecise copy of Delacroix. </p> <p>Manet's Woman Reading , borrowed from Chicago, has an importance beyond its sketchy surface. Brettell counts the 'no more than 20 separate strokes of paint' that conjure up her face, but fails to notice that this painting about the act of reading itself ought to be read. At a caf\u00e9 table with a glass of beer beside her, the woman has snatched a magazine from the rack and is skimming it. Here is Manet's announcement that art should aspire to the condition of journalism, not (as the mid-nineteenth century's epic painters intended) to that of history. But for Brettell, sprucing up his jargon, the scene is merely one more 'performative project', in which the brush strokes are twinkle-toed ballerinas. </p> <p>The other artist unconvincingly presented as a gestural performer is Van Gogh. Impression concludes by assembling a group of his paintings under the heading 'The Post Impression', a term as desperately vacuous as postmodern. Brettell expatiates on the 'brutal' and 'strongly linear' brush strokes applied by Van Gogh to a pair of shoes, without considering the significance of those dirty, dented, careworn boots, which are an antidote to the volatile ballet slippers worn by the dancers of Degas. </p> <p>Van Gogh's work repudiates the casualness which Impression extols. The vortex of swirls in his Entrance to a Quarry looks maniacal, and in Trunks of Trees with Ivy , painted just outside the gates of the hospital where he was being treated for epilepsy, the ivy has the trees in a stranglehold, while the surface of the canvas is ridged with pigment as prickly as a security fence of barbed wire. </p> <p>The exhibition is safer when confining itself to the suburban picnic sites favoured by these painters - the Isle of Wight, for instance, described by Berthe Morisot as 'the prettiest place for painting'. This cult of prettiness presumably explains the inclusion of Renoir's gooey portrait of a King Charles spaniel. Having drawn attention to the fawning creature's 'liquid eyes', Brettell admits that the picture cannot be 'regarded as a serious work of art'. Quite so, but in that case what's it doing here?

As his admirer Graham Greene remarked: 'He was never so much of a dramatist as when he had ceased to have theatrical ambitions'. </p> <p>The team of writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, producer Ishmail Merchant and directory James Ivory, who previously adapted The Europeans and The Bostonians, again demonstrate with their version of <b> The Golden Bowl</b> how effective James can be on the screen. It's their best work since The Remains of the Day, though altogether more in thrall to the country house and less socially critical. </p> <p>Stripped of James's ornate, periphrastic late style, a simple, intriguing story remains of an unhealthily close father and daughter, the widowed American billionaire, Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), and his only child, Maggie (Kate Beckinsale), marrying two sophisticated fortune hunters - Maggie's beautiful but penniless schoolfriend, Charlotte (Uma Thurman), and the handsome, impecunious Italian aristocrat, Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam). </p> <p>Unbeknown to the Ververs, Charlotte and the prince are former lovers, a relationship they subsequently resume until they surrender to power, convention and destiny. The moral is pointed in the eponymous Byzantine gilded bowl, a beautiful object with a hidden flaw that renders it worthless in the eyes of some. </p> <p>(The film refrains from using the prince's description of the dealer who sold it as 'the little swindling Jew', an example of what used to be called 'gentlemanly anti-Semitism.') </p> <p>The names spell out the allegory - Amerigo, the tired European who discovered America but stayed at home to luxuriate in tradition; Adam, the American innocent who virtually owns an industrial metropolis called American City that he intends to civilise by creating a grand museum in the Roman style full of European art treasures. </p> <p>The film lacks the novel's mystery and complexity, though some of the hollowness derives from James's own confusion and ignorance. But it's sumptuously staged and has an outstanding performance from Nick Nolte, who perfectly combines the power and sensitivity that James attributed to his idealised American plutocrat. </p> <p>Jeremy Northam's prince, however, probably because of the elaborate Italian accent, seems more of a suave conman than an honest, agonising aristocrat. </p> <p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (with whom, the young Henry James observed: 'I lately spent a pleasant evening and found him bland and mildly anecdotal') famously wrote that </p> <p> 'Lives of great men all remind us <br>We can make our lives sublime, <br>And, departing, leave behind us <br>Footprints on the sands of time.' </p> <p> That uplifting sentiment might stand as an epigraph to the hero-worshipping movies of Richard Attenborough. But after Churchill, Gandhi, Biko, Chaplin and Hemingway, the latest addition to the Attenborough pantheon, the eponymous <b> Grey Owl</b>, hasn't left much in the way of a footprint. And it will be for James Bond, not his portrait of this Canadian conservationist, that Pierce Brosnan's footprints will be stamped in the foyer of Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Sunset Boulevard. </p> <p>This warm-hearted labour of love tells the story of the lower-middle-class Englishman, Archie Belaney, steeped from childhood in wilderness lore, who emigrated to Canada as a teenager, reinvented himself as the Indian Grey Owl, and in the 1930s became a best-selling author and lecturer on environmental matters, and a guest at Buckingham Palace. </p> <p>His true identity wasn't revealed until after his death in 1938. </p> <p>There's a fascinating story here, but it is sentimentalised and Disneyfied in William Nicholson's screenplay which concentrates on the crucial influence on Archie of a tiresome d\u00e9racin\u00e9e Mohawk beauty called Pony (Annie Galipeau). She gets him to instruct her in 'the old ways' and ends up converting him from trapping to conservation. The best sequence is his return to Hastings to visit the elderly aunts (Stephanie Cole, Ren\u00e9e Asherson) who reared him. The claims made for his significance seemed greatly exaggerated. </p> <p>Mark Herman's <b> Purely Belter</b> is The Likely Lads 30 years on. But the successors to the hopeful Tyneside boys of the 1960s are a hopeless pair of permanently truanting teenagers, the smart, aggressive Gerry (Chris Beatty), and the dim, compliant Sewell (Greg McClane). They've grown up in a culture of permanent unemployment, of broken families, runaway, drug-addicted sisters, feckless chain-smoking mothers, drunken, abusive fathers, indifferent teachers, ineffectual social workers. Ironically offering them moral support is Antony Gormley's 'Angel of the North'. </p> <p>As in Brassed Off, Herman lays it on with a trowel. The only thing that will gain Gerry and Sewell the respect they seek is the wherewithal (\u00a31,000) to buy season tickets to see Newcastle Utd, and they set about raising it by begging, shoplifting, burglary and bank-robbery. For this last, bungled crime they're sentenced to 200 hours' community service - they should, of course, have been sentenced to six months at the Royal Ballet School. </p> <p> Purely Belter is a lively, coarse, often very funny film with a brief appearance by Alan Shearer as himself (the lads steal his sportscar for a joyride in the country) and no concessions over matters of dialect (the title is Geordie for 'as good as it gets'). </p> <p>This kind of state-of-the-nation movie has been around since the 1980s and used to be called 'The Cinema of Thatcher's Britain'. Which suggests that as far as moviemakers are concerned, the difference between Blair's Britain and Thatcher's is the same as the traditional distinction between capitalism and communism - under one system man exploits man; under the other, it's the other way around. </p> <p>Amy Heckerling's last movie, Clueless , was an enjoyable updating of Jane Austen's Emma to present-day Los Angeles. Her moderately entertaining new picture, <b> Loser</b>, is virtually a reworking of Wilder's The Apartment at a New York university. </p> <p>In this case, Paul, a small-town scholarship lad (Jason Biggs), is ill-treated by his rich, idle contemporaries until they need his off-campus room to throw orgiastic parties. </p> <p>The girl he secretly loves (Mena Suvari from American Beauty ) is the mistress of a smug English teacher (Greg Kinnear) and when she's left near death at one of the rich kids' parties, Paul cares for her, though she briefly returns to the cynic who exploits her. This was a sharper brew when made with a Lemmon.</p>",

The moral is pointed in the eponymous Byzantine gilded bowl, a beautiful object with a hidden flaw that renders it worthless in the eyes of some. (The film refrains from using the prince's description of the dealer who sold it as 'the little swindling Jew', an example of what used to be called 'gentlemanly anti-Semitism.') The names spell out the allegory - Amerigo, the tired European who discovered America but stayed at home to luxuriate in tradition; Adam, the American innocent who virtually owns an industrial metropolis called American City that he intends to civilise by creating a grand museum in the Roman style full of European art treasures. The film lacks the novel's mystery and complexity, though some of the hollowness derives from James's own confusion and ignorance. But it's sumptuously staged and has an outstanding performance from Nick Nolte, who perfectly combines the power and sensitivity that James attributed to his idealised American plutocrat. Jeremy Northam's prince, however, probably because of the elaborate Italian accent, seems more of a suave conman than an honest, agonising aristocrat. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (with whom, the young Henry James observed: 'I lately spent a pleasant evening and found him bland and mildly anecdotal') famously wrote that 'Lives of great men all remind us We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time.' That uplifting sentiment might stand as an epigraph to the hero-worshipping movies of Richard Attenborough. But after Churchill, Gandhi, Biko, Chaplin and Hemingway, the latest addition to the Attenborough pantheon, the eponymous Grey Owl, hasn't left much in the way of a footprint. And it will be for James Bond, not his portrait of this Canadian conservationist, that Pierce Brosnan's footprints will be stamped in the foyer of Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Sunset Boulevard. This warm-hearted labour of love tells the story of the lower-middle-class Englishman, Archie Belaney, steeped from childhood in wilderness lore, who emigrated to Canada as a teenager, reinvented himself as the Indian Grey Owl, and in the 1930s became a best-selling author and lecturer on environmental matters, and a guest at Buckingham Palace. His true identity wasn't revealed until after his death in 1938. There's a fascinating story here, but it is sentimentalised and Disneyfied in William Nicholson's screenplay which concentrates on the crucial influence on Archie of a tiresome d\u00e9racin\u00e9e Mohawk beauty called Pony (Annie Galipeau). She gets him to instruct her in 'the old ways' and ends up converting him from trapping to conservation. The best sequence is his return to Hastings to visit the elderly aunts (Stephanie Cole, Ren\u00e9e Asherson) who reared him. The claims made for his significance seemed greatly exaggerated. Mark Herman's Purely Belter is The Likely Lads 30 years on. But the successors to the hopeful Tyneside boys of the 1960s are a hopeless pair of permanently truanting teenagers, the smart, aggressive Gerry (Chris Beatty), and the dim, compliant Sewell (Greg McClane). They've grown up in a culture of permanent unemployment, of broken families, runaway, drug-addicted sisters, feckless chain-smoking mothers, drunken, abusive fathers, indifferent teachers, ineffectual social workers. Ironically offering them moral support is Antony Gormley's 'Angel of the North'. As in Brassed Off, Herman lays it on with a trowel. The only thing that will gain Gerry and Sewell the respect they seek is the wherewithal (\u00a31,000) to buy season tickets to see Newcastle Utd, and they set about raising it by begging, shoplifting, burglary and bank-robbery. For this last, bungled crime they're sentenced to 200 hours' community service - they should, of course, have been sentenced to six months at the Royal Ballet School. Purely Belter is a lively, coarse, often very funny film with a brief appearance by Alan Shearer as himself (the lads steal his sportscar for a joyride in the country) and no concessions over matters of dialect (the title is Geordie for 'as good as it gets'). This kind of state-of-the-nation movie has been around since the 1980s and used to be called 'The Cinema of Thatcher's Britain'. Which suggests that as far as moviemakers are concerned, the difference between Blair's Britain and Thatcher's is the same as the traditional distinction between capitalism and communism - under one system man exploits man; under the other, it's the other way around. Amy Heckerling's last movie, Clueless , was an enjoyable updating of Jane Austen's Emma to present-day Los Angeles. Her moderately entertaining new picture, Loser, is virtually a reworking of Wilder's The Apartment at a New York university. In this case, Paul, a small-town scholarship lad (Jason Biggs), is ill-treated by his rich, idle contemporaries until they need his off-campus room to throw orgiastic parties. The girl he secretly loves (Mena Suvari from American Beauty ) is the mistress of a smug English teacher (Greg Kinnear) and when she's left near death at one of the rich kids' parties, Paul cares for her, though she briefly returns to the cynic who exploits her. This was a sharper brew when made with a Lemmon.",

Shouldn't they be making the most of their remaining visible assets? </p> <p>Does the premise sound familiar?

But we didn't realise quite how possessive they had become. </p> <p>Now, just a week after the opening of The Full Monty: the musical, the gritty northern fable is halfway to being appropriated as part of the American Dream. It is already the hottest- selling ticket on Broadway and one day it may even earn the rare accolade of breaking even. The critics have been positive. Ben Brantley in the New York Times called it 'that rare aggressive crowd-pleaser that you don't have to apologise for liking'. To the Daily News it was 'fresh, bouncy and downright delightful'. </p> <p>'There was an awful long line waiting for seats today,' said a proud member of the production team on Friday. </p> <p>But there is one key person in The Full Monty saga who has not been queuing for a ticket: the British screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy. Only a few of Beaufoy's original lines remain in the musical and he no longer regards it as his story. </p> <p>'He feels it is nothing to do with him now and he has no plans to go to see it,' Beaufoy's agent, Rod Hall, told The Observer last week. Beaufoy was not even invited to the first night. </p> <p>The book for the new musical has been almost entirely rewritten by Terrence McNally, the playwright recently embroiled in religious controversy after his play Corpus Christi, about a gay Christ figure, was staged in New York and London. McNally, who also wrote the book for Kiss of the Spiderwoman , has had no contact with Beaufoy and has only seen the film once. </p> <p>So how did America manage to hi-jack this British hit? On the strength of the film, two influential showbusiness executives gave up their day jobs in order to bring a musical treatment of the story to the stage. One of them was Lindsay Law, former president of 20th Century Fox's Searchlight division, the company who released the original Monty. </p> <p>'It was a one-time-only adventure,' he says. 'Although the film was set in Sheffield, it was obvious it translated everywhere. It is the same heart and for that reason it could travel.' </p> <p>At Fox, Law was in charge of around 80 film scripts at any moment. He was keen to focus on one project only and he chose The Full Monty. </p> <p>Now a co-producer of the musical along with Thomas Hall, the former director of San Diego's Old Globe Theater, Law is to visit London this week to 'explore the possibility' of bringing the show to Britain. A tour of America has just been agreed, he says, and there are also plans to take it to Hamburg, Madrid, Mexico City and Sydney. But London, he knows, will be the real problem. </p> <p>'We have an American musical here and it would not be at all easy to change it to a British musical, although we have utilised a British movie. Our biggest concern is Great Britain by virtue of the special affection in its heart for this story.' </p> <p>Despite the fact that the producers have had no contact with the original Monty creative team, they have taken out an advertisement in the show's programme which formally thanks both Beaufoy and Umberto Pasolini, the producer of the film. </p> <p>'Reviews have said how closely it sticks to the movie,' says Law. 'We do have a couple of new women characters - a jazzy accompanist and a female stripper - but the guys are true to the original guys.' </p> <p>Law denies that he has simply Americanised the story to make it commercially acceptable in the States. 'Musical comedy is one of the few art forms that is original to America. We invented it and there are many more practitioners here, so it made sense for me to develop it out here. Then, of course, the team were going to be much more comfortable doing it with an American story rather than wondering all the time what those guys in Sheffield would have said. </p> <p>'Even over here there are plenty who fail constantly by writing boring musicals. A lot of the stuff on Broadway is full of mugging and \"large\" acting. The Full Monty is true to life and as a result has a much more substantial book.' </p> <p>It is a specific writing skill, Law argues, to be able to establish a character in a couple of lines and then lead him into a song. 'Terrence wrote the complete book to the show and then it was obvious some scenes were going to be better as songs.' </p> <p>The show has nearly double the budget of the film, which has made around \u00a3170 million worldwide. But the talent hired to work on the musical did not look, on paper, like a team that would guarantee a hit. Take McNally. More than 2,000 catholics, Hindus and Muslims demonstrated on the streets when his play Corpus Christi came to Manhattan. He did not seem the natural choice to write for a fun, family night out. </p> <p>The composer, David Yazbek, had previously written only for an obscure rock band, and Jack O'Brien, the director, has a chequered track record. His previous show, More to Love, closed after four days in 1998. Even the show's star, Patrick Wilson, arrived fresh from two critical disasters, Fascinating Rhythm and Bright Lights, Big City. </p> <p>The show was initially 'workshopped' quietly with 12 actors and then staged in full in San Diego. For Law, this slow creative process was crucial. 'It was a question of listening to your show to see what you had,' he says. </p> <p>What they had was a show with songs that rhymed 'carving' with 'Lee Marvin' and 'cojones' with 'testosterones'. Our heroes are a divorced father called Jerry and his chunky pal, Dave, who collaborate with four friends in a last-ditch search for cash and self-esteem. The famous dole-queue bopping scene is gone, so too is the moment when the troupe learn to dance by aping the Arsenal defence appeal for offside. Instead the gay love element in the plot has been enhanced and basketball replaces football. As in the film, the story builds to the climatic question, will they ever strip bare? And it is a question that has the audience in a nightly frenzy. 'They scream and yell, and not just at the stripping,' says Law, 'but at the humour. I was nervous about the Wednesday matinee because they were older women, but they were just as raucous.' </p> <p>Some of the mass delirium induced by the show's finale is, it should be pointed out, rather whooped up by the fact that female members of the cast join the audience in the stalls.

But while his movies - all of them thrillers - were enjoyable enough, it took L.A. Confidential to elevate him to that currently small league of film-makers whose next film one eagerly looks forward to. We've had to wait three years for its successor, <strong> Wonder Boys</strong>, a delightful and constantly surprising film, far removed from the world of big-city crime, though there is a killing (of a dog), a theft (of a remarkable piece of memorabilia) and a fleeting glimpse of James Ellroy at a writers' conference. </p> <p>Adapted by Steve Kloves (writer-director of the lively The Fabulous Baker Boys ) from Michael Chabon's funny, accurate novel of the literary life, Wonder Boys is set during a couple of overcast, winter days in Pittsburgh and centres on Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas), a critically esteemed novelist in his late forties, who teaches a creative writing workshop at a local university. Grady, the film's narrator and present in every scene, is in trouble. </p> <p>He's overweight, addicted to the weed and hasn't published a book for seven years, though far from having a writer's block his problem is a manuscript of nearly 3,000 single-space pages that he can't bring to an end. Moreover, his wife has just left him (though, as he tells us, 'wives have left me before'); his old chum and editor Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr) is coming from New York to attend the university's annual 'Bookfest'; and his lover Sara (Frances McDormand), who happens to be chancellor of the university and married to Grady's boss, the head of the English department, announces her pregnancy. Not surprisingly, he's subject to anxiety attacks which leave him prostrate. </p> <p>This is the stuff of tragedy and might have been unbearably painful. Two things prevent it from being so. The first is the sardonic wit that accompanies the juggling act which keeps Grady's problems from crashing to the ground around him. The second is the warmth we feel towards the shambling Grady, an honest teacher, a respecter of truth if not always of persons, a man trying to do the decent thing. </p> <p>To have seen Robin Williams in this role would have been unbearable. But Douglas, like his father, never invites easy sympathy and the neurotic characters they often play scorn sentimentality and embrace losing with dignity. Easy pathos is kept at bay (or gently mocked) until the tidying up process at the end. Until then the action is driven for ward with the speed of classical farce. </p> <p>There are numerous odd strands to the plot - a black guy believes that Grady has stolen his car; the head of English is obsessed with baseball memorabilia and is writing a book on Monroe and DiMaggio called The Last American Marriage; a transvestite tuba player briefly crosses Grady's path; Crabtree, Grady's reckless bisexual editor, is at the end of his tether and needs a successful book or a new author to keep his publishing job. </p> <p>The central thread in the narrative skein, however, is Grady's relationship with a brilliant, deeply disturbed student, James Leer (Tobey Maguire), an inveterate liar, who transmutes the fantasies of his life into the verities of fiction. Grady and James are bound together not only as teacher and pupil and as potential literary rivals but also through a bizarre incident at a party for visiting writers at the chancellor's house. James is an obsessive film buff with an encyclopedic knowledge of popular culture and Grady shows him the black satin jacket trimmed with ermine that Marilyn Monroe wore at her 1954 marriage to Joe DiMaggio, the most closely guarded possession of the head of English. James steals this numinous garment immediately after killing the head of English's vicious dog who has attacked Grady, having intuited that his master is being cuckolded. This hilarious episode fuels the whole film, but the relationship is handled with a sensitivity reminiscent of Lionel Trilling's celebrated story Of This Time, Of That Place, about of a university professor confronted with an insane pupil. </p> <p> Wonder Boys flies in the face of a dumbed-down Hollywood through literary references and jokes that depend on some passing acquaintance with the names of Carlyle, Macaulay, Hadley, Hemingway and Genet, and it touches lightly but deftly on aspects of the literary process.

The vast majority, some 418,000, are Grade II; a further 18,000 are Grade III; and only 6,000 have a Grade I listing, which represents buildings of the greatest importance. The main reasons for listing are that a house was built by a prominent architect, or is deemed to be a good example of a particular type of craftsmanship or design. Alternatively, it may have historic value, for example by association with people or events of national importance. </p> <p>In practice, any building older than 1700 is automatically listed, as are most dating from between 1700 and 1840. Relatively few buildings from the twentieth century are listed, though the numbers have increased lately, with buildings from the Sixties being added. In the broadest terms, a house which is Georgian or earlier is almost certainly listed, while Victorian is far less likely, and with an Edwardian or later house it is quite the exception. </p> <p>The basic rule applying to all listed houses is that they cannot be either demolished or structurally altered without listed building consent, in addition to any planning permission that you would usually have to obtain. </p> <p>For the majority whose house is Grade II, the consent will usually be given by the local planning authority, possibly after consultation with conservation groups; but with the higher grades, English Heritage is called in. </p> <p>Simon Edwards, of estate agents FPD Savills in Hampstead, London, says: 'There is a popular misconception that this only affects changes you want to make to the exterior of the building. That is quite wrong, because it affects any structural alterations.' The danger, he says, is that once you have applied for consent, it can result in a raft of new restrictions. </p> <p>'Suppose you want to knock through from one room to another; the planning officer comes to inspect and announces that you can't move that fireplace, or that a particular cornice must be retained.' </p> <p>Curiously, he says, many buyers of listed properties don't, before buying, even obtain the actual listing which should at least give an indication of the features that are most likely to be protected. The listing may say the house has interesting ironwork, for example. There is a rotting ornamental balcony that you wanted to get rid of, but instead you find yourself having to restore it at great expense. </p> <p>One of the risks of buying a listed property needing a lot of work is that you have no way of knowing how reasonable the local planning authority - or English Heritage officer - is going to be. Usually, says Simon Edwards, they will want the basic proportions of the main reception rooms to be preserved, but will be less fussy about a basement being knocked through. </p> <p>However, restrictions can be severe. When a cash-starved local literary institute needed to refurbish its building, the stucco was knocked off and it was discovered that wooden lintels underneath were rotten. The institute asked to replace the lintels with concrete, which would then be hidden by the stucco, but was told that it had not only to replace them with wood, but that the wood had to be with oak of the same age as the originals. </p> <p>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which is responsible for the listing of buildings, publishes a guide for owners, What Listing Means . </p> <p>Its advice on the subject is that 'even relatively minor works, such as painting, may affect the character of a listed building, and it is therefore advisable to consult your local planning authority before starting if you are in any doubt'. </p> <p>The penalty for not doing so can be harsh. Three years ago, Conservative MP Teresa Gorman and her husband were each fined \u00a33,000 after they altered their sixteenth century Grade II-listed farmhouse in Essex without permission.

You could apply to English Heritage, which gives grants totalling around \u00a335 million each year for the repair of important buildings.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When she was a child, she says, she was rather plain; not beautiful at all - a plump and pigtailed swot whose father would sit by her side in the evenings while she did her homework, and who immersed herself in Victorian novels, romantic poetry and the great Hollywood films of the Forties. A conscientious eldest child growing up in Stockport during the war and ration years, passing the 11-plus, going to grammar school, getting good grades, and dreaming of Betty Grable, Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner with their silk gowns and lipsticked, dangerous allure. Dreaming of leaving. Of being someone else, somewhere different.</p> <p>She knew there was a place called university, though no one in her family had ever been there. She knew that this was her route away from her roots. A gulf was growing between her and her parents, who had themselves struggled so hard to leave their working class backgrounds for the lower middle classes. Her aspiration was also a kind of rejection. Success was a kind of betrayal. </p> <p>Joan Bakewell is now in her mid-sixties, and emotionally in a 'bit of a beached' place since her 25-year marriage to her second husband Jack Emery ended a few months ago. 'It's hard at 66,' she says with a wry grimace and no self-pity. </p> <p>She has an eloquent, graceful face, with her large eyes, her dark, gleaming hair, her fine, determined features. She has a firm chin that she keeps - literally and metaphorically - up. There is a luminous quality about her that is immensely attractive, and a kind of pluck. She sits on a sofa in her beautiful house in Primrose Hill - large rooms, tall windows through which sunlight slants, and outside a square of golden trees, scattering their leaves on the grass - immaculate in her black suit and black T-shirt.</p> <p>She still would not call herself beautiful, however often the epithet has been given to her. Nor, she insists, has she ever thought herself so ('I simply do the best I can'). But for many years - over three decades - her public has known her as a woman who combines loveliness and good sense, who can be rather earnest, very sexy and studiously clever all at once. </p> <p>She started her media career proper with the arts programme Late Night Line Up in the Sixties, and began a second career when for many years she presented The Heart of the Matter, the Sunday evening religious programme that debated ethical dilemmas. She resigned from that last year but still has several television projects on the boil - as well as being on Radio 3's Brains Trust, involved with the BBC's new digital cultural channel, on the board of the Tate (she was one of the jurors responsible for choosing the architect for the Tate Modern) and chair of the British Film Institute, whose London Film Festival opened last Wednesday. From going to the cinema twice a week as a movie-mad girl, now she's representing movies. </p> <p>It's a long journey from post-war Joan Dawson Rowlands to postmodern Joan Bakewell, CBE, whose high cheekbones and long legs we know; whose seven-year affair with Harold Pinter, the subject of his play Betrayal, is now famous, whose crisp diction (learnt from elocution lessons that her mother insisted on) is still familiar. 'But I'm not a star,' she says. 'I never have been. I have a pretty average media life. I have never been on a ladder. It's not a career. I just work. I'm a worker.' </p> <p>And she is, resilient and diligent, slogging on when so many around her disappear; a trouper. </p> <p>Joan Bakewell speaks of her parents as being 'touchingly ordinary', yet the life of her mother is a painful narrative and clearly still casts shadows over the daughter who got away. Her mother, Rose, was the eldest of a large family, intelligent and ambitious (she wanted to be an engineer), who left school at 13 to look after her seven siblings. When she married Joan's father, whose own mother worked as a seamstress to within four hours of dying, the 'great honour of being lower middle class, no longer working class, was that the woman could stay at home - in a house where there was an indoor toilet and some kitchen facilities. My mother's job was to keep the home impeccable. She was very clever, but that was what she was taught to aspire to. It was a nightmare to live with. You could hardly dare put anything down. Everything had to be flawless; every last speck of dust had to be chased from the house. </p> <p>'All her energies went into that. She was unhappy, and that snarled up our relationship. I remember her as silent - great stretches of silence. And she would hit me and my sister, smack us, a slap here, a flick of the wrist, a sharp tap. She was always terrified we would get pregnant before we got married. She made me secretive. I hid things from her. I took care not to get caught. I went to church. I was baptised and confirmed, I went to youth clubs, all sorts of jolly fresh air activities and maybe a bit of groping behind the youth club, holding hands, a peck on the cheek, and thinking, \"more, more\", but knowing because of what my mother said it was dangerous to want more.' </p> <p>Cambridge (where she studied history) took her away from her parents, and introduced her to books, sex, pleasure, privileged young men and women with alien accents and love of learning. Her horizons opened. 'There was a whole world out there.' But she was still tied to her background ('I was rather Edwardian really') and she married her boyfriend, Michael Bakewell, because that was what you did, and started a family, because that was what you did, too. And gave up work as an advertising copywriter and occasional journalist (because ditto). </p> <p>This was the Fifties: the great change of the Sixties was waiting in the wings, but in her twenties Joan Bakewell had both managed to escape and yet remained trapped by her gender and her sense of what was appropriate. 'I'm very conventional really, you know,' she says. 'It's a big thing for me, breaking the rules.' </p> <p>Feminism and the Sixties changed her world and broke the rules for her, although she says that sometimes she regrets that it did not happen until she was in her thirties. 'I've been catching up ever since.' </p> <p>Her life flowered with new pain and possibility. Her career took off, though it did not happen overnight. In 1964, when she was 30, she started work with Late Night Line Up on BBC2 (a Late Review of its day). Later she became the presenter of The Heart of the Matter and, consequently, a kind of national pin-up. She also started her seven-year affair with Pinter, a friend and colleague of her husband, (although in the middle of it she and Bakewell had another child, a son). The affair - which was an open secret in the world in which she moved - was only made public with Michael Billington's biography of Pinter. The playwright gave permission to Joan Bakewell to talk. (' \"Really talk?\" I said.'). </p> <p>She had been strictly brought up to believe that private lives should be kept private, and yet talk she did, speaking candidly of the passion and joy of those years, as well as the pain. She did not, she said then and repeats today, regret it. She chose to tell the story, she says to me now, because it was in an 'intelligent book'; it was long ago, everyone she cared about knew of the affair. It was time (though she drank a glass of wine beforehand to steady her nerve). The subsequent brouhaha took her by surprise. </p> <p>She was 28 when her mother died, of leukaemia, a few years before her turbulent decade. The death brought Joan Bakewell a wrenching grief because everything between them remained so unresolved. 'It was not until I was in my mid-thirties, with the arrival of feminism, that I saw how clever she was, how thwarted, how terribly unhappy. We - my sister Susan and myself - found certificates in the drawers. All those classes she'd been to, learning about Beethoven, Picasso... always wanting to better herself. Seeing what I was doing with my life must have made her very wistful, I saw that at last. And then I could forgive her, when she was dead and it was too late.' </p> <p>Her beloved father's death in 1992 gave her a softer grief, a grief she was almost glad of ('a deep and good grief'). He was in his eighties, and died in her arms. A few years later her younger sister died of breast cancer. 'When she told me about the cancer, I cried out, \"You can't leave me.\" When she went it was part of my life that went - a visceral separation.' </p> <p>She's not scared of death herself, but she's scared of losing other people. There has been other loss in her life. She and her first husband separated, after their 'mutual infidelities'. Now she and her second husband have also separated. 'Here I am, in my sixties, and I thought everything would go on the same, but it's become this strange period of change.' Everything is different. For almost the first time in her life, she is on her own, in a large house, her children gone, having to make sure she organises her time and fills her suddenly yawning weekends. Women friends, she says, have been 'completely wonderful' - a 'warm blanket' of love and support, 'a springboard so that I can go on'. </p> <p>She sees her two children and their families often. She is a grandmother of six. When she talks of her grandchildren her face lights up. She is reading the celebrated children's author Philip Pullman at the moment so that she can keep in touch with their emergent worlds. </p> <p>But sometimes she looks in the mirror and thinks 'oh my God, I'd forgotten about that. The neck goes. Around the eyes. No more skimpy frocks. No more of that utter freedom of being young. Fashion leaves you behind - I've always been interested in clothes but clothes are losing their interest in me. Except sexy shoes. </p> <p>'But I don't feel post-sexual, although at this moment I am incapacitated a bit. I don't see myself as living in a neutered reality. I don't think that women ever need to feel like that - maybe they often feel like that because that's how other people see them. </p> <p>'I went to the Maudsley Hospital the other day,' she goes on. 'I was interviewing a doctor who treats children, and on her shelves there were all these generic dolls, you know - the boy with genitals, the little girl doll, the woman, the man. And there was this doll with crinkly grey hair and little spectacles on the end of her nose and wearing slippers with bobbles on. \"What's that?\" I asked, and she said, \"That's granny.\" \"But I'm a granny,\" I said, \"Look at me, this is what grannies look like. We wear high heels, nice clothes, have lives.\" I'm a granny and I work and I go to the gym and I've just bought myself a sporty little car. </p> <p>'Feminism has hit the 60-year-olds. We've had feminist women writing and talking about being young, working, trying to bring up children, marrying, divorcing, going through the menopause. And now at last we've got to feminism that's talking about the reality of getting old. This is what it's like. Of course, friends do begin to die and we are approaching death ourselves, but we're not all Yeatsian - when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire and that kind of thing. </p> <p>'No. I was fearful of death in my twenties and my thirties. Now I know it. I've seen it and recognised it and held it in my arms. It doesn't have to be terrifying, although it is always awesome.' </p> <p>You have to keep on changing, she says; making new challenges. You have to have self-knowledge and when things are hard you must wait and be receptive. You have to keep on being interested in life. 'I've been unhappy, of course. There have been terribly unhappy times, but usually I take a delight in life. I am,' she smiles elegantly, 'an optimistic little bee.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "When she was a child, she says, she was rather plain; not beautiful at all - a plump and pigtailed swot whose father would sit by her side in the evenings while she did her homework, and who immersed herself in Victorian novels, romantic poetry and the great Hollywood films of the Forties. A conscientious eldest child growing up in Stockport during the war and ration years, passing the 11-plus, going to grammar school, getting good grades, and dreaming of Betty Grable, Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner with their silk gowns and lipsticked, dangerous allure. Dreaming of leaving. Of being someone else, somewhere different. She knew there was a place called university, though no one in her family had ever been there. She knew that this was her route away from her roots. A gulf was growing between her and her parents, who had themselves struggled so hard to leave their working class backgrounds for the lower middle classes. Her aspiration was also a kind of rejection. Success was a kind of betrayal. Joan Bakewell is now in her mid-sixties, and emotionally in a 'bit of a beached' place since her 25-year marriage to her second husband Jack Emery ended a few months ago. 'It's hard at 66,' she says with a wry grimace and no self-pity. She has an eloquent, graceful face, with her large eyes, her dark, gleaming hair, her fine, determined features. She has a firm chin that she keeps - literally and metaphorically - up. There is a luminous quality about her that is immensely attractive, and a kind of pluck. She sits on a sofa in her beautiful house in Primrose Hill - large rooms, tall windows through which sunlight slants, and outside a square of golden trees, scattering their leaves on the grass - immaculate in her black suit and black T-shirt. She still would not call herself beautiful, however often the epithet has been given to her. Nor, she insists, has she ever thought herself so ('I simply do the best I can'). But for many years - over three decades - her public has known her as a woman who combines loveliness and good sense, who can be rather earnest, very sexy and studiously clever all at once. She started her media career proper with the arts programme Late Night Line Up in the Sixties, and began a second career when for many years she presented The Heart of the Matter, the Sunday evening religious programme that debated ethical dilemmas. She resigned from that last year but still has several television projects on the boil - as well as being on Radio 3's Brains Trust, involved with the BBC's new digital cultural channel, on the board of the Tate (she was one of the jurors responsible for choosing the architect for the Tate Modern) and chair of the British Film Institute, whose London Film Festival opened last Wednesday. From going to the cinema twice a week as a movie-mad girl, now she's representing movies. It's a long journey from post-war Joan Dawson Rowlands to postmodern Joan Bakewell, CBE, whose high cheekbones and long legs we know; whose seven-year affair with Harold Pinter, the subject of his play Betrayal, is now famous, whose crisp diction (learnt from elocution lessons that her mother insisted on) is still familiar. 'But I'm not a star,' she says. 'I never have been. I have a pretty average media life. I have never been on a ladder. It's not a career. I just work. I'm a worker.' And she is, resilient and diligent, slogging on when so many around her disappear; a trouper. Joan Bakewell speaks of her parents as being 'touchingly ordinary', yet the life of her mother is a painful narrative and clearly still casts shadows over the daughter who got away. Her mother, Rose, was the eldest of a large family, intelligent and ambitious (she wanted to be an engineer), who left school at 13 to look after her seven siblings. When she married Joan's father, whose own mother worked as a seamstress to within four hours of dying, the 'great honour of being lower middle class, no longer working class, was that the woman could stay at home - in a house where there was an indoor toilet and some kitchen facilities. My mother's job was to keep the home impeccable. She was very clever, but that was what she was taught to aspire to. It was a nightmare to live with. You could hardly dare put anything down. Everything had to be flawless; every last speck of dust had to be chased from the house. 'All her energies went into that. She was unhappy, and that snarled up our relationship. I remember her as silent - great stretches of silence. And she would hit me and my sister, smack us, a slap here, a flick of the wrist, a sharp tap. She was always terrified we would get pregnant before we got married. She made me secretive. I hid things from her. I took care not to get caught. I went to church. I was baptised and confirmed, I went to youth clubs, all sorts of jolly fresh air activities and maybe a bit of groping behind the youth club, holding hands, a peck on the cheek, and thinking, \"more, more\", but knowing because of what my mother said it was dangerous to want more.' Cambridge (where she studied history) took her away from her parents, and introduced her to books, sex, pleasure, privileged young men and women with alien accents and love of learning. Her horizons opened. 'There was a whole world out there.' But she was still tied to her background ('I was rather Edwardian really') and she married her boyfriend, Michael Bakewell, because that was what you did, and started a family, because that was what you did, too. And gave up work as an advertising copywriter and occasional journalist (because ditto). This was the Fifties: the great change of the Sixties was waiting in the wings, but in her twenties Joan Bakewell had both managed to escape and yet remained trapped by her gender and her sense of what was appropriate. 'I'm very conventional really, you know,' she says. 'It's a big thing for me, breaking the rules.' Feminism and the Sixties changed her world and broke the rules for her, although she says that sometimes she regrets that it did not happen until she was in her thirties. 'I've been catching up ever since.' Her life flowered with new pain and possibility. Her career took off, though it did not happen overnight. In 1964, when she was 30, she started work with Late Night Line Up on BBC2 (a Late Review of its day). Later she became the presenter of The Heart of the Matter and, consequently, a kind of national pin-up. She also started her seven-year affair with Pinter, a friend and colleague of her husband, (although in the middle of it she and Bakewell had another child, a son). The affair - which was an open secret in the world in which she moved - was only made public with Michael Billington's biography of Pinter. The playwright gave permission to Joan Bakewell to talk. (' \"Really talk?\" I said.'). She had been strictly brought up to believe that private lives should be kept private, and yet talk she did, speaking candidly of the passion and joy of those years, as well as the pain. She did not, she said then and repeats today, regret it. She chose to tell the story, she says to me now, because it was in an 'intelligent book'; it was long ago, everyone she cared about knew of the affair. It was time (though she drank a glass of wine beforehand to steady her nerve). The subsequent brouhaha took her by surprise. She was 28 when her mother died, of leukaemia, a few years before her turbulent decade. The death brought Joan Bakewell a wrenching grief because everything between them remained so unresolved. 'It was not until I was in my mid-thirties, with the arrival of feminism, that I saw how clever she was, how thwarted, how terribly unhappy. We - my sister Susan and myself - found certificates in the drawers. All those classes she'd been to, learning about Beethoven, Picasso... always wanting to better herself. Seeing what I was doing with my life must have made her very wistful, I saw that at last. And then I could forgive her, when she was dead and it was too late.' Her beloved father's death in 1992 gave her a softer grief, a grief she was almost glad of ('a deep and good grief'). He was in his eighties, and died in her arms. A few years later her younger sister died of breast cancer. 'When she told me about the cancer, I cried out, \"You can't leave me.\" When she went it was part of my life that went - a visceral separation.' She's not scared of death herself, but she's scared of losing other people. There has been other loss in her life. She and her first husband separated, after their 'mutual infidelities'. Now she and her second husband have also separated. 'Here I am, in my sixties, and I thought everything would go on the same, but it's become this strange period of change.' Everything is different. For almost the first time in her life, she is on her own, in a large house, her children gone, having to make sure she organises her time and fills her suddenly yawning weekends.

She is a grandmother of six. When she talks of her grandchildren her face lights up. She is reading the celebrated children's author Philip Pullman at the moment so that she can keep in touch with their emergent worlds.

      "body": "<p>The worst financial advice you can give a child, says author Robert Kiyosaki, is to urge them to get an education and a good job. 'Financial struggle is often the result of people working all their lives for someone else,' he says in his book Rich Dad, Poor Dad . 'Many people will have nothing at the end of their working lives.' </p> <p> This new, highly readable book, a bestseller in the United States, is a plea to the middle classes to move away from their long-held desire for job security (and relative poverty) and to become more entrepreneurial (and probably more wealthy). </p> <p> Born 53 years ago in Hawaii, Kiyosaki was the son of the state superintendent of education. While his father urged him to go the traditional route of academic education and job security, he was more impressed with the views of his best friend's father, his 'rich dad', who questioned traditional academic education and preferred acquiring real estate. Kiyosaki, a millionaire several times over after being down-and-out twice, is proof of his own pudding. While other 53-year-olds are commuting to the City and worrying about pensions and mortgages, Kiyosaki has been retired from his business activities for six years. He spends his time driving his fast cars, devoting himself to financial education and lecturing because he enjoys it, as well as travelling. </p> <p> He and his wife Kim, also financially astute, live in a large house in Arizona, following their own interests - she gives large charitable donations to animal protection charities; he gives to environmental organisations and runs his Foundation for Financial Literacy. </p> <p> After beating the survival odds as a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam war, he went into the hat, wallet and bag trade. He twice went bust. On one of these occasions, he and Kim lived for three weeks in a car. 'For a man looking at my beautiful young wife, it hurt,' he says. 'It was male failure. But it inspired me to shape up.' </p> <p> He learnt a lesson, he says, and it made him tougher. Part of the reason he never gives money to beggars is that they haven't yet learnt the lessons of their failure: 'Giving a poor person money keeps them poor. Intelligent people should learn from their experiences. With people on the street, the bad experience has beaten them.' </p> <p> Part of the reason he went bankrupt, he says, was that he couldn't accept the child labour of bag, wallet and handbag manufacture. So he hadn't become the bad, greedy person his father had feared? No, he says. 'Money is a magnifier of what you are already.</p> <p> If you are greedy, it will make you greedier.

      "bodyText": "The worst financial advice you can give a child, says author Robert Kiyosaki, is to urge them to get an education and a good job. 'Financial struggle is often the result of people working all their lives for someone else,' he says in his book Rich Dad, Poor Dad . 'Many people will have nothing at the end of their working lives.' This new, highly readable book, a bestseller in the United States, is a plea to the middle classes to move away from their long-held desire for job security (and relative poverty) and to become more entrepreneurial (and probably more wealthy). Born 53 years ago in Hawaii, Kiyosaki was the son of the state superintendent of education. While his father urged him to go the traditional route of academic education and job security, he was more impressed with the views of his best friend's father, his 'rich dad', who questioned traditional academic education and preferred acquiring real estate. Kiyosaki, a millionaire several times over after being down-and-out twice, is proof of his own pudding. While other 53-year-olds are commuting to the City and worrying about pensions and mortgages, Kiyosaki has been retired from his business activities for six years. He spends his time driving his fast cars, devoting himself to financial education and lecturing because he enjoys it, as well as travelling. He and his wife Kim, also financially astute, live in a large house in Arizona, following their own interests - she gives large charitable donations to animal protection charities; he gives to environmental organisations and runs his Foundation for Financial Literacy. After beating the survival odds as a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam war, he went into the hat, wallet and bag trade. He twice went bust. On one of these occasions, he and Kim lived for three weeks in a car. 'For a man looking at my beautiful young wife, it hurt,' he says. 'It was male failure. But it inspired me to shape up.' He learnt a lesson, he says, and it made him tougher. Part of the reason he never gives money to beggars is that they haven't yet learnt the lessons of their failure: 'Giving a poor person money keeps them poor. Intelligent people should learn from their experiences. With people on the street, the bad experience has beaten them.' Part of the reason he went bankrupt, he says, was that he couldn't accept the child labour of bag, wallet and handbag manufacture. So he hadn't become the bad, greedy person his father had feared? No, he says. 'Money is a magnifier of what you are already. If you are greedy, it will make you greedier. My family are all teachers, and genetically I'm a teacher. Since retiring, I've taught more and more. Ironically, I'm making more money. You make more money if you're generous.' How do other people do this? First, do not lock yourself into a pile of financial commitments and a salary that only rises once a year. Buy assets that work for you even when you're asleep - in businesses that interest you or in shares. His book explains the psychological and practical steps. You don't need academic qualifications to do well: 'My bank manager never asked me for my report card,' he says with a laugh. \u0095 Rich Dad, Poor Dad, \u00a39.99, is published by Little Brown.",

I responded to its letter, but have heard nothing since the middle of September. </p> <p>Is it not a standard clause in house contents policies that the policyholder is indemnified against financial loss incurred by a third party? <strong><br>SP, Bath </strong></p> <p>The weakness in the third party liability clause is that, for a claim to be successful, you have to prove the other person was at fault. </p> <p>If your neighbour says she had no idea the that wall was weak, you have to prove that she did know and did nothing about it. </p> <p>But now, even though R&amp;SA has given up hope of making the other side pay up, it has agreed to give you \u00a3100 as an ex gratia payment. </p> <p><strong> Lawyer's error cost me a bonus</strong></p> <p>I redeemed my mortgage with the Skipton Building Society when I bought a new property this June. Due to an oversight by my solicitor, the Skipton did not receive payment until 3 July. It claimed this took my account into another month, for which I was liable to pay an extra month's interest of \u00a3200. </p> <p>Some weeks later, I discovered that the society was making loyalty payments, but was told that I had to have a mortgage with them on 19 July to qualify, and my mortgage was redeemed on 3 July. </p> <p>I did not qualify, even though I had to pay interest to the end of July.<strong><br>LH, Huddersfield </strong> </p> <p>With all payouts and bonuses, there is a cut-off date, which is bad luck for those who just miss out. </p> <p>You had already paid a \u00a345 discharge fee to the Skipton, but its rules say that you pay interest to the end of the month in which a mortgage is redeemed.

They are now aged 11, and the renewal notice shows the premiums are rising by 52 per cent, there is a mandatory excess of \u00a340 and I then have to pay 35 per cent of any remaining bill. </p> <p>Previously, the company charged the same premium regardless of the animal's age and whether or not the owner lived in a low-cost area, as I do. </p> <p>I was prepared to pay over the odds for insuring my cats when they were young on the tacit understanding that cover would continue at a reasonable cost as my pets grew older. DBI's abrupt change of policy means that I am penalised.<strong><br>JT, Beaumaris </strong></p> <p>DBI (Dog Breeders Insurance) says premiums were bumped up by its new owner, Cornhill, because it had been trading unprofitably. This is no consolation to policyholders like you who were not expecting such a leap in cost. DBI says insuring a cat of 11 is \u00a37.55 a month. Primary Direct insures younger cats for \u00a35 a month, but you are trapped because no one will start insuring cats as old as yours. </p> <p><strong> Cancelled cheque: Did it check out?</strong></p> <p>I paid for shares in a new company with a \u00a32,000 building society cheque. The offer was cancelled, and the cheque returned. I thought, wrongly, that at least my money was safely back in my account. Just in time I stopped myself from tearing it up and, when I asked at the branch what would have happened, I was told: 'You would have lost \u00a32,000.'<strong><br>LS, Leicester </strong></p> <p>That is wrong. If you had destroyed the returned cheque, or it had been stolen, the money would have been returned to your account once the building society had proved your story. You cannot cancel third-party cheques but the building society can, if you report one lost or stolen. You lose interest between taking the cheque and paying it back in, so you should get it back into your account fast. </p> <p>\u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

If your solicitor was at fault for the late payment, you should trying talking to him about compensation for being forced to pay an extra month's interest. Skipton staff were deliberately kept in the dark about the loyalty bonus, as happens with all bonuses, until they arrived for work on 19 July, so no one could have forewarned you. Insurer claws elderly cats My two cats have been insured against vets' bills with DBI Insurance continuously since they were a few months old. They are now aged 11, and the renewal notice shows the premiums are rising by 52 per cent, there is a mandatory excess of \u00a340 and I then have to pay 35 per cent of any remaining bill. Previously, the company charged the same premium regardless of the animal's age and whether or not the owner lived in a low-cost area, as I do. I was prepared to pay over the odds for insuring my cats when they were young on the tacit understanding that cover would continue at a reasonable cost as my pets grew older. DBI's abrupt change of policy means that I am penalised. JT, Beaumaris DBI (Dog Breeders Insurance) says premiums were bumped up by its new owner, Cornhill, because it had been trading unprofitably. This is no consolation to policyholders like you who were not expecting such a leap in cost. DBI says insuring a cat of 11 is \u00a37.55 a month. Primary Direct insures younger cats for \u00a35 a month, but you are trapped because no one will start insuring cats as old as yours. Cancelled cheque: Did it check out? I paid for shares in a new company with a \u00a32,000 building society cheque. The offer was cancelled, and the cheque returned. I thought, wrongly, that at least my money was safely back in my account. Just in time I stopped myself from tearing it up and, when I asked at the branch what would have happened, I was told: 'You would have lost \u00a32,000.' LS, Leicester That is wrong. If you had destroyed the returned cheque, or it had been stolen, the money would have been returned to your account once the building society had proved your story. You cannot cancel third-party cheques but the building society can, if you report one lost or stolen. You lose interest between taking the cheque and paying it back in, so you should get it back into your account fast. \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

A scab is a two-legged animal with a corkscrew soul, a waterlogged brain and a combination backbone of jelly and glue. When a scab comes down the street men turn their backs, the angels weep in Heaven, and the devil shuts the gates of hell to keep him out.' </p> <p>Some editions are becoming scarce, notably 'end-of-an-era' plates. Some were presented to redundant miners by National Coal Board officials as they stepped out of the lift cage after their last shift. Outraged, many smashed them on the spot. </p> <p>One such rarity is the first mining plate made by Ed-wards &amp; Lockett, the Stoke-on-Trent firm that has since issued about 600 editions of plates - nearly all that exist. Published in 1982 for the NUM, the plate marks the closure that year of the Bilsthorpe, Nottingham-shire, colliery.

Loftus, who deals in both the secondary and ex-factory markets, sells NUM plates that are still in stock for \u00a314-\u00a317 - a low-price policy that has won him an exclusive concession from the NUM to sell plates commissioned by the union, he says. </p> <p>Some other dealers at Midlands weekend markets charge \u00a320 for run-of-the-mill mining plates.

Loftus offered me as many of them as I wanted for \u00a31 each. Some plates are numbered but do not reveal the size of the edition.

'We've always been completely impartial.' </p> <p>Loftus worked for more than two years down the pit, from the age of 17. The memory of it arouses little passion in him but the fate of his father does. He died from emphysema aged 62 after working 36 years at Bilsthorpe, most of the time at the coal face. </p> <p>'I'm bitter,' says Loftus, a Labour councillor in Newark, 'and these plates are one way of keeping the memory of the miners alive.' Instead of smashing his Bilsthorpe 'end of an era' plate - now the most valuable - Adrian's father gave it to him.

The trust has access to gearing worth up to 45 per cent of its asset value, meaning it can borrow this money to invest in shares that the trust could not otherwise afford to buy.

Bells &amp; whistles: A conventional (ordinary shares only) trust run by Alex Darwall who, while running Jupiter's split capital European investment trust, has achieved growth of 210 per cent over the last two years and 109 per cent in the last year. How it works: Darwall will pick companies both inside and outside the eurozone. The trust has access to gearing worth up to 45 per cent of its asset value, meaning it can borrow this money to invest in shares that the trust could not otherwise afford to buy. This will enhance returns to investors provided the shares rise, but will increase investors' losses if share prices fall. The trust has a fixed lifespan which ends on 29 February, 2008.

On entering a house, the estate agent's key should turn smoothly in the lock and the lavatory should never be positioned opposite the front door. </p> <p>It is apparently not only the way in which the house is designed and decorated that can affect your future happiness but fundamental issues such as the property's history, its position in relation to the sun and the wind, the amount of greenery surrounding it, its proximity to water as well as the time and geographical direction of your actual move. The list of dos and don'ts is long and a good place to start is at <a href=\"http://www.fengshuisite.com\">www.fengshuisite.com</a> followed by a consultation relating specifically to you and your property. </p> <p>Panchang is the Indian alternative with origins from 4,000 BC. This system uses the exact position of the Moon, the planets and zodiac signs at the time and place of birth to formulate a chart. </p> <p>Panchang is a way for the individual to use timing to their advantage by, for example, calculating the best time to buy and sell property. Sam Chaffey consulted Michael Geary, a Panchang astro-loger, about her move from Devon. </p> <p>Sam explained: \"The property in Devon had slipped into negative equity and was proving impossible to sell. I was distraught at the prospect of not being able to move. However, Michael suggested an auspicious time to put the house on the market, and within the week we had found a buyer at the original asking price.' The sale went without a hitch. </p> <p>According to Geary, timing is the key to success. 'For example,' he said, 'I advised one person on her house move recently. Her consultation suggested that she postpone putting the house on the market for a few weeks. She did so and the sale finalised at 40 per cent above the original asking price.' </p> <p>But so too have a lot of house sales in the past year or so. This particular divination is available at <a href=\"http://www.panchang.com,\">www.panchang.com,</a> where it claims to be able to 'ease the stress' of a house move. </p> <p>The origins of tarot are uncertain, although it seems to have started as a card game handed down by gypsies travelling through Europe in the thirteenth century. Tarot readings are a selection of picture cards picked from a pack of 72 which allude to the fortune of the person asking a specific question. </p> <p>Catriona was considering a move out of London to a cottage in Tyttenhanger, near St Albans. The reasons for moving to this area included an easy commute, good schools and the benefits of country living. The property seemed perfect. 'It had loads of character, was beautifully decorated and backed on to open fields,' she said. But at \u00a3275,000 it was more than their budget allowed so they put in an offer of \u00a3260,000 which was turned down. </p> <p>Catriona first consulted her tarot reader on whether the move to St Albans was auspicious. The reader used a three-card spread as follows: the Three of Cups showed a happy group, seen as Catriona and her family. The second revealed the Hierophant, a card with strong religious overtones and therefore relevant to the city of St Albans. The third card represents the answer to the question asked, and in this case was the Hermit interpreted as Catriona's isolation if she left London. </p> <p>The process was repeated asking whether Catriona should move to Tyttenhanger. The Hermit came up again as the first card which reinforced the tarot reader's concerns. The Ace of Pentacles related to the area and the outcome was the Five of Cups, a card of regret which pictured three cups having fallen down. In view of the previous reading, the tarot reader felt that this was very worrying and advised caution. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the property was under offer twice from other buyers, but these potential deals fell through before Catriona spotted it advertised at a lower price. The cards were consulted again, this time with the actual cottage in mind to decide on whether Catriona should put in another offer. </p> <p>The third tarot card in the reading showed the King of Cups whose throne is floating on water which greatly troubled the reader; a definite sign of unstable foundations. Catriona pressed the estate agent for further details as to why the house sale appeared to be so problematic. It was revealed that a property developer had bought the land behind the cottage and, rather than surrounding themselves with open fields, Catriona and her family could have found themselves on a housing estate. They decided to stay in London. 'I will always consult the tarot,' says Catriona. 'But it's only relevant if you are going to act on it.' </p> <p>The tarot reader explained that often the symbolism depicted on the card only served to strengthen convictions which you had already. 'It's all about interpretation and often it can make you feel as though fortune is smiling on you,' she says. </p> <p>There are other divinations you can consult when considering a move. Like Panchang, astrology, or the zodiac as we see it in horoscopes, usually relates to the time and place of your birth. </p> <p>An astrological chart is drawn up focusing on birth as the most important symbolic time of life. From this, natal astrology dictates whether it is the right time to buy, sell or move, according to your individual chart. Horary astrology depends on the time at which a particular decision is made as to whether or not it is fortuitous. For example, an offer has been made on my flat, should I accept it? </p> <p>Electional astrology makes it possible to elect a specific time to do something. For instance, completing on a certain date at a certain time although you would have to find an understanding solicitor to comply with this. Obviously, a combination of all three types of astrology is used to give a more detailed response to various questions and dilemmas. </p> <p>Patricia, an astrologer advised her client who was considering a move from a flat to a larger property in a more affordable area to wait as something much closer to home seemed to be symbolised in her chart. Soon after wards, the flat below came up for sale offering the possibility of a cheap conversion and a less costly move while staying in the same area. </p> <p>Numerology gives individuals a life path number which is reached by a calculation involving date of birth. House numbers come into play by suggesting a mood for the house which is or is not compatible with the life path number of its occupant. </p> <p>Vaastu shastra is similar to feng shui and concentrates on the flow of energy through your body and your surroundings. </p> <p>So next time you are gazing through an estate agent's window and you think you might fancy a change, think about where the house is positioned with regard to the elements and consider the time at which your birth dictates you should move. </p> <p>Consult the tarot cards and beware the unlucky Hanged Man, and finally, if your life path number is four, don't even think of moving into number 57 because, among other things, you'd have to paint it violet to restore the karma and secure happy, fruitful relationships.</p>",

Catriona was considering a move out of London to a cottage in Tyttenhanger, near St Albans. The reasons for moving to this area included an easy commute, good schools and the benefits of country living. The property seemed perfect. 'It had loads of character, was beautifully decorated and backed on to open fields,' she said. But at \u00a3275,000 it was more than their budget allowed so they put in an offer of \u00a3260,000 which was turned down. Catriona first consulted her tarot reader on whether the move to St Albans was auspicious. The reader used a three-card spread as follows: the Three of Cups showed a happy group, seen as Catriona and her family. The second revealed the Hierophant, a card with strong religious overtones and therefore relevant to the city of St Albans. The third card represents the answer to the question asked, and in this case was the Hermit interpreted as Catriona's isolation if she left London. The process was repeated asking whether Catriona should move to Tyttenhanger. The Hermit came up again as the first card which reinforced the tarot reader's concerns. The Ace of Pentacles related to the area and the outcome was the Five of Cups, a card of regret which pictured three cups having fallen down. In view of the previous reading, the tarot reader felt that this was very worrying and advised caution. Meanwhile, the property was under offer twice from other buyers, but these potential deals fell through before Catriona spotted it advertised at a lower price. The cards were consulted again, this time with the actual cottage in mind to decide on whether Catriona should put in another offer. The third tarot card in the reading showed the King of Cups whose throne is floating on water which greatly troubled the reader; a definite sign of unstable foundations. Catriona pressed the estate agent for further details as to why the house sale appeared to be so problematic. It was revealed that a property developer had bought the land behind the cottage and, rather than surrounding themselves with open fields, Catriona and her family could have found themselves on a housing estate. They decided to stay in London. 'I will always consult the tarot,' says Catriona. 'But it's only relevant if you are going to act on it.' The tarot reader explained that often the symbolism depicted on the card only served to strengthen convictions which you had already. 'It's all about interpretation and often it can make you feel as though fortune is smiling on you,' she says. There are other divinations you can consult when considering a move. Like Panchang, astrology, or the zodiac as we see it in horoscopes, usually relates to the time and place of your birth. An astrological chart is drawn up focusing on birth as the most important symbolic time of life. From this, natal astrology dictates whether it is the right time to buy, sell or move, according to your individual chart. Horary astrology depends on the time at which a particular decision is made as to whether or not it is fortuitous. For example, an offer has been made on my flat, should I accept it? Electional astrology makes it possible to elect a specific time to do something. For instance, completing on a certain date at a certain time although you would have to find an understanding solicitor to comply with this. Obviously, a combination of all three types of astrology is used to give a more detailed response to various questions and dilemmas. Patricia, an astrologer advised her client who was considering a move from a flat to a larger property in a more affordable area to wait as something much closer to home seemed to be symbolised in her chart. Soon after wards, the flat below came up for sale offering the possibility of a cheap conversion and a less costly move while staying in the same area. Numerology gives individuals a life path number which is reached by a calculation involving date of birth. House numbers come into play by suggesting a mood for the house which is or is not compatible with the life path number of its occupant. Vaastu shastra is similar to feng shui and concentrates on the flow of energy through your body and your surroundings. So next time you are gazing through an estate agent's window and you think you might fancy a change, think about where the house is positioned with regard to the elements and consider the time at which your birth dictates you should move. Consult the tarot cards and beware the unlucky Hanged Man, and finally, if your life path number is four, don't even think of moving into number 57 because, among other things, you'd have to paint it violet to restore the karma and secure happy, fruitful relationships.",

His biggest win was \u00a31,000, though for the last two months he has not been so lucky. He likes Premium Bonds because of the gambling aspect, the chance to win \u00a31m without losing his stake.

      "body": "<p>Scientists have put a date to Armageddon. It will occur on 21 September 2030, when earth is in danger of being hit by an asteroid.</p> <p>The newly discovered threat to global civilisation is called 2000 SG344, and it could strike our planet with a force 100 times greater than that released by the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, astronomers have calculated.</p> <p>Their announcement, posted yesterday on the internet by the International Astronomical Union, is the first formal public prediction of a potential collision with a piece of cosmic debris and it arises from a scientific review process designed to eliminate premature predictions of celestial calamities.</p> <p>Two years ago, asteroid watchers triggered worldwide alarm by announcing that a mile-wide asteroid called XF-11 might hit earth in 2028. A few days later they had to withdraw the forecast, after calculations showed the object posed no danger to our planet.</p> <p>The new prediction is unlikely to be withdrawn, however - for it has been carefully duplicated by scientists at several research centres. The object was recently discovered trailing in Earth's orbit around the sun by astronomers using the 3.6-metre Canada-France-Hawaii telescope on the island of Hawaii.</p> <p>However, the probability that it might hit Earth in 2030 was not realised until last week when Paul Chodas, at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, began studying its orbit. There was a small but definite risk, about one in 500, that its orbit, and Earth's, might coincide on 21 September 2030 - a danger that has been verified over the past 72 hours by a group of International Astronomical Union experts in Italy, Finland and the US.</p> <p>'This is a first for us,' said space scientist David Morrison at Nasa's Ames Research Center, chairman of the Astronomical Union committee. 'We have never before had a prediction at this high level of probability. In the past we have talked about 1 in 10,000 or 1 in a million.'</p> <p>On a newly devised 10-point scale for grading potential impact hazards, known as the Torino scale, the object gets a rating of only 1 - mainly because of its relatively small size and uncertain chances of striking Earth. Any rating on the Torino scale means an object merits careful monitoring. This is the first astronomical object to be given full, formal designation on the Torino scale.</p> <p>In revealing their concerns, astronomers are walking a delicate tightrope between prudent secrecy and disclosure, balancing possible ridicule against the demands of public responsibility. The danger of having to make an embarrassing withdrawal about their claim is low, however, thanks to the quick action of the the technical review panel which has confirmed Chodas's calculations, and by the careful conservative language used in their announcement.</p> <p>It is quite possible, say the astronomers, that SG344 may prove to be nothing more than a discarded Saturn rocket booster, lost in space since the days of the Apollo moon programme. Nasa records show that nine Saturn V rockets were launched toward the moon in the Apollo programme. In each case, spent rocket boosters ended up in uncharted orbits around the sun. If SG344 was to turn out to be one of these, it would simply burn up on entering our atmosphere.</p> <p>'It could be an old rocket we sent up to launch a satellite decades ago that has come back to haunt us,' said Brian Marsden, director of the Minor Planets Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge. 'At least, we can't exclude the possibility.'</p> <p>However, most experts believe the SG344 is most probably an asteroid - with a diameter of between 100 and 230 feet, the size of an office block. If such an object were to hit Earth, the consequences would be severe, though not globally devastating.</p> <p>If made of stone and iron, as are many asteroids and meteorites, SG344 would explode with an estimated energy of two megatons, But if it was a loose conglomeration of stones and gravel, as several experts believe may the case, it might easily disintegrate as it skims into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not enough is known about the asteroid. 'That is our problem - we don't know what it is,\" said Donald Yeomans, manager of Nasa's Near Earth Object Program office at JPL. 'All we know is how bright it appears to be, and so we have to guess to come up with a diameter.'</p> <p>It is thought that there are more than 100,000 asteroids of the estimated size of SG344 scattered around the solar system. A few approach the Earth, and on average one strikes our planet every 100 years, the last resulting in the 20-megaton blast that levelled 700 square miles of forests of central Siberia in 1908, the Tunguska explosion.

      "bodyText": "Scientists have put a date to Armageddon. It will occur on 21 September 2030, when earth is in danger of being hit by an asteroid. The newly discovered threat to global civilisation is called 2000 SG344, and it could strike our planet with a force 100 times greater than that released by the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, astronomers have calculated. Their announcement, posted yesterday on the internet by the International Astronomical Union, is the first formal public prediction of a potential collision with a piece of cosmic debris and it arises from a scientific review process designed to eliminate premature predictions of celestial calamities. Two years ago, asteroid watchers triggered worldwide alarm by announcing that a mile-wide asteroid called XF-11 might hit earth in 2028. A few days later they had to withdraw the forecast, after calculations showed the object posed no danger to our planet. The new prediction is unlikely to be withdrawn, however - for it has been carefully duplicated by scientists at several research centres. The object was recently discovered trailing in Earth's orbit around the sun by astronomers using the 3.6-metre Canada-France-Hawaii telescope on the island of Hawaii. However, the probability that it might hit Earth in 2030 was not realised until last week when Paul Chodas, at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, began studying its orbit. There was a small but definite risk, about one in 500, that its orbit, and Earth's, might coincide on 21 September 2030 - a danger that has been verified over the past 72 hours by a group of International Astronomical Union experts in Italy, Finland and the US. 'This is a first for us,' said space scientist David Morrison at Nasa's Ames Research Center, chairman of the Astronomical Union committee. 'We have never before had a prediction at this high level of probability. In the past we have talked about 1 in 10,000 or 1 in a million.' On a newly devised 10-point scale for grading potential impact hazards, known as the Torino scale, the object gets a rating of only 1 - mainly because of its relatively small size and uncertain chances of striking Earth. Any rating on the Torino scale means an object merits careful monitoring. This is the first astronomical object to be given full, formal designation on the Torino scale. In revealing their concerns, astronomers are walking a delicate tightrope between prudent secrecy and disclosure, balancing possible ridicule against the demands of public responsibility. The danger of having to make an embarrassing withdrawal about their claim is low, however, thanks to the quick action of the the technical review panel which has confirmed Chodas's calculations, and by the careful conservative language used in their announcement. It is quite possible, say the astronomers, that SG344 may prove to be nothing more than a discarded Saturn rocket booster, lost in space since the days of the Apollo moon programme. Nasa records show that nine Saturn V rockets were launched toward the moon in the Apollo programme. In each case, spent rocket boosters ended up in uncharted orbits around the sun. If SG344 was to turn out to be one of these, it would simply burn up on entering our atmosphere. 'It could be an old rocket we sent up to launch a satellite decades ago that has come back to haunt us,' said Brian Marsden, director of the Minor Planets Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge. 'At least, we can't exclude the possibility.' However, most experts believe the SG344 is most probably an asteroid - with a diameter of between 100 and 230 feet, the size of an office block. If such an object were to hit Earth, the consequences would be severe, though not globally devastating. If made of stone and iron, as are many asteroids and meteorites, SG344 would explode with an estimated energy of two megatons, But if it was a loose conglomeration of stones and gravel, as several experts believe may the case, it might easily disintegrate as it skims into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, not enough is known about the asteroid. 'That is our problem - we don't know what it is,\" said Donald Yeomans, manager of Nasa's Near Earth Object Program office at JPL. 'All we know is how bright it appears to be, and so we have to guess to come up with a diameter.' It is thought that there are more than 100,000 asteroids of the estimated size of SG344 scattered around the solar system. A few approach the Earth, and on average one strikes our planet every 100 years, the last resulting in the 20-megaton blast that levelled 700 square miles of forests of central Siberia in 1908, the Tunguska explosion. A blast like that in a heavily developed area - California or Japan - could result in millions of deaths. In the next few months, astronomers will try to gather more data about SG344 in a bid to learn more about its orbit and to determine more accurately its chances of hitting earth - though they have had little success so far. Future observations may yield better data, however, allowing scientists to predict more accurately its chances of striking earth. But the object is slowly moving away from us, which means astronomers have only a short time to gather more data and so refine their orbital calculations. If they fail, they will have to wait until 2028, when SG344 comes into range again. In such circumstances, earth will have very little time to act if it turns out that the asteroid is doomed to collide with us. \"My own feeling is that an object this small would not be worth a great effort to deflect it, even if it is on course toward Earth,' added David Morrison. 'I don't see an argument for any sort of crash effort.' It remains to be seen if people agree in 2030. ...it happened before: our planet is struck regularly by objects crashing down on us from outer space. The best recorded of these events occurred in 1908 when a small asteroid, about 300 feet in diameter, exploded high above the Tunguska River valley in Siberia, producing a brilliant blue fireball that knocked people off their feet 40 miles away, and flattened millions of trees.",

France's deepening BSE crisis has dealt a blow to a country that prides himself on taking more precautions than any other nation to make the meat safe to eat. Last month a French meat trader and his son spent a week in jail after being accused of knowingly selling a BSE-infected cow to an abattoir. They had tried to hide the sick animal in a batch of healthy ones.

      "bodyText": "Singapore Airlines last night announced it would offer \u00a3290,000 compensation each to the families of the 81 passengers and crew who died when one of its jumbo jets crashed in Taiwan. The airline accepted that its experienced Malaysian pilot, Chee Kong Foong, 41, made a 'dreadful error' by trying to take off from the wrong runway at Taipei airport on Tuesday. Two Britons, Florida-based teacher Margaret Blanche Rabley, 62, originally from Risca, near Newport, South Wales, and Hong Kong-based Tak Wing Loo, 27, are presumed dead, the airline said. Two other Britons, Paul Blanchon, 38, from Stokesley, North Yorkshire, and US-based Steve Courteney, 45, were among the 98 survivors. The airline, which had earlier offered \u00a318,000 to the families of those who died and \u00a33,400 to the injured, said it would also pay the medical expenses of the injured and discuss further compensation with them later. Its Los Angeles-bound Flight SQ006 broke into three pieces and burst into flames after straying on to a runway which was being repaired and slamming into cranes. The airline's deputy chairman, Cheong Choong Kong, said it accepted full responsibility for the disaster, which was due to 'pilot error'. He said: 'They are our pilots, it was our aircraft, and the aircraft should not have been on that runway. There is no point in concealing anything and we won't.' But he added: 'The pilots all along believed they were on the correct runway, but they now know that they weren't.' He said he believed the pilots, who have been told not to leave Taiwan, were well rested before the flight. Captain Foong, who survived, had been with the airline 21 years, has 11,000 hours' flight experience and knew the airport well. Questions are now being raised about safety at the airport which did not have ground radar to monitor the whereabouts of planes on the ground. There are also suggestions that lights were left operating on the runway that was under repair, and there was no barrier to prevent planes going on to it.",

Doctors want to ensure that medical practice is not further restricted by any change in the law. Those who oppose abortion and are campaigning for a referendum on the issue want to see a blanket ban inserted into the Irish constitution.</p> <p>The committee's report will land on Ahern's desk this week. It is expected to lay out three possible courses of action. The first would involve holding a referendum on a plan to allow a pregnancy to be terminated where there is a specific threat to the life of the woman involved. This would exclude any threat by her to commit suicide. If passed, that would in effect roll back the 1992 ruling by the Irish Supreme Court that a 14-year-old girl, pregnant as a result of rape, should be allowed an abortion.</p> <p>The second option is to make no change.</p> <p>The third, and most controversial, is to allow pregnancies to be terminated in Irish hospitals in limited circumstances, but 'pro-life' groups say this would 'open the floodgates' to abortion on demand.</p> <p>There have been reports that Ahern favours a referendum. He is under intense pressure from four independent deputies in the Irish Parliament, on whose support his minority government depends, to go down this road. But he knows such a decision would plunge the country into a bitterly divisive campaign, with the very real possibility that any wording put forward for a change in the constitution would be defeated. Anti-abortion groups would see it as too liberal, while those in favour of a woman's right to choose would see it as too restrictive.</p> <p>One of the writers in The Irish Journey described returning home during the last abortion referendum to find 'I had done something which divided the country'. Perhaps the book will help put a human face on the issue, but we are a long way from ensuring that an Irish woman facing a crisis pregnancy is treated with dignity and care in her own country.</p>",

It is expected to lay out three possible courses of action. The first would involve holding a referendum on a plan to allow a pregnancy to be terminated where there is a specific threat to the life of the woman involved. This would exclude any threat by her to commit suicide. If passed, that would in effect roll back the 1992 ruling by the Irish Supreme Court that a 14-year-old girl, pregnant as a result of rape, should be allowed an abortion. The second option is to make no change. The third, and most controversial, is to allow pregnancies to be terminated in Irish hospitals in limited circumstances, but 'pro-life' groups say this would 'open the floodgates' to abortion on demand. There have been reports that Ahern favours a referendum. He is under intense pressure from four independent deputies in the Irish Parliament, on whose support his minority government depends, to go down this road. But he knows such a decision would plunge the country into a bitterly divisive campaign, with the very real possibility that any wording put forward for a change in the constitution would be defeated. Anti-abortion groups would see it as too liberal, while those in favour of a woman's right to choose would see it as too restrictive. One of the writers in The Irish Journey described returning home during the last abortion referendum to find 'I had done something which divided the country'. Perhaps the book will help put a human face on the issue, but we are a long way from ensuring that an Irish woman facing a crisis pregnancy is treated with dignity and care in her own country.",

Tony Blair practised as a barrister there, and Irvine was his pupil-master.</p> <p>Government figures re-leased to The Observer reveal that the Lord Chancellor has used barristers at his old chambers more than twice as often as any others.</p> <p>Since the election, Irvine's former colleagues have been paid \u00a3125,000 by his department alone. Some three-quarters of this sum has gone to Philip Sales, who in Novem ber 1997 was controversially given the coveted post of Treasury 'devil' - a barrister who is used to give legal advice to departments right across Whitehall.</p> <p>According to an official at the Attorney-General's office, as well as the \u00a390,000 Sales has earned from Irvine's deparment, he has made more than \u00a3750,000 from work given to him from Treasury solicitors representing other parts of government. In addition, Sales - who charges \u00a3150 an hour - has been given lucrative work directly from other departments.</p> <p>In total, it is estimated he has earned more than \u00a31m from advising government departments since his former colleague Irvine became Lord Chancellor. Other barristers at 11 King's Bench Walk who have been given work by Irvine include James Goudie, who used to chair the Society of Labour Lawyers.</p> <p>Opposition MPs have dubbed Sales a 'Labour millionaire crony' and believe the use of Lord Chancellor's former chambers is a clear case of 'jobs for the boys'.</p> <p>Shadow Attorney-General Edward Garnier said: 'These disclosures highlight the sheer arrogance of the Lord Chancellor who appoints barristers from his old chambers to plum jobs and cares not a jot about public disquiet. Once again we have an example of cronyism infecting a Labour administration that promised one thing in opposition and has given us another in government.'</p> <p>The appointment of Sales as Treasury 'devil' was contentious as it used secret 'soundings' in the legal profession, a process condemned by Labour in opposition as a relic of the 'old boys' network'.</p> <p>Barrister Josephine Hayes took the Government to court, claiming that the process discriminated against women. She alleged Irvine had engineered the choice of one of his own former colleagues for the plum job that is regarded as an almost cer tain route to becoming a High Court judge. Sales, 35 at the time, was regarded as 'exceptionally' young and far less experienced than other front-runners.</p> <p>Despite opposition from senior judges, Hayes obtained details of the 'secret soundings' taken before his appointment, and this forced the Attorney-General to settle in order to prevent an embarrasing court case. The Government paid \u00a35,000 into a charity of Hayes's choice on condition that she did not disclose details of the material she had obtained.</p> <p>Whitehall sources told The Observer that not only was Irvine instrumental in the appointment of Sales but that, even before he was made Treasury 'devil', government lawyers were told to give him work ahead of others.</p> <p>Ministers insist Sales's appointment was made on merit, but the row could not have come at a worse time for Irvine. Later this month he will face the Employment Appeals Tribunal contesting a ruling that found him guilty of sexual discrimination for appointing a friend, Garry Hart, as his special adviser.</p> <p>Earlier this year Irvine was accused of cronyism over his appointment of judges. In July it emerged he made his brother-in-law, Sir Andrew Longmore, an appeal court judge. Last October Irvine also appointed Harry Hodge, husband of Education Minister Margaret Hodge and a longtime member of the Society of Labour Lawyers.</p> <p>A statement from the Lord Chancellor's Department said: 'The department seeks legal advice from a range of counsel, making use of specialists in various areas of law. However, in common with all government departments, we make extensive use of the First Treasury Junior [Philip Sales]. The First Treasury Junior is appointed by the Attorney-General to be available to advise all deparments on public law issues that require counsel's opinion. These figures are reflected in the earnings for 11 Kings Bench Walk Chambers.'</p> <p>Irvine resigned from 11 King's Bench Walk when he took his \u00a3151,000 a year job as Lord Chancellor. He is likely to return there when he leaves the Government. <br><br><a href=\"mailto:antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, has been plunged into a fresh row over cronyism after it emerged that barristers at his former chambers have earned more than \u00a31 million in fees from lucrative government work since the last general election. The disclosures will raise further questions over the intimate legal network surrounding the Lord Chancellor and the chambers he set up at 11 King's Bench Walk at London's Middle Temple. Tony Blair practised as a barrister there, and Irvine was his pupil-master. Government figures re-leased to The Observer reveal that the Lord Chancellor has used barristers at his old chambers more than twice as often as any others. Since the election, Irvine's former colleagues have been paid \u00a3125,000 by his department alone. Some three-quarters of this sum has gone to Philip Sales, who in Novem ber 1997 was controversially given the coveted post of Treasury 'devil' - a barrister who is used to give legal advice to departments right across Whitehall. According to an official at the Attorney-General's office, as well as the \u00a390,000 Sales has earned from Irvine's deparment, he has made more than \u00a3750,000 from work given to him from Treasury solicitors representing other parts of government. In addition, Sales - who charges \u00a3150 an hour - has been given lucrative work directly from other departments. In total, it is estimated he has earned more than \u00a31m from advising government departments since his former colleague Irvine became Lord Chancellor. Other barristers at 11 King's Bench Walk who have been given work by Irvine include James Goudie, who used to chair the Society of Labour Lawyers. Opposition MPs have dubbed Sales a 'Labour millionaire crony' and believe the use of Lord Chancellor's former chambers is a clear case of 'jobs for the boys'. Shadow Attorney-General Edward Garnier said: 'These disclosures highlight the sheer arrogance of the Lord Chancellor who appoints barristers from his old chambers to plum jobs and cares not a jot about public disquiet. Once again we have an example of cronyism infecting a Labour administration that promised one thing in opposition and has given us another in government.' The appointment of Sales as Treasury 'devil' was contentious as it used secret 'soundings' in the legal profession, a process condemned by Labour in opposition as a relic of the 'old boys' network'. Barrister Josephine Hayes took the Government to court, claiming that the process discriminated against women. She alleged Irvine had engineered the choice of one of his own former colleagues for the plum job that is regarded as an almost cer tain route to becoming a High Court judge. Sales, 35 at the time, was regarded as 'exceptionally' young and far less experienced than other front-runners. Despite opposition from senior judges, Hayes obtained details of the 'secret soundings' taken before his appointment, and this forced the Attorney-General to settle in order to prevent an embarrasing court case. The Government paid \u00a35,000 into a charity of Hayes's choice on condition that she did not disclose details of the material she had obtained. Whitehall sources told The Observer that not only was Irvine instrumental in the appointment of Sales but that, even before he was made Treasury 'devil', government lawyers were told to give him work ahead of others. Ministers insist Sales's appointment was made on merit, but the row could not have come at a worse time for Irvine. Later this month he will face the Employment Appeals Tribunal contesting a ruling that found him guilty of sexual discrimination for appointing a friend, Garry Hart, as his special adviser. Earlier this year Irvine was accused of cronyism over his appointment of judges. In July it emerged he made his brother-in-law, Sir Andrew Longmore, an appeal court judge. Last October Irvine also appointed Harry Hodge, husband of Education Minister Margaret Hodge and a longtime member of the Society of Labour Lawyers. A statement from the Lord Chancellor's Department said: 'The department seeks legal advice from a range of counsel, making use of specialists in various areas of law. However, in common with all government departments, we make extensive use of the First Treasury Junior [Philip Sales]. The First Treasury Junior is appointed by the Attorney-General to be available to advise all deparments on public law issues that require counsel's opinion. These figures are reflected in the earnings for 11 Kings Bench Walk Chambers.' Irvine resigned from 11 King's Bench Walk when he took his \u00a3151,000 a year job as Lord Chancellor. He is likely to return there when he leaves the Government. antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

While the problem of youth unemployment has improved - in 1995, young jobless reached 250,000, compared with 100,000 today - the survey found only 71 per cent of men aged between 18 and 24 were active in the labour market compared with 85 per cent in 1975. At the opposite end of the scale, 82 per cent of men aged 60-64 were employed in 1975, while 39 per cent of the same age group were in work today. 'These findings are alarming both for men individually and for the economy as a whole,' said Melanie Howard, a director of the Futures Foundation, which compiled the figures. Even middle-aged men are less likely to be employed than their forefathers. In 1975, 95 per cent of men aged 25-34 were employed, compared with 85 per cent today, while 94 per cent of 35- to 49-year olds and 93 per cent of 50-59-year-olds were working, compared with 85 per cent and 75 per cent today. Jon Philpott, former director of the Employment Policy Institute, blames low employment on decades of corporate ageism, the collapse of traditional industries and the growth of new technology. 'Younger men are increasingly choosing to stay on in higher education but in addition, more men of all ages are clearly deciding to opt out of the labour market altogether,' he said. 'The growth of the new knowledge-based economy means these men find it almost impossible to find long-term work when they eventually try to re-enter the labour market.' A recent retirement survey found most unemployed men aged 55-64 cited 'not needing or wanting another job' or 'no jobs available' as one of the main reasons for their economic inactivity.",

But in an Orwellian twist two decades later the former Belfast IRA commander is deemed by his former comrades as 'unacceptable' even to mediate in a potentially murderous republican dispute. Hughes, a former cellmate of Gerry Adams in Long Kesh, was a hero of the republican movement in 1980 after fasting for 53 days in the struggle for political status. Last Saturday the one-time IRA leader and close confidant of Adams offered himself up as a go-between to stop the intimidation of republican dissenters such as former prisoner turned academic Anthony McIntyre. McIntyre's home in Ballymurphy - the republican estate where Adams grew up - has been picketed by a Sinn Fein-organised crowd on two occasions over the past fortnight simply because he publicly blamed the IRA for murdering Real IRA member Joe O'Connor in the area. The Republican Writers' Group, comprising former IRA prisoners such as McIntyre, has demanded a 'community inquiry' into O'Connor's death. McIntyre and his American partner Carrie Twomey believe the pickets are a precursor to them being driven out of Ballymurphy or even killed. Hughes also said he was prepared to speak to the Real IRA to dissuade them from taking revenge for the murder of O'Connor, who was shot in Ballymurphy on 23 October.

That message is that the use of the gun to sort out political disputes is still legitimate post-Good Friday. This message reinforces the intellectual pool from which armed republicans drink,' McIntyre said. Carrie Twomey, who is six months pregnant, was alone in the house when the pickets descended on her door last Wednesday evening. She called on Bairbre de Brun, Northern Ireland's Health Minister and Sinn Fein Assembly member for the Ballymurphy area, to demand an end to the pickets. 'I am concerned how the stress of the last few weeks has affected my child,' she said. 'If the Health Minister who's from my area is concerned about the health of her constituents, how does that square with her party sending mobs to my house?' The Observer put this question to de Brun's department on Friday but to date the Sinn Fein Minister has failed to reply. Hughes meanwhile, who is still held in high regard by many ordinary IRA members across Ireland, is bewildered over Sinn Fein's entry into a Stormont parliament he once set out to physically destroy. 'The British Army is still occupying Divis Towers on the Falls Road, so why don't they hold pickets about that instead of picketing a republican home such as Anthony's andCarrie's. 'Now they're calling me a dissenter for speaking out in defence of free speech and asking who shot Joe O'Connor.' He added: 'I don't mind being labelled a dissenter, I've been a dissenter all my life.'",

      "body": "<p>When Chris Woodhead quit as Chief Inspector of Schools in England on Thursday, it was as if a high-speed train had come off the rails at last - without serious injury to its driver, who walked off into the private sector. But the resignation en masse the same day of the Scottish exam board was the final episode in the educational equivalent of the Titanic disaster. </p> <p>There was the fog - of administrative incompetence where the left hand did not know what the right was doing. There was the iceberg - the deadlines by which exam results had to be issued. There were the casualties adrift on the ocean - more than 16,000 youngsters with missing or incomplete results. </p> <p>All that was needed to complete the metaphor was the orchestra playing as the ship went down. As it was, the Scottish Executive had good reason for celebration. The political classes, who had built the lumbering Scottish Qualifications Authority in the first place and given it inadequate resources to tackle a task of unusual complexity, had secured their escape. So too had the civil servants. Their lifeboat was the report by consultants which laid the blame for the disaster squarely on the authority's board and management. </p> <p>With one bound the new Education Minister, Jack McConnell, was free of a mess that had threatened to bring down his predecessor Sam Galbraith and had embroiled the late Donald Dewar's administration in controversy. </p> <p>McConnell said: 'The report paints a stark picture of an organisation with significant management weaknesses, and where poor strategic and operational planning led eventually to a data-management crisis from which it could not recover in time. After reading the report, I was appalled by the scale of the organisational failure.' </p> <p>Cynics detected a strong whiff of political whitewash in the failure of the report, by Deloitte &amp;#amp; Touche, to place explicit blame on the politicians and officials who so conspicuously omitted to monitor an authority which they created, in which they had powers to intervene, and for which they were ultimately responsible. Political responsibility, as might have been guessed, was not included in the consultants' terms of reference. </p> <p>Ron Tuck, the authority's chief executive who resigned as the scale of the crisis became apparent, said the report failed to appreciate the scale of the problems facing the authority. Among educationists there is considerable sympathy with this view. As much as managerial failure the new authority suffered from system overload. Or, to prolong the metaphor about disasters, design failure was as much a problem as pilot error. </p> <p>The authority, formed in 1997, was a merger between the Scottish Examination Board and the vocational education council known as Scotvec. </p> <p>The task was daunting. The new authority had to create new units, exams and courses. It had to introduce new qualifications like Scottish Group Awards and Advanced Highers. Many educationists warned at the time that the plans were overly ambitious. </p> <p>A new exam timetable meant pupils faced their final exams later than before. This left less time to mark papers and collate results. A new results certificate was introduced to record everything achieved by pupils during their school career. Teachers complained that the system of internal assessments took up so much time that their core function was threatened. </p> <p>As the authority began its work, it faced considerable 'cultural' problems with 'lots of infighting' between the rival echelons from the two merged bodies. </p> <p>These difficulties flowed into the new management structure which was designed to placate and accommodate individuals, some of them already with senior status. The result was a 27-strong management team including no fewer than 21 heads of unit. </p> <p>Tuck, whose qualifications were described by the consultants as 'modest' for the task ahead, had a consensualist style. His chairman, David Miller, is able but gentlemanly and affable. </p> <p>The management style was by committee. There were few clear lines of responsibility and where they did exist they were fudged. There was no critical path, no process of monitoring, no corporate awareness of the developing crisis even though alarm bells were ringing loudly by March this year. This emerged from internal emails examined by the consultants. One director confessed he was 'rattled' and 'very worried'. </p> <p>When the crisis blew into the open, the response of the authority was to blame individuals within the organisation. The head of the operations unit, Jack Greig, was suspended and charged with gross negligence for failing to plan and prepare staff. The matter was resolved when he accepted retirement. </p> <p>The consultants acknowledge that his department's failures made a major contribution to the authority's problems. But they found that senior managers also had to take a share of the blame. </p> <p>Chief among the department's difficulties was the computer system designed to manage the complex data flowing into the authority by paper, floppy disk and email. This was a classic example of 'garbage in, garbage out'. As the crisis developed, the system sank into anarchy. </p> <p>It left managers unable at any stage to say that all information about candidates and courses had been logged. Documents were lost. Temporary staff were hired and hurled into the breach but management had no time to train them. </p> <p>Serious delays built up over marking. As late as June, 65,000 unmarked scripts had still to be allocated. Markers were asked to process more scripts than agreed, to tighter deadlines and at much shorter notice than in previous years. </p> <p>Scripts were even sent to markers who had declined to take part. So desperate had management become that it refused to take no for answer. </p> <p>One marker sent back almost 100 scripts left in a bag 'which appeared at my back door'. They were sent back but 'one week later more scripts were delivered'. Another marker, who had not taken part in the process for five years, returned from a holiday in Spain to find that a sack of scripts had arrived. </p> <p>The new chairman of the authority is John Ward, chairman of Scottish Homes, who has an impressive record in senior management with IBM. The new chief executive, Bill Morton, has little time in which to fulfil McConnell's pledge that such a fiasco must never happen again. </p> <p>The consultants bleakly warn that the crisis has had a knock-on effect with the processing of data for next year's exams already delayed. Immediate action is needed to ensure that there are adequates staff and other resources, that computer systems are brought up to scratch and that the problems of recruiting markers is tackled sooner rather than later. Most urgent of all, perhaps, is the task of restoring the staff's crushed morale. Without their dedication, the consultants say, the crisis would have been even worse. </p> <p>McConnell will refuse to accept some of the board resignations, and is to set up an independent body, reporting directly to him, to monitor the authority's performance. And when the new management team asks for more resources, it will be pushing on an open door. </p> <p>After all, boards and managers may come and go but politicians must march onwards. The old doctrine of ministerial responsibility - where Ministers took the rap for public servants in exchange for whatever glory was going - has been turned on its head. After a train crash it is always easier to blame the driver than the system.</p>",

There was the fog - of administrative incompetence where the left hand did not know what the right was doing. There was the iceberg - the deadlines by which exam results had to be issued. There were the casualties adrift on the ocean - more than 16,000 youngsters with missing or incomplete results. All that was needed to complete the metaphor was the orchestra playing as the ship went down. As it was, the Scottish Executive had good reason for celebration. The political classes, who had built the lumbering Scottish Qualifications Authority in the first place and given it inadequate resources to tackle a task of unusual complexity, had secured their escape. So too had the civil servants. Their lifeboat was the report by consultants which laid the blame for the disaster squarely on the authority's board and management. With one bound the new Education Minister, Jack McConnell, was free of a mess that had threatened to bring down his predecessor Sam Galbraith and had embroiled the late Donald Dewar's administration in controversy. McConnell said: 'The report paints a stark picture of an organisation with significant management weaknesses, and where poor strategic and operational planning led eventually to a data-management crisis from which it could not recover in time. After reading the report, I was appalled by the scale of the organisational failure.' Cynics detected a strong whiff of political whitewash in the failure of the report, by Deloitte &amp;#amp; Touche, to place explicit blame on the politicians and officials who so conspicuously omitted to monitor an authority which they created, in which they had powers to intervene, and for which they were ultimately responsible. Political responsibility, as might have been guessed, was not included in the consultants' terms of reference. Ron Tuck, the authority's chief executive who resigned as the scale of the crisis became apparent, said the report failed to appreciate the scale of the problems facing the authority. Among educationists there is considerable sympathy with this view. As much as managerial failure the new authority suffered from system overload. Or, to prolong the metaphor about disasters, design failure was as much a problem as pilot error. The authority, formed in 1997, was a merger between the Scottish Examination Board and the vocational education council known as Scotvec. The task was daunting. The new authority had to create new units, exams and courses. It had to introduce new qualifications like Scottish Group Awards and Advanced Highers. Many educationists warned at the time that the plans were overly ambitious. A new exam timetable meant pupils faced their final exams later than before. This left less time to mark papers and collate results. A new results certificate was introduced to record everything achieved by pupils during their school career. Teachers complained that the system of internal assessments took up so much time that their core function was threatened. As the authority began its work, it faced considerable 'cultural' problems with 'lots of infighting' between the rival echelons from the two merged bodies. These difficulties flowed into the new management structure which was designed to placate and accommodate individuals, some of them already with senior status. The result was a 27-strong management team including no fewer than 21 heads of unit. Tuck, whose qualifications were described by the consultants as 'modest' for the task ahead, had a consensualist style. His chairman, David Miller, is able but gentlemanly and affable. The management style was by committee. There were few clear lines of responsibility and where they did exist they were fudged. There was no critical path, no process of monitoring, no corporate awareness of the developing crisis even though alarm bells were ringing loudly by March this year. This emerged from internal emails examined by the consultants. One director confessed he was 'rattled' and 'very worried'. When the crisis blew into the open, the response of the authority was to blame individuals within the organisation. The head of the operations unit, Jack Greig, was suspended and charged with gross negligence for failing to plan and prepare staff. The matter was resolved when he accepted retirement. The consultants acknowledge that his department's failures made a major contribution to the authority's problems. But they found that senior managers also had to take a share of the blame. Chief among the department's difficulties was the computer system designed to manage the complex data flowing into the authority by paper, floppy disk and email. This was a classic example of 'garbage in, garbage out'. As the crisis developed, the system sank into anarchy. It left managers unable at any stage to say that all information about candidates and courses had been logged. Documents were lost. Temporary staff were hired and hurled into the breach but management had no time to train them. Serious delays built up over marking. As late as June, 65,000 unmarked scripts had still to be allocated. Markers were asked to process more scripts than agreed, to tighter deadlines and at much shorter notice than in previous years. Scripts were even sent to markers who had declined to take part. So desperate had management become that it refused to take no for answer. One marker sent back almost 100 scripts left in a bag 'which appeared at my back door'. They were sent back but 'one week later more scripts were delivered'. Another marker, who had not taken part in the process for five years, returned from a holiday in Spain to find that a sack of scripts had arrived. The new chairman of the authority is John Ward, chairman of Scottish Homes, who has an impressive record in senior management with IBM. The new chief executive, Bill Morton, has little time in which to fulfil McConnell's pledge that such a fiasco must never happen again. The consultants bleakly warn that the crisis has had a knock-on effect with the processing of data for next year's exams already delayed. Immediate action is needed to ensure that there are adequates staff and other resources, that computer systems are brought up to scratch and that the problems of recruiting markers is tackled sooner rather than later. Most urgent of all, perhaps, is the task of restoring the staff's crushed morale. Without their dedication, the consultants say, the crisis would have been even worse. McConnell will refuse to accept some of the board resignations, and is to set up an independent body, reporting directly to him, to monitor the authority's performance. And when the new management team asks for more resources, it will be pushing on an open door. After all, boards and managers may come and go but politicians must march onwards. The old doctrine of ministerial responsibility - where Ministers took the rap for public servants in exchange for whatever glory was going - has been turned on its head. After a train crash it is always easier to blame the driver than the system.",

      "body": "<p>The hapless citizen had only one concern: the state of the weather. Why were we having gales and storms, he wanted to know? Could they possibly be due to the impiety of the nation? </p> <p>The questions were of such pressing concern that the poor amateur meteorologist carefully carved them on a lead tablet - and then deposited it at a Roman oracle 2,400 years ago. </p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, is not recorded. Only the tablet has been recovered. Yet the questions it posed are intriguing - for they suggest that humans have always thought the weather is odd, and that we tend to blame its quirks on our own behaviour. </p> <p>Two millennia ago, bungled sacrifices, strange omens and sin among senators took the rap for floods and downpours. Today we have a different scapegoat: the carbon dioxide that is pouring from our factories and power stations. This is the new weather bogeyman, the climatic culprit responsible for last week's storms that deluged Shrewsbury, York, and Worcester; blocked rail lines and roads; and ruined thousands of houses with rising flood water. </p> <p>'Carbon dioxide emissions are the main drivers of climate change,' announced Environment Secretary Michael Meacher. 'We should greatly speed up our shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.' But not every scientist is convinced about this neat connection between storm and industry. One increasingly vociferous group has started to argue that many climatologists have failed to take proper account of a key aspect of the problem: the behaviour of our climate in prehistoric times. </p> <p>'If you take a deeper, geological perspective, you have to consider another culprit - the last Ice Age,' said geographer Dr David Evans, of Glasgow University. 'Most current climate studies fail to do this.' </p> <p>The last full Ice Age ended more than 10,000 years ago, though the planet is still visited by lesser periods of cooling - the most recent being the Little Ice Age that began during the late sixteenth century and which did not end until the early years of the twentieth. During the Little Ice Age's most intense periods, Ethiopia was regularly struck by blizzards and crops frequently failed across Europe while Britain was frequently affected by Arctic weather. </p> <p>For example, on New Year's Day 1684, John Evelyn recorded that the Thames was frozen over so thickly 'as to beare not onely streetes of boothes in which they roasted meates and had divers shops of wares quite acrosse as in a towne but coaches, carts and horses passed over'. </p> <p>The Severn Estuary and the Wash also iced over while the resulting agricultural devastation wrecked the Scottish economy, contributing - some say - to the country's decision to agree to the Union of Parliaments in 1707 (though bribery by the perfidious English was also involved). </p> <p>The little ice age was almost certainly caused by a change in the sun's activity, researchers now believe. Solar radiation continuously batters the upper atmosphere and warms it. However, the sun's output fluctuates in a series of cycles, and when several of these cycles coincide, solar radiation can rise or drop dramatically. When that happens, the planet will heat up, or cool down. Importantly, from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, astronomers recorded very few sunspots, while the Northern Lights were rarely seen - indicating that solar activity was low at this time, and that our climate would have been chilled. </p> <p>'The more closely we look at the Little Ice Age, the earlier it seems to have started and the later it appears to have finished,' added Evans. </p> <p>'In Iceland, glaciers were still around their maximum size in the early years of the twentieth century, and have only been shrinking since then. Those shrinking ice sheets has nothing to do with CO 2 levels and everything to do with the end of the Little Ice Age, I believe.' </p> <p>Scientists have been able to study past climates by analysing samples of ancient, buried ice. From these, they conclude that over the past two million years little Ice Ages have been followed by aftermaths that were rarely marked by calm, gradual rises in global temperatures, but were instead disfigured with jagged fluctuations in weather, just like the ones that are now being experienced. </p> <p>'Ancient climate records suggest one thing about the last century's weather patterns - that they are very similar and that there is therefore little evidence to support the idea that human activities, particularly those involving carbon dioxide production, have been affecting matters very much,' added Evans. </p> <p>'That does not mean they will not do so in future.' </p> <p>The issue is not about global warming, of course. No one doubts that it is occurring. The Arctic is estimated to have warmed by up to 6 C over the past 30 years, while its ice covering has dropped from 10ft to 6ft. Similarly, weather patterns have become more and more extreme, from tornadoes to droughts, and from floods to heatwaves. </p> <p>Nor is there any dispute that carbon dioxide levels have risen. Records show they have increased from 280 parts per million to 360 over the past two centuries. </p> <p>But is this increased carbon dioxide, trapping more and more sunlight, causing the planet to overheat - and if so, is it the cause of global warming? </p> <p>The climate gainsayers think not. 'I simply don't accept that humans are solely responsible for global warming,' said Professor John Lowe, of Royal Holloway College, London. 'On the other hand, by pumping out more and more carbon dioxide, we are definitely modifying an already highly sensitive situation. That cannot be denied.' </p> <p>This view is backed by climate history researchers at Newcastle and Exeter universities who have studied rainfall records for the past 1,000 years by analysing the width of growth rings in cave stalagmites. These reveal a number of sustained periods of wet and stormy conditions have occurred in that period. </p> <p>'Our research suggests that British rainfall is naturally highly variable,' said geographer Dr Andy Baker, of Newcastle University. 'We have shown that nature is able to repeat current events without the help of global warming.' Nevertheless, Baker added a crucial caveat: that further increases in global temperature, 'could exaggerate the natural variations and could create even more severe bouts of flooding'. </p> <p>In other words, most of the so-called climate change that we are witnessing is the result not of rising CO 2 levels but of natural climate variation, most of it associated with the recent end of the Little Ice Age. This does not mean industrial emissions will not have an impact in future, however. </p> <p>In addition, many climatologists disagree that industrial emissions are not having an impact. 'We are now seeing really large variations in the weather,' said Dr Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at East Anglia University. </p> <p>'There is no way that these fluctuations are being caused only by warming after the Little Ice Age. That is quite insufficient to explain the weather changes we have seen since the 1980s. Only the input of greenhouse gases, and in particular carbon dioxide, can account for the things we have experienced recently.' </p> <p>In addition, the changes that have already been set in motion by global warming - no matter what its cause - promise to be profound. Sea levels have already risen by a foot over the past century, and will rise by a further one to three feet. For countries like Bangladesh that spells disaster. For low-level areas of Britain, it suggests some very uncomfortable times to come. </p> <p>'It will take several hundred years for sea levels to stabilise even if we could stop global warming today,' added Hulme. 'We are going to have to live with the consequences of global warming for centuries.' </p> <p>In fact, both sides agree that reducing carbon dioxide is desirable. It is just that the climate gainsayers do not urge this action with the fervour displayed by other weather experts, or by ecologists who are campaigning not just to save the environment, but to ensure developed countries alter their lifestyles. </p> <p>In other words, most agree that a few percentage cuts in carbon dioxide emissions could do wonders for our weather. </p> <p>Whether they will reduce our impiety is a different matter. </p> <p><strong>Weather myths and sober truths...</strong></p> <p><strong> Noah's Flood</strong> </p> <p> \u2022 Original scapegoat: God. </p> <p>\u2022 Real culprit: Inundation of Black Sea by Mediterranean 8,000 years ago </p> <p> <strong> Viking invasions</strong> </p> <p> \u2022 Original scapegoat: raping and pillaging instincts of Scandinavians. </p> <p>\u2022 Real culprit: exceptional warm period of climate around AD1000 helped Vikings reach Iceland, Greenland and America and settle there. </p> <p> <strong> 1815: The year without a summer</strong> </p> <p> \u2022 Original scapegoat: Day of Judgment. </p> <p>\u2022 Real culprit: Indonesia's Mount Tambora,'which exploded with the force of one billion tonnes of TNT, and coated the planet in inky dust. </p> <p> <strong> Demise of the dinosaurs</strong> </p> <p> \u2022 Original scapegoat: dinosaurs' own stupidity. </p> <p>\u2022 Real culprit: major climatic disaster, probably triggered by the impact of an asteroid.</p>",

The cheap test, based on a simple blood sample, can find cancers as soon as they start forming and has been described as the 'holy grail' of cancer diagnosis. Most cancers have no early symptoms and are only diagnosed after it is too late to treat them effectively. The new DR-70 test, offering early detection, makes successful treatment far more likely. It could save the lives of hundreds of sick people who die because doctors take so long to diagnose a cancer that it becomes untreatable by the time it is identified. The DR-70 test could immediately show which cases are cancer rather than something less serious. Dr Mary Berrington, of the Cancer Research Campaign, said: 'This test is potentially exciting.

A film in which you play a woman who has the power to heal, and I'm interested in what drew you to that story.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, in about 1977 I was in Greece making a film with Jules Dassin called A Dream of Passion, and my agent called me and said that there was this script called Resurrection in which Jesus Christ comes back to Earth as a woman. I said, 'Oooh. I like that.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>So they sent me the script and then the director and the producer came to Athens to meet me and I said that I really liked the idea of the script, but I didn't like the script itself. It was about this school teacher who went to Jerusalem and started bleeding from the palms. It just didn't make an awful lot of sense to me. </p> <p>So I suggested that they did a script about a woman who was a very ordinary housewife in contemporary society who develops some of the abilities that Jesus had - like healing and so forth. At the time I was doing a lot of reading about the re-emergence of the goddess and I liked the idea of reuniting sexuality and religion - a religious figure who was also a sensual being. I sketched out a rough story for them and the director said, well it's a good story but we have the go-ahead from Universal to make this script and did I want to do it. I said no, and they left. </p> <p>When they got back to their hotel the producer called me and said, 'We like your story more than our story, and with your permission we'd like to go back to Universal and ask them if we can start over and find a writer to write your story.' So they did. </p> <p>They found a writer called Lewis John Carlino, who came to my house in New York and stayed with me for about a week, and I told him my life story plus all that I was reading and studying at the time, and out of that came the script that he wrote in, I think, 18 days. We got a new director, Daniel Petrie, and out came Resurrection. </p> <p>I loved it, and it has had a lot of meaning for a lot of people because it deals with death a lot and the passing over to the other side and the experiences of some of the people I had read about who had had near-death experiences, and that was put into the film. So many people have written and told me how they have been with their parents and helped them cross over because of Resurrection. And that's pleased me very deeply.</p> <p>It wasn't very successful because at the time Universal had no faith in it, and they had another film, which I won't mention, that they had already released and made a lot of money from, with an actress in it who they felt had a good opportunity to win the Best Actress award. And my reviews said, 'Just as so-and-so looked to have a clear shot at the Oscar, along comes Ellen Burstyn in Resurrection.' So Universal made an executive decision to put all their money behind the film that they thought was very successful. And it was. And she did win. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>They pulled Resurrection out of the theatres, so it was running in New York and I was nominated for the Oscar and there was no ad in the newspapers to say it was running. So it was literally killed. Which is a very painful experience, you know, when you love a piece of work and it comes out the way you wanted it to come out and people like it, but the studio decides to kill it. That's one of the glories of showbusiness.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> In the 1980s you moved to work primarily in television, and did some stage work too.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Yes, I did both stage and television, and I did some films. A couple. But because Resurrection didn't make money because it wasn't successful, nor did Same Time, Next Year - those two films in a row didn't make money, they were both Universal, and that was it girl, you know! It's a sin to have your films not to make money. Strangely enough, both of those films have a huge following now, and they're shown on television quite often, and I hear from people all the time that one or the other is their favourite film, so...</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> It also goes back to what you were talking about earlier on. How things were changing in the 70s, then the political changes in the 80s. Interesting, then, that in the 90s, certainly from a British perspective, we see you back on screen. It is almost as if at that point something changed again.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I hope so. I think that the change began... I made a film a few years ago called The Spitfire Grill, and that didn't make much money either, but it was a good film and an independent film. It was more like the films that we were making in the 70s, so I think that a movement began with Sundance. I think that was the beginning of a new energy.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Let's talk a little about your two new films that are in the festival - The Yards and Requiem for a Dream - in both those films you are working with directors who are making their second features. Thinking about your career, it seems that you have worked a lot with directors in the early stages of their careers.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Yes. The Last Picture Show was Peter Bogdanovich's second feature, The King of Marvin Gardens was Bob Rafelson's second, and Alice was Marty's second. </p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> So is that coincidence, or is that something you specifically enjoy?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> I do like to work with young directors because it's such a difficult business that I think after directors have been around a while sometimes, not always, but sometimes their passion gets siphoned off because they get hurt. They become more conservative and get afraid to take the same kind of chances. </p> <p>For instance, James Gray with The Yards - it's a beautiful film, wonderful - the critics have gone after him with meat cleavers in the United States, and I just don't understand why. I hope he doesn't get discouraged and that he continues to make the kind of films that he makes so well. His first film was Little Odessa, which was a wonderful film. Yes, he's dark, he's attracted to dark and moody pieces, but that's where his heart is. I hope that he doesn't get discouraged.</p> <p>Darren, on the other hand, his film has been received without the same kind of rancour and he's being supported, so I think that that won't happen to him. But it's very, very hard on directors, and when I see a film by a director that shows promise, I want to get to 'em fast! <br><strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn4.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a> (2 mins 18)]</strong></p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Requiem sees you in another extremely demanding role. How were you persuaded to do that?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> By Darren's first film, Pi. When the offer came in from my agent I was playing Mary Tyrone in Long Day's Journey into Night at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut, and I had played Mary Tyrone the year before at the Alley theatre in Houston, so I was deep into addiction! And it's always a financial sacrifice to do a play, and I had just done The Yards, which was also a low budget film, so I was hoping for a large budget film...! </p> <p>Then in came this script with another very low offer, and another drug addict and a depressing and difficult part to play. I thought, 'Why should I put myself through that for hardly any money?' </p> <p>But I had heard about Pi, but hadn't seen it, so I put it on and within two minutes I thought, 'This guy's an artist and I can't wait to work with him.' So after I agreed to do it, I read the script again and really got into it And loving Sarah. But it took a while, because I was daunted by what I was going to have to put myself through. And rightly so!</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Can you tell us what some of the greatest challenges were?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, first of all, physically, Sarah goes through an enormous transformation. She loses 50 pounds in the film, and goes from fairly sane to totally out of her mind. So for the first part of the film I was wearing a 40 pound fat suit, which is very, very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the neck.</p> <p> I had the neck glued on from my chin down to my bosom and all the way around. It was hard enough getting it on, but getting it off was torture, because you're in it for 14 to 15 hours a day and your skin absorbs all the glue. So you slowly take a little brush and start peeling it back, and when you get enough you cut it off and then keep going. </p> <p>It takes about an hour to get it off. And then all the glue is still in your skin, so you get hot towels to bring the glue up, and then glue remover, and then more hot towels which took another 30 to 40 minutes. My whole chest was bright red and covered in sores and bleeding. It was just horrible. </p> <p>Then we got to the 20-pound fat suit which I was supposed to get into. I went to Darren and said, 'I cannot get into the neck. Please!' Because it was also hard to shoot around it, because if you moved the wrong way it buckled in the wrong way. So, you know, I was always playing the neck in all those scenes!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>And Darren would say, you know, 'Great take, but we have to go again because the neck went funny.' So I refused to get into the 20 pound neck and he was very relieved because he was tired of shooting around it. Then after I got out of the fat suit we coincidentally came to a two-week break in my schedule, so I took off 10 pounds myself. So altogether that made 50 pounds. </p> <p>But I was always uncomfortable in that. Physically uncomfortable. Either from the fat suit, or the neck, or my severe dieting. Or wearing the camera. That was one of Darren's tricks. He designed this mount that goes over your shoulders and the camera is out in front or behind and, you know, you're the camera mount! My dress had to be made with special flaps to cover the mount. </p> <p>He's very inventive with his use of the camera, and innovative, so I was doing some creative things I had never done before. But then the hardest part was accessing the emotional depths of yourself that are necessary to realise a part like this. You basically torture yourself emotionally to get there. And the worst part is that you're never sure you're actually going to be able to do it, and it's such a relief when you do! <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn5.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a> (3 mins 22)]</strong></p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> It's time to open it up to the audience...</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it true that you rang William Friedkin and told him you were born to play Mrs MacNeil in The Exorcist?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> No. It's not true at all! I know he says that but I keep telling him that I wish we'd had a tape recorder because he mis-remembers! </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>There was a casting director at Warner Brothers who suggested me for it, and an appointment was made. I called Billy and asked him if we could have the appointment at my house rather than in his office because I would feel more comfortable there. he very kindly agreed and came to my house. I did call him, but I already had an appointment to see him. That's my version.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Had you read the book before?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> I can't remember if I read the book before or not.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I saw you twice in the Broadway version of Same Time, Next Year. How do you keep it fresh?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, you know, for me that's the whole job. The interesting thing about doing a play is to find a way to make it fresh and do it as though you were doing it for the first time. And that's what all the technique was about. Ways of getting to yourself in order to be in this moment and this time, and not in the performance you did last night or last week. I did that for six months and then a year went by before we made the film, and I had a change of partners. Alan Alda did the film, so it was like a new love affair! How I did it: I don't remember. That I did it: that's my job.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I saw Dream of Passion, and I was wondering what it was like working with the forceful personality of Melina Mercouri and how you put yourself in the role of Medea [Burstyn played a woman jailed for murdering her kids, Medea-style; Mercouri played an actress playing Medea in a classical tragedy who calls on Burstyn for inspiration].</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, Melina was wonderful. She's a character. She was like the character in the film - it was written for her by her husband and it draws on her life and her behaviour and who she is. I don't know how to say what it was like to work with her. It was Melina.</p> <p> I remember one time she came up to me and said: [Melina voice] 'How do you like this line?'. So she read a line to me and I said, 'It seems fine, fine.' [Melina voice] 'You don't think it's too much?' 'Well, ya, maybe a bit.' [Melina voice] 'Tell him. Tell Jules [Dassin]' 'Melina, he's your husband, you tell him!' [Melina voice] 'No. He don't listen to me. He has this...antagonism.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>As for Medea, that was very difficult. I actually took that problem to Lee. I'll tell you what I did. I wanted to work on this central problem of killing. How you go about killing. Now, in the film I had to kill my children - well, I didn't want to get that far. I mean I can do flies, and cockroaches and ants, but that's about it. I couldn't kill a chicken, I couldn't kill a cow - I was a vegetarian too at that time - so I thought, well what is there that I could kill? I couldn't kill this and I couldn't kill that. If I brought an ant on stage that's hardly the same as killing your children...</p> <p>So I was at the Actor's Studio, thinking about this, and I happened to glance over to the other side of the stage and I saw the ugliest chair I have ever seen. And I thought, 'Well, I could kill that chair!' So I started building around that. </p> <p>I did an exercise for Lee, with everyone present, and created an imaginary child - but before I did that I stopped at the butcher's shop on the way in and got some lamb's liver, raw lambs liver, and at one point I put it in my mouth and rubbed it all over my face to experience the... to get past my own squeamishness was what I was doing. </p> <p>And then I created this little child, who was my darling boy, and then I went over and sat him on the chair and then proceeded to destroy the chair. And I found that that was what Medea was doing. She was not killing her children, she was killing her husband through her children because he had so destroyed her.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you tell us about working with Alain Resnais on Providence?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> He's so wonderful! I guess more than any man I've ever known he's a gentleman. He's so elegant. He has a very unique way of directing. He casts the film and then brings the actors together for two weeks, you rehearse every day and go over the script and you say if you want anything re-written. Then the script is finally finished - no more changes - and all the scenes have been played. Then he goes away for two days and edits the film in his head. </p> <p>So he only shoots exactly what will be on screen. So there is nothing on his cutting room floor. So in a scene where I'm talking and he's going to show Sandra nodding and shaking her head, he'll only shoot that and I'm heard off camera. I've never worked with any other director who works like that. It's completely unique to him.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> The Exorcist has been pushed back into public consciousness through the new cut. What do you think of it and how has it affected your career?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, it's been surprisingly important to my career. I didn't realise in the 1970s that that was the film I was going to be remembered for for the rest of my life.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>As a matter of fact, on the last day of Requiem for a Dream, Darren made this beautiful little speech for me in front of the crew and thanked me and said all sorts of nice things. I thanked him for giving me a role in a film that I might perhaps be remembered for as much as The Exorcist.</p> <p>I saw The Exorcist a few years ago at Radio City Music Hall when Billy and I went to see it. We were both appalled at the quality of the print. It looked like an old film, fading and it had pops and holes and squeaks. But now that it's been remastered it looks brand new, like it's just been shot. I like a couple of the added things, but the added doctor scene, I'm not so sure about. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn6.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a> (1 min 17)]</strong></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Requiem for a Dream - how important was the book?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> It certainly deepened my appreciation of the script. Hubert Selby Jr's way of writing, for those of you who may not have read the book, the page is a solid block. It is not divided up into paragraphs and there is no 'he-said-she-said', he just flows from one person speaking to the next without identifying them. </p> <p>But the voices are so clear that you know exactly who is speaking. I've never seen anybody accomplish that on the printed page. Also, when you read the book, you realise how Darren's cinematic style is the perfect realisation of the book. I got more of an understanding of Sarah from reading the book, but most of what's in the book is in the film too.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You are going back to television. Why do a television series?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> No, it's not 'going back', it's 'also'. I liked the writing and I liked the cast. When you've been an actress for 45 years as I have, it's a feast or famine life and I thought that maybe it was time now to have a steady gig!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You talked about pushing films for Oscars. Are you ready to go through the circus to push Requiem for a Dream?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, you know what circuses are like. It's a lot of fun to take the rides and to take part in the bright lights. But it's also nice to go home at night and be quiet. So it will just me my job in the future 'hoopla' days to make sure that I balance it and have enough time to myself. I'm not someone who goes to a lot of parties or those type of events. But I try and enjoy it as much as I can. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I wondered which actresses you admired when you started out.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well my taste wasn't very good when I first started out. But later, when I began to appreciate the art of acting, I would say the actress I most admire is Vanessa Redgrave. I think she's just an amazing miracle of an actress. And I like Jessical Laing very much. And there is a new actress, Claire Danes, she's wonderful. But when I first started out I wanted to be like Betty Grable. That's not bad taste, I don't mean to insult Betty Grable, but it was just about wearing sequins and feathers and glamour!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Could you tell us a little about The King of Marvin Gardens?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> I loved that film. It was very exciting to work on. Jack Nicholson - I think that's the best thing he's ever done, it has the least Nicholsonian things in it. He really created a character different from himself. It was a film that was killed by the critics when it came out. It was a 'What's happening to the arts in America?' response. Then when it was released on video a few years ago, everybody said, 'Gee! Where did this film come from? It's great!' And all the critics loved it. So... one tries not to be bitter!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there any role you passed up on that you regret that you didn't take up?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I try not to allow regret to live in me because I think it festers, and that's one way to become bitter and cynical - to clutch at you regrets and to carry them around like a wilted bouquet.

A film in which you play a woman who has the power to heal, and I'm interested in what drew you to that story. EB: Well, in about 1977 I was in Greece making a film with Jules Dassin called A Dream of Passion, and my agent called me and said that there was this script called Resurrection in which Jesus Christ comes back to Earth as a woman. I said, 'Oooh. I like that.' [Laughter] So they sent me the script and then the director and the producer came to Athens to meet me and I said that I really liked the idea of the script, but I didn't like the script itself. It was about this school teacher who went to Jerusalem and started bleeding from the palms. It just didn't make an awful lot of sense to me. So I suggested that they did a script about a woman who was a very ordinary housewife in contemporary society who develops some of the abilities that Jesus had - like healing and so forth. At the time I was doing a lot of reading about the re-emergence of the goddess and I liked the idea of reuniting sexuality and religion - a religious figure who was also a sensual being. I sketched out a rough story for them and the director said, well it's a good story but we have the go-ahead from Universal to make this script and did I want to do it. I said no, and they left. When they got back to their hotel the producer called me and said, 'We like your story more than our story, and with your permission we'd like to go back to Universal and ask them if we can start over and find a writer to write your story.' So they did. They found a writer called Lewis John Carlino, who came to my house in New York and stayed with me for about a week, and I told him my life story plus all that I was reading and studying at the time, and out of that came the script that he wrote in, I think, 18 days. We got a new director, Daniel Petrie, and out came Resurrection. I loved it, and it has had a lot of meaning for a lot of people because it deals with death a lot and the passing over to the other side and the experiences of some of the people I had read about who had had near-death experiences, and that was put into the film. So many people have written and told me how they have been with their parents and helped them cross over because of Resurrection. And that's pleased me very deeply. It wasn't very successful because at the time Universal had no faith in it, and they had another film, which I won't mention, that they had already released and made a lot of money from, with an actress in it who they felt had a good opportunity to win the Best Actress award. And my reviews said, 'Just as so-and-so looked to have a clear shot at the Oscar, along comes Ellen Burstyn in Resurrection.' So Universal made an executive decision to put all their money behind the film that they thought was very successful. And it was. And she did win. [Laughter] They pulled Resurrection out of the theatres, so it was running in New York and I was nominated for the Oscar and there was no ad in the newspapers to say it was running. So it was literally killed. Which is a very painful experience, you know, when you love a piece of work and it comes out the way you wanted it to come out and people like it, but the studio decides to kill it. That's one of the glories of showbusiness. SH: In the 1980s you moved to work primarily in television, and did some stage work too. EB: Yes, I did both stage and television, and I did some films. A couple. But because Resurrection didn't make money because it wasn't successful, nor did Same Time, Next Year - those two films in a row didn't make money, they were both Universal, and that was it girl, you know! It's a sin to have your films not to make money. Strangely enough, both of those films have a huge following now, and they're shown on television quite often, and I hear from people all the time that one or the other is their favourite film, so... SH: It also goes back to what you were talking about earlier on. How things were changing in the 70s, then the political changes in the 80s. Interesting, then, that in the 90s, certainly from a British perspective, we see you back on screen. It is almost as if at that point something changed again. EB: Well, I hope so. I think that the change began... I made a film a few years ago called The Spitfire Grill, and that didn't make much money either, but it was a good film and an independent film. It was more like the films that we were making in the 70s, so I think that a movement began with Sundance. I think that was the beginning of a new energy. SH: Let's talk a little about your two new films that are in the festival - The Yards and Requiem for a Dream - in both those films you are working with directors who are making their second features. Thinking about your career, it seems that you have worked a lot with directors in the early stages of their careers. EB: Yes. The Last Picture Show was Peter Bogdanovich's second feature, The King of Marvin Gardens was Bob Rafelson's second, and Alice was Marty's second. SH: So is that coincidence, or is that something you specifically enjoy? EB: I do like to work with young directors because it's such a difficult business that I think after directors have been around a while sometimes, not always, but sometimes their passion gets siphoned off because they get hurt. They become more conservative and get afraid to take the same kind of chances. For instance, James Gray with The Yards - it's a beautiful film, wonderful - the critics have gone after him with meat cleavers in the United States, and I just don't understand why. I hope he doesn't get discouraged and that he continues to make the kind of films that he makes so well. His first film was Little Odessa, which was a wonderful film. Yes, he's dark, he's attracted to dark and moody pieces, but that's where his heart is. I hope that he doesn't get discouraged. Darren, on the other hand, his film has been received without the same kind of rancour and he's being supported, so I think that that won't happen to him. But it's very, very hard on directors, and when I see a film by a director that shows promise, I want to get to 'em fast! [Listen to the sound clip (2 mins 18)] SH: Requiem sees you in another extremely demanding role. How were you persuaded to do that? EB: By Darren's first film, Pi. When the offer came in from my agent I was playing Mary Tyrone in Long Day's Journey into Night at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut, and I had played Mary Tyrone the year before at the Alley theatre in Houston, so I was deep into addiction! And it's always a financial sacrifice to do a play, and I had just done The Yards, which was also a low budget film, so I was hoping for a large budget film...! Then in came this script with another very low offer, and another drug addict and a depressing and difficult part to play. I thought, 'Why should I put myself through that for hardly any money?' But I had heard about Pi, but hadn't seen it, so I put it on and within two minutes I thought, 'This guy's an artist and I can't wait to work with him.' So after I agreed to do it, I read the script again and really got into it And loving Sarah. But it took a while, because I was daunted by what I was going to have to put myself through. And rightly so! SH: Can you tell us what some of the greatest challenges were? EB: Well, first of all, physically, Sarah goes through an enormous transformation. She loses 50 pounds in the film, and goes from fairly sane to totally out of her mind. So for the first part of the film I was wearing a 40 pound fat suit, which is very, very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the neck. I had the neck glued on from my chin down to my bosom and all the way around. It was hard enough getting it on, but getting it off was torture, because you're in it for 14 to 15 hours a day and your skin absorbs all the glue. So you slowly take a little brush and start peeling it back, and when you get enough you cut it off and then keep going. It takes about an hour to get it off. And then all the glue is still in your skin, so you get hot towels to bring the glue up, and then glue remover, and then more hot towels which took another 30 to 40 minutes. My whole chest was bright red and covered in sores and bleeding. It was just horrible. Then we got to the 20-pound fat suit which I was supposed to get into. I went to Darren and said, 'I cannot get into the neck. Please!' Because it was also hard to shoot around it, because if you moved the wrong way it buckled in the wrong way. So, you know, I was always playing the neck in all those scenes! [Laughter] And Darren would say, you know, 'Great take, but we have to go again because the neck went funny.' So I refused to get into the 20 pound neck and he was very relieved because he was tired of shooting around it. Then after I got out of the fat suit we coincidentally came to a two-week break in my schedule, so I took off 10 pounds myself. So altogether that made 50 pounds. But I was always uncomfortable in that. Physically uncomfortable. Either from the fat suit, or the neck, or my severe dieting. Or wearing the camera. That was one of Darren's tricks. He designed this mount that goes over your shoulders and the camera is out in front or behind and, you know, you're the camera mount! My dress had to be made with special flaps to cover the mount. He's very inventive with his use of the camera, and innovative, so I was doing some creative things I had never done before. But then the hardest part was accessing the emotional depths of yourself that are necessary to realise a part like this. You basically torture yourself emotionally to get there. And the worst part is that you're never sure you're actually going to be able to do it, and it's such a relief when you do! [Listen to the sound clip (3 mins 22)] SH: It's time to open it up to the audience... Q: Is it true that you rang William Friedkin and told him you were born to play Mrs MacNeil in The Exorcist? EB: No. It's not true at all! I know he says that but I keep telling him that I wish we'd had a tape recorder because he mis-remembers! [Laughter] There was a casting director at Warner Brothers who suggested me for it, and an appointment was made. I called Billy and asked him if we could have the appointment at my house rather than in his office because I would feel more comfortable there. he very kindly agreed and came to my house. I did call him, but I already had an appointment to see him. That's my version. Q: Had you read the book before? EB: I can't remember if I read the book before or not. Q: I saw you twice in the Broadway version of Same Time, Next Year. How do you keep it fresh? EB: Well, you know, for me that's the whole job. The interesting thing about doing a play is to find a way to make it fresh and do it as though you were doing it for the first time. And that's what all the technique was about. Ways of getting to yourself in order to be in this moment and this time, and not in the performance you did last night or last week. I did that for six months and then a year went by before we made the film, and I had a change of partners. Alan Alda did the film, so it was like a new love affair! How I did it: I don't remember. That I did it: that's my job. Q: I saw Dream of Passion, and I was wondering what it was like working with the forceful personality of Melina Mercouri and how you put yourself in the role of Medea [Burstyn played a woman jailed for murdering her kids, Medea-style; Mercouri played an actress playing Medea in a classical tragedy who calls on Burstyn for inspiration]. EB: Well, Melina was wonderful. She's a character. She was like the character in the film - it was written for her by her husband and it draws on her life and her behaviour and who she is. I don't know how to say what it was like to work with her. It was Melina. I remember one time she came up to me and said: [Melina voice] 'How do you like this line?'. So she read a line to me and I said, 'It seems fine, fine.' [Melina voice] 'You don't think it's too much?' 'Well, ya, maybe a bit.' [Melina voice] 'Tell him. Tell Jules [Dassin]' 'Melina, he's your husband, you tell him!' [Melina voice] 'No. He don't listen to me. He has this...antagonism.' [Laughter] As for Medea, that was very difficult. I actually took that problem to Lee. I'll tell you what I did. I wanted to work on this central problem of killing. How you go about killing. Now, in the film I had to kill my children - well, I didn't want to get that far. I mean I can do flies, and cockroaches and ants, but that's about it. I couldn't kill a chicken, I couldn't kill a cow - I was a vegetarian too at that time - so I thought, well what is there that I could kill? I couldn't kill this and I couldn't kill that. If I brought an ant on stage that's hardly the same as killing your children... So I was at the Actor's Studio, thinking about this, and I happened to glance over to the other side of the stage and I saw the ugliest chair I have ever seen. And I thought, 'Well, I could kill that chair!' So I started building around that. I did an exercise for Lee, with everyone present, and created an imaginary child - but before I did that I stopped at the butcher's shop on the way in and got some lamb's liver, raw lambs liver, and at one point I put it in my mouth and rubbed it all over my face to experience the... to get past my own squeamishness was what I was doing. And then I created this little child, who was my darling boy, and then I went over and sat him on the chair and then proceeded to destroy the chair. And I found that that was what Medea was doing. She was not killing her children, she was killing her husband through her children because he had so destroyed her. Q: Can you tell us about working with Alain Resnais on Providence? EB: He's so wonderful! I guess more than any man I've ever known he's a gentleman. He's so elegant. He has a very unique way of directing. He casts the film and then brings the actors together for two weeks, you rehearse every day and go over the script and you say if you want anything re-written. Then the script is finally finished - no more changes - and all the scenes have been played. Then he goes away for two days and edits the film in his head. So he only shoots exactly what will be on screen. So there is nothing on his cutting room floor. So in a scene where I'm talking and he's going to show Sandra nodding and shaking her head, he'll only shoot that and I'm heard off camera. I've never worked with any other director who works like that. It's completely unique to him. Q: The Exorcist has been pushed back into public consciousness through the new cut. What do you think of it and how has it affected your career? EB: Well, it's been surprisingly important to my career. I didn't realise in the 1970s that that was the film I was going to be remembered for for the rest of my life. [Laughter] As a matter of fact, on the last day of Requiem for a Dream, Darren made this beautiful little speech for me in front of the crew and thanked me and said all sorts of nice things. I thanked him for giving me a role in a film that I might perhaps be remembered for as much as The Exorcist. I saw The Exorcist a few years ago at Radio City Music Hall when Billy and I went to see it. We were both appalled at the quality of the print. It looked like an old film, fading and it had pops and holes and squeaks. But now that it's been remastered it looks brand new, like it's just been shot. I like a couple of the added things, but the added doctor scene, I'm not so sure about. [Listen to the sound clip (1 min 17)] Q: Requiem for a Dream - how important was the book? EB: It certainly deepened my appreciation of the script. Hubert Selby Jr's way of writing, for those of you who may not have read the book, the page is a solid block. It is not divided up into paragraphs and there is no 'he-said-she-said', he just flows from one person speaking to the next without identifying them. But the voices are so clear that you know exactly who is speaking. I've never seen anybody accomplish that on the printed page. Also, when you read the book, you realise how Darren's cinematic style is the perfect realisation of the book. I got more of an understanding of Sarah from reading the book, but most of what's in the book is in the film too. Q: You are going back to television. Why do a television series? EB: No, it's not 'going back', it's 'also'. I liked the writing and I liked the cast. When you've been an actress for 45 years as I have, it's a feast or famine life and I thought that maybe it was time now to have a steady gig! [Laughter] Q: You talked about pushing films for Oscars. Are you ready to go through the circus to push Requiem for a Dream? EB: Well, you know what circuses are like. It's a lot of fun to take the rides and to take part in the bright lights. But it's also nice to go home at night and be quiet. So it will just me my job in the future 'hoopla' days to make sure that I balance it and have enough time to myself. I'm not someone who goes to a lot of parties or those type of events. But I try and enjoy it as much as I can. Q: I wondered which actresses you admired when you started out. EB: Well my taste wasn't very good when I first started out. But later, when I began to appreciate the art of acting, I would say the actress I most admire is Vanessa Redgrave. I think she's just an amazing miracle of an actress. And I like Jessical Laing very much. And there is a new actress, Claire Danes, she's wonderful. But when I first started out I wanted to be like Betty Grable. That's not bad taste, I don't mean to insult Betty Grable, but it was just about wearing sequins and feathers and glamour! Q: Could you tell us a little about The King of Marvin Gardens? EB: I loved that film. It was very exciting to work on. Jack Nicholson - I think that's the best thing he's ever done, it has the least Nicholsonian things in it. He really created a character different from himself. It was a film that was killed by the critics when it came out. It was a 'What's happening to the arts in America?' response. Then when it was released on video a few years ago, everybody said, 'Gee! Where did this film come from? It's great!' And all the critics loved it. So... one tries not to be bitter! Q: Is there any role you passed up on that you regret that you didn't take up? EB: Well, I try not to allow regret to live in me because I think it festers, and that's one way to become bitter and cynical - to clutch at you regrets and to carry them around like a wilted bouquet. I always wanted to play Joan of Arc. I've always wanted to do that. Now I'm thinking, 'Maybe there's a story in Joan of Arc's mother!' If I don't hurry up, her grandmother! SH: Well, I think that's something we all look forward to seeing! It's fantastic you were here. Thank you very much. EB: Thank you.

      "body": "<p>About 5 million people in Britain live in homes built on flood plains - areas that the Environment Agency says are at risk of flooding. </p> <p>But far more householders than that could find their homes underwater, experiencing the misery of those affected by last week's storm, with evacuation and bills for ruined carpets, furniture and decor. Experts fear there may an even steeper cost: homes reduced in value, or even made unsaleable. </p> <p>One factor worrying the experts is the inability of a Victorian drainage system to cope with increased rainfall in ever-spreading built-up areas. At the end of the year, the Government will receive a report from the insurance industry urging a radical rethink to tackle this growing problem. </p> <p>What worries Professor Michael Clark, head of the so-called Sunami (Japanese for 'wave') working party, is the incidence of floods in places, such as Edinburgh, that are not usually regarded as vulnerable. </p> <p>'There is an increasing number of floods that aren't on the flood plain,' Clark says. 'These can be caused when there are flash floods and the drains can't cope. The drainage problem is as big a problem as river and sea defence. Ultimately, urban drainage will be seen as more of a focus of attention than building little walls around groups of houses that should never have been built in the first place.' </p> <p>The Victorians' work will have to be redone one day. Just as governments have neglected the transport infrastructure, so they seem to have neglected the sewers and drains. And just as Railtrack is now investing in safety, so local authorities will eventually have to invest in the drainage infrastructure. </p> <p>But whatever the cause of the flooding, fresh facts are starting to emerge. Insurance experts are expecting premiums to rise for building and contents cover. </p> <p>Peter Staddon of the British Insurance Brokers Association, says: 'It could be \u00a310 or \u00a320 per policy, I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen in the new year.' The exact increases are hard to work out. Falling crime figures could, he suggests, counterbalance the financial effect of greater flooding. </p> <p>Clark, who is based at Southampton University's Geodata Institute, takes a similar view: 'Because we spread the [flood element of] premiums across all policyholders, the premiums are better [than they would be otherwise for people affected]. But, if the problems continue, we will see a small increase for people living in the flood plains.' </p> <p>Insurers are almost guaranteed to push any extra costs on to the highest-risk policyholders, says Bryan Joseph, general insurance actuary at accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers: 'If insurers don't target their premium rate increases, other players will cherry-pick the good risks.' </p> <p>The outlook for people whose homes have been flooded more than once recently is difficult. The Association of British Insurers, normally eager to dismiss suggestions that people at particular risk might be unable to get cover, admits openly there is a problem. </p> <p>'In very extreme cases, it might mean excluding flood cover,' says a spokeswoman. 'In areas flooded once or twice a year, if the insurer knows that the local authority is looking at the issue, they will keep cover in place.' </p> <p>She accepts that insurers are less likely to do so if they do not believe the council involved will find a solution. </p> <p>A Norwich Union spokeswoman says: 'If someone has had their property flooded two or three times in the last two or three years, then premiums could go up to reflect the risk.' </p> <p>Looking longer term, new ways of dealing with the problems caused by flood, storm and insufficient drainage will have to be found. There are two main financial aspects to the problem: the cost of damage repair and insurance; and the effect on house prices. </p> <p>On the cost of repair, the Sunami working party has discovered that the UK is 'unique' in relying totally on the commercial sector and in having no financial input from government. The case for a contingency fund for disasters is one issue it will raise with the Government. </p> <p>Clark says other possibilities include putting 'the onus of flood defence on to individual properties'.This would mean that homes in flood plains would follow the example of the Netherlands, which builds them with raised, waterproof doors, air bricks that shut and other features that resist water. </p> <p>The Housing Minister, Nick Raynsford, is interested in this approach. </p> <p>He is pushing another development that could help: the publication of draft planning guidelines that encourage property developers and local authorities to consult insurers, lenders and other interested parties before new sites are built on. This would be particularly important when discussing the massive new house-building programme that the Government says is needed. </p> <p>Homes in areas that are flooded regularly could be worth less or, in extreme cases, become unsaleable, say experts. This would affect the residents of places hit badly last week, such as Yalding in Kent,and Lewes, East Sussex. 'I can't imagine that anyone would want to buy in Yalding,' says con veyancing solicitor Brian Marson of Marsons. </p> <p>But even people whose homes have not yet been flooded could find that the value of their home goes down because they are deemed to be a risk. </p> <p>The Environment Agency plans to publish national flood maps on its website by the end of the year at the latest. This will provide a free analysis of the flooding risk for every postcode in England and Wales. A similar system is already freely available to individuals through the Homecheck website. </p> <p>'This sort of system will impact on property value,' says Brendan Doyle of Homecheck. 'Surveyors and lawyers will have to become skilled at interpreting that information.' </p> <p>Buyers should be warned that many solicitors do not undertake this sort of check for conveyancing clients now, so potential problems can remain hidden. </p> <p>But, as more solicitors become familiar with the need to check for flood and other environmental risks, so the problems in more houses will become more obvious to potential buyers. It could be that disclosure is made compulsory , just as an analysis of earthquake and other hazards is required when people buy and sell homes in California.</p> <p><strong>How to wring out the cash for repairs</strong></p> <p>1 Ring your insurer or broker quickly to agree a plan of action. They usually prefer to send repairers and buy replacement items themselves. </p> <p>2 Don't throw out sodden carpets or other damaged items before your insurer's loss adjuster examines them.</p> <p>3 Take photographs or a video of the damage while the water is in the house as extra evidence.</p> <p>4 Expect to be rehoused in a hotel for a few days if the damage is mild; in a rented house if the repairs will take weeks or months. The insurer should pay.</p> <p>5 Contact your motor insurer if you have comprehensive cover and your car has been damaged by the water or a storm. If you are only covered for third party, fire and theft, you cannot claim.</p> <p>6 Don't expect to be reimbursed for repairs if your fence suffers storm damage. Most policies exclude such commonplace items, though some pay out for damage caused by a falling tree.</p> <p>7 Plan to stay with your existing insurer if you are making a claim now. It will be easier administratively to stay put while your claim is sorted out. Premiums may be higher with other firms once you have experienced flood or storm damage. </p> <p><strong>More information</strong></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.org.uk\">www.environment-agency.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.homecheck.co.uk\">www.homecheck.co.uk</a></p> <p>National Floodline: 0845-988 1888</p>",

      "bodyText": "About 5 million people in Britain live in homes built on flood plains - areas that the Environment Agency says are at risk of flooding. But far more householders than that could find their homes underwater, experiencing the misery of those affected by last week's storm, with evacuation and bills for ruined carpets, furniture and decor. Experts fear there may an even steeper cost: homes reduced in value, or even made unsaleable. One factor worrying the experts is the inability of a Victorian drainage system to cope with increased rainfall in ever-spreading built-up areas. At the end of the year, the Government will receive a report from the insurance industry urging a radical rethink to tackle this growing problem. What worries Professor Michael Clark, head of the so-called Sunami (Japanese for 'wave') working party, is the incidence of floods in places, such as Edinburgh, that are not usually regarded as vulnerable. 'There is an increasing number of floods that aren't on the flood plain,' Clark says. 'These can be caused when there are flash floods and the drains can't cope. The drainage problem is as big a problem as river and sea defence. Ultimately, urban drainage will be seen as more of a focus of attention than building little walls around groups of houses that should never have been built in the first place.' The Victorians' work will have to be redone one day. Just as governments have neglected the transport infrastructure, so they seem to have neglected the sewers and drains. And just as Railtrack is now investing in safety, so local authorities will eventually have to invest in the drainage infrastructure. But whatever the cause of the flooding, fresh facts are starting to emerge. Insurance experts are expecting premiums to rise for building and contents cover. Peter Staddon of the British Insurance Brokers Association, says: 'It could be \u00a310 or \u00a320 per policy, I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen in the new year.' The exact increases are hard to work out. Falling crime figures could, he suggests, counterbalance the financial effect of greater flooding. Clark, who is based at Southampton University's Geodata Institute, takes a similar view: 'Because we spread the [flood element of] premiums across all policyholders, the premiums are better [than they would be otherwise for people affected]. But, if the problems continue, we will see a small increase for people living in the flood plains.' Insurers are almost guaranteed to push any extra costs on to the highest-risk policyholders, says Bryan Joseph, general insurance actuary at accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers: 'If insurers don't target their premium rate increases, other players will cherry-pick the good risks.' The outlook for people whose homes have been flooded more than once recently is difficult. The Association of British Insurers, normally eager to dismiss suggestions that people at particular risk might be unable to get cover, admits openly there is a problem. 'In very extreme cases, it might mean excluding flood cover,' says a spokeswoman. 'In areas flooded once or twice a year, if the insurer knows that the local authority is looking at the issue, they will keep cover in place.' She accepts that insurers are less likely to do so if they do not believe the council involved will find a solution. A Norwich Union spokeswoman says: 'If someone has had their property flooded two or three times in the last two or three years, then premiums could go up to reflect the risk.' Looking longer term, new ways of dealing with the problems caused by flood, storm and insufficient drainage will have to be found. There are two main financial aspects to the problem: the cost of damage repair and insurance; and the effect on house prices. On the cost of repair, the Sunami working party has discovered that the UK is 'unique' in relying totally on the commercial sector and in having no financial input from government. The case for a contingency fund for disasters is one issue it will raise with the Government. Clark says other possibilities include putting 'the onus of flood defence on to individual properties'.This would mean that homes in flood plains would follow the example of the Netherlands, which builds them with raised, waterproof doors, air bricks that shut and other features that resist water. The Housing Minister, Nick Raynsford, is interested in this approach. He is pushing another development that could help: the publication of draft planning guidelines that encourage property developers and local authorities to consult insurers, lenders and other interested parties before new sites are built on. This would be particularly important when discussing the massive new house-building programme that the Government says is needed. Homes in areas that are flooded regularly could be worth less or, in extreme cases, become unsaleable, say experts. This would affect the residents of places hit badly last week, such as Yalding in Kent,and Lewes, East Sussex. 'I can't imagine that anyone would want to buy in Yalding,' says con veyancing solicitor Brian Marson of Marsons. But even people whose homes have not yet been flooded could find that the value of their home goes down because they are deemed to be a risk. The Environment Agency plans to publish national flood maps on its website by the end of the year at the latest. This will provide a free analysis of the flooding risk for every postcode in England and Wales. A similar system is already freely available to individuals through the Homecheck website. 'This sort of system will impact on property value,' says Brendan Doyle of Homecheck. 'Surveyors and lawyers will have to become skilled at interpreting that information.' Buyers should be warned that many solicitors do not undertake this sort of check for conveyancing clients now, so potential problems can remain hidden. But, as more solicitors become familiar with the need to check for flood and other environmental risks, so the problems in more houses will become more obvious to potential buyers. It could be that disclosure is made compulsory , just as an analysis of earthquake and other hazards is required when people buy and sell homes in California. How to wring out the cash for repairs 1 Ring your insurer or broker quickly to agree a plan of action. They usually prefer to send repairers and buy replacement items themselves. 2 Don't throw out sodden carpets or other damaged items before your insurer's loss adjuster examines them. 3 Take photographs or a video of the damage while the water is in the house as extra evidence. 4 Expect to be rehoused in a hotel for a few days if the damage is mild; in a rented house if the repairs will take weeks or months. The insurer should pay. 5 Contact your motor insurer if you have comprehensive cover and your car has been damaged by the water or a storm. If you are only covered for third party, fire and theft, you cannot claim. 6 Don't expect to be reimbursed for repairs if your fence suffers storm damage. Most policies exclude such commonplace items, though some pay out for damage caused by a falling tree. 7 Plan to stay with your existing insurer if you are making a claim now. It will be easier administratively to stay put while your claim is sorted out. Premiums may be higher with other firms once you have experienced flood or storm damage.

New rules governing how the bonds are financed will cost the life insurance industry between \u00a315 billion and \u00a320bn by the end of the year, according to analyst Ned Cazalet. </p> <p>He says: 'The hit to with-profits will be as big as the pensions mis-selling bill.' </p> <p>The prediction follows concerns expressed by actuaries about the product. With-profits bonds are lump-sum investments that try to offer good rates of return without fully exposing investors to the risks of the stock market. </p> <p>The risk is minimised by a process known as smoothing - annual bonuses are paid out at a steady rate instead of at values equivalent to the top or the bottom end of stock market returns. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority, the industry watchdog, now requires life offices to set aside more money to cover the cost of running with-profits business. Some may be forced to cut bonuses as a result. </p> <p>Prudential, which sells the market-leading Prudence bond, admits it will have to increase its reserves by 15 per cent to meet its commit ments. The Pru is strong enough to take the hit, but other companies may not be. </p> <p>In its FSA returns, Royal &amp; SunAlliance has revealed it has set up a facility which will let it pump shareholders' money into subsidiary SunAlliance and London. The move was prompted by the poor performance of the stock and bond markets over the past year, but will be exacerbated by the changes to the with-profits regulations. </p> <p>Cazalet says other life offices likely to feel the strain include Axa Sun Life, Clerical Medical, Equitable Life, Friends Provident, Scottish Life, Scottish Mutual, Scottish Widows and Standard Life. </p> <p>In a separate move, the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries voiced its concerns about with-profits bonds earlier this year after it found a mismatch between perceived bonuses and the reserves set aside by life insurance companies to underpin their promises. </p> <p>Life offices were structuring their bonds so that they paid the best rates in the early years. This enabled the insurers to market the bonds as an alternative to deposit accounts on the basis of their attractive headline rates - as much as 9 per cent in the first year. Deposit account rates have plunged from about 10 per cent to 4 per cent in the past 10 years. </p> <p>However, the actuaries concluded that the with-profits rates may be misleading as no one usually sees the returns promised after just one year without paying a surrender penalty - the bonds are designed to be held much longer. They wrote to some members informing them of these concerns, prompting fears of a repeat of the endowment crisis. </p> <p>John Hylands, a member of the FIA's life board, says: 'There are concerns over the marketing practices of particular providers, but we do not want to give the impression that the product itself is flawed. The vast majority of with-profits bonds are perfectly OK. We just want some life offices to change the way they are promoted.' </p> <p>Life office Norwich Union has already closed one bond to new investors, citing, in a letter to independent advisers, the furore surrounding headline rates . </p> <p>Patrick Connolly of Bath-based financial adviser Chartwell says: 'As well as the change to headline rates, charges will have to be more explicit, and competitive forces will mean that commission will come down. Pressure for regulation will come from consumers. Companies will want to get in there and do it first.' </p> <p>He says two providers have already changed the formats of their with-profits bonds for 2001, making them more transparent and cutting commission rates. But he still thinks a clampdown on the bonds is 'inevitable'. </p> <p>The FSA admits it is keeping an eye on with-profits bonds after witnessing an explosion in sales in recent years. In 1994, \u00a32.2bn was held in with-profits bonds; in 1999 it was\u00a312.1bn. </p> <p>The FSA's Jackie Blyth says: 'They are on our radar, but that will not necessarily culminate in an announcement. We are looking at with-profits bonds as part of our usual supervising and monitoring visits.' </p> <p>So can you still rely on with-profits bonds to give you good returns with minimal risk? Cazalet warns you not to get sucked in by headline rates. He says potential investors should look at the ability of a life assurer to offer good rates of return in the medium- to long-term, because the money should be invested for between five and seven years. </p> <p>He advises to check with an independent financial adviser that the life office holds between 75 and 80 per cent of its investments in equities and property. </p> <p>Otherwise your bond could underperform because the assurer will not have the financial strength to smooth out the annual bonuses. </p> <p>Life offices that comply with Cazalet's real assets criteria are Axa Equity &amp; Law, Scottish Mutual, Prudential, CGU and Liverpool Victoria.</p>",

However, the actuaries concluded that the with-profits rates may be misleading as no one usually sees the returns promised after just one year without paying a surrender penalty - the bonds are designed to be held much longer. They wrote to some members informing them of these concerns, prompting fears of a repeat of the endowment crisis. John Hylands, a member of the FIA's life board, says: 'There are concerns over the marketing practices of particular providers, but we do not want to give the impression that the product itself is flawed. The vast majority of with-profits bonds are perfectly OK. We just want some life offices to change the way they are promoted.' Life office Norwich Union has already closed one bond to new investors, citing, in a letter to independent advisers, the furore surrounding headline rates . Patrick Connolly of Bath-based financial adviser Chartwell says: 'As well as the change to headline rates, charges will have to be more explicit, and competitive forces will mean that commission will come down. Pressure for regulation will come from consumers. Companies will want to get in there and do it first.' He says two providers have already changed the formats of their with-profits bonds for 2001, making them more transparent and cutting commission rates. But he still thinks a clampdown on the bonds is 'inevitable'. The FSA admits it is keeping an eye on with-profits bonds after witnessing an explosion in sales in recent years. In 1994, \u00a32.2bn was held in with-profits bonds; in 1999 it was\u00a312.1bn. The FSA's Jackie Blyth says: 'They are on our radar, but that will not necessarily culminate in an announcement. We are looking at with-profits bonds as part of our usual supervising and monitoring visits.' So can you still rely on with-profits bonds to give you good returns with minimal risk? Cazalet warns you not to get sucked in by headline rates. He says potential investors should look at the ability of a life assurer to offer good rates of return in the medium- to long-term, because the money should be invested for between five and seven years. He advises to check with an independent financial adviser that the life office holds between 75 and 80 per cent of its investments in equities and property. Otherwise your bond could underperform because the assurer will not have the financial strength to smooth out the annual bonuses. Life offices that comply with Cazalet's real assets criteria are Axa Equity &amp; Law, Scottish Mutual, Prudential, CGU and Liverpool Victoria.",
