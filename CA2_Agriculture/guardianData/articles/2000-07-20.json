Diaspora affairs minister Michael Melchior, who was in the United States last week at Barak's request as part of Israel's publicity team, would not say how he knew Barak had accepted the US bridging proposal. \"We can accept, under the framework of Israeli sovereignty over all Jerusalem...a certain extended administrative autonomy solution for some of the Muslim quarters outside the Old City, and only outside the Old City,\" he said. Eldad Yaniv, an adviser to Barak who is part of the negotiating team near Washington, denied that Barak had accepted any proposal, and said he was waiting for the Palestinians to react before he made his position known. \"No, the prime minister is not considering, he is not assessing, he is not supporting or opposing any idea or proposal until he is convinced that the Palestinians understand what lies before them and are ready with courage and responsibility to make painful decisions,\" Yaniv said.

This is a sensible approach, particularly with a first book. It proves that you've got the ability and the discipline to write a book, you will have a full \"draft\" to present to potential publishers, and you will know that this is really what you want to do. The description of writing as \"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration\" is no exaggeration.</p> <p>If you don't write the complete book, the very least a publisher will require is a detailed contents list, a sample unit or two, and a marketing brief saying exactly who you think will buy it. Bear in mind, though, that a published book often differs greatly from the original idea. It evolves as you write, and sometimes it is only when you get to the end of the first draft that you will find out what it is you wanted to say. </p> <p>Writer Robert O'Neill tells how once, more than 20 years ago, when he responded to the pleas of a publisher to \"plan the whole book first and then stick to the plan\", he produced a draft that, \"made me want to vomit. I read it through on the train on my way to my London publisher and realised it was rubbish. As I walked to my appointment I stopped in the middle of a bridge over the Thames and threw the manuscript into the river.</p> <p>Jane Revell, another seasoned ELT author, never throws anything away. \"Keep everything you write, even if at the time of writing you think it's a load of rubbish. Often a bit or reworking or rewording will turn it into a gem.\" Or maybe you can use it in your next book. Revell also gives some practical ideas on how to go about the writing itself. \"Don't just sit there. Write something. Write anything. Once you get started, ideas begin to flow and you can go back and improve on things later. Keep a notebook with you at all times and jot down ideas when they come to you, so you've got something to start with when you do come to write.\"</p> <p>Writing the book, however, is only the first stage. It needs to be edited, designed and printed, which is a process normally determined by publishers. Their treatment of your text will influenced by crucial considerations such as sales and distribution, No matter how good a book is, if it doesn't reach the attention of people who might want to buy it, the exercise will have been a costly and time-consuming failure. </p> <p>Many of the publisher's decision will be based on cost. Every page costs more money, but many of their suggestions will relate to making this a better book. As writer Ingrid Freebairn says, \"Don't think you know best. Listen to the editors. This is a team effort.\" Jeremy Harmer agrees: \"Many of the best books have owed their success partly to the editorial work that has gone on as the manuscripts have progressed.\"</p> <p>Whether or not you have an editor, take a professional view of your writing. Very often it is the phrase you love best that needs to come out. Keep checking that you're still on track. Think about what the audience wants. \"Make sure it works,\" as Ingrid Freebairn advises. \"Pretend you are a student or a bored teacher. Answer the questions yourself, be your own testing ground.\"</p> <p>With a draft written you then need choose (or find) a publisher. Start by looking for publishers that seem to publish similar works to yours (look along the shelves of an EFL bookshop - addresses are usually on the inside cover of books). Publishers will not usually publish something that competes directly with a current title unless it is past its sell-by date, but they may take something which complements an existing title. You may also benefit from \"me-too\" publishing, where a publisher produces a book similar to something by another publisher that sells well. </p> <p>If you are really breaking new ground, you either need a big publisher that can afford to take the financial risk, or a very small publisher that is prepared to put a lot of individual effort into marketing. Alternatively, you can publish it yourself - but that is another story.</p> <p>Never underestimate the role played by chance. As so many authors recall, their \"big break\" with a publisher came from being in the right place at the right time. This is what happened to Ken Wilson, but as he warns, \"you can't possibly predict when that right place and right time might be. As a young teacher, I was playing a song I had written for my class. A director of studies heard it, someone told Longmans and within a matter of months I was a published ELT author. I was 23.\"</p> <p>If you're good, the word will get out. But there is also plenty you can do to get yourself noticed. Present your ideas at teachers' seminars and conferences - most teachers' associations invite their members to put forward suggestions for lectures and papers. Start by writing for specialist ELT periodicals and magazines - at least it proves you can write. In this way you will get your name known.</p> <p>Often publishers will approach you. They are, after all, always in need of material to publish, and many publishers set about building a list, and they look for authors for specific books they want to commission. My first EFL book came about because I was commercial English director at one of the big London schools, and Longmans asked me to submit a synopsis for business English materials.</p> <p>Be warned, though. Writing is hard work and time-consuming. It is a bit like getting married or having a baby. If you really knew what was involved, you'd probably leave it to someone else. But don't let that put you off. The arrival of the copies of that book bearing your name makes the whole thing worthwhile - and very few of us ever stop at just the one.</p> <p>\u0095 Susan Norman is an ELT author</p>",

Start by looking for publishers that seem to publish similar works to yours (look along the shelves of an EFL bookshop - addresses are usually on the inside cover of books). Publishers will not usually publish something that competes directly with a current title unless it is past its sell-by date, but they may take something which complements an existing title. You may also benefit from \"me-too\" publishing, where a publisher produces a book similar to something by another publisher that sells well. If you are really breaking new ground, you either need a big publisher that can afford to take the financial risk, or a very small publisher that is prepared to put a lot of individual effort into marketing. Alternatively, you can publish it yourself - but that is another story. Never underestimate the role played by chance. As so many authors recall, their \"big break\" with a publisher came from being in the right place at the right time. This is what happened to Ken Wilson, but as he warns, \"you can't possibly predict when that right place and right time might be. As a young teacher, I was playing a song I had written for my class. A director of studies heard it, someone told Longmans and within a matter of months I was a published ELT author. I was 23.\" If you're good, the word will get out. But there is also plenty you can do to get yourself noticed. Present your ideas at teachers' seminars and conferences - most teachers' associations invite their members to put forward suggestions for lectures and papers. Start by writing for specialist ELT periodicals and magazines - at least it proves you can write. In this way you will get your name known. Often publishers will approach you. They are, after all, always in need of material to publish, and many publishers set about building a list, and they look for authors for specific books they want to commission. My first EFL book came about because I was commercial English director at one of the big London schools, and Longmans asked me to submit a synopsis for business English materials. Be warned, though. Writing is hard work and time-consuming. It is a bit like getting married or having a baby. If you really knew what was involved, you'd probably leave it to someone else. But don't let that put you off. The arrival of the copies of that book bearing your name makes the whole thing worthwhile - and very few of us ever stop at just the one. \u0095 Susan Norman is an ELT author",

      "body": "<p>Michael Bevan's purple patch continued yesterday in Hove, where he and Richard Montgomerie made <strong> Nottinghamshire</strong> pay a heavy price for sending <strong> Sussex</strong> into bat on the opening day of their Second Division fixture. </p> <p>Their second-wicket partnership was worth 292 out of a total of 404 for five, with each player registering his highest score for the county. </p> <p>Bevan's share was 166 off 213 balls, made in five hours and including 20 boundaries. The Australian left-hander has now scored 1,493 runs in all cricket this season and 533 in his last seven innings. </p> <p>It was his second successive championship century, following the unbeaten 151 made in the drawn match against Essex last week, and it will be a source of disappointment for Sussex that they will be without him for 10 days next month when he plays in three one-day internationals against South Africa in Melbourne. </p> <p>Montgomerie, who had previously passed 50 only three times in first-class cricket this season, made 133 with 19 fours. </p> <p>Another Australian left-hander, Simon Katich, made his third championship century of the season to provide the basis for <strong> Durham's </strong> 355 for nine against <strong> Lancashire </strong> at Old Trafford in the First Division. </p> <p>Katich, who put on 146 for the third wicket with Paul Collingwood (60), reached his hundred off 157 balls and went on to make 129 before falling to the slow left-arm of Gary Keedy, who took four for 99. England's Chris Schofield was the least successful of Lancashire's three spinners with one for 59. </p> <p><strong> Yorkshire </strong> bowled out <strong> Somerset</strong> for 182 in Scarborough despite losing their left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom, who tore a muscle in his hip after bowling one ball of his fourth over. </p> <p>At the close the hosts had reached 144 for three, with the young opener Simon Widdup hitting seven boundaries in 44 made from 85 balls in only his second senior game for Yorkshire. </p> <p>Paul Pollard (77) and David Leatherdale (62) took the batting honours in Chelmsford with a stand of 117 to carry the Second Division leaders <strong> Worcestershire </strong> to 232 for seven. But the 18-year-old fast bowler Andrew McGarry caught the eye for <strong> Essex </strong> with three for 29 from 16 overs on his championship debut. </p> <p>Darren Thomas took five wickets in an innings for the second time this summer as <strong> Northamptonshire </strong> were dismissed for 229 by <strong> Glamorgan </strong> in Cardiff. </p> <p>Thomas's efforts were all the more commendable as his new-ball partner Steve Watkin, who had taken his 800th first-class wicket for Glamorgan with the third ball of the day, limped off with a groin strain in the first over after lunch. Glamorgan themselves were two wickets down by the close. </p> <p>\u0095 Neil Johnson has become the second Zimbabwe player to announce that he is to end his international career. Johnson will return to South Africa as the overseas player for Western Province in a move understood to be influenced by financial and political reasons. Murray Goodwin announced immediately after the recent Zimbabwean elections that he would return to Australia.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Bevan's purple patch continued yesterday in Hove, where he and Richard Montgomerie made Nottinghamshire pay a heavy price for sending Sussex into bat on the opening day of their Second Division fixture. Their second-wicket partnership was worth 292 out of a total of 404 for five, with each player registering his highest score for the county. Bevan's share was 166 off 213 balls, made in five hours and including 20 boundaries. The Australian left-hander has now scored 1,493 runs in all cricket this season and 533 in his last seven innings. It was his second successive championship century, following the unbeaten 151 made in the drawn match against Essex last week, and it will be a source of disappointment for Sussex that they will be without him for 10 days next month when he plays in three one-day internationals against South Africa in Melbourne. Montgomerie, who had previously passed 50 only three times in first-class cricket this season, made 133 with 19 fours. Another Australian left-hander, Simon Katich, made his third championship century of the season to provide the basis for Durham's 355 for nine against Lancashire at Old Trafford in the First Division. Katich, who put on 146 for the third wicket with Paul Collingwood (60), reached his hundred off 157 balls and went on to make 129 before falling to the slow left-arm of Gary Keedy, who took four for 99. England's Chris Schofield was the least successful of Lancashire's three spinners with one for 59. Yorkshire bowled out Somerset for 182 in Scarborough despite losing their left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom, who tore a muscle in his hip after bowling one ball of his fourth over. At the close the hosts had reached 144 for three, with the young opener Simon Widdup hitting seven boundaries in 44 made from 85 balls in only his second senior game for Yorkshire. Paul Pollard (77) and David Leatherdale (62) took the batting honours in Chelmsford with a stand of 117 to carry the Second Division leaders Worcestershire to 232 for seven. But the 18-year-old fast bowler Andrew McGarry caught the eye for Essex with three for 29 from 16 overs on his championship debut. Darren Thomas took five wickets in an innings for the second time this summer as Northamptonshire were dismissed for 229 by Glamorgan in Cardiff. Thomas's efforts were all the more commendable as his new-ball partner Steve Watkin, who had taken his 800th first-class wicket for Glamorgan with the third ball of the day, limped off with a groin strain in the first over after lunch. Glamorgan themselves were two wickets down by the close. \u0095 Neil Johnson has become the second Zimbabwe player to announce that he is to end his international career. Johnson will return to South Africa as the overseas player for Western Province in a move understood to be influenced by financial and political reasons. Murray Goodwin announced immediately after the recent Zimbabwean elections that he would return to Australia.",

      "body": "<p>On the face of it, today's announcement in Nature that a team of Princeton physicists have broken the light barrier demolishes what is arguably science's most cherished principle. </p> <p>Ever since Albert Einstein formulated his theory of relativity nearly a century ago, it has been a central tenet of physics that nothing can travel faster than light. Now it is claimed that in certain circumstances, light itself can be accelerated up to 300 times its usual speed. But it's too soon to consign the textbooks to the dustbin. As always, the devil is in the detail. </p> <p>Moving through a vacuum, light travels at 300,000 km per second. According to the theory of relativity, it is the ultimate speed limit for the propagation of any physical influence. That includes spacecraft, subatomic particles, radio signals, or anything that might convey information or cause an effect. </p> <p>When light passes through a medium such as air, it is slowed. The effect is best explained by analogy with water waves. Try throwing a stone in a pond to make ripples. Focus on a particular wave crest, and it will appear to move fairly fast, but then take a wider perspective to view the group of waves as a whole, and it travels outwards from the point of disturbance noticeably more slowly. It is almost as if the waves are rushing to get nowhere fast. You can watch as new ripples rise up at the back of the wave group, whiz forwards, and fade away at the front. </p> <p>The same thing happens to light in a medium. It comes about because atoms in the medium create outgoing ripples of light as the primary light wave sweeps by them. When these ripples overlap and combine with the primary wave, they obliterate the parts racing on ahead, suppressing the fast-moving wave front and serving to slow down the group. So light passing through a medium has two associated velocities: that of the group as a whole, and that of the individual wave crests, known as the phase velocity. </p> <p>A normal medium always reduces the group velocity of light to below its phase velocity, leading to the familiar phenomenon of refraction - the effect that causes a stick to look bent when it is stuck in water. The special feature of the Princeton experiment was the creation of a peculiar state of matter in which this situation is reversed: the secondary ripples of light actually make the wave group travel faster than the phase velocity. </p> <p>To achieve this odd state of affairs, the scientists used a gas of cold caesium, and then excited the caesium atoms with a laser. So energised, the atoms do more than cause secondary ripples of light, they amplify the light too. It is this amplification that is the key to boosting the speed of the wave group, reportedly to 300 times the speed of light in a vacuum. Bizarrely, the wave distortion achieved is so large, it causes the group velocity to become negative, which means the peak of the wave pulse appears to exit the gas before it enters. In other words, the light waves seem to run backwards. </p> <p>What makes this result so sensational is the relationship between light speed and causality.

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, today's announcement in Nature that a team of Princeton physicists have broken the light barrier demolishes what is arguably science's most cherished principle. Ever since Albert Einstein formulated his theory of relativity nearly a century ago, it has been a central tenet of physics that nothing can travel faster than light. Now it is claimed that in certain circumstances, light itself can be accelerated up to 300 times its usual speed. But it's too soon to consign the textbooks to the dustbin. As always, the devil is in the detail. Moving through a vacuum, light travels at 300,000 km per second. According to the theory of relativity, it is the ultimate speed limit for the propagation of any physical influence. That includes spacecraft, subatomic particles, radio signals, or anything that might convey information or cause an effect. When light passes through a medium such as air, it is slowed. The effect is best explained by analogy with water waves. Try throwing a stone in a pond to make ripples. Focus on a particular wave crest, and it will appear to move fairly fast, but then take a wider perspective to view the group of waves as a whole, and it travels outwards from the point of disturbance noticeably more slowly. It is almost as if the waves are rushing to get nowhere fast. You can watch as new ripples rise up at the back of the wave group, whiz forwards, and fade away at the front. The same thing happens to light in a medium. It comes about because atoms in the medium create outgoing ripples of light as the primary light wave sweeps by them. When these ripples overlap and combine with the primary wave, they obliterate the parts racing on ahead, suppressing the fast-moving wave front and serving to slow down the group. So light passing through a medium has two associated velocities: that of the group as a whole, and that of the individual wave crests, known as the phase velocity. A normal medium always reduces the group velocity of light to below its phase velocity, leading to the familiar phenomenon of refraction - the effect that causes a stick to look bent when it is stuck in water. The special feature of the Princeton experiment was the creation of a peculiar state of matter in which this situation is reversed: the secondary ripples of light actually make the wave group travel faster than the phase velocity. To achieve this odd state of affairs, the scientists used a gas of cold caesium, and then excited the caesium atoms with a laser. So energised, the atoms do more than cause secondary ripples of light, they amplify the light too. It is this amplification that is the key to boosting the speed of the wave group, reportedly to 300 times the speed of light in a vacuum. Bizarrely, the wave distortion achieved is so large, it causes the group velocity to become negative, which means the peak of the wave pulse appears to exit the gas before it enters. In other words, the light waves seem to run backwards. What makes this result so sensational is the relationship between light speed and causality. The theory of relativity predicts that speed slows time. For example, time passes a bit slower in an aircraft than on the ground, an effect that has been verified using atomic clocks. The time warp is small for everyday motion, but grows without limit as the speed of light is approached. Cosmic rays, for example, travel exceedingly close to the speed of light, and their internal clocks are slowed millions of times. Relativity theory predicts that if a particle could exceed the speed of light, the time warp would become negative, and the particle could then travel backwards in time. As Dr Who fans are aware, travel into the past opens up a nest of paradoxes. For example, suppose a faster-than-light particle is used as a signal to explode a bomb in the very lab that the particle itself is created. If the bomb explodes yesterday, the particle cannot be made today. So the bomb won't explode, and the particle will be made. Either way, you get contradictory nonsense. At stake, then, is the very rationality and causal order of the universe. Allow faster-than-light travel, and the physical world turns into a madhouse . Timing the speed of a pulse of light is fraught with complications, not least because the shape of the pulse changes when it passes through a medium. To make a pulse of a short duration, it is necessary to mix together waves of many different frequencies, and in a medium each wave will propagate differently. As for transmitting information, opinions differ about how to associate it with a pulse that has a complicated, changing shape. The inherent fuzziness in a light pulse made up of many different waves superimposed precludes a clean definition of how fast actual information travels. The problem is closely related to the quantum nature of light, where each frequency component can be thought of as made up of pho tons that behave in some ways like particles. But photons are subject to Heisenberg's principle, according to which there is an inherent uncertainty in their whereabouts.

It might have been perfect from a meteorologist's point of view but in fact it was more of a disaster. </p> <p>Still, the movie is a rattling good yarn and a great adventure, packed with noise and action in the mould of a James Bond film. I'm sure it will be a great success with filmgoers this side of the Atlantic, but perhaps not as much as in the US. Nevertheless, the sets and special effects were magnificent. It's a bit slow to get going but is still a great action film and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an evening away from the humdrum of normal life and who doesn't always want a predictable ending. </p> <p>The Perfect Storm is the story of a fishing boat getting caught up in a developing hurricane some nine years ago. Although at the beginning of the film we are told it is based on a true story, I think it is done so very loosely and contains a great deal of poetic licence. It gets very dramatic during the storm but the truth is nobody knows what the hell it was actually like because the fishermen lost all radio contact. </p> <p>Even though the forecasting of severe storms has made enormous strides over the past decade, I do feel that the skipper of the fishing boat brought most of the disasters upon himself by not getting or heeding the weather forecast, so he could well be found negligent. I'd probably say the same about the captain of the helicopter rescue crew, since the helicopter scenes, although traumatic and exciting, were far removed from reality. </p> <p>I thought the actor who played the weatherman was lightweight. The forecaster didn't get as excited as most broadcasting weather forecasters would do if they saw this once-in-100-years storm coming along. He just sat there. For most of us, our eyes would of have gone glazed and we would have got up and started screaming \"I want more time\" before broadcasting. We would have made much more of it rather than saying blandly: \"If this happens and this happens then it could really be something dramatic.\" </p> <p>I thought the satellite pictures were great, but of course we've got some wonderful pictures of hurricanes now, and the eye of the storm looked really, really good. I think the sea special effects were also pretty good - suitably horrendous. Whether you get 100ft waves or not in real life, I'm not entirely sure, but it certainly looked good. </p> <p>I thought the helicopter crew that ran out of fuel but didn't go back to the coast were a bit stupid. Then they jumped into the water - into wild seas - which was ridiculous because you could never find anybody in that, but somehow they managed to locate each other, which was a bit far-fetched. And they talked to each other over screaming, 200-mile-an-hour winds, which is also pretty incredible because you'd never hear anything over that. </p> <p>George Clooney was very good, but I thought his character was foolish in not taking any weather advice. And when he did eventually get it through his fax he didn't heed it, so he could certainly be blamed for what happened. Having said that, he did have some terrible decisions to make: for the first time in umpteen trips they had a full load of fish and were thinking they were all going to be rich, but they had to go back quickly because the ice machine had gone up the chute. It was then they decided to go straight through this hurricane, which was immensely stupid, but a very tough decision to have to make, I suppose. </p> <p>When you get hurricanes you can't go very far wrong with the weather forecast. In 1987, when we got it wrong it wasn't a hurricane but hurricane-force winds, which is something different. A hurricane is a tropical revolving storm which you can see clearly on the satellite pictures and it doesn't move very quickly. What we had moved at 60mph. You wouldn't miss a big tropical revolving storm like the one in the film. </p> <p>\u0095 More about <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Film_Page/0,4061,-84443,00.html\">The Perfect Storm</a></p>",

I think the sea special effects were also pretty good - suitably horrendous. Whether you get 100ft waves or not in real life, I'm not entirely sure, but it certainly looked good. I thought the helicopter crew that ran out of fuel but didn't go back to the coast were a bit stupid. Then they jumped into the water - into wild seas - which was ridiculous because you could never find anybody in that, but somehow they managed to locate each other, which was a bit far-fetched. And they talked to each other over screaming, 200-mile-an-hour winds, which is also pretty incredible because you'd never hear anything over that. George Clooney was very good, but I thought his character was foolish in not taking any weather advice. And when he did eventually get it through his fax he didn't heed it, so he could certainly be blamed for what happened. Having said that, he did have some terrible decisions to make: for the first time in umpteen trips they had a full load of fish and were thinking they were all going to be rich, but they had to go back quickly because the ice machine had gone up the chute. It was then they decided to go straight through this hurricane, which was immensely stupid, but a very tough decision to have to make, I suppose. When you get hurricanes you can't go very far wrong with the weather forecast. In 1987, when we got it wrong it wasn't a hurricane but hurricane-force winds, which is something different. A hurricane is a tropical revolving storm which you can see clearly on the satellite pictures and it doesn't move very quickly. What we had moved at 60mph. You wouldn't miss a big tropical revolving storm like the one in the film. \u0095 More about The Perfect Storm",

      "body": "<p>Trams are set for a revival across Britain as part of the government's 10-year strategy for transport announced today by John Prescott.</p> <p>The secretary of state committed himself to constructing 25 new light-rail systems as part of a \u00a3180bn programme of investment in transport over the next decade - a programme criticised by London mayor Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>In a low-key House of Commons statement which contained few surprises but some significant commitments, Mr Prescott set out how he intends to spend the massive increase in transport funding announced by the chancellor in Tuesday's spending review. \"Transport is now a growth industry,\" he told MPs.</p> <p>Much of the new spending will focus on capital investment - in railway tracks, roads, trams and bus routes - with the aim of cutting congestion from its present levels. Mr Prescott also pledged that road congestion would be lower in 2010 than it is at present.</p> <p>The big winner from the announcement will be public transport. Of the \u00a3179.7 billion package, \u00a356.3 billion will have to come from the private sector. The area most dependent on private money is the railways, where \u00a334.3 billion of private money will be needed. Railways will gain \u00a360bn of investment over a decade - which includes a \u00a37bn modernisation fund - with the aim of increasing passenger numbers by 50%. The secretary of state for the environment, transport and the regions also guaranteed to implement the findings of the inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove incident, saying: \"Safety will always be first in my plans.\"</p> <p>Urban transport wins \u00a359bn, much of it aimed at improving bus services, which Prescott sees as a speedy way of cutting congestion, and there will be \u00a325bn for London Transport.</p> <p>Road spending will concentrate on maintenance, with \u00a330bn going to local authorities to cut their repairs backlog. He also announced plans to widen 360 miles of the motorway and trunk road network and to build 100 new bypasses.</p> <p>The overall plan would \"deliver radical improvement for passengers, motorists, business and for all of us as citizens,\" Mr Prescott said, adding that the measures were \"new ideas, new powers, new resources - a new approach for a new century\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, major improvements aimed at easing congestion will have to be delayed because the capital has been \"dumped\" with the outstanding bill for the Jubilee Line, London mayor Ken Livingstone said today.</p> <p>The extension to the east London line, a new Wimbledon/Hackney tube line, a new east Thames river crossing, cross rail and improvements of transport to Heathrow Airport to cope with the new terminal five, will have to be deferred because of the \u00a33.2 billion transport budget secured from government today \u00a3104 million must pay for outstanding Jubilee Line bills.</p> <p>\"It's bizarre. Did someone in the Treasury forget to pay the bill and were they waiting for the first available sap to pay for it?\" Mr Livingstone said at a news conference.</p> <p>\"It is tragic to have come so close and then to hear the Treasury have done a great doo-doo on the Mayor's doorstep.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trams are set for a revival across Britain as part of the government's 10-year strategy for transport announced today by John Prescott. The secretary of state committed himself to constructing 25 new light-rail systems as part of a \u00a3180bn programme of investment in transport over the next decade - a programme criticised by London mayor Ken Livingstone. In a low-key House of Commons statement which contained few surprises but some significant commitments, Mr Prescott set out how he intends to spend the massive increase in transport funding announced by the chancellor in Tuesday's spending review. \"Transport is now a growth industry,\" he told MPs. Much of the new spending will focus on capital investment - in railway tracks, roads, trams and bus routes - with the aim of cutting congestion from its present levels. Mr Prescott also pledged that road congestion would be lower in 2010 than it is at present. The big winner from the announcement will be public transport. Of the \u00a3179.7 billion package, \u00a356.3 billion will have to come from the private sector. The area most dependent on private money is the railways, where \u00a334.3 billion of private money will be needed. Railways will gain \u00a360bn of investment over a decade - which includes a \u00a37bn modernisation fund - with the aim of increasing passenger numbers by 50%. The secretary of state for the environment, transport and the regions also guaranteed to implement the findings of the inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove incident, saying: \"Safety will always be first in my plans.\" Urban transport wins \u00a359bn, much of it aimed at improving bus services, which Prescott sees as a speedy way of cutting congestion, and there will be \u00a325bn for London Transport. Road spending will concentrate on maintenance, with \u00a330bn going to local authorities to cut their repairs backlog. He also announced plans to widen 360 miles of the motorway and trunk road network and to build 100 new bypasses. The overall plan would \"deliver radical improvement for passengers, motorists, business and for all of us as citizens,\" Mr Prescott said, adding that the measures were \"new ideas, new powers, new resources - a new approach for a new century\". Meanwhile, major improvements aimed at easing congestion will have to be delayed because the capital has been \"dumped\" with the outstanding bill for the Jubilee Line, London mayor Ken Livingstone said today. The extension to the east London line, a new Wimbledon/Hackney tube line, a new east Thames river crossing, cross rail and improvements of transport to Heathrow Airport to cope with the new terminal five, will have to be deferred because of the \u00a33.2 billion transport budget secured from government today \u00a3104 million must pay for outstanding Jubilee Line bills. \"It's bizarre. Did someone in the Treasury forget to pay the bill and were they waiting for the first available sap to pay for it?\" Mr Livingstone said at a news conference. \"It is tragic to have come so close and then to hear the Treasury have done a great doo-doo on the Mayor's doorstep.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>TURNING POINT</strong></p> <p>John Gregory has had a terrible time in the transfer market of late, so the Fiver is well pleased to see him enjoy a bit of luck. No, honest. Gregory finally made an impact in the marketplace today when he secured the signature of Turkish defender Alpay from Fenerbahce for \u00a35.6m. You may remember Alpay: he's the one who would have delivered a punch to the face of Fernando Couto in the Euro 2000 quarter-finals (had the Portuguese defender not already dived out of the way in a successful effort to get him sent off, that is).</p> <p>Gregory's luck changed when Alpay's expected move to Greek club Olympiakos collapsed at the last minute. The Villa boss mobilised himself quickly and swooped to snap up a 27-year-old player he describes as having \"a lot of good qualities\". Managers can never complete swift deals like this without boardroom backing, remember, and we're sure Trinity Road stand regulars would want to take this opportunity to doff their caps to their ultra-popular chairman Doug Ellis for all his selfless work. Yes, we're certainly sure of that.</p> <p>Having finally signed someone, Gregory set about the vultures hovering over Villa Park with renewed confidence. He shooed off Manchester City and their piddling \u00a36m offer for Ugo Ehiogu - \"the bid does not match our valuation and has been rejected\" - and then swatted Wimbledon, who are buzzing around Paul Merson, like a fly: \"I am not surprised that Wimbledon are interested in taking Paul, but I am sure they will also not be surprised that our response is to keep him.\"</p> <p>All in all, then, a good day's work - and still no bids for Gareth Southgate. Yippee!</p> <p><strong>IF YOU WANT TO GET A PLAYER, GET A HAT</strong></p> <p>Roughly speaking, there are two methods used by the modern manager to determine his prospective summer signings. One is called the \"considered\" approach, which involves in-depth analysis of a player's performances and how he would fit into your existing line-up. The other is called the \"hat\" system, and involves pulling names out of a hat. Can you guess which method Middlesbrough boss Bryan Robson prefers?</p> <p>Yes, after a summer spent chasing the likes of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Dani, Nicolas Anelka and Zinedine Zidane, the hard-working Boro boss has yanked a picture of Robbie Fowler from his titfer. \"Robbie Fowler's not a bad player,\" Robson said today, responding to reports that he will offer Liverpool \u00a315m for the heterosexual hit-man. \"Everybody knows that we've got quite a bit of money to spend and they know I'm after top-drawer players.\"</p> <p>Sadly for Robbo, it seems his hat work will be scuppered by an armband, because Gerard Houllier has confirmed that Fowler will start the season as his captain. \"Robbie is the vice-captain,\" Gerard Houllier explained today, \"and because of Jamie Redknapp's injury, if Robbie plays he is captain.\" Whether the introduction of long-term Liverpool target Christian Ziege into the equation would change Houllier's mind or not is another matter, but as Robson is disinclined to part with the German international, he'll probably have to return to the hat. Who's this 7\u00be?

Meanwhile, German club FC Hamburg have confirmed that Everton are to sign Danish international midfielder Thomas Gravesen. \"I couldn't let such a good opportunity slip away,\" said Gravesen, who was a member of Denmark's Euro 2000 squad. Manchester United defender Ronny Johnsen should be fit for the start of the new season. He is believed to have finally recovered from a condition called jumper's knee which kept him out of the United team for the whole of last season. Muzzy Izzett has signed a new four-year contract with Leicester, putting an end to speculation that he was set to leave the club. Izzett's teammate Neil Lennon has been the subject of a \u00a36m bid from Martin O'Neill's Celtic, and will talk with manager Peter Taylor about his future tomorrow. Rangers have given FC Schalke 04 until the end of the day to accept or reject their \u00a36.5m offer for Belgian striker Emile Mpenza. \"It will be sorted out way or another today. The manager has said that if we don't resolve it today, we must move on,\" chairman David Murray said. Everton's new signing, Ghanaian midfielder Alex Nyarko, has been awarded a work permit by the department of employment. St Johnstone have signed French defender Mohamed Sylla on a three-year deal.

Well, nobody suggested it would be easy.</p> <p>But Clinton had set great store by what cynics describe as his \"legacy project\" - earning a place in history as the man who finally brought peace to the Middle East. By summoning the Israelis and Palestinians to Camp David, he deliberately invited comparisons with the meeting 22 years ago when his Democratic predecessor, Jimmy Carter, brokered peace between Israel and Egypt.</p> <p>Yesterday's outcome may well enhance history's assessment of Carter (who was thrown out of office after a single term) but it can only diminish the stature of Clinton. Clinton's two big Middle East initiatives this year - the Geneva summit with the late President Assad of Syria last spring, and now Camp David - have both flopped. He will, no doubt, claim the credit for trying and pin the blame on intractable differences between the protagonists. But in both cases there is a common factor behind the failures: American arrogance.</p> <p>All the issues were well-known, the arguments well-rehearsed, long before the meetings. It has been obvious for years that Jerusalem is a major sticking point. So why did Clinton call the summit? Was it because he had something up his sleeve that he believed would turn Camp David into the brilliant success that he craved? Er\u0085not exactly.</p> <p>In a similar vein to Geneva last spring, Clinton seems to have assumed that congenial surroundings, and the presence of the world's most powerful man, would somehow work magic. Once at the summit, Assad and Arafat would turn to jelly, abandoning principles which they clearly regarded as important (even if Clinton didn't).</p> <p>Having done little to secure their confidence as an honest broker, having failed to come up with a workable plan to bridge the gaps, Clinton simply presented them with a thinly disguised version of Israeli proposals.</p> <p>Nobody, except perhaps Bill Clinton, should be surprised at the result.</p>",

But Clinton had set great store by what cynics describe as his \"legacy project\" - earning a place in history as the man who finally brought peace to the Middle East. By summoning the Israelis and Palestinians to Camp David, he deliberately invited comparisons with the meeting 22 years ago when his Democratic predecessor, Jimmy Carter, brokered peace between Israel and Egypt. Yesterday's outcome may well enhance history's assessment of Carter (who was thrown out of office after a single term) but it can only diminish the stature of Clinton. Clinton's two big Middle East initiatives this year - the Geneva summit with the late President Assad of Syria last spring, and now Camp David - have both flopped. He will, no doubt, claim the credit for trying and pin the blame on intractable differences between the protagonists. But in both cases there is a common factor behind the failures: American arrogance. All the issues were well-known, the arguments well-rehearsed, long before the meetings. It has been obvious for years that Jerusalem is a major sticking point. So why did Clinton call the summit? Was it because he had something up his sleeve that he believed would turn Camp David into the brilliant success that he craved? Er\u0085not exactly. In a similar vein to Geneva last spring, Clinton seems to have assumed that congenial surroundings, and the presence of the world's most powerful man, would somehow work magic. Once at the summit, Assad and Arafat would turn to jelly, abandoning principles which they clearly regarded as important (even if Clinton didn't). Having done little to secure their confidence as an honest broker, having failed to come up with a workable plan to bridge the gaps, Clinton simply presented them with a thinly disguised version of Israeli proposals. Nobody, except perhaps Bill Clinton, should be surprised at the result.",

The European Commission has found that British tourists holidaying in Europe are paying over the odds when buying their local currency, and Barclays' Portuguese arm has been named and shamed. </p> <p>So where should you buy your holiday money for the best in value and convenience? Is buying before you fly the better option? And in what form should you take it? </p> <p>Some people dash to the bureau de change in the airport, anxiously scanning the flight board while they decide just how much they will need for two weeks in Riga. Other more organised types buy months in advance, speculating that the value of the euro will continue to rise. But most people, according to Thomas Cook, buy their cash eight days before departure. </p> <p>The pound's strength against the euro peaked in May, but it is still 3% stronger against European currencies than it was last year, meaning that buying \u00a3500 worth of currency would give you an additional \u00a315 in euros. The pound's increase against the drachma means you get \u00a335 more than last year when exchanging \u00a3500, and its leap against the Turkish lira means you would get \u00a3195 more this year than last when changing the same \u00a3500, although local inflation will effectively cancel this out. Travellers to the United States will lose out, however; the dollar has risen 4% and buyers of \u00a3500 of dollars will get \u00a320 less. </p> <p>Although it makes sense to have some liquid local cash when arriving in a country, using your credit or debit card abroad is the cheapest way to pay. This could either be at the point of sale or by using the cards to withdraw money from an ATM. Using a card means you do not have to carry wads of cash or travellers cheques with you, athough there is still an element of risk involved as the card itself could be stolen. Bear in mind also that your remote Greek island may not have a cash machine. </p> <p>The banks charge differing rates for using cards abroad. Royal Bank of Scotland, for instance, charges 2% of the sterling equivalent of what you withdraw, to a maximum of \u00a34 and an exchange rate charge of 2.65% for withdrawing with a debit card. Credit card issuers charge around 1.5% to withdraw cash at an ATM, and some may charge a daily interest rate if the account is not settled in full when the bill is received. Nationwide has the cheapest credit and debit cards and Co-operative Bank the most expensive. </p> <p>According to the Consumers Association, making a purchase of 1,000 French francs with a credit or debit card costs, on average, \u00a397, compared with \u00a399 to buy the same amount of currency in the UK. </p> <p>Next in order of expense are travellers cheques. Whether you buy sterling cheques or foreign currency ones will probably depend on where you are going. In the US dollar cheques can be used in the same way as cash, and so small denominations are advisable. The same applies to Germany and the more touristy regions of Spain. But if you do buy in the local currency you can usually avoid paying commission when cashing them in. Either way, all Thomas Cook and American Express cash outlets cash their respective cheques for free, regardless of the denomination. </p> <p>When it comes to buying travellers cheques, Thomas Cook charges 2%, with a minimum charge of \u00a33, while American Express takes just 1% commission. Travelex rates vary according to the branch. Shops at BAA-owned airports charge a minimum of \u00a33 commission on sums up to \u00a3167, after which the rate is 1.5%. </p> <p>Most pricey of all is buying currency before you leave. Travelex charges a minimum of \u00a32.50 to change sums up to \u00a3167, after which the rate is 1.5%. Thomas Cook and American Express charge a \u00a32 flat fee for foreign notes, regardless of how much you buy. </p> <p>Alternatively, you could order your currency over the internet. The Chequepoint, International Currency Exchange, Post Office, Travelex and Thomas Cook sites all have this provision, although high commission charges make this an expensive - if convenient - way of buying. ICE charges \u00a33 commission and \u00a34.95 for delivery, while Thomas Cook's commission rate of \u00a35 includes delivery. Chequepoint and Travelex are both commission-free, however, and do not charge for delivery. </p> <p>Shopping around for the best exchange rates is not really worth while. On average, bureaux de change are slightly cheaper for foreign currency, but banks are better for buying travellers cheques. From time to time both will have special offers - Thomas Cook, for instance, is selling holiday cash commission free for the next three weeks, starting tomorrow. </p> <p>When you have to change your foreign currency back to sterling, Thomas Cook and American Express will buy back any unused notes for no commission, provided you present your receipt, although Thomas Cook specifies that you need to have bought at least \u00a3100 worth of money in the first place. For \u00a32.50, Travelex airport branches guarantee that they will buy back from you at exactly the rate you bought. </p> <p>Travellers cheques can also often be bought back commission-free, but you should check the terms of your issuer; Abbey National and HSBC, for instance, only buy back sterling travellers cheques on a no commission basis. </p> <p>Coins can also be changed. British Airways says that \u00a330m is wasted each year by travellers keeping their francs and pesatas as loose change. Thomas Cook and Amex will both accept pesetas, French francs, US cents and German marks. For other coins try the Travelex machine at the airport, which will be branded either Coinex or Foreign Coin Exchange. Each machine accepts the four currencies most popular in that location, so if you are in Terminal 4 at Heathrow that is French francs, US and Australian dollars and the Dutch guilder. The exchange rate, however, is poor, so why not do a good deed and put your coins into the airline charity envelope? </p> <p><strong>Cash tips</strong></p> <p>* If you are going to the United States increase the limit on your credit card. Many hotels and car-hire companies block out credit on your card in lieu of a deposit. </p> <p>* Do not use a debit card to buy currency or travellers cheques in the UK; you will be charged a handling fee even though the money is coming straight from your account. </p> <p>* Buy some dual-signature travellers cheques, allowing either of the signatories to countersign them for cash.

      "bodyText": "With permission, Madam Speaker, I will make a statement on the Ten Year Plan for Transport. Transport is a subject that has been close to my heart for all my working life. But for decades it has been in decline - dogged by stop-go funding and a short- term approach. Madam Speaker, on Tuesday the Chancellor set out how we can now begin to invest properly in our public services. He was able to do that because we have dealt with debt and sorted out the public finances. This meant we had to stick to the depressed Tory spending figures we inherited. We continued the last Government's fuel duty escalator both to limit greenhouse gas emissions and restore the public finances. That wasn't easy. It wasn't popular. But it was the right thing to do: Now we can build and invest for the future. Decades of under-investment and the lack of strategic planning had left us with a transport system in crisis. That is already changing. In three years, we have made real improvements: we have begun to tackle the road maintenance backlog; the overall decline in bus passengers has been halted and in many areas passenger numbers are rising; and rail passengers have increased by 17% and rail freight by 22% since the General Election. Transport is now a growth industry, and many of the problems it faces are of expansion, not decline. We have laid the foundations for the long term: we needed to integrate the Departments of Environment and Transport, we've done that; we needed a new strategy, we've done that; we needed radical new legislation, we've done that; we needed new forms of finance, we've done that; and today I am announcing the new resources to bring about a step-change in transport. So, Madam Speaker, these are new ideas, new powers, new resources - a new approach for a new century. It is on these foundations we are building today's 10 Year Programme. It is based on long-term investment by Government and business to modernise the country's transport system. It is vital for our economic success, and for the quality of our lives. It is excellent news for manufacturers and the construction sector who will be able to plan for the long term. On Tuesday the Chancellor announced that in the next three years, public spending on transport will rise from 5 billion pounds to over 9 billion. Capital investment will double in real terms. This was widely welcomed. The AA said it was: \"a welcome change from decades of penny-pinching and under-investment. They also said: \"There's no doubt that this represents the most serious attempt to tackle our transport crisis in years\". The Rail Users' Committee said the announcement was: \"good news for rail passengers and for the country\". The CBI also welcomed it. And the CBI Chair, Digby Jones, said on the Today Programme this morning that what is needed is a 10 Year programme providing substantial public and private investment, up to \u00a3180 billion. My Department's modelling, analysis and consultation comes to a similar conclusion. Our analysis is published in a document available in the Library. There is now a broad consensus about what is needed to reduce congestion, provide a bigger, better and safer railway and real choice in public transport. With public investment keeping pace with economic growth after 2004, total spending over the 10 years - public and private - will be 180 billion pounds. 132 billion pounds of this - almost three quarters - will come from the public purse. This is not all new money. But even if we maintained this year's spending as the norm, that means over 50 billion pounds of extra public expenditure. So, Madam Speaker, capital investment by Government and business together will be 75% more in real terms than over the last decade. The Plan addresses the issues in a realistic and business-like way. No frills, no promises of a rosy, traffic-free future. Just our best judgements- based on detailed analysis - of what the new resources will deliver. We are securing long term investment through long term partnership contracts: new rail franchises lasting up to twenty years, 30-year contracts for roads and 30-year contracts for the London Underground. But let me make it absolutely clear, if we put in public money we expect rail and bus companies - and local authorities - to deliver the goods: more investment and better services for the travelling public. On budget and on time. Madam Speaker, the policy we inherited on the railways planned for decline and reduced public support. Our programme includes 60 billion pounds for a bigger, better, safer railway - the biggest investment in railways for generations. We will deliver: better quality for the travelling public, lower regulated fares, 50% more passengers and 80% more rail freight. - a new Strategic Rail Authority with a new Rail Modernisation Fund of 7 billion pounds to help deliver those goals. So we will deliver a railway system which is: better for passengers better for freight better for the economy better for the environment A good deal all round. Our programme includes 59 billion pounds for modernising local transport in every region throughout the country. Increasing bus use by 10%, with guided buses, priority routes, park and ride and a modern fleet. Building on the \u00a3400 million of private investment that has already taken place. Light rail can transform our cities. Manchester and other cities have already shown what a difference it can make. So we are going to provide the resources for up to 25 new projects in our major cities. We will create greater social justice with: more accessible buses, trains and taxis for disabled people; cut-price fares for pensioners and disabled people. And for the first time we are recognising the problems of people who live in poorly-served, deprived urban areas, cut off from jobs and services. They can look to help from a new Urban Bus Challenge Fund to provide new links to their communities. Our successful Rural Transport Fund, which has already secured 2000 extra services, will rise from 60 million to 95 million pounds a year with a Rural Transport Partnership established in every county. Both urban and rural communities will benefit from an extension to fuel duty rebate for community transport. Small-scale, local improvements can make a big difference to people's lives, such as schemes to make walking and cycling safer and easier and 20mph zones, especially where children are most at risk. We will increase funding for these schemes. Madam Speaker, in London, our great capital city, we inherited a creaking transport system, congested roads and overcrowded trains. We have already made major investments in the capital, with the Jubilee Line and Docklands Light Railway Extensions and other projects. But our programme goes much further. The Mayor of London asked for 3 billion pounds over the next 3 years. London will receive 3.2 billion pounds. Over the next 10 years our programme provides 25 billion pounds to support the London Transport strategy, with better buses, less crowded trains and less congestion on the roads. This will be enough to produce a step change in bus services, town centre improvements and safer walking and cycling. The Public-Private Partnership will secure investment in the existing Underground. And we have made provision for new links; an orbital London railway and longer-term projects such as a new east-west rail link and East Thames crossings. And we are determined to use refranchising to get better, more reliable rail services for commuters. Madam Speaker, these major improvements in public transport throughout the country will help reduce congestion and pollution. Sensible land-use planning and new technology can make a difference. But we also need to make better use of our road network. We have already set up studies into our busiest transport corridors to find solutions that involve all types of transport. The first conclusions will emerge over the next few months and are providing the resources to implement the results. The programme includes 21 billion pounds for the strategic road network. This is enough: to widen 360 miles of the most congested roads, such as the A1 and M6; to invest in 'electronic motorways' to manage traffic better and to keep drivers informed. There will be: 100 new bypasses to take traffic out of hard-pressed villages and towns; schemes to tackle congestion and safety hotspots; and low noise surfaces on 60% of the trunk road network, including all concrete roads. We have already dealt with the backlog of trunk road repairs. We will enable local authorities to get rid of the backlog on our local roads with a 30 billion pound maintenance programme. Without the measures in the Plan, congestion is forecast to grow by 28% on inter-urban trunk roads and by 15% in larger urban areas. With the Plan, we will not only eliminate this forecast growth. We will actually reduce congestion below current levels by 2010. Our proposals will produce savings in greenhouse gas emissions, helping to achieve our Kyoto targets and more. We will improve air quality, with new resources to encourage cleaner fuels and vehicles. Madam Speaker, safety is fundamental to our Plan. The terrible accidents at Ladbroke Grove and Southall - and over 3000 deaths on our roads every year - are a vivid reminder that we can never afford to be complacent. We will ensure the installation of train protection systems, as recommended by Sir David Davies. I have repeatedly stressed that we will not pre-empt Lord Cullen's Inquiry. But I also give a categorical assurance that the Plan will deliver any further measures arising from Lord Cullen's Inquiry. Safety will always comes first in my priorities. Our roads are already amongst the safest in Europe. Over the next decade we are determined to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents by 40%, and by 50% for children. We are providing the resources to enable government, the Highways Agency and local authorities, to play their part in achieving these targets. Conclusion It has often been the role of Labour Governments to modernise this country's infrastructure. That is what we are doing again with our 10 year plan. Long term investment and public-private partnership to increase choice and cut congestion. The Opposition have no plans to cut congestion only to cut public spending. The public will ask them to declare where they would make cuts in our programme. Madam Speaker, this is a Labour Government working with business to deliver the long-term investment needed to rebuild our infrastructure, cut congestion, improve public transport and give people choice. Modernising the transport system will take time. New roads and railways aren't built overnight. But with sustained Government investment and the backing of business we will make year-on-year improvements to get the job done. This Plan will get Britain moving and give the people of this country a transport system they can rely on. The British people have waited decades for a long-term approach like this. It is what the people of Britain deserve and I commend it to the House.",

      "body": "<b>Why is transport in the news?</b> <br> Two reasons. The immediate one is that Gordon Brown has boosted the government's transport budget, raising spending from its current \u00a35bn to more than \u00a39bn in 2003-4, an average annual increase of 20% a year in real terms. Spending on this scale should make a big difference to travel in Britain. Today the transport secretary, John Prescott will announce how he plans to use the money. The longer-term reason for transport's rising importance as an issue is that transport congestion - on the roads, in the skies and on the railways - is getting worse by the day. Some say traffic congestion costs the country \u00a310bn a year. Politicians now worry that if they don't sort out the problem, they will lose votes and the economy will suffer. <p><b>Why is congestion getting worse?</b><br> Partly because Britain's getting richer. More people travel by train, for instance, when the economy is doing well, and more people can afford to drive cars. It's no coincidence that congestion is worst in London, the richest part of Britain. Partly, too, because society is changing: we have entered an age of what transport experts call 'hyper-mobility'. We expect to be able to travel where we want and when we want and complain when congestion means we can't.</p> <p><b>Is Britain's transport system really as bad as we think?</b> No. Compared with much of the world, Britain's transport system works rather well. London's taxi drivers moan non-stop about the city's traffic but they'd find things very much worse if they worked in Bangkok, Tokyo or Mexico City. Americans are impressed by our railways, even if we aren't, and Heathrow remains the world's biggest international destination. But set against the rest of the EU, transport in Britain is undeniably unimpressive. </p> <p><b>Why?</b> Money is at the root of the problem. Britain spends under 1% of its gross domestic product on transport, less than Germany, France, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and as a result Britain's roads are five times more congested than Germany's, twice as congested as Italy's and 3.5 times more choked up than those of France. The chancellor's spending boost should help improve this aspect of the problem. But other causes will prove harder to tackle - geography, for instance. France has a far lower population density than Britain, and wealth is more evenly spread across the country. That makes it easier to establish a smooth-running transport network.</p> <p><b>What will happen if we don't act?</b> Analysts warn that road traffic could grow by 30% in the next 20 years and that congestion could rise even faster than that. Rail demand could go up by 30-50% in the next decade, as well. In 1979, there were 70 cars per mile of road. In 1997 there were 100 cars per mile of road, despite a transport policy that led to what the Conservative government called the 'biggest road-building programme since the Romans'.</p> <p><b>And if we do?</b> John Prescott's transport department is unveiling a 10-year plan which it promises will \"transform the country's transport network\" by tackling congestion bottlenecks on the roads, expanding railway capacity and building light rail networks. But it will steer clear of measures such as motorway tolls which might upset voters. Without draconian measures such as these some suspect little will change. Paris has fine public transport, for instance, but still sees terrible traffic jams. 81% of British motorists never use buses and getting them out of their cars will be a big job. </p> <p><b>So the jams will go on?</b> Yes. And beyond that, transport investment actually means they will get worse. Any improvement means a period of massive reconstruction which will see existing transport routes hugely disrupted. The west coast main rail line is now on the point of collapse because the builders bringing the line up to date get in the way of the business of running trains. London's Victoria line is closing for all of August simply to allow workers to replace some of its rails. Imagine how much chaos will be caused by a bigger reconstruction programme. And don't expect a smooth journey around Britain any time soon.</p> <p> <b>Useful links</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theaa.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">The AA</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.detr.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">The Department of Transport, the Environment and the Regions</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.argonet.co.uk/users/railwatch/\" target=\"_new\">The Railway Development Society</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.rha.net\" target=\"_new\">The Road Haulage Association</a></p>",

So the jams will go on? Yes. And beyond that, transport investment actually means they will get worse. Any improvement means a period of massive reconstruction which will see existing transport routes hugely disrupted. The west coast main rail line is now on the point of collapse because the builders bringing the line up to date get in the way of the business of running trains. London's Victoria line is closing for all of August simply to allow workers to replace some of its rails. Imagine how much chaos will be caused by a bigger reconstruction programme. And don't expect a smooth journey around Britain any time soon.

      "body": "<p>Cod is to be added to a list of endangered species by WWF amid fears that Britain's traditional dish of fish and chips is to disappear along with thousands of fishing industry jobs. </p> <p>WWF, the global environmental network formerly known as the World Wide Fund for Nature, will claim the species is already threatened with virtual extinction by overfishing as it launches its Oceans Recovery Campaign (Orca) today, which aims to raise awareness of the plight of the UK's marine environment. </p> <p>Cod stocks in the North Sea are down to one-tenth of the level 30 years ago. The catch used to be 250,000 tonnes a year but the maximum permitted cod catch this year under EU rules is 34,301 tonnes, but even this seems far too high. Catches to July 13 were 13,305 tonnes - so low because fishermen, even with radar and sophisticated satellite tracking equipment, just cannot find the fish. </p> <p>Scientists fear that North Sea cod may go the way of those in the Grand Banks of Canada, where overfished stocks disappeared in 1992 and have not revived. </p> <p>Elliott Morely, the fisheries minister, said the North Sea cod's plight had been caused over 20 years by the failure of EU and successive fisheries ministers to take scientific advice seriously, and quotas for catches being fixed too high. </p> <p>\"The results have been disastrous. That is why we are trying to do something about it now with all sorts of conservation measures, drastic cuts in quotas, nets that let the juvenile fish escape. Everyone realises what a mess cod are in.\" </p> <p>The plight of the once numerous fish has not been helped by changes in water temperature in the North Sea which has increased up to 3C. Cod prefers cold water and the rise in temperature, which some ascribe to global warming, has damaged cod's ability to spawn. But no one doubts that overfishing is the primary cause of the fish's decline. </p> <p>Barry Dees, the chief executive of the national federation of fishermen's organisations, said: \"The common fisheries policy has clearly not worked.

      "bodyText": "Cod is to be added to a list of endangered species by WWF amid fears that Britain's traditional dish of fish and chips is to disappear along with thousands of fishing industry jobs. WWF, the global environmental network formerly known as the World Wide Fund for Nature, will claim the species is already threatened with virtual extinction by overfishing as it launches its Oceans Recovery Campaign (Orca) today, which aims to raise awareness of the plight of the UK's marine environment. Cod stocks in the North Sea are down to one-tenth of the level 30 years ago. The catch used to be 250,000 tonnes a year but the maximum permitted cod catch this year under EU rules is 34,301 tonnes, but even this seems far too high. Catches to July 13 were 13,305 tonnes - so low because fishermen, even with radar and sophisticated satellite tracking equipment, just cannot find the fish. Scientists fear that North Sea cod may go the way of those in the Grand Banks of Canada, where overfished stocks disappeared in 1992 and have not revived. Elliott Morely, the fisheries minister, said the North Sea cod's plight had been caused over 20 years by the failure of EU and successive fisheries ministers to take scientific advice seriously, and quotas for catches being fixed too high. \"The results have been disastrous. That is why we are trying to do something about it now with all sorts of conservation measures, drastic cuts in quotas, nets that let the juvenile fish escape. Everyone realises what a mess cod are in.\" The plight of the once numerous fish has not been helped by changes in water temperature in the North Sea which has increased up to 3C. Cod prefers cold water and the rise in temperature, which some ascribe to global warming, has damaged cod's ability to spawn. But no one doubts that overfishing is the primary cause of the fish's decline. Barry Dees, the chief executive of the national federation of fishermen's organisations, said: \"The common fisheries policy has clearly not worked. We need a fundamental change, we need to manage zones of the sea. This includes no-take zones, seasonally closed areas, special nets to allow juvenile fish to escape. Each area needs its own special agreements and measures to protect the stocks. \"The EU dictating solutions to fishermen from afar is resented and has not worked. I still think it can be done, stock can recover, there is still all to play for.\" WWF described cod, which is worth more than \u00a340m a year to the Scottish fishing fleet, as a \"potent symbol of decline\" in the state of the oceans. According to the organisation, haddock, the mainstay of the fish supper in Scotland, is less depleted but its long-term future is just as insecure. A spokesman for WWF said the decision to place cod on the endangered species list was a warning bell to draw attention to the fact that urgent action was required. Alastair Davison, a marine specialist at WWF Scotland, said: \"The ocean recovery campaign is about much more than saving wildlife. Unless we take action to regenerate fish stocks, jobs in the fishing industry and the future of coastal communities will continue to suffer decline and be at risk. \"More than 70% of the UK fishing fleet is based in Scotland.

Fishermen and WWF share the same goal - abundant fish stocks in healthy seas. Marine life needs safe havens to survive and regenerate, and creating room for living seas is simply an investment in the future.\" Orca wants government action to regenerate the seas, including the piloting of fishing-free zones and a stronger network of protected areas. Cod lore \u0095 Cod can live 20 years and grow to 5ft but most are caught between two and four years before they reach sexual maturity \u0095 Cold water is needed for breeding so they spawn from January to April \u0095 Females produce up to 4m eggs but 98% get eaten before hatching, mostly by herring \u0095 Cod mostly eat other fish, sand eels, pout, herring, dab and shrimps \u0095 According to scientists, cod are \"outside safe biological limits\", which means there may not be enough breeding stock left to stop the species disappearing",

In the run-up to the summit, Greenpeace, the environmental group, urged G8 leaders to stop government subsidies it said were helping to destroy the earth's remaining ancient forests. The environmental organisation presented a new report from the Washington-based World Resources Institute (WRI), which said destruction of remaining pristine forests was subsidised by G8 governments to the tune of more than $3bn. The heads of the world's leading industrialised countries are also expected to come under pressure from campaigners to move more quickly on previous pledges to cancel the debts of poor countries.

The ruling was announced a short time ago at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London. Over 100 relatives, backed by the media, had sought the order which would force Health Secretary Alan Milburn to hold a public investigation \"to restore faith and confidence in GPs and the NHS\". Today Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Jackson, ruled the decision to sit in private \"contravenes Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights in that it constitutes unjustified governmental interference with the reception of information that others wish or may be willing to impart\". Earlier this year Shipman, 54, of Mottram in Longendale, Greater Manchester, was convicted at Preston Crown Court of murdering 15 patients at Hyde, Cheshire, but he is suspected of killing nearly 200. At a recent hearing, family lawyers urged Lord Justice Kennedy and Mr Justice Jackson to intervene over the investigation into the deaths. They argued that Mr Milburn had been wrong to direct evidence to be given in private, and stressed that an open hearing was vital. But earlier David Elvin QC, appearing for the Health Secretary, had said the families had no \"legitimate expectation\" that the inquiry would be in public. The decision to hold it in private was plainly not irrational, he argued, and Mr Milburn had been entitled to decide that a private hearing was the best way to obtain evidence and implement any recommended reforms as quickly as possible. Richard Gordon QC, appearing for inquiry chairman Lord Laming, said tensions were resulting from the fact that the inquiry was not going to be as broad as the families of those who died would like.

The shoe was found in a hedge in Coolham, West Sussex, about a mile from Pulborough where the eight-year-old's body was retrieved. Meanwhile, campers say they heard a little girl's screams on the night murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne vanished in West Sussex. But they have only just come forward to report the cries after realising their campsite was near where the eight-year-old's body was discovered. Police say they have taken statements from the two young couples who told them they were concerned about the screams but did not attach sufficient importance to them. They were camped at Fittleworth beauty spot on the weekend Sarah disappeared, three miles from where her body was found on Monday near Pulborough. The development came as Sarah's distraught parents begged the nation for help in finding her killer. In their first public appeal since the eight-year-old's body was found, Michael and Sara Payne were choked with emotion as they made the heart-rending plea. Later they broke down and sobbed after seeing the hundreds of flowers, toys and cards which had been left by the roadside near the spot where her body was dumped. An appeal fund has been set up by police for the parents as a focus for the hundreds of people who have sent money for the family in the wake of Sarah's death. At an emotionally-charged news conference the couple said public support had kept them strong throughout their 18-day ordeal. Police have received more than 28,000 calls in connection with the inquiry. Mr and Mrs Payne, both 31, from Hersham, Surrey, told reporters at Littlehampton police station in West Sussex: \"We've got a job now and that's to catch this person, or persons...whoever it is has got to be stopped.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> Repairing the damage</strong> </p> <p>For those of us obliged to rely on Britain's now-you-see-it-now-you-don't transport system, the only consolation is the thought of the huge insurance premiums paid by the car drivers who speed by us. That comfort is to become even more consoling as premiums are set to soar by up to 2% a month over the next year. </p> <p>One reason is the numerous mergers within the insurance industry which has swallowed competition and killed off smaller independents. Prices, insiders lament, have been kept artificially low in the cut-throat market of the 90s; now the surviving big boys can flex their muscles, hike prices and \"streamline\" the range of policy types once offered by their rivals. </p> <p>So what is it that drivers get for their \u00a3600-odd a year? V Mitchell of Cardiff surrendered her car to Endsleigh insurance after an accident and emphasised that she wanted a repair for sentimental reasons even if she had to contribute towards it. However, after two weeks of waiting she was told the vehicle was a write-off and had been taken to a salvage yard. </p> <p>She was offered \u00a3500 if she accepted it back unrepaired and \u00a3800 if it was scrapped. \"This,\" she says, \"despite the fact that it was insured for \u00a31,600.\" When the car was eventually returned she found that it had been stripped of its battery and spare wheel. Five weeks on she was still waiting for a cheque and replacement parts. </p> <p>\u0095\"We can see exactly why she's so frustrated,\" says an eager young spokesman. \"The car was tampered with and filleted and pilfered and we are cap in hand.\" The car was taken to the scrapyard simply to be stored safely, he points out, although usually owners are warned of this beforehand. As for the measly recompense, it's one of the joys of being an insurer that they are allowed to offer the policy value or the market value, whichever is the lower. In this case the car was worth less than the policy, but, in its contrition, Endsleigh has now agreed to fund the full cost of the \"uneconomical\" repair. </p> <p><strong> The cost of courtesy</strong> </p> <p>Elisabeth Standen is a disabled passenger who, last March, travelled with Wales &amp; West trains from Bristol to Yatton. She checked the facilities on the helpline beforehand, but found that on the return leg there was no ramp. Instead, her friend and a fellow passenger lifted her into the carriage, after which the guard appeared and tried to prevent the friend from leaving the train. </p> <p>\"She told her that she could not take responsibility for me and behaved as though my friend were trying to abandon a baby,\" she says. </p> <p>The same guard told Standen that staff at Bristol would help her out of the carriage, but no one appeared. This time the taxi driver, whom Standen had booked to meet her, lifted her down, but the guard tried to prevent her from taking Standen to her cab. \"Her behaviour was completely out of order as the driver was clearly wearing an identity badge and we were both obviously on first name terms,\" she says. Standen wrote a letter complaining of her humiliation in March but never received a reply. </p> <p>\u0095Courtesy levels in Wales &amp; West HQ are no improvement on those on Standen's train. A weary-sounding spokeswoman agrees to investigate and that's the last we hear from her. </p> <p>Weeks later, when Consumer manages to track her down, the exchange goes something like this: \"Mrs Standen has apologised to us for contacting you because we have resolved it.\" \"Was it resolved after we intervened?\" \"Yes.\" \"So why has she had to apologise.\" \"Don't know.\" </p> <p>Our amiable contact refuses to comment further, but Standen has just reported that an apology and a goodwill cheque for \u00a315 has since arrived in the post. </p> <p><strong> Charging for change</strong><br> </p> <p> NatWest has this week invested in pages of smug adverts, boasting of how they have cut their charges and become champions of altruism. Mary Gill was therefore surprised to be asked if she was a NatWest account holder when she asked the bank to change a \u00a320 note, freshly dispensed from its cashpoint, into fivers. \"I was told that if I were not, I'd be charged \u00a33 for a transaction that took all of 10 seconds,\" she says. </p> <p>\u0095\"It's a discretionary charge,\" says a NatWest spokeswoman. \"If a customer came in for change for a bus and it was raining we'd be sympathetic, but if you walk in every day and want change for your antiques business we'd charge a fee.\" </p> <p>A spokesman from the National Association of Bank and Insurance customers takes a more robust view: \"It's another way for banks to try to make you become a customer by not doing business with anyone who isn't one.\" </p> <p><strong> Men come first - it's in the small print</strong> </p> <p> Recently we published a disgruntled enquiry from a reader who found herself unable to vote in Standard Life's demutualisation ballot. Her husband's name came first on their joint account which meant that he was the nominal account holder with the sole right to vote. The man's name, as she pointed out, is traditionally put first and no one at the building society had ever asked the couple for their preference. </p> <p>Geraldine Simmons of Merseyside will also find herself out of pocket because of the system. Three years ago she and her ex-husband remortgaged their home through Bradford &amp; Bingley and his name appeared first on the policy. At the end of last year she transferred the account into her name only. Shortly afterwards, borrowers who had taken out their loan before April 1999 were told they would receive shares if the company floated on the stock market, but Simmons found herself ineligible because during the qualifying period her ex-husband was the official account holder. </p> <p>\"As far as I am aware we were not asked which name we wished to appear first,\" she says. \"Now neither of us will receive anything.\" </p> <p>\u0095Bradford &amp; Bingley points to its terms and conditions which do explain (at the end of the eighth section) that the first name in a joint account is the nominal account holder with sole right to vote. Women beware - always read the small print. </p> <p><strong> An ink cartridge is not just an ink cartridge</strong> </p> <p> David Godfrey of Twickenham wants to know how retailers can justify charging \u00a326 for a 28ml ink cartridge used in his computer printer. \"This works out at just under \u00a31,080 per litre of ink,\" he rages. \"What's so special about it?\" </p> <p>\u0095More than the layman could ever fathom, according to a spokesman for the Dixons group which sells large numbers of such cartridges. \"Over the past five years printers have dropped in price and part of their hi-tech facilities have been transferred to the cartridges,\" he says. </p> <p>So those bland plastic refills might contain their own in-built printer head, fade-proof ink, and a micro-chip or two. Really posh ones can deliver ink droplets of four million millionth of a litre to print fine quality photographs. </p> <p>They can't yet brew your early morning cuppa, alas, but doubtless that will come.</p> <p>Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Repairing the damage For those of us obliged to rely on Britain's now-you-see-it-now-you-don't transport system, the only consolation is the thought of the huge insurance premiums paid by the car drivers who speed by us. That comfort is to become even more consoling as premiums are set to soar by up to 2% a month over the next year. One reason is the numerous mergers within the insurance industry which has swallowed competition and killed off smaller independents. Prices, insiders lament, have been kept artificially low in the cut-throat market of the 90s; now the surviving big boys can flex their muscles, hike prices and \"streamline\" the range of policy types once offered by their rivals. So what is it that drivers get for their \u00a3600-odd a year? V Mitchell of Cardiff surrendered her car to Endsleigh insurance after an accident and emphasised that she wanted a repair for sentimental reasons even if she had to contribute towards it. However, after two weeks of waiting she was told the vehicle was a write-off and had been taken to a salvage yard. She was offered \u00a3500 if she accepted it back unrepaired and \u00a3800 if it was scrapped. \"This,\" she says, \"despite the fact that it was insured for \u00a31,600.\" When the car was eventually returned she found that it had been stripped of its battery and spare wheel. Five weeks on she was still waiting for a cheque and replacement parts. \u0095\"We can see exactly why she's so frustrated,\" says an eager young spokesman. \"The car was tampered with and filleted and pilfered and we are cap in hand.\" The car was taken to the scrapyard simply to be stored safely, he points out, although usually owners are warned of this beforehand. As for the measly recompense, it's one of the joys of being an insurer that they are allowed to offer the policy value or the market value, whichever is the lower. In this case the car was worth less than the policy, but, in its contrition, Endsleigh has now agreed to fund the full cost of the \"uneconomical\" repair. The cost of courtesy Elisabeth Standen is a disabled passenger who, last March, travelled with Wales &amp; West trains from Bristol to Yatton. She checked the facilities on the helpline beforehand, but found that on the return leg there was no ramp. Instead, her friend and a fellow passenger lifted her into the carriage, after which the guard appeared and tried to prevent the friend from leaving the train. \"She told her that she could not take responsibility for me and behaved as though my friend were trying to abandon a baby,\" she says. The same guard told Standen that staff at Bristol would help her out of the carriage, but no one appeared. This time the taxi driver, whom Standen had booked to meet her, lifted her down, but the guard tried to prevent her from taking Standen to her cab. \"Her behaviour was completely out of order as the driver was clearly wearing an identity badge and we were both obviously on first name terms,\" she says. Standen wrote a letter complaining of her humiliation in March but never received a reply. \u0095Courtesy levels in Wales &amp; West HQ are no improvement on those on Standen's train. A weary-sounding spokeswoman agrees to investigate and that's the last we hear from her. Weeks later, when Consumer manages to track her down, the exchange goes something like this: \"Mrs Standen has apologised to us for contacting you because we have resolved it.\" \"Was it resolved after we intervened?\" \"Yes.\" \"So why has she had to apologise.\" \"Don't know.\" Our amiable contact refuses to comment further, but Standen has just reported that an apology and a goodwill cheque for \u00a315 has since arrived in the post. Charging for change NatWest has this week invested in pages of smug adverts, boasting of how they have cut their charges and become champions of altruism. Mary Gill was therefore surprised to be asked if she was a NatWest account holder when she asked the bank to change a \u00a320 note, freshly dispensed from its cashpoint, into fivers. \"I was told that if I were not, I'd be charged \u00a33 for a transaction that took all of 10 seconds,\" she says. \u0095\"It's a discretionary charge,\" says a NatWest spokeswoman. \"If a customer came in for change for a bus and it was raining we'd be sympathetic, but if you walk in every day and want change for your antiques business we'd charge a fee.\" A spokesman from the National Association of Bank and Insurance customers takes a more robust view: \"It's another way for banks to try to make you become a customer by not doing business with anyone who isn't one.\" Men come first - it's in the small print Recently we published a disgruntled enquiry from a reader who found herself unable to vote in Standard Life's demutualisation ballot. Her husband's name came first on their joint account which meant that he was the nominal account holder with the sole right to vote. The man's name, as she pointed out, is traditionally put first and no one at the building society had ever asked the couple for their preference. Geraldine Simmons of Merseyside will also find herself out of pocket because of the system. Three years ago she and her ex-husband remortgaged their home through Bradford &amp; Bingley and his name appeared first on the policy. At the end of last year she transferred the account into her name only. Shortly afterwards, borrowers who had taken out their loan before April 1999 were told they would receive shares if the company floated on the stock market, but Simmons found herself ineligible because during the qualifying period her ex-husband was the official account holder. \"As far as I am aware we were not asked which name we wished to appear first,\" she says. \"Now neither of us will receive anything.\" \u0095Bradford &amp; Bingley points to its terms and conditions which do explain (at the end of the eighth section) that the first name in a joint account is the nominal account holder with sole right to vote. Women beware - always read the small print. An ink cartridge is not just an ink cartridge David Godfrey of Twickenham wants to know how retailers can justify charging \u00a326 for a 28ml ink cartridge used in his computer printer. \"This works out at just under \u00a31,080 per litre of ink,\" he rages. \"What's so special about it?\" \u0095More than the layman could ever fathom, according to a spokesman for the Dixons group which sells large numbers of such cartridges. \"Over the past five years printers have dropped in price and part of their hi-tech facilities have been transferred to the cartridges,\" he says. So those bland plastic refills might contain their own in-built printer head, fade-proof ink, and a micro-chip or two. Really posh ones can deliver ink droplets of four million millionth of a litre to print fine quality photographs. They can't yet brew your early morning cuppa, alas, but doubtless that will come.

      "body": "<p><strong>I've heard that Krishnamachari Srikkanth of India was the first pinch hitter in one-day internationals. What was his highest score?</strong> asks Kannan Tirupachanur </p> <p>Actually Srikkanth was almost a pinch hitter in Test cricket, as well as one-day internationals. He was an uninhibited opener who went for his shots right from the start. Ironically he made his debut in one of the dreariest of Test series - against England in 1981-82. India won the first Test (Srikkanth 0 and 13) and then Sunil Gavaskar and Keith Fletcher, the rival captains, seemed content to play out five boring draws on placid pitches. Srikkanth finished up with 2062 runs in 43 Tests, at an average of just under 30. He cracked two entertaining centuries: 116 v Australia at Sydney in 1985-86, when he reached his hundred from 97 balls and hit legspinner Bob Holland for 22 in an over, and 123 v Pakistan at Madras in 1986-87. That time he reached 50 in 86 balls, but needed only 32 more to reach 100. He captained India in four Tests in 1989-90, and last played for them in 1991-92.</p> <p>In one-day internationals - a form of the game which might have been invented for him - Srikkanth scored 4092 runs in 146 matches, and again averaged 29. He hit four hundreds, three in India and one in Sharjah. His highest one-day score was 123, like his Test-best, and came against Pakistan at Calcutta in 1986-87. He was top-scorer, with 38, in the 1983 World Cup final, when India pulled off a surprise victory over West Indies, the holders and overwhelming favourites.</p> <p>Whether Srikkanth was a pinch hitter (a term borrowed from baseball) is debatable - he was just playing his normal game. The first time the term was widely used was during the 1996 World Cup, when Sri Lanka promoted Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana from the middle order to take advantage of the regulation restricting the number of outfielders in the first 15 overs. The tactic was tried during the 1992 World Cup as well - Ian Botham had a mixed time of it for England, but Mark Greatbatch had more success for New Zealand.</p> <p> <strong> Who wrote the song that was the theme tune for the BBC's cricket programmes?</strong> asks Hywel ap Rees </p> <p>That tune was \"Soul Limbo\", which was written and recorded in the early 1960s by Booker T Jones, Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and Al Jackson junior, who were collectively known as Booker T and the MGs (the MG bit stood for \"Memphis Group\"). I tracked down a copy of the group's Greatest Hits CD on www.amazon.co.uk for \u00a36.99, if you're interested.</p> <p> <strong> Who is the youngest player to score a Test century?</strong> asks Tilak Malaviya </p> <p>It's Mushtaq Mohammad, who was only 17 years 82 days old when he made 101 for Pakistan v India at New Delhi in 1960-61. India's Sachin Tendulkar nearly beat him, but he was 30 days older than Mushtaq when he reached three figures for the first time in a Test, with 119 not out against England at Old Trafford in 1990.</p> <p> <strong> Which England batsman had his arm broken during the 1984 Old Trafford Test?</strong> asks David Ides </p> <p>It was Paul Terry, the Hampshire batsman (and fine fielder), who made his debut in the third Test against West Indies that year, at Headingley. Although he made only 8 and 1, he retained his place for the Old Trafford Test - but probably wished he hadn't when a ball from Winston Davis fractured his left arm. He retired hurt with 7, but returned later to help Allan Lamb reach his century. Terry, who was born in West Germany in 1959, never won another Test cap, but he played on for Hampshire until 1996, when he retired and moved to Western Australia. He finished with 16,427 first-class runs at an average of 36.66, with 38 hundreds, and over 8500 runs in domestic one-day cricket.</p> <p> <strong> Who was the first player of Asian or West Indian descent to play Test cricket for England?</strong> asks Vidura Gunapala </p> <p>It was KS Ranjitsinhji, the stylish Indian-born batsman who played for Sussex around the turn of the last century. \"Ranji\", who later became the Jam Saheb (prince) of Nawanagar, made his Test debut for England against Australia at Old Trafford in 1896, and scored 62 and 154 not out. He followed that up with 175 in his first Test in Australia, at Sydney in 1897-98. In all he scored 989 runs (44.95) in 15 Tests. In first-class cricket he scored 24,692 runs at the tremendous average of 56.37, passing 3000 in 1899 and again in 1900. India's Ranji Trophy is named after him, although he never actually played first-class cricket in India.</p> <p>Pelham Warner, England's captain in Australia in 1903-04, was born in Trinidad, but the first black West Indian-born player to represent England was Roland Butcher, who made his Test debut against West Indies on his native Barbados in 1980-81. </p> <p> <strong> What is the highest team score recorded in a one-day international, and what's Australia's highest?</strong> asks Paula Freeman </p> <p>The highest total in an official one-day international is Sri Lanka's 398 for 5 against Kenya at Kandy during the 1996 World Cup. Aravinda de Silva hit 145, Asanka Gurusinha 84 and Arjuna Ranatunga 75 not out. Martin Suji (9-0-85-1) was the chief sufferer among the bowlers. Australia's highest was set only last winter - 349 for 6 v New Zealand at Christchurch on Feb 26. Their previous record was 337 for 7, set 22 days previously against Pakistan at Sydney.</p> <p> <strong> Someone called E Crush dismissed Don Bradman when Kent played the Australians in 1948. Can you tell me anything about him?</strong> asks Bruce Reid </p> <p>Edmund \"Eddie\" Crush was born in Crabble, near Dover, on April 25, 1917. He bowled quickish offbreaks, almost at medium-pace, and played 45 matches as an amateur for Kent between 1946 and 1949. In all he took 83 wickets, at an average of 38.10. In the match against Hampshire at Canterbury in 1948 he made his highest score (78) and returned his best bowling figures (6 for 50). In that game against the Australians Crush had Bradman caught off a skyer by Bryan Valentine at mid-off for 65. The Australians - who went through the tour unbeaten and are now remembered as \"The Invincibles\" - made 361, then bowled Kent out for 51 and 124 to win by an innings and 186 runs.</p> <p><strong> Are there any proposals to publish another \"Wisden Anthology\", on the lines of those edited by the late Benny Green which covered the periods 1864 to 1982?</strong> asks Peter Collier </p> <p>There are no immediate plans, but our colleagues at John Wisden &amp; Co., who sometimes license out the Wisden name for suitable projects, say they are hoping to interest a publisher in the idea at some time in the future.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

The first time the term was widely used was during the 1996 World Cup, when Sri Lanka promoted Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana from the middle order to take advantage of the regulation restricting the number of outfielders in the first 15 overs. The tactic was tried during the 1992 World Cup as well - Ian Botham had a mixed time of it for England, but Mark Greatbatch had more success for New Zealand. Who wrote the song that was the theme tune for the BBC's cricket programmes? asks Hywel ap Rees That tune was \"Soul Limbo\", which was written and recorded in the early 1960s by Booker T Jones, Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and Al Jackson junior, who were collectively known as Booker T and the MGs (the MG bit stood for \"Memphis Group\"). I tracked down a copy of the group's Greatest Hits CD on www.amazon.co.uk for \u00a36.99, if you're interested. Who is the youngest player to score a Test century? asks Tilak Malaviya It's Mushtaq Mohammad, who was only 17 years 82 days old when he made 101 for Pakistan v India at New Delhi in 1960-61. India's Sachin Tendulkar nearly beat him, but he was 30 days older than Mushtaq when he reached three figures for the first time in a Test, with 119 not out against England at Old Trafford in 1990. Which England batsman had his arm broken during the 1984 Old Trafford Test? asks David Ides It was Paul Terry, the Hampshire batsman (and fine fielder), who made his debut in the third Test against West Indies that year, at Headingley. Although he made only 8 and 1, he retained his place for the Old Trafford Test - but probably wished he hadn't when a ball from Winston Davis fractured his left arm. He retired hurt with 7, but returned later to help Allan Lamb reach his century. Terry, who was born in West Germany in 1959, never won another Test cap, but he played on for Hampshire until 1996, when he retired and moved to Western Australia. He finished with 16,427 first-class runs at an average of 36.66, with 38 hundreds, and over 8500 runs in domestic one-day cricket. Who was the first player of Asian or West Indian descent to play Test cricket for England? asks Vidura Gunapala It was KS Ranjitsinhji, the stylish Indian-born batsman who played for Sussex around the turn of the last century. \"Ranji\", who later became the Jam Saheb (prince) of Nawanagar, made his Test debut for England against Australia at Old Trafford in 1896, and scored 62 and 154 not out. He followed that up with 175 in his first Test in Australia, at Sydney in 1897-98. In all he scored 989 runs (44.95) in 15 Tests. In first-class cricket he scored 24,692 runs at the tremendous average of 56.37, passing 3000 in 1899 and again in 1900. India's Ranji Trophy is named after him, although he never actually played first-class cricket in India. Pelham Warner, England's captain in Australia in 1903-04, was born in Trinidad, but the first black West Indian-born player to represent England was Roland Butcher, who made his Test debut against West Indies on his native Barbados in 1980-81. What is the highest team score recorded in a one-day international, and what's Australia's highest? asks Paula Freeman The highest total in an official one-day international is Sri Lanka's 398 for 5 against Kenya at Kandy during the 1996 World Cup. Aravinda de Silva hit 145, Asanka Gurusinha 84 and Arjuna Ranatunga 75 not out. Martin Suji (9-0-85-1) was the chief sufferer among the bowlers. Australia's highest was set only last winter - 349 for 6 v New Zealand at Christchurch on Feb 26. Their previous record was 337 for 7, set 22 days previously against Pakistan at Sydney. Someone called E Crush dismissed Don Bradman when Kent played the Australians in 1948. Can you tell me anything about him? asks Bruce Reid Edmund \"Eddie\" Crush was born in Crabble, near Dover, on April 25, 1917. He bowled quickish offbreaks, almost at medium-pace, and played 45 matches as an amateur for Kent between 1946 and 1949. In all he took 83 wickets, at an average of 38.10. In the match against Hampshire at Canterbury in 1948 he made his highest score (78) and returned his best bowling figures (6 for 50). In that game against the Australians Crush had Bradman caught off a skyer by Bryan Valentine at mid-off for 65. The Australians - who went through the tour unbeaten and are now remembered as \"The Invincibles\" - made 361, then bowled Kent out for 51 and 124 to win by an innings and 186 runs. Are there any proposals to publish another \"Wisden Anthology\", on the lines of those edited by the late Benny Green which covered the periods 1864 to 1982? asks Peter Collier There are no immediate plans, but our colleagues at John Wisden &amp; Co., who sometimes license out the Wisden name for suitable projects, say they are hoping to interest a publisher in the idea at some time in the future. Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

All is yellow and faded and scattered with crumbling relics of an abandoned wedding. The clocks are all stopped at 20 to nine.

The day came, but not the bridegroom.\" Miss Havisham is a grotesque, but like others among Dickens's most haunting grotesques only a step or two away from reality. As a child, I used to visit a small town in Sussex where the grocer's shop was run by a man whose daughter had met the same fate: the day came, but not the bridegroom. And now she sat day after day at an upstairs windows, shrieking and screaming abuse at her father's customers. No doubt her clocks too had stopped at 20 to nine.

And I promise you, no cats, though Roadkill is a real recipe.\" Roadkill Scrape the cat off the road take it home and fillet out the flesh throw it in the marinade where the deer you wrecked your bumper on a week before Xmas, sits in chunks, alongside slivers of fox, a boned, de-spined hedgehog, the legs and breasts of a slow hare - all in a bath of red wine with onion slices and garlic, and an ounce of juniper berries. That cat was the last ingredient you didn't know you needed and had better keep secret. After a day, strain the marinade and cook the meat all morning in the wine and blood. Serve in bowls, with bread. Matthew Sweeney from A Smell Of Fish (Cape \u00a38)",

His appeal to Londoners at the beginning of the mayoral election campaign in May raised \u00a3709,586 - most of it from small donations. But his election expenses only came to \u00a3389,000 - 55% of the total raised. Mr Livingstone says he will be writing to all donors offering to return 45% of their donations, although will also invite them to donate the money to his re-election campaign. He says he will donate 45% from donors who cannot be traced to Centrepoint, the London charity for the single homeless. Mr Livingstone says: \"I am amazed and delighted that so many people responded to this appeal and made my independent candidature possible. \"I am also grateful to donors big and small, but particularly gratified that we would have managed to raise the sum we needed simply from those who gave less than \u00a31,000.\" Mr Livingstone has lodged details of the donations with Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Elizabeth Filkin.

      "bodyText": "Moving home should become easier and less stressful because of moves to cut gazumping announced yesterday. The time it takes solicitors to conduct a property search on a house could be cut from six weeks to half an hour using an online conveyancing service, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, revealed. The national land information service website will give solicitors and buyers instant access to deeds and planning records that are currently available only through a lengthy process of written applications to more than 10 government agencies. Solicitors said the e-conveyancing website, which runs from spring next year, would allow them to access all planning and environmental information on a single register, so they could complete legal checks on a house in less than 48 hours and exchange contracts in a week. This would reduce gazumping, whereby a seller backs out and accepts a higher offer in the wait for solicitors to complete checks for the first buyer. Lord Irvine said: \"This is the first time since the Domesday book that we will have a complete survey of all land holdings and their associated values.\" He said gazumping was expensive and traumatic and should be avoided. Andrew Larner, of the government's improvement and development agency, said the website would cost between \u00a310 and \u00a320 to access and would eventually be free. It would allow solicitors to check a property's complete planning history, its access by public roads and environmental details such as its proximity to landfill sites. David Brown, of Abbey Law solicitors, took part in a pilot of the scheme in Bristol last year. \"Using the website we can complete our checks in 48 hours,\" he said. \"If the buyer has a mortgage complete and the seller has made detailed preparations, the website means contracts can be exchanged in one week. \"Previously, conveyancing entailed writing to 12 agencies, waiting for answers by post, then making written requests for clarification of those answers. Over 10% of house purchases would fall through in the time it took us to do this.

      "body": "<p>Pete Sampras and the Williams sisters may have grabbed all the headlines at Wimbledon, but deep in the bowels of the All England Tennis Club's headquarters in leafy SW19 tennis history of a different kind was being made. </p> <p>Its effects on how the sport is followed in the future are likely to be far more profound than any of the winning performances the relentless Sampras was able to muster. </p> <p>Somewhere around the time Venus Williams was presented with her first ever Grand Slam singles title, the official website <a href=\"http://www.wimbledon.org\">www.wimbledon.org</a> registered its two billionth hit of the fortnight. </p> <p>Just eight days into the two-week tournament all previous user records were broken. By the time Andre Agassi and Pat Rafter's electrifying semi-final moved into its fifth and deciding set, the Wimbledon site was registering more than 960,000 hits per minute from score-hungry fans. </p> <p>Even for Wimbledon the figures were unprecedented. For some of the bigger internet service providers they would have been statistics to die for. But, as anybody who runs an online sports service will tell you, sports fans cannot get enough of their favourite team or star and the web is the perfect medium for delivering that information. </p> <p>A decade after Rupert Murdoch described sport as \"a battering ram\" and used exclusive sports rights to build his BSkyB satellite empire, the comment is as true as ever. Internet service providers and mobile phone operators are queuing up to sign content deals with sports websites in the hope that consumers will spend just that little bit longer on their site or a few seconds more surfing their Wap phones if there is the promise of the latest soccer transfer news or England cricket score. </p> <p>Screen Digest's Rachel Church, author of a recently released 450 page report entitle Sport On The Internet, says her two subject matters could not be a better fit. \"The internet is considered the perfect medium for the average sports fan, who is usually passionate about one team and sport, as well as interested in big events and other sports to a lesser degree,\" she says. \"The web allows users to drill as deeply as they like in one sport, and, at the same time, get an instant, comprehensive overview of all the others.\" </p> <p>The Wimbledon site offered a huge range of information. Powerful technology from IBM enabled fans to have text messages of latest scores automatically sent to their mobiles and email newsletters dispatched daily to their PCs. Visitors could trawl through thousands of statistics from this and previous tournaments or use a robotic camera to zoom in and out on the live action on centre court. </p> <p>Players could come off court after a match and head for the locker room knowing a personalised statistic analysis of their performance would be waiting for them. </p> <p> By far the most popular service was the live scoreboard that web users could download to their desktops. It kept them up to date on scores from all courts in real-time while they worked. \"Office users across Europe and the US downloaded it in their hundreds of thousands,\" an IBM spokeswoman said. \"It was the immediacy of the scores that they seemed to love.\" </p> <p>In November, Neilsen Media Research found that 60% of UK adult internet users regularly logged on for sports and entertainment news. The anecdotal evidence from online sports providers is that the numbers have since grown exponentially. </p> <p>Research by Go2Net in May found that US sites <a href=\"http://www.ESPN.com\" target=\"_new\">ESPN.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.NBA.com\" target=\"_new\">NBA.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.NFL.com\" target=\"_new\">NFL.com</a> are the most popular on a global basis, but British sites such as <a href=\"http://www.Soccernet.com\" target=\"_new\">Soccernet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cricinfo.com\" target=\"_new\">CricInfo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Sports.com\" target=\"_new\">Sports.com</a> are not far behind. </p> <p>Users are predominantly male, older, up-market and decision-makers. In short, an advertiser's dream. Personalisation technology will increase the lure of the web as an advertising medium. </p> <p>By 2005 advertising on sports-related websites is expected to reach $6.27bn, up from $612m in 1999. The National Basketball Association in the US is expected to receive as much as 15% of its income from online revenue streams by 2004. </p> <p>For now though, the main value of sports content is in driving sales of new technology like Wap. Jupiter Research says 40% of consumers want additional content via their cellular handset or pager. </p> <p>\"Sports results is killer content for mobile internet devices,\" says Sports.com's managing director Tom Jessiman. \"Events change so often during the day and sports fans want to be kept updated on changing scores wherever they are, whether they're on the train, on the bus or standing on a street corner. They can wait until they get home to watch the highlights on television but they need to know the score as soon as it changes.\" </p> <p>During Euro 2000 and Wimbledon, Sports.com registered around 100,000 page views a day through Wap, compared with around 15,000 a day from portals like Excite and even less from many of the financial sites whose real-time share price updates were said to have been ideally suited to mobile phones. </p> <p>\"By the end of next year we believe more people will be accessing Sports.com through mobile devices than their fixed screens,\" Jessiman says. </p> <p>Jessiman, an American who ran Sportsline in the US, believes Europe's superior mobile penetration will give sports fans on the continent an 18-month head start over those in the US when it comes to receiving sports news on the move. </p> <p>In February, Vodafone signed a commercial alliance with the biggest sports brand of all - Manchester United. A four-year \u00a330m deal will not only put the Vodafone logo on United shirts but will also bring a range of mobile information services to the club's global supporter base, including access to the web. Vodafone predicts that in three to four years, United fans will watch highlights of matches and goals on their phones, and call in for exclusive audio reports, betting odds and statistics. </p> <p>Traditional broadcasters are picking up on the internet's sport potential and also positioning themselves for the introduction of broadband services such as ADSL and cable. BSkyB recently paid \u00a3301m for Sports Internet, owners of the <a href=\"http://www.Planetfootball.com\" target=\"_new\">Planetfootball.com</a> brand, 11 Premiership football club websites, a statistics service and an off-shore betting arm. It also has a stake in Sportal, a south London company specialising in building official websites for teams such as AC Milan and the South African rugby team. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sportal.com\" target=\"_new\">Sportal</a> built the official site for Euro2000 which offered 3,000 pages in six European languages and video clips of all the goals from previous European championships. During the tournament it registered 129 million page impressions. </p> <p>The web is providing huge commercial opportunities for sport's biggest stars. Yahoo and Microsoft are rumoured to have offered \u00a310m to run davidbeckham.com. Japanese footballer Nakata recently signed a \u00a330m internet deal and expects to make a further \u00a320m from merchandising. His site receives 100,000 visits per week. </p> <p>The most commonly searched for athlete on the web is Russian tennis star Anna Kournikova, says Lycos. Her <a href=\"http://www.kournikova.com\">site</a> is built in partnership with US firm Athletes Direct. Visitors can get their latest Anna \"fix\", trawl picture libraries, discover her favourite things (chocolate, Austin Powers and sit-ups, apparently) and ask her questions. (What was it like living in Alaska, Anna? Her reply: \"Alaska was pretty much like anywhere else!\") </p> <p>A large e-tailing section is devoted to her own merchandising range. But the success of kournikova.com depends largely on how long Anna remains the media's golden girl and whether a younger, more attractive version takes her place. </p> <p>There are thousands and thousands of sports sites, ranging from cheaply strung together sites on park football teams and school sports days through to lavish ventures such as <a href=\"http://www.Manutd.com\" target=\"_new\">Manutd.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wwf.com\" target=\"_new\">WWF.com</a>, official website of the World Wrestling Federation. </p> <p>Experts predict that many will struggle to survive. The winners, they say, will be those that combine a mass global and local appeal with a strong following. Leading clubs will be able to build communities, exploit archives of information and, soon, show video clips of goals. From 2001, Premiership clubs will be able to show their own games on their websites after midnight on Monday. </p> <p>However, Screen Digest's Rachel Church believes that niche sites, based around sports and teams whose loyal users are deprived of extensive television coverage, will also have their day. </p> <p>Technology as much as any other factor is likely to define the future of many websites and the way in which sport is consumed. But despite the growing importance of new delivery platforms and the success of sites like Wimbledon, traditional coverage of the tournament from the likes of the BBC is unlikely to be dropped. </p> <p>\"There's no single killer application,\" said Sportal chief executive Rob Hersov. \"The different distribution media like Wap, broadband and wireless will all be ways to distribute digital assets and consumers will be viewing the event or the information or the interactivity in different ways.\" </p> <p>So the Saturday Wap user may use the office's ADSL line during the week before going home in the evening to watch sport on digital television, using a PC to access the web for their statistical needs at the same time. And it would be a surprise if stars like Anna Kournikova didn't have a presence on every single platform. </p> <p><strong> Most popular UK sites</strong><br> <strong> Page impressions per month</strong></p> <p><strong> 1:</strong> <strong> soccernet.com</strong> 60 million <br> <strong> 2:</strong> <strong> sports.com</strong> 31 million <br> <strong> 3:</strong> <strong> formula1.com</strong> 27 million <br> <strong> 4:</strong> <strong> planetfootball.com</strong> 25 million <br> <strong> 5:</strong> <strong> sky.sports.com</strong> 25 million <br> <strong> 6:</strong> <strong> Sportal network </strong> 25 million <br> <strong> 7:</strong> <strong> Sports Internet</strong> 20 million <br> <strong> 8:</strong> <strong> sporting-life.com</strong> 15 million <br> <strong> 9:</strong> <strong> teamtalk.com</strong> 14 million <br> <strong> 10:</strong> <strong> football365.com</strong> 12.5 million</p>",

Just eight days into the two-week tournament all previous user records were broken. By the time Andre Agassi and Pat Rafter's electrifying semi-final moved into its fifth and deciding set, the Wimbledon site was registering more than 960,000 hits per minute from score-hungry fans. Even for Wimbledon the figures were unprecedented. For some of the bigger internet service providers they would have been statistics to die for. But, as anybody who runs an online sports service will tell you, sports fans cannot get enough of their favourite team or star and the web is the perfect medium for delivering that information. A decade after Rupert Murdoch described sport as \"a battering ram\" and used exclusive sports rights to build his BSkyB satellite empire, the comment is as true as ever. Internet service providers and mobile phone operators are queuing up to sign content deals with sports websites in the hope that consumers will spend just that little bit longer on their site or a few seconds more surfing their Wap phones if there is the promise of the latest soccer transfer news or England cricket score. Screen Digest's Rachel Church, author of a recently released 450 page report entitle Sport On The Internet, says her two subject matters could not be a better fit. \"The internet is considered the perfect medium for the average sports fan, who is usually passionate about one team and sport, as well as interested in big events and other sports to a lesser degree,\" she says. \"The web allows users to drill as deeply as they like in one sport, and, at the same time, get an instant, comprehensive overview of all the others.\" The Wimbledon site offered a huge range of information. Powerful technology from IBM enabled fans to have text messages of latest scores automatically sent to their mobiles and email newsletters dispatched daily to their PCs. Visitors could trawl through thousands of statistics from this and previous tournaments or use a robotic camera to zoom in and out on the live action on centre court. Players could come off court after a match and head for the locker room knowing a personalised statistic analysis of their performance would be waiting for them. By far the most popular service was the live scoreboard that web users could download to their desktops. It kept them up to date on scores from all courts in real-time while they worked. \"Office users across Europe and the US downloaded it in their hundreds of thousands,\" an IBM spokeswoman said. \"It was the immediacy of the scores that they seemed to love.\" In November, Neilsen Media Research found that 60% of UK adult internet users regularly logged on for sports and entertainment news. The anecdotal evidence from online sports providers is that the numbers have since grown exponentially. Research by Go2Net in May found that US sites ESPN.com, NBA.com and NFL.com are the most popular on a global basis, but British sites such as Soccernet, CricInfo and Sports.com are not far behind. Users are predominantly male, older, up-market and decision-makers. In short, an advertiser's dream. Personalisation technology will increase the lure of the web as an advertising medium. By 2005 advertising on sports-related websites is expected to reach $6.27bn, up from $612m in 1999. The National Basketball Association in the US is expected to receive as much as 15% of its income from online revenue streams by 2004. For now though, the main value of sports content is in driving sales of new technology like Wap. Jupiter Research says 40% of consumers want additional content via their cellular handset or pager. \"Sports results is killer content for mobile internet devices,\" says Sports.com's managing director Tom Jessiman. \"Events change so often during the day and sports fans want to be kept updated on changing scores wherever they are, whether they're on the train, on the bus or standing on a street corner. They can wait until they get home to watch the highlights on television but they need to know the score as soon as it changes.\" During Euro 2000 and Wimbledon, Sports.com registered around 100,000 page views a day through Wap, compared with around 15,000 a day from portals like Excite and even less from many of the financial sites whose real-time share price updates were said to have been ideally suited to mobile phones. \"By the end of next year we believe more people will be accessing Sports.com through mobile devices than their fixed screens,\" Jessiman says. Jessiman, an American who ran Sportsline in the US, believes Europe's superior mobile penetration will give sports fans on the continent an 18-month head start over those in the US when it comes to receiving sports news on the move. In February, Vodafone signed a commercial alliance with the biggest sports brand of all - Manchester United. A four-year \u00a330m deal will not only put the Vodafone logo on United shirts but will also bring a range of mobile information services to the club's global supporter base, including access to the web. Vodafone predicts that in three to four years, United fans will watch highlights of matches and goals on their phones, and call in for exclusive audio reports, betting odds and statistics. Traditional broadcasters are picking up on the internet's sport potential and also positioning themselves for the introduction of broadband services such as ADSL and cable. BSkyB recently paid \u00a3301m for Sports Internet, owners of the Planetfootball.com brand, 11 Premiership football club websites, a statistics service and an off-shore betting arm. It also has a stake in Sportal, a south London company specialising in building official websites for teams such as AC Milan and the South African rugby team. Sportal built the official site for Euro2000 which offered 3,000 pages in six European languages and video clips of all the goals from previous European championships. During the tournament it registered 129 million page impressions. The web is providing huge commercial opportunities for sport's biggest stars. Yahoo and Microsoft are rumoured to have offered \u00a310m to run davidbeckham.com. Japanese footballer Nakata recently signed a \u00a330m internet deal and expects to make a further \u00a320m from merchandising. His site receives 100,000 visits per week. The most commonly searched for athlete on the web is Russian tennis star Anna Kournikova, says Lycos. Her site is built in partnership with US firm Athletes Direct. Visitors can get their latest Anna \"fix\", trawl picture libraries, discover her favourite things (chocolate, Austin Powers and sit-ups, apparently) and ask her questions. (What was it like living in Alaska, Anna? Her reply: \"Alaska was pretty much like anywhere else!\") A large e-tailing section is devoted to her own merchandising range. But the success of kournikova.com depends largely on how long Anna remains the media's golden girl and whether a younger, more attractive version takes her place. There are thousands and thousands of sports sites, ranging from cheaply strung together sites on park football teams and school sports days through to lavish ventures such as Manutd.com and WWF.com, official website of the World Wrestling Federation. Experts predict that many will struggle to survive. The winners, they say, will be those that combine a mass global and local appeal with a strong following. Leading clubs will be able to build communities, exploit archives of information and, soon, show video clips of goals. From 2001, Premiership clubs will be able to show their own games on their websites after midnight on Monday. However, Screen Digest's Rachel Church believes that niche sites, based around sports and teams whose loyal users are deprived of extensive television coverage, will also have their day. Technology as much as any other factor is likely to define the future of many websites and the way in which sport is consumed. But despite the growing importance of new delivery platforms and the success of sites like Wimbledon, traditional coverage of the tournament from the likes of the BBC is unlikely to be dropped. \"There's no single killer application,\" said Sportal chief executive Rob Hersov. \"The different distribution media like Wap, broadband and wireless will all be ways to distribute digital assets and consumers will be viewing the event or the information or the interactivity in different ways.\" So the Saturday Wap user may use the office's ADSL line during the week before going home in the evening to watch sport on digital television, using a PC to access the web for their statistical needs at the same time. And it would be a surprise if stars like Anna Kournikova didn't have a presence on every single platform.

Eventually it hopes to broadcast games live, charging fans on a pay-per-view basis. The team's number of television followers is unmatched by any other club. The potential for a web-based product is clear. The first steps towards the club using new technology to connect direct to its fans were taken in February with the unveiling of a \u00a330m four-year partnership agreement with Vodafone, the mobile telecoms group. Thanks to the Vodafone deal United fans will eventually be able to use mobile devices to watch goal highlights, listen to live match commentaries, receive real-time score updates in text message formats and order the latest replica kit. The service will be global and available in dozens of different languages. \"Fans from Stretford to Shanghai will be able to keep up with all the action from Old Trafford 24 hours a day,\" deputy chief executive Peter Kenyon said. \"All they will have to do is push a button on their phone.\" United is now looking for investment partners with internet expertise to help it maximise the potential of Manutd.com. It may be the world's biggest and best-known club, but in internet terms United is only a start-up. The worst news for fans sick of United's dominance of the game is that this is one start-up almost guaranteed to succeed - and make the club a lot more money.",

Shopping on the internet should be easy and stress-free, yet, says a new study, people are still reluctant to embrace e-commerce. </p> <p>Dr Peter Lunt, senior lecturer in the psychology department, University College London, has spent the past two years analysing people's responses to internet shopping and found that most shoppers buy books, CDs, travel tickets and software over the internet. He surveyed almost 900 people, talking to and surfing the net with groups and individuals in their own home. </p> <p>Of those surveyed, only 14%had tried shopping online and a mere 5% were regular (monthly) users. Three-quarters had bought only four kinds of products. In general, the people least keen on internet shopping tended to be thrifty or brand loyal shoppers. </p> <p>According to Lunt, the main reasons cited for being cautious about e-shopping were the costs of computer equipment, going online and delivery of goods. People were also uncertain about how to return products. </p> <p>There is also a fundamental mismatch between the way people shop normally and online services: impulse buying or the ability to examine products are missing; for many, the experience of shopping, for clothes, for instance, is as important as the products themselves. </p> <p>\"People acknowledge the convenience of e-commerce in principle, especially for mundane grocery shopping,\" says Lunt. \"But it became clear that the supermarket shop is a complex activity that includes idiosyncratic and luxury items bought on impulse or with a specific occasion, person or meal in mind. The difficulties of reproducing this experience using a list-based computer program were evident to our participants.\" </p> <p>Most shoppers found it hard to navigate e-commerce sites as goods are laid out unintuitively and many were disappointed at how dull the web sites were, particularly if they were used to computer or video games. </p> <p>Lunt believes there are three groups of people who do not e-shop. The first has little knowledge of the internet but is potentially interested. \"They're a prime target for limited e-services delivered by digital TV,\" he adds. The other group tends to be older and less educated and, Lunt believes, may be left behind. Members of the third group are relatively wealthy and computer literate but have other reasons for not shopping on the web. \"The issues for these people are the broader social issues of privacy and the possible effects on the way we live and shop. They could be the new Luddites - except that they are happy to use the internet for other reasons.\" </p> <p>Lunt adds that this group is unlikely to start e-shopping unless they are sure that their privacy will be safeguarded. </p> <p>Most of the people he talked to considered online shopping analogous to \"real\" shopping. \"They are thinking more of the integration of e-commerce services into their current consumption practices rather than taking the opportunity to rethink the way they shop and organise the allocation of responsibilities within the household,\" says Lunt. </p> <p>The location of the computer was another factor, as many people have theirs either in the sitting room as part of an entertainment set-up, or else in the study for work. </p> <p>Lunt sees this as a drawback because as he puts it, \"PCs are not integrated into the 'provisioning' spaces and flows of the household\". </p> <p>Young people and men were most positive about internet shopping. About 58% of e-shoppers are men. Lunt suggests that men shop more than women simply because what they want is gendered - books and CDs rather than cosmetics or clothes - but that in any case men still aren't buying much at all. </p> <p>\"The survey indicates that those who are most positive about e-commerce are focusing on the convenience and the price advantage in particular products and not on the experiential aspects of shopping. These are relatively well to do people who are technologically savvy and don't get much pleasure from shopping,\" he says. </p> <p>Given that these people are a minority, will the situation change enough to encourage the rest of the population to shop online? The European Commission has already been involved in producing directives aimed at protecting the identities of online shoppers, but the trouble will be in regulating the internet. </p> <p>As usual it will be down to the manufacturers themselves to behave reasonably. How ever, because manufacturers will need to make more profits than usual from internet sales, they will need - and want - to collect and analyse the vast amounts of data that will be generated by internet shoppers. </p> <p>\"One likely solution is that firms will develop methods that allow the collection of data linked to consumer profiles (ways of categorising consumers using a variety of indicators) that do not require the identification of individuals,\" says Lunt. \"This has the advantage of protecting the privacy of the individual but allowing the collection of detailed consumer information. The problem with this scenario is that this is still a radical increase in information asymmetry between consumers and retailers (they may not know it is me but they know a lot more about people 'like' me) and that there are a number of potential dangers in this practice. One is that marketing decisions will be made on the basis of the information but (since it is not identified with me) I can not challenge these decisions.\" </p> <p>In the future, more of us may be encouraged to shop online as manufacturers overcome bad web design and learn to safeguard our privacy, but could internet shopping ever seriously replace the stress, and the thrill of the real thing? </p> <p>\"It depends how far you are looking ahead,\" says Lunt, \"I think the interesting question is what the strategic responses of firms to the introduction of e-commerce will be.
