Audiences share this fascination and every week since Roy Plomley devised Desert Island Discs in 1942 several million listeners have tuned in to hear how various celebrities would cope with loneliness and privation, and what eight gramophone records they'd take with them to ease the pain. </p> <p>The latest exercise in the Crusoe genre is Cast Away, which reunites Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, the director and star of Forrest Gump, which was, of course, an updating of another eighteenth-century moral fiction, Voltaire's Candide. </p> <p>Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a workaholic FedEx systems engineer who spends his time flying around the world trying to make his company's parcel delivery service faster than that of its rivals. We first meet him a couple of blocks from Red Square trying to imbue FedEx's Moscow branch with the Stakhanovite spirit. 'We live or die by the clock,' he tells them. </p> <p>Back home in Memphis, Tennessee, he has a fianc\u00e9e, Kelly (Helen Hunt), a research scientist working on her doctorate and, except for a nagging tooth, all seems well with his life. After a pre-Christmas dinner, he promises to be home for New Year and possible nuptials, after he's accompanied a Fed-Ex cargo plane to the Antipodes. Unfortunately, the plane loses radio contact with Tahiti in a storm and in a superbly extended crash sequence that leaves you searching for a seat belt, Chuck is washed up on a small island, the only survivor. </p> <p>Robinson Crusoe actually had it lucky with a wrecked ship from which to salvage for rifles, gunpowder, tools, clothes, timber and so on. He also had a rather grand island to explore, to map and to colonise. Chuck Noland, whose name suggests someone dumped in no man's land, has wound up on a hard place as inhospitably rocky as the one that provided the briefest of sanctuaries to the eponymous hero of William Golding's brilliant and remorseless Pincher Martin. </p> <p>Chuck has nothing except for a few random parcels, containing a woman's party dress, a pair of ice-skates, a volleyball, some VHS cassettes and a document annulling a marriage. When the body of his dead pilot is washed up, he keeps the man's boots but can't bring himself to remove the belt. Crusoe managed to retrieve some of the ship's instruments; Chuck has a fine pocket watch, a family heirloom given him by his fianc\u00e9e, whose photo is in the cover. </p> <p>The first days on the island are well managed - the discovery of coconuts, the shaping of tools, the hope of imminent rescue, the descent into despair. The film's colour is cold, unromantic, quite unlike the gorgeous Technicolor hues of the 1949 (British) and 1980 (American) versions of The Blue Lagoon, both shot in the same area of the South Seas. </p> <p>There are neat details here. The retrieved volleyball is given a face painted in blood, named Wilson after its manufacturer, and becomes a cross between a mute companion and a fetishist Cargo Cult object. An ice skate becomes a primitive dental tool for the most painful exercise in sadomasochistic orthodontics since Marathon Man. </p> <p>Unlike Crusoe, Noland defecates (hiding behind a bush) and urinates boldly into the sea, and it's during a moonlight slash that he spots a distant light which raises rapidly dashed hopes of rescue.

Meanwhile, humanity's great achievement - flight - is drained of its romance: 'What [the pilot] gets is artificial pressure... made-up stresses to give [him] some idea of the physical sensation of flying' and individuality, our major desire, is cruelly despatched as another character is described as 'the sum of everyone she'd ever worked with - the voice of 5,000 cabin crew'. </p> <p>Sutton's writing is minutely observed, credible and slick, but having evoked the existential Void, Sutton fails to provoke any thought on the matter, making this a rather pointless excursion, all told. </p> <p><strong>Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?</strong><br>Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson<br>4th Estate \u00a37.99, pp310<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000369077,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>The Irish Republican Army was a spent force well before 1972, when a group of paratroopers, determined to 'crack heads', shot 27 Catholic marchers, stone-throwers and bystanders on Bloody Sunday, an event which rekindled anti-English sentiment, underscored the need for demilitarisation and yet made it even less feasible. </p> <p>Agitators were rarely armed with more than rubble, but minimum force had come to mean shooting to kill. Supposedly 'aimed shots' killed Barney McGuigan, unarmed and uninvolved, who had raised his hands and a makeshift white flag as he went to help a wounded man. The circumstances of the other dozen deaths are no less tragic and ludicrous. </p> <p> Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? is a unique and, therefore, vital account of Bloody Sunday, incorporating new interviews and evidence since the present Government reopened the inquiry. This is an important, essential and harrowing book. </p> <p> <strong>Lost</strong><br>Hans-Ulrich Treichel<br>Picador \u00a35, pp145<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000349248,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>Should this novella have continued into the mid-teens of the plump, permanently unhealthy and parentally neglected narrator, he might well have found kindred spirits in Grigor Samsa and Harry Haller (Metamorphosis and Steppenwolf). Growing up with the absence of Arnold, the brother his parents lost while fleeing from the Russians at the end of the Second World War, the protagonist is subjected to a battery of (pre-DNA testing) examinations, to determine the probability of Foundling 2307 being his sibling. Every detail is revealed to the reader but his name and yet nothing is revealed to his parents of his inner life and anguish. The story may be mundane, a clever exercise in characterisation only just meriting a longer format, but the dread of 'Waiting for Arnold' (to take what little affection his parents have to give), has the impact of Hesse or Kafka; strangely endearing. </p> <p> <strong> The Danish Girl</strong><br>David Ebershoff<br>Phoenix \u00a36.99, pp310<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000369875,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>In 1925, the artist Greta Waud needed more than just a reliable model; she needed a 'Muse', a catalyst for her 'Art', to surmount the indifference of critics and evade the comparisons to her husband. When she and Einar discovered his feminine alter ego, Lili, as a man and artist, Einar began to slip into her shadow, and some years later became the first hermaphrodite to undergo sexual reassignment surgery.</p> <p>The transition was agonising, but as Greta allowed Lili to explore her femininity and Einar allowed Greta to develop her art, they also discovered a deeper fidelity to the people they'd been waiting to become. Ebershoff writes seductively and compassionately; his first novel is a flawless accomplishment. In looking to the distant past for inspiration, like Patricia Ducker, Ebershoff neglects the feminist thesis that 'the personal is political', but tells a tremendous story all the same. </p> <p> <strong> On the Missionary Trail</strong><br>Tom Hiney<br>Vintage \u00a37.99, pp 367<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000354008,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>In the early nineteenth century, George Bennet and the Reverend Daniel Tyerman were among the first envoys of the London Missionary Society (whose most famous member was David Livingstone, although this pair were no less heroic). Travelling by whaler to Polynesia, New Zealand and Australia and then on to China, India and Africa, they and their colleagues had to contend with cannibals and the justifiable fear and suspicion of Europeans, whose diseases had ravaged some native populations.</p> <p>On the Missionary Trail has already been serialised on Radio 4 and this splendidly illustrated paperback, from the author of an acclaimed biography of Raymond Chandler, should win many more devotees, being an accessible, detailed recreation of genuine adventures in exotic lands, before the West altered the native cultures forever.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Flying Henry Sutton Sceptre \u00a36.99, pp330 Buy it at a discount at BOL Apparently, Henry Sutton wrote this, his fourth novel, to combat his own fear of flying, but if he succeeds in allaying anyone else's fear, it will only be by inducing the far greater fear that 'It's All Just About Sex'. In the course of two Atlantic crossings, we're given the tour of a flight crew's fantasies. Meanwhile, humanity's great achievement - flight - is drained of its romance: 'What [the pilot] gets is artificial pressure... made-up stresses to give [him] some idea of the physical sensation of flying' and individuality, our major desire, is cruelly despatched as another character is described as 'the sum of everyone she'd ever worked with - the voice of 5,000 cabin crew'. Sutton's writing is minutely observed, credible and slick, but having evoked the existential Void, Sutton fails to provoke any thought on the matter, making this a rather pointless excursion, all told. Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson 4th Estate \u00a37.99, pp310 Buy it at a discount at BOL The Irish Republican Army was a spent force well before 1972, when a group of paratroopers, determined to 'crack heads', shot 27 Catholic marchers, stone-throwers and bystanders on Bloody Sunday, an event which rekindled anti-English sentiment, underscored the need for demilitarisation and yet made it even less feasible. Agitators were rarely armed with more than rubble, but minimum force had come to mean shooting to kill. Supposedly 'aimed shots' killed Barney McGuigan, unarmed and uninvolved, who had raised his hands and a makeshift white flag as he went to help a wounded man. The circumstances of the other dozen deaths are no less tragic and ludicrous. Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? is a unique and, therefore, vital account of Bloody Sunday, incorporating new interviews and evidence since the present Government reopened the inquiry. This is an important, essential and harrowing book. Lost Hans-Ulrich Treichel Picador \u00a35, pp145 Buy it at a discount at BOL Should this novella have continued into the mid-teens of the plump, permanently unhealthy and parentally neglected narrator, he might well have found kindred spirits in Grigor Samsa and Harry Haller (Metamorphosis and Steppenwolf). Growing up with the absence of Arnold, the brother his parents lost while fleeing from the Russians at the end of the Second World War, the protagonist is subjected to a battery of (pre-DNA testing) examinations, to determine the probability of Foundling 2307 being his sibling. Every detail is revealed to the reader but his name and yet nothing is revealed to his parents of his inner life and anguish. The story may be mundane, a clever exercise in characterisation only just meriting a longer format, but the dread of 'Waiting for Arnold' (to take what little affection his parents have to give), has the impact of Hesse or Kafka; strangely endearing. The Danish Girl David Ebershoff Phoenix \u00a36.99, pp310 Buy it at a discount at BOL In 1925, the artist Greta Waud needed more than just a reliable model; she needed a 'Muse', a catalyst for her 'Art', to surmount the indifference of critics and evade the comparisons to her husband. When she and Einar discovered his feminine alter ego, Lili, as a man and artist, Einar began to slip into her shadow, and some years later became the first hermaphrodite to undergo sexual reassignment surgery. The transition was agonising, but as Greta allowed Lili to explore her femininity and Einar allowed Greta to develop her art, they also discovered a deeper fidelity to the people they'd been waiting to become. Ebershoff writes seductively and compassionately; his first novel is a flawless accomplishment. In looking to the distant past for inspiration, like Patricia Ducker, Ebershoff neglects the feminist thesis that 'the personal is political', but tells a tremendous story all the same. On the Missionary Trail Tom Hiney Vintage \u00a37.99, pp 367 Buy it at a discount at BOL In the early nineteenth century, George Bennet and the Reverend Daniel Tyerman were among the first envoys of the London Missionary Society (whose most famous member was David Livingstone, although this pair were no less heroic). Travelling by whaler to Polynesia, New Zealand and Australia and then on to China, India and Africa, they and their colleagues had to contend with cannibals and the justifiable fear and suspicion of Europeans, whose diseases had ravaged some native populations. On the Missionary Trail has already been serialised on Radio 4 and this splendidly illustrated paperback, from the author of an acclaimed biography of Raymond Chandler, should win many more devotees, being an accessible, detailed recreation of genuine adventures in exotic lands, before the West altered the native cultures forever.",

This is a world coloured by a priori memory of what might have been better. You feel the ache in every poem. It reveals itself most churlishly in a poem like 'Rock Music'.

Still, there's nothing 'mainstream' in the negative sense about Riley, one of Britain's major, if insufficiently recognised poets. Some years ago I worked with Riley on a selection that roughly equates with this one, now published as <strong> Passing Measures: A Collection of Poems</strong>, and therefore might feel closer to the work than others I review.

Much of Riley's poetry is about movement through places, considering the still points in a journey - the points that will remain or change outside your experience as you pass through. Riley paints sound pictures of place. He best epitomises the New Lyricism that has blurred the boundaries between pure linguistic innovation based on rhetorical language and the lyric of self. He consistently examines the tension between 'nature' and pastoral versions of 'nature'. The stand-out pieces of this volume are the 'Sea Watches'. </p> <p>I have been looking forward to Ann Carson's new book, though it came more quickly than I thought it would. <strong> Men in the Off Hours</strong> is a large collection of poetry, texts, translations, and essayistic poetry prose. In a sense, this book marks the end of one aspect of the modernist experiment. It's simply all been done before. The techniques of blurring the lyrical self and personae, of Bakhtinian shifts in narrative, of Derridean genre ploys, have been much exploited. Carson does bring something fresh and unusual to the processes, and brings life to what Thom Gunn has noted on Pound's Homage to Sextus Propertius, that 'the line is more garrulous, as is suitable to a poetry of wit, gossip, and opinion'. </p> <p>Unfortunately, many of the pieces in the book seem like offcuts from other more focused projects. Liminality can be camouflage for inadequate self-editing. This volume is far too long, and some sequences dull. However, the book gets stronger as it goes on, and the 'Akhmatova' pieces are stunning. </p> <p>Among the Faber series of poets selecting poets, <strong> Ezra Pound, Poems selected by Thom Gunn</strong> is the most striking. In varying degrees, none of the poets reviewed here can escape the shadow of Pound. In his blunt, unequivocal introduction, Gunn gets to the brilliance and repulsiveness of Pound. And of the 'modernist condition' and the play of voices in poetry Gunn notes, referring to the title of Pound's first 'commercially published' volume, Personae: 'It has since become a fashionable critical term - too fashionable, as if a poem is necessarily spoken through another voice than that of the author, but in Pound's case it usually was.' </p> <p>Of these books, the selection process behind the Auden poems is most fascinating - a poem for roughly every year of his writing life. Given the range and volume of Auden's work, Fuller has done remarkably well to give the reader a taste of the master's multi-layered voice.

Given the associations of that number, this might be deliberate, but given that the book hasn't been perfectly proofread (there's an odd slip with the punctuation), it might not be. It doesn't matter overmuch; although the chapters are linked, they are mostly interchangeable and mostly identical in tone and action.</p> <p>They are, ostensibly, the story of Pat McNab, a Norman Bates character who still lives with his mother at the age of 45, until he kills her. More killings duly follow, in Pat's creepy old house two miles from the town of Gullytown, or, as Pat refers to it in one chapter, 'the Town of Liars'. But telling lies from truths is a fruitless task in a book that tries to be as stylistically insane as its protagonist. </p> <p>The narrative voice, responsible for the opening sequence, 'An Introduction', and the more pedantic asides that follow, is oddly imprecise. It sometimes takes a lofty view as if trying, after the event, to make sense of Pat's slaughter of so many townfolk, a number that 'might be around the 55, 55 mark', most of them destined to fertilise his garden. </p> <p>Whether we trust this voice or not is moot, partly because it seems privy to a vast amount of information that only Pat himself might have, and there is no clear indication of what happens to Pat, and partly because it also allows great discrepancies, as to the fate of Pat's dad, for example.

      "bodyText": "Emerald Germs of Ireland Patrick McCabe Picador \u00a314.99, pp380 Buy it at a discount at BOL Patrick McCabe's latest book, Emerald Germs of Ireland, has two chapter 13s. Given the associations of that number, this might be deliberate, but given that the book hasn't been perfectly proofread (there's an odd slip with the punctuation), it might not be. It doesn't matter overmuch; although the chapters are linked, they are mostly interchangeable and mostly identical in tone and action. They are, ostensibly, the story of Pat McNab, a Norman Bates character who still lives with his mother at the age of 45, until he kills her. More killings duly follow, in Pat's creepy old house two miles from the town of Gullytown, or, as Pat refers to it in one chapter, 'the Town of Liars'. But telling lies from truths is a fruitless task in a book that tries to be as stylistically insane as its protagonist. The narrative voice, responsible for the opening sequence, 'An Introduction', and the more pedantic asides that follow, is oddly imprecise. It sometimes takes a lofty view as if trying, after the event, to make sense of Pat's slaughter of so many townfolk, a number that 'might be around the 55, 55 mark', most of them destined to fertilise his garden. Whether we trust this voice or not is moot, partly because it seems privy to a vast amount of information that only Pat himself might have, and there is no clear indication of what happens to Pat, and partly because it also allows great discrepancies, as to the fate of Pat's dad, for example. It is also anarchically uneven in tone; at the beginning, it attributes its idioms to various people ('as Timmy Sullivan described him'; 'as Honky McCool might put it'; 'as the Americans say'), but as it proceeds, various registers blend and clash, from the lofty to the demotic, to no obvious purpose bar a straining for effect. Sometimes, the voice insists that something cannot be described accurately; at others, it insists, wrongly, that only one particular word or term will do. This style, so unsettled, so alternately anxious or careless about its own linguistic authority, is extraordinarily circumlocutory and inefficient, and when it says: 'Let us not mince words here', the joke is obvious. It simply becomes irritating after a short while. Pat McNab is clearly obsessed with his dead mother; clearly a bit of a drunk; clearly has trouble with reality, compounded by brushes with hallucinogens and beatings to the head. (Some resulting hallucinations take up whole chapters of surreal trips through movie clich\u00e9s - sci-fi, gangster, et cetera). 'There are many theories with regard to \"perception\" and the relationship one might contrive with the \"ineluctable modality of the visible\",' says the narrator, with another hefty and tedious wink to the weary reader. So, granted, we are in a shifting, oneiric universe where Pat McNab may or may not be a cross-dressing, mum-obsessed psychopath straight out of Hitchcock or de Palma, or we may be in the head of a lunatic fantasist, off his head on drink and drugs, weaving together storylines from old songs and movies. The question, then, is whether this is sufficiently funny or focused, and the answer, sadly, is that it is not. McNab's character develops a little, in that through his story we see any number of influences that might have made him go terminally loopy: a bullying father, a brutal schoolmaster and treacherous friends; sexual inadequacy and taunting; a dominant mother. We also end up in a queer complicity with poor old Pat, whose victims seem deserving of their deaths (though, given that few of them start with much life beyond central-casting stereotyping, this isn't so strange).

      "body": "<p>Aston Villa sources close to John Gregory and his coaching team of Steve Harrison and Ross MacLaren are indicating they will up sticks and quit for Newcastle United. </p> <p>Their whispering campaign has been going on for several weeks, throughout Gregory's uncomfortable stand-off with 'time-warp' chairman Doug Ellis after which Ellis demanded - and received - a grovelling apology. </p> <p>Newcastle, Villa's opponents in this week's FA Cup replay, have not encouraged the gossip, with chairman Freddy Shepherd telling one reporter: 'Gregory will never manage this club while I am chairman.' But talk of the move has increased in the past week, especially in the Villa dressing room. </p> <p>So what gives? Gregory might benefit from speculation if it was perceived that he might quit, with fans already calling for the chairman's head.

      "bodyText": "Aston Villa sources close to John Gregory and his coaching team of Steve Harrison and Ross MacLaren are indicating they will up sticks and quit for Newcastle United. Their whispering campaign has been going on for several weeks, throughout Gregory's uncomfortable stand-off with 'time-warp' chairman Doug Ellis after which Ellis demanded - and received - a grovelling apology. Newcastle, Villa's opponents in this week's FA Cup replay, have not encouraged the gossip, with chairman Freddy Shepherd telling one reporter: 'Gregory will never manage this club while I am chairman.' But talk of the move has increased in the past week, especially in the Villa dressing room. So what gives? Gregory might benefit from speculation if it was perceived that he might quit, with fans already calling for the chairman's head. And, while Shepherd has privately rubbished the speculation, his relationship with manager Bobby Robson has been strained by the club's refusal to allow Robson to take temporary charge of England and the board's disquiet over his recent transfer buys. And there's the rub. Gregory's unease at Villa was caused by the club's lack of spending. Yet Robson has been forced to hunt for cut-price bargains at home and abroad. Add to that Ellis's decision on Friday to reactivate the \u00a39.5m Juan-Pablo Angel purchase and the picture is, at best, clouded by intrigue.

      "body": "<p>Life can be cruel, but Manchester United can be so much worse. After Bradford had drawn much of the Champions' sting in a disciplined opening hour, a moment of harsh misfortune gave the favourites a chance they were never going to pass up. What is worse, the culprit was Gary Walsh, the home keeper, who used to play at Old Trafford. He at least ensured himself a generous welcome if ever he should return. </p> <p>With the match still goalless as it entered its closing stages, Valley Parade was buzzing with excitement. Against the odds and with complete disregard for the form book, United were struggling to create chances and Bradford were hinting at an upset. Walsh, though, had other ideas. As a harmless back-pass rolled its way towards him, Walsh lifted his left foot to clear. In a split-second, 72 minutes of tireless work and a thousand dreams were rendered meaningless as he missed his kick and Teddy Sheringham rolled the ball into an unguarded net. </p> <p>'I didn't think we were going to win,' said Alex Ferguson, 'but you'd never wish that on a goalkeeper, particularly Gary Walsh, who is such a good keeper. But after that, the game opened up and we finished well. We've worked hard for our points today. We had to.' </p> <p>Walsh had barely raised his head from his hands when Ryan Giggs burst into the area to smash in a second. A first league goal from Luke Chadwick, who finished with composure from Roy Keane's astute through-ball, gave the scoreline an extremely flattering appearance from United's perspective. Ferguson needed to summon his deepest powers of overstatement to surmise: 'I think it was a decent performance by us. It wasn't a great performance but it's a good, workmanlike way of playing.' </p> <p>It certainly was not their greatest performance, but there were plenty of positives to be taken from it. Jaap Stam played for an hour and has obviously lost nothing but a little fitness after three months out with an Achilles injury. Sheringham and Andy Cole continued their comebacks, but it was the appearance of Luke Chadwick, a second-half substitute, which offered most encouragement. </p> <p>Chadwick will never sell many duvet covers, but he is comfortable on the ball and - whisper it - caused Bradford more problems on the right than did David Beckham. </p> <p>Bradford, too, should gain some encouragement. 'We made them work hard to beat us,' said Jim Jefferies. 'We feel we're starting to perform. We're looking solid, passing well, working hard for each other. But you can't legislate for what happened today. It was a sickener the way it happened. Until then Bradford were comfortable, and had it not been for that blunder we would maybe have taken something from the game.' </p> <p>United dominated much of the possession, but struggled to create chances. Giggs missed their best of the first half, running from midfield, exchanging passes with Sheringham on his way unhindered through the home defence, but the finish was weak. </p> <p>In the second period, their threat was limited to Beckham's free-kicks, from which Michael Silvestre and Giggs came close to heading an opening goal. In the end, though, they needed a moment of fortune to gift them an advantage they would never surrender. </p> <p>For all their resilience, Bradford's opportunities were limited to one in each half. It is not for nothing that they are the Premiership's lowest scorers, but they should at least be applauded for their willingness to try to attack when many sides would have erred towards footballing filibuster. </p> <p>It says a lot that they came no closer in the first half than a 40-yard shot from Dean Windass, acrobatically and somewhat unnecessarily turned over by Fabien Barthez. Then after an hour Robbie Blake raced through the visiting defence only to roll the ball apologetically into the side netting when only Barthez blocked his route to goal. </p> <p>And so ends a memorable week for Bradford. Three of their most high-profile signings have been transfer-listed; one, Dan Petrescu, already gone. On Monday, barely 7,000 saw them crash out of the FA Cup. In such times of turmoil, the last team you want to see strolling into the visitors' dressing room are Manchester United. While their performance was better than could have been expected, it will be forgotten long before the result. For in four Premiership games, United's aggregate lead over Bradford is now 17-0. The tide may be turning, but Bradford still have a long way to go.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Middlesbrough's transformation since the arrival of Terry Venables was sustained with considerable ease against an out-of-sorts Derby who were allowed a solitary shot on target. </p> <p>Middlesbrough are now unbeaten in seven games under Venables, who unsurprisingly considered this their best performance since he took control. 'We kept our clean sheet, played with imagination and finished well,' he said. His verdict and the margin of victory suggest a comfortable success - and so it was in the end - but Boro still needed a 41st-minute penalty to make the crucial breakthrough. </p> <p>Venables was planning half-time adjustments when Alen Boksic despatched the spot-kick after a foul by Darryl Powell on the Croatian that was spotted by few people other than referee Rob Styles. 'It was a harsh decision,' said County's assistant manager, Colin Todd. 'We feel hard done by. They hadn't looked like scoring and decisions sometimes change the course of a game.' </p> <p>Todd was even-handed enough to accept his side didn't appear capable of scoring one as Boksic's guile and the assured passing of Australian Paul Okon enabled Middlesbrough to dictate. Okon's chief midfield ally was Paul Ince, energetic enough to suggest he may be right to insist he can still play a part in England's future. </p> <p>Ince's commitment was admirable and one of his forward breaks in first-half stoppage-time ended in penalty appeals as he went down under a challenge from Horacio Carbonari. This time, Mr Styles shook his head. </p> <p>Derby finally roused in the 51st minute when Malcolm Christie's shot forced a save from Schwarzer. Little good it did Christie; he was soon substituted, three minutes before Derby conceded another goal. It was a stylish one. </p> <p>Ince's free-kick was volleyed into the area by Karembeu, presenting Ugo Ehiogu with an easy chance. Ehiogu's header was the prelude to a period of total domination by Boro, who almost added to their lead when Boksic headed Dean Gordon's corner against the bar. He eventually claimed his second with a sublime piece of finishing after collecting a through- ball from Robbie Mustoe while adding to the education of inexperienced defender Chris Riggott in the 81st minute. </p> <p>Boksic had been substituted by the time Brian Deane was fouled inside the area in the dying seconds, leaving Hamilton Ricard to take the penalty to give Middlesbrough their best win since October 1998. </p> <p>They are now out of the bottom three after conceding only two goals in seven games - a penalty and an own goal. 'It's very promising, but there's a long way to go,' said Venables. 'Let's hope we can keep it up.' </p> <p>Todd, dismayed by his players' late capitulation, said: 'We lost our shape and discipline. Now we've got to bounce back.' They must do it with the knowledge that Middlesbrough's impressive emergence will make life more difficult for Derby as the struggle for survival intensifies. Todd undoubtedly believes the club he once managed can escape. </p> <p>'They shouldn't be in this position,' he said, 'when you look at the amount of money they have spent and the experience of their players.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Middlesbrough's transformation since the arrival of Terry Venables was sustained with considerable ease against an out-of-sorts Derby who were allowed a solitary shot on target. Middlesbrough are now unbeaten in seven games under Venables, who unsurprisingly considered this their best performance since he took control. 'We kept our clean sheet, played with imagination and finished well,' he said. His verdict and the margin of victory suggest a comfortable success - and so it was in the end - but Boro still needed a 41st-minute penalty to make the crucial breakthrough. Venables was planning half-time adjustments when Alen Boksic despatched the spot-kick after a foul by Darryl Powell on the Croatian that was spotted by few people other than referee Rob Styles. 'It was a harsh decision,' said County's assistant manager, Colin Todd. 'We feel hard done by. They hadn't looked like scoring and decisions sometimes change the course of a game.' Todd was even-handed enough to accept his side didn't appear capable of scoring one as Boksic's guile and the assured passing of Australian Paul Okon enabled Middlesbrough to dictate. Okon's chief midfield ally was Paul Ince, energetic enough to suggest he may be right to insist he can still play a part in England's future. Ince's commitment was admirable and one of his forward breaks in first-half stoppage-time ended in penalty appeals as he went down under a challenge from Horacio Carbonari. This time, Mr Styles shook his head. Derby finally roused in the 51st minute when Malcolm Christie's shot forced a save from Schwarzer. Little good it did Christie; he was soon substituted, three minutes before Derby conceded another goal. It was a stylish one. Ince's free-kick was volleyed into the area by Karembeu, presenting Ugo Ehiogu with an easy chance. Ehiogu's header was the prelude to a period of total domination by Boro, who almost added to their lead when Boksic headed Dean Gordon's corner against the bar. He eventually claimed his second with a sublime piece of finishing after collecting a through- ball from Robbie Mustoe while adding to the education of inexperienced defender Chris Riggott in the 81st minute. Boksic had been substituted by the time Brian Deane was fouled inside the area in the dying seconds, leaving Hamilton Ricard to take the penalty to give Middlesbrough their best win since October 1998. They are now out of the bottom three after conceding only two goals in seven games - a penalty and an own goal. 'It's very promising, but there's a long way to go,' said Venables. 'Let's hope we can keep it up.' Todd, dismayed by his players' late capitulation, said: 'We lost our shape and discipline. Now we've got to bounce back.' They must do it with the knowledge that Middlesbrough's impressive emergence will make life more difficult for Derby as the struggle for survival intensifies. Todd undoubtedly believes the club he once managed can escape. 'They shouldn't be in this position,' he said, 'when you look at the amount of money they have spent and the experience of their players.'",

      "body": "<p>With Alan Shearer out of action for at least another couple of months Newcastle United's scoring opportunities rely heavily on the pace and invention of Kieron Dyer. And he proved himself up to the task. It was his probing and prompting that led to United's first two goals and he completed a splendid afternoon with an effort that owed nothing to anyone but his own sublime skill in dissecting the City defence. It may well prove to be worthy of consideration when goals of the season are judged. </p> <p>What a pity then that Dyer will be suspended for United's next two games; the FA Cup replay at Villa Park and the visit to Leeds at Elland Road. </p> <p>Newcastle will miss him. His ability to link with Nolberto Solano and outsprint defenders was a crucial factor in this comfortable victory. It was after one such early raid that United got a corner in the fourth minute which Solano planted on to Gary Speed's head. The Welsh international glided it home with an exquisite touch. </p> <p>That was the most memorable act of a mundane first half, but the second provided much more entertainment. </p> <p>First Dyer set up Solano for a glorious chance that went begging. But it was nothing compared with the catalogue of misses that followed from Coventry. Thompson, Bellamy (three times) and Aloisi could all have found the net, and their profligacy drove manager Gordon Strachan into a touchline frenzy. How he must have regretted the failure to complete the transfer of John Hartson. </p> <p>Dyer then moved up a gear and settled the issue in the space of eight minutes. Combining yet again with Solano, he rolled the ball across the face of goal for Shola Ameobi to stick out a leg and poke over the line. That was in the 58th minute, and in the 66th Dyer settled all doubts with his wonderful individual effort. </p> <p>If Coventry couldn't find the net by any known convention, they did gain slight consolation when Stephen Glass put into his own goal. </p> <p>Newcastle manager Bobby Robson acknowledged the contributions of Dyer and Solano. 'It's going to be a headache playing without them,' he said, adding that Solano had shin splint injuries which are causing considerable concern. </p> <p>Coventry are not the best travellers in the league and certainly not here, and only Thompson gave them some indication of the old Strachan-McAllister spirit they need to rediscover. </p> <p>Strachan generously acknowledged Dyer's contribution: 'An exceptional talent. If he'd been on my side we would have won today.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "With Alan Shearer out of action for at least another couple of months Newcastle United's scoring opportunities rely heavily on the pace and invention of Kieron Dyer. And he proved himself up to the task. It was his probing and prompting that led to United's first two goals and he completed a splendid afternoon with an effort that owed nothing to anyone but his own sublime skill in dissecting the City defence. It may well prove to be worthy of consideration when goals of the season are judged. What a pity then that Dyer will be suspended for United's next two games; the FA Cup replay at Villa Park and the visit to Leeds at Elland Road. Newcastle will miss him. His ability to link with Nolberto Solano and outsprint defenders was a crucial factor in this comfortable victory. It was after one such early raid that United got a corner in the fourth minute which Solano planted on to Gary Speed's head. The Welsh international glided it home with an exquisite touch. That was the most memorable act of a mundane first half, but the second provided much more entertainment. First Dyer set up Solano for a glorious chance that went begging. But it was nothing compared with the catalogue of misses that followed from Coventry. Thompson, Bellamy (three times) and Aloisi could all have found the net, and their profligacy drove manager Gordon Strachan into a touchline frenzy. How he must have regretted the failure to complete the transfer of John Hartson. Dyer then moved up a gear and settled the issue in the space of eight minutes. Combining yet again with Solano, he rolled the ball across the face of goal for Shola Ameobi to stick out a leg and poke over the line. That was in the 58th minute, and in the 66th Dyer settled all doubts with his wonderful individual effort. If Coventry couldn't find the net by any known convention, they did gain slight consolation when Stephen Glass put into his own goal. Newcastle manager Bobby Robson acknowledged the contributions of Dyer and Solano. 'It's going to be a headache playing without them,' he said, adding that Solano had shin splint injuries which are causing considerable concern. Coventry are not the best travellers in the league and certainly not here, and only Thompson gave them some indication of the old Strachan-McAllister spirit they need to rediscover. Strachan generously acknowledged Dyer's contribution: 'An exceptional talent. If he'd been on my side we would have won today.'",

Before their match at Tranmere earlier this season, the Bolton team arrived just 30 minutes before the kick-off, already in their kit, and left immediately after the final whistle, still wearing their kit and without even having a shower.

Once he opens the door to Warnock, the manager takes it off the hinges. The hapless hack then attempts to change the subject, manfully tries to be understanding. But he was as Ginger Rogers to Neil's Fred Astaire, no more than an invisible dancing partner. </p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> At the end, you've gone out of the FA Cup but what was your plan going in, because you survived for so long? </p> <p><strong> Warnock:</strong> We tried to cope with the 11 players. It was difficult with whatever happened with the ref. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement, really. There's no way Southampton would have beaten us without the referee today. It's simple as that and obviously I'm disappointed. But he's a Premier League referee and [you] don't bite the hand that feeds you. </p> <p><strong> Q: </strong> All in a moment you had a penalty conceded and you had a player sent off. What was the verdict on the bench? </p> <p><strong> Warnock: </strong> Well, we wondered why their lad didn't get sent off for deliberate hand-ball when [Paul] Devlin was through on goal. Is it because we're Nationwide League? You know ... It's no wonder they want him [David Elleray] next home match for the third home match on the trot. He's becomin' a regular. They should be safe if they keep gettin' him at home. It's a ridiculous situation. It's got to be the same. The lad deliberately hand-balled, Devlin's through on goal. </p> <p>[Neil is now building up a healthy head of steam. He spots that his inquisitor has left him a gap. Through he goes.] </p> <p><strong> Warnock: </strong> It's sad. Two tackles in second half, one on George Santos - he never even gave a free-kick. He's cut him off near the waist. It's just two different rules. [Talks about a Southampton player who was substituted]. Can't remember his name. He shook [Elleray's] hand when he was substituted. He'd already been booked and later pushed Devlin out of the way. And [Elleray] says to him, 'I should book ... I should send you off for doing that again.' Come on. It stinks. </p> <p><strong> Q: </strong> Was it a penalty? </p> <p><strong> Warnock: </strong> From where Mr Elleray was positioned, I would think it might have been, because he were that far away he would have needed binoculars. And he couldn't wait to give it. He blew up before he went down! In a game like that, a challenge like that, you don't give those. But he's waiting to give it, he's wanting to give it. You know? You can see that from the sidelines. </p> <p><strong> Q: </strong> What has Bobby Ford said about what happened immediately afterwards? </p> <p><strong> Warnock:</strong> He said the referee said he'd said words that he did not say. But he shouldn't have said it, because David Elleray loves sending players off for foul and abusive language. [And here comes the insight]. He's a schoolteacher. And he loves it, because he can write it down on Monday morning when he's back at his desk. You know? 'For foul and abusive language, I've sent Bobby Ford off. And I loved it.' And that's what it's all about. To hell with the tackles, the waist-high tackles that went unpunished. He's got him sent off for dissent and I think Mr Elleray loved every minute of it. </p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> Apart from the referee - and clearly you're really wound up about that - I can understand that, but apart from the refereeing decisions that went against you, how did you feel about the performance of the two teams? [If he thought this change of subject was going to budge Neil from his appointed task, he was sadly disappointed.] </p> <p><strong> Warnock:</strong> You tell me how they were going to score. They weren't going to score a goal today. They didn't have a clue in the second half - how to break us down. They haven't beaten us today, that's why I'm talking about the referee... the referee has beaten us today. I think it's a disgrace.' </p> <p>Thank you and good night. </p> <p>But hang on a minute. We might have an epidemic on our hands. </p> <p>'The better side is not necessarily winning a match these days, because it is being decided by the referee... that is not right. The ref is a major influence and that should not be the case. They have brought in new referees this season to give them experience and it has not worked. They are not up to scratch. The Premiership should not be used as a testing ground. There's a mad rush to find new blood and we have to put up with rubbish in the interim. </p> <p>'We're talking livelihoods of players and coaches at stake here.

      "body": "<p>Shockheaded Peter is the two-word answer to people who think that theatre has had its day. Described by its producer as 'a nineteenth-century pop-up video', it projects a dizzy mix of talents: the grisly tales of a nineteenth-century physician; a fringe theatre company whose directors are also designers; a band whose music has been filed in record shops under every section from jazz to folk to rock. </p> <p>First staged three years ago at West Yorkshire Playhouse, and subsequently at the Lyric Hammersmith, the show has since sold out in Toronto, Wellington, Zurich, Minneapolis... Next month it comes to the West End. The most original piece of theatre of the past 10 years has become a mainstream success. </p> <p>Much of its power is due to the dark imagination of Heinrich Hoffmann, a Frankfurt doctor who had worked in his city's morgue and with the mentally ill. Unable to find a picture-book for his son, Hoffmann wrote and illustrated a clutch of cautionary tales, in which childish misdemeanours - playing with matches, fidgeting at mealtimes - were horribly punished: a little boy who sucks his thumbs has them cut off by the scissor man. At the centre was Struwwelpeter - Shockheaded or Slovenly Peter - a stocky chap with hair like a bush and terrifyingly long fingernails that curl like briars. </p> <p> Pretty Stories and Funny Pictures for Little Children was published in Britain in 1848, two years after Edward Lear's Book of Nonsense and 17 years before Alice in Wonderland. In all three books a new vein of writing for children is detectable, in which the ridiculous shades into nightmare, but Hoffmann is by far the most gory. </p> <p>Freud saw the thumb-sucking tale as an account of masturbation and - 'Snip, Snip' - castration. Marxist historians have read the stories as expressions of mid-nineteenth-century bourgeois culture. In both world wars, the figure of Shockheaded Peter was used in anti-German propaganda: Hitler was adorned in picture-books with nail and hair extensions. </p> <p>But it took Michael Morris, of Cultural Industry, to see in Hoffmann's work a suitable case for theatrical treatment. Morris, who as a child had been drawn to and scared by the figure of Struwwelpeter, approached Martyn Jacques, accordionist, possessor of an eerie falsetto voice, creator with his group the Tiger Lillies of Low Life Lullabies . Jacques adapted Hoffmann's words and set them to music, introducing one big amendment: in his version all the erring children die; the word 'dead' - often delivered by Jacques as if he were pronouncing something of great sweetness - rings through the show. Morris next turned to Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott, of the brilliant Improbable Theatre, who wove the songs into a story. </p> <p>The tale of monstrous Shockheaded Peter - who gets buried under the floorboards by his prissy parents, and proceeds to sprout through them - provided one framing device. The idea of a ramshackle touring theatre com pany, presided over by a fruity actor manager (villainously leering Julian Bleach), struggling to put on a show which was constantly getting out of control, was another. The design became that of a toy theatre, with cardboard props and dimensions so cramped the actors seemed to be struggling to stay inside the set. </p> <p>I first saw Shockheaded Peter in 1998. It was like learning a new theatrical language, and the memories are still vivid. </p> <p>The stories are enacted both by enormous humanoid puppets and actors who deploy the puppet-like style of silent movies. There was Harriet who incinerates herself, disappearing into the froth of her flame-coloured petticoats while her cats gloat: 'We told her so', and Fidgety Phil, stabbed to death by cutlery to the accompaniment of a frantic percussion on pots and pans. There was the fleeting moment when a giant fly sweeps over the stage, and the slow minutes when Peter's fingernails start to push up through the floor, and his enormous goggling head lolls above the proscenium arch. </p> <p>Animated and given voice on the stage, these stories have a far-reaching thrill and chill, talking differently to each audience of buried secrets that will burst out. In Tel Aviv the show proved an intense experience for older watchers familiar with the stories from childhood. </p> <p>In Australia the show's challenging moment - when the audience is asked: 'What's under your floorboards?' - caused a shiver at the Adelaide Festival, where a debate had raged about opening the Festival Club to Aboriginal bands. </p> <p>Now Shockheaded Peter is sprouting different lives in Hoffmann's own country. D\u00fcsseldorf has seen an entirely new production: a large-scale sci-fi version featuring robots and loads of machinery. And last week in Hamburg I saw a staging mounted by Crouch and McDermott with a German cast. On the wide stage of the beautiful Schauspielhaus, the show was more more imposing, more studied, less explosively funny than the English version. </p> <p>But the inheritance of Weill-style cabaret was more apparent, largely because of the performance of Wiebke Puls, who sang triumphantly in the Jacques role. So long-limbed that she seemed to concertina when she sat down, she presented herself differently for each number: often in a circus-style corselette; once like a mermaid; once, sitting high above the stage, as a cat, with a long tail draping Rapunzel-style to the floor. </p> <p>The German audience didn't laugh much, but they applauded like crazy. The man in the ticket office was happy. He'd been given the book for Christmas when he was six, partly as a threat: it was meant to shock him out of being a picky eater. </p> <p> Shockheaded Peter will be at the Piccadilly Theatre, London W1 from 14 February to 28 April.

      "byline": "Amy Lawrence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Queens Park Rangers are a broke and broken football club. Crippled by debts in the region of \u00a37 million a year, struggling with an injury list as long as Peter Crouch's extraordinarily spindly legs, depressed by the fear of relegation to a division they have looked down upon for more than three decades, it's not surprising that the chirpiest chap at their training ground last week is on his way out of there - fast. Rob Steiner, forced to retire from the game prematurely, dropped into leafy Acton to see a few old friends before disappearing on long and luxurious holiday. Lucky him. </p> <p>Maintaining passion for an increasingly bleak cause at Loftus Road is a tough task. Gerry Francis, who is starkly realistic about the club's plight, shoulders the responsibility to keep the fire burning because Rangers are in his soul. He grew up there, captained them to their highest ever position - runners up in the top flight - then managed them to their next best finish. Now, in his second spell in charge, the club he calls 'my Rangers' need his dedication more than ever. </p> <p>Since their 12-year stint in the top flight came to an end in 1996, QPR's potential has shrivelled at an alarming rate. Money has been at the root of their problems. They frittered away a fortune trying to get back into the Premiership on a series of expensive, extortionately paid signings. </p> <p>The millions that were wasted on the likes of Mike Sheron, Ned Zelic, Vinnie Jones and Mark Hateley - names to make the faithful wince - might as well have been flushed down the gents. Without much in the way of gate receipts to compensate, it leaves them with no more funds, dwindling commercial value, and precious little in the way of floggable assets. These days they are forced to ask players to take salary cuts when their contracts are up and they no longer pay signing on fees. </p> <p>Francis contemplates the amount of wealthier (though not necessarily bigger) clubs in the division and accepts, sadly, the fact that Rangers are in no position to aim for anything other than survival. </p> <p>'West Brom, for example, paid \u00a32 million for Jason Roberts, Birmingham bought Geoff Horsfield for \u00a32.5 million, Watford spent \u00a34 million on two players from Tottenham, Preston the other day paid \u00a31.3 million for David Healy from Manchester United. We spent \u00a3350,000 on all the players this season. </p> <p>'I was fortunate to get Clark Carlisle for \u00a3250,000, who has since become an England under-21 international - if we can hang onto him he'll be a big asset for the club - and also Peter Crouch, who was only 19 when I took him for \u00a360,000 from Tottenham. Peter has had to be thrown in and he's responded with nine goals - a tremendous achievement for a young kid playing at a very high level. </p> <p>'Even if we had millions to spend on top-quality players we couldn't afford the wages. But I knew the situation when I took over - I wouldn't have come back for any other club really - and the only way to get out of the situation is to try and work at it to pull through. </p> <p>'Unless some fairy Godmother or an Al-Fayed comes in with x millions of pounds it's going to be a slow process. You can't give up. You have to roll your sleeves up and make it happen. The most important thing is to make sure we're still a First Division team next year. QPR mean a great deal to me and to see them in this position hurts me. I'm the last person that would ever want to see them relegated.' </p> <p>The grapple for points has been hampered by an absurd number of draws and a volume of injuries so atrocious it's a miracle Francis puts a team out at all. </p> <p>'Unfortunately, this season right from the word go people such as Rob Steiner - a player who was influential and has been forced to quit the game - and my captain Danny Maddix have not been able to play a game. Paul Murray broke his leg twice and hasn't played at all. Early in the year we lost Ian Barraclough with a broken leg, Karl Reddy and Gavin Peacock.

      "bodyText": "Queens Park Rangers are a broke and broken football club. Crippled by debts in the region of \u00a37 million a year, struggling with an injury list as long as Peter Crouch's extraordinarily spindly legs, depressed by the fear of relegation to a division they have looked down upon for more than three decades, it's not surprising that the chirpiest chap at their training ground last week is on his way out of there - fast. Rob Steiner, forced to retire from the game prematurely, dropped into leafy Acton to see a few old friends before disappearing on long and luxurious holiday. Lucky him. Maintaining passion for an increasingly bleak cause at Loftus Road is a tough task. Gerry Francis, who is starkly realistic about the club's plight, shoulders the responsibility to keep the fire burning because Rangers are in his soul. He grew up there, captained them to their highest ever position - runners up in the top flight - then managed them to their next best finish. Now, in his second spell in charge, the club he calls 'my Rangers' need his dedication more than ever. Since their 12-year stint in the top flight came to an end in 1996, QPR's potential has shrivelled at an alarming rate. Money has been at the root of their problems. They frittered away a fortune trying to get back into the Premiership on a series of expensive, extortionately paid signings. The millions that were wasted on the likes of Mike Sheron, Ned Zelic, Vinnie Jones and Mark Hateley - names to make the faithful wince - might as well have been flushed down the gents. Without much in the way of gate receipts to compensate, it leaves them with no more funds, dwindling commercial value, and precious little in the way of floggable assets. These days they are forced to ask players to take salary cuts when their contracts are up and they no longer pay signing on fees. Francis contemplates the amount of wealthier (though not necessarily bigger) clubs in the division and accepts, sadly, the fact that Rangers are in no position to aim for anything other than survival. 'West Brom, for example, paid \u00a32 million for Jason Roberts, Birmingham bought Geoff Horsfield for \u00a32.5 million, Watford spent \u00a34 million on two players from Tottenham, Preston the other day paid \u00a31.3 million for David Healy from Manchester United. We spent \u00a3350,000 on all the players this season. 'I was fortunate to get Clark Carlisle for \u00a3250,000, who has since become an England under-21 international - if we can hang onto him he'll be a big asset for the club - and also Peter Crouch, who was only 19 when I took him for \u00a360,000 from Tottenham. Peter has had to be thrown in and he's responded with nine goals - a tremendous achievement for a young kid playing at a very high level. 'Even if we had millions to spend on top-quality players we couldn't afford the wages. But I knew the situation when I took over - I wouldn't have come back for any other club really - and the only way to get out of the situation is to try and work at it to pull through. 'Unless some fairy Godmother or an Al-Fayed comes in with x millions of pounds it's going to be a slow process. You can't give up. You have to roll your sleeves up and make it happen. The most important thing is to make sure we're still a First Division team next year. QPR mean a great deal to me and to see them in this position hurts me. I'm the last person that would ever want to see them relegated.' The grapple for points has been hampered by an absurd number of draws and a volume of injuries so atrocious it's a miracle Francis puts a team out at all. 'Unfortunately, this season right from the word go people such as Rob Steiner - a player who was influential and has been forced to quit the game - and my captain Danny Maddix have not been able to play a game. Paul Murray broke his leg twice and hasn't played at all. Early in the year we lost Ian Barraclough with a broken leg, Karl Reddy and Gavin Peacock. The following week we lost Chris Plummer with another broken leg. We certainly haven't had the best of luck with injuries.' Relief from the pressure of basement battles comes with an FA Cup replay on Wednesday. The incentive is massive. Should QPR overcome Luton they will host Arsenal in the next round. It is symbolic of Rangers' current standing that they haven't enjoyed a decent cup run for years. Francis's contract expires at the end of the season and if he is to extend his 20-year association with the club he needs reassurance that there is light at the end of the tunnel. It needs another renaissance, rather like the transformation he witnessed as a kid when an ambitious takeover made the good times roll. 'The Rangers I grew up with hardly had any seats in the ground, no grass on the pitch, one bath, with a shower over the top of the toilet, old wooden facilities and maybe 3,000 people turned up every week. Our neighbours Brentford were probably a better supported club. That's the QPR I knew before Jim Gregory came along and changed all that. He gave us a major lift, built the stadium, bought players and the club progressed.' Oh for the days of Rodney Marsh and Stan Bowles, when QPR won the League Cup as a Division Three side and promotions. Glamour and glory cascaded around Shepherd's Bush. Francis still believes that new investment, a new stadium, and new talent will come again. But while pounds and points remain hard to come by he won't be holding his breath.",

It all costs a lot of money which even large Premier League clubs can't take for granted. For example, Paul Gascoigne has been out injured for 10 games, about a quarter of the season.

And starting soon - perhaps even as soon as next season - more of them are going to fulfil that ambition. For moves are afoot for three-up, three-down between the Nationwide League and Conference. Talks have already taken place between the two bodies, instigated by the FA, and another meeting is planned for the week after next. 'We are looking at how we can improve the current situation,' says the FA's chief executive Adam Crozier, who believes the present one-up, one-down is restrictive and unfair on a growing number of Conference clubs in better health than many in the Third Division. 'We had a major meeting before Christmas at which all the cards were put on the table and we hope to be seeking an agreement over the next four to six weeks.'

      "byline": "Gordon Strachan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Any striker who is suffering from a lack of confidence will surely have been lifted by the agony that Michael Owen experienced in Liverpool's 2-1 Worthington Cup semi-final first-leg defeat at Crystal Palace on Wednesday. </p> <p>In missing chances that he would usually have taken with his eyes closed, Owen is bound to have caused other strikers going through a bad patch to have felt a little better about themselves. I can relate to this through my assessments of myself as a manager. </p> <p>In order to keep a sense of perspective about yourself when things are not going well, it does help to be able to look at managers with a better record or a bigger reputation than me who have landed in the same situation. </p> <p>In that context, the players who might have derived the biggest boost through watching Owen's uncharacteristic mistakes on TV are those at Coventry. It is no secret that scoring goals has been a big problem for us this season. Generally, we have not had the results we have deserved on the possession we have had and the number of chances we have created. </p> <p>During my time as manager, the Coventry team that posed the biggest scoring threat was the one with Dion Dublin and Darren Huckerby together up front three seasons ago. Dion, with his physical strength and ability in the air, and Darren, with his pace in getting behind defenders, complemented each other perfectly. They scored 38 goals between them, with Dion finishing the joint top scorer in the Premiership - alongside Michael Owen - on 23. </p> <p>I felt that we had potentially another top-notch scoring duo in Robbie Keane and Cedric Roussel. But there was no way we could afford to turn down Inter Milan's \u00a313.5 million bid for Robbie and Cedric has been hampered by injuries. Not surprisingly, the fact that we have struggled in the scoring department this season has put Craig Bellamy, the Welsh international signed as a replacement for Keane for a club record fee of \u00a36.5m, under a lot of pressure. </p> <p>This is unfair - not least because he has not had a lot of help from players in other positions. However, the harsh reality for strikers is that, no matter how much good work they might do with regards to their team's overall play, it is their scoring records on which they are assessed. </p> <p>In our training sessions, I always stress that the strikers' first thought should be to get into a scoring position. Dropping deep, and setting someone else up for a scoring attempt, should always be the second option. But when a striker is going through a bad time, it is not the easiest advice to take on board. </p> <p>To me, one of the most intriguing aspects of the scoring art is that the best strikers tend to come in all shapes and sizes. In one category, for example, there are the will-o'-the-wisp types such as Owen, Robbie Fowler, Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke. In the other, there are the big men such as John Hartson and Niall Quinn, who might not look particularly stylish but are nevertheless very effective. </p> <p>As reflected by Coventry's bid to sign Hartson from Wimbledon, I have admired him for some time.

      "bodyText": "Any striker who is suffering from a lack of confidence will surely have been lifted by the agony that Michael Owen experienced in Liverpool's 2-1 Worthington Cup semi-final first-leg defeat at Crystal Palace on Wednesday. In missing chances that he would usually have taken with his eyes closed, Owen is bound to have caused other strikers going through a bad patch to have felt a little better about themselves. I can relate to this through my assessments of myself as a manager. In order to keep a sense of perspective about yourself when things are not going well, it does help to be able to look at managers with a better record or a bigger reputation than me who have landed in the same situation. In that context, the players who might have derived the biggest boost through watching Owen's uncharacteristic mistakes on TV are those at Coventry. It is no secret that scoring goals has been a big problem for us this season. Generally, we have not had the results we have deserved on the possession we have had and the number of chances we have created. During my time as manager, the Coventry team that posed the biggest scoring threat was the one with Dion Dublin and Darren Huckerby together up front three seasons ago. Dion, with his physical strength and ability in the air, and Darren, with his pace in getting behind defenders, complemented each other perfectly. They scored 38 goals between them, with Dion finishing the joint top scorer in the Premiership - alongside Michael Owen - on 23. I felt that we had potentially another top-notch scoring duo in Robbie Keane and Cedric Roussel. But there was no way we could afford to turn down Inter Milan's \u00a313.5 million bid for Robbie and Cedric has been hampered by injuries. Not surprisingly, the fact that we have struggled in the scoring department this season has put Craig Bellamy, the Welsh international signed as a replacement for Keane for a club record fee of \u00a36.5m, under a lot of pressure. This is unfair - not least because he has not had a lot of help from players in other positions. However, the harsh reality for strikers is that, no matter how much good work they might do with regards to their team's overall play, it is their scoring records on which they are assessed. In our training sessions, I always stress that the strikers' first thought should be to get into a scoring position. Dropping deep, and setting someone else up for a scoring attempt, should always be the second option. But when a striker is going through a bad time, it is not the easiest advice to take on board. To me, one of the most intriguing aspects of the scoring art is that the best strikers tend to come in all shapes and sizes. In one category, for example, there are the will-o'-the-wisp types such as Owen, Robbie Fowler, Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke. In the other, there are the big men such as John Hartson and Niall Quinn, who might not look particularly stylish but are nevertheless very effective. As reflected by Coventry's bid to sign Hartson from Wimbledon, I have admired him for some time. People tend to concentrate on his physique and combativeness; as his former West Ham boss, Harry Redknapp, pointed out: 'He is the closest football equivalent to a rugby union front-row forward.' But there is more to Hartson than just physical power. He has a good knowledge of the game - he knows how to find space - and, in addition to his ability in the air, he is an excellent striker of the ball. The other attraction about him for Coventry, of course, is that he operates with Bellamy in the Welsh team. At this stage, I do not want to get carried away by the prospect of him in a Coventry shirt. There are so many potential hitches in transfer deals and those concerning this one include the player-exchange element involving Roussel, and Hartson's previous knee problems. However, our chairman, Bryan Richardson, who is dealing with the finer points of the deal, is confident it will go ahead. Quinn, experiencing a new lease of life at Sunderland at the age of 34, is another big striker whose appearance is deceptive. It is difficult to avoid looking ungainly and clumsy when you are 6ft 5in tall. But, like Hartson, he has acquired a tremendous football knowledge; and his partnership with Kevin Phillips is as good as any in the Premiership. Still, that does not mean they are above missing apparently simple chances. As we saw on Wednesday, no one is. In the second leg of the Liverpool-Palace tie, we might also see how dramatically a striker's fortunes can be transformed. I still remember Mark McGhee's response after he and I had been guilty of amazing misses in Aberdeen's 2-0 European Cup Winners' Cup defeat by Ujpest Dozsa in 1984. In his book on his Aberdeen experiences, the manager, Alex Ferguson, described them as 'the worst goal attempts I have ever seen'.

      "body": "<p>I hate to say it, but I have spent the past few days hooked on a statistics website. The best thing about <a href=\"http://www.football.sportsites.co.uk\">www.football.sportsites.co.uk</a> is the attendance figures it provides for almost every football league in Europe (though not, sadly, for Albania). These give surprising insights and answer the question of which European country is maddest about the game. </p> <p>Crowds in England are now the biggest in Europe. It was not ever thus. Ten years ago the average match in the old English First Division drew 20,776 people. In the Premier League so far this season it's 32,553. England has thus come from miles behind to overtake Italy, where average crowds in Serie A have hovered about 30,000 for most of the decade (or 29,499 so far this season). </p> <p>German attendances have also jumped, but they did so earlier than in England, with the rise starting in the mid-Eighties and more or less peaking in the mid-Nineties. The average Bundesliga match now draws 29,897. German, Italian and Spanish crowds have all declined this season, while Premier League attendances are up 6.2 per cent. </p> <p>But the country where fandom has truly come into fashion is France. Ten years ago the average crowd in the Championnat was 10,226. This season it's more than double that, at 22,190. As far as I can ascertain, this is by far the highest average in French history. </p> <p>Aha, you might say, that's because the French won the World Cup and Euro 2000. Indeed, the average gate has jumped by 7,000 since the World Cup, and a sign of how quickly the French have caught on is that the final of Euro 2000 was watched on TV by four million more people (a total of 25 million) than saw the World Cup final. </p> <p>However, it should be noted that the latest rises merely accelerated a trend. In the eight years before the World Cup, the average French attendance rose 50 per cent. </p> <p>All this proves how fickle football fans are. It's not that they come running when a team does well. Rather, it seems that football can quickly become fashionable across a whole country. All teams then profit, but particularly those that build nice, large new stadiums. That would explain why the three English clubs whose crowds grew fastest over the Nineties were Manchester United, Sunderland and Newcastle. (The club that lost most spectators, incidentally, was Sheffield Wednesday, which shed 8,953 during the decade.) </p> <p>In other nations, clubs such as Ajax and Celtic have drawn huge new crowds to their new grounds - in Ajax's case, even though their football has spontaneously combusted. Chants of 'Where were you when you were shit?' miss the point. It should be, 'Where were you when your ground was shit?' </p> <p>Fans are more swayed by comfort, safety and fashion than by glory. If they were so worried about winning, then silverware-free operations such as Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Newcastle and Olympique Marseille would not be among the 12 European clubs with the largest crowds. </p> <p>Brian Clough once spoke of the great hordes of people not going to football matches. Indeed, grounds in most European countries are empty. Only in eight leagues does the average match draw more than 10,000 people. In Greece, supposedly a football-mad place, the average top-division crowd is 4,648. </p> <p>But most pathetic are attendances in eastern Europe. This is a post-Communist phenomenon. In 1989, Nicolae Ceaucescu's last year in power, the average crowd at a Romanian first-division match was 17,000, almost as many as in England at the time. Now it's 7,307. In Poland, which has nearly 40 million inhabitants, the average has sunk to 4,523, and even given that Russian men are dying at such a startling rate, it's disappointing that only 11,820 (or less than one in 10,000 Russians) on average turn up to matches there. In Ukraine, Dynamo Kiev average 6,429 spectators. But the least popular league in Europe is Lithuania's, with an average attendance of 398. </p> <p>It is also clear that few Europeans care about little clubs. The English are the exception. The Premiership club with the smallest crowds, Southampton, still pulls in 15,106, which is more than six clubs in Spain's Primera Liga. </p> <p>The Nationwide Division One is easily the best-supported lower league in Europe, with average crowds of 13,943 per game. That is almost double the Italian Serie B , and nearly three times larger than the average in France's second division. </p> <p>The Champions League was invented by the big western clubs. But it is their fans who like it least. Bayern Munich's average attendance in Europe so far this season is 22,750, or less than half their average Bundesliga crowd. Real Madrid, Lazio, Juventus and Paris St Germain also draw fewer fans than for domestic games. </p> <p>The Champions League has most appeal in countries where domestic football is unpopular. Among the eight clubs with the largest average crowds in the competition are Olympiakos Piraeus, Dynamo Kiev, Panathinaikos, and, in first place, Spartak Moscow with 69,250. That's almost four times what they get for domestic matches. </p> <p>None of this reveals which European country is nuttiest about football. England may have Europe's largest attendances, but as a percentage of its population the numbers are modest. In which country does the highest proportion of inhabitants go to games? </p> <p>You might think it was Scotland. The average Scottish Premier League match draws a crowd of 15,991, more than the Russian average - pretty good for a country of 5.1 million people. If the English went in equal proportions, even taking into account the fact that the English Premier League game has eight more teams than Scotland's, the average English match would draw a crowd of 90,000. </p> <p>Nor is the Scottish phenomenon simply an Old Firm effect. The average attendance for the 10 other clubs in the Scottish Premier League is 8,400, far more than for any other European country of similar size. </p> <p>Yet the Scots are not the most football-mad Europeans. Icelanders are marginally more fanatical, but they don't win either. Instead, the honour goes to Cyprus. The average Cypriot match draws just 2,789 people, but that amounts to an excellent one in 287 of the country's 800,000 inhabitants. </p> <p><strong>The crowd pullers: Europe's top 20</strong></p> <p><strong>Average attendance per league match in top division </strong></p> <p><strong>England</strong> 32,758 <br> <strong>Italy</strong> 29,801<br> <strong>Germany</strong> 29,765 <br> <strong>Spain</strong> 23,253 <br> <strong>France</strong> 22,355<br> <strong>Scotland</strong> 15,915 <br> <strong>Netherlands</strong> 14,894 <br> <strong>Russia</strong> 11,820<br> <strong>Belgium</strong> 9,976<br> <strong>Ukraine</strong> 7,405 <br> <strong>Portugal</strong> 7,344<br> <strong>Romania</strong> 7,307 <br> <strong>Sweden</strong> 6,949 <br> <strong>Greece</strong> 4,648<br> <strong>Denmark</strong> 5,286 <br> <strong>Bulgaria</strong> 6,031 <br> <strong>Austria</strong> 6,590<br> <strong>Norway</strong> 5,715 <br> <strong>Switzerland</strong> 5,386 <br> <strong>Czech Republic</strong> 4,723</p>",

Call it what you like - recharging batteries, getting away from it all, just chilling out - there are many destinations that offer more than just a holiday. They are somewhere to restore your well-being, physically and mentally, places to which you definitely don't need to bring along your cell phone, Wap, portable computer or Palm. On these travels you might have a massage by a swirling whirlpool, go hiking up a mountainside, or take part in a mass meditation ceremony. You may end up staying in a luxury, expensive hotel, or cheap, spartan accommodation - and it could be thousands of miles away or just the other side of the Channel. </p> <p> <strong> Rejang River, Sarawak, Malaysia </strong> </p> <p> Sarawak is in the middle of the world's oldest rainforests in Borneo, and before becoming part of modern Malaysia was the private fief of Britain's Brooke family, known as the Land of the White Rajahs. Running through the jungle is the Rejang River, on whose banks live the Iban people, who were headhunters until half a century ago. </p> <p><strong> Why there? </strong> The Ibans live in communities of longhouses, where several hundred people share the same building, where only the sleeping quarters are kept private. The Ibans are friendly and welcoming to visitors, though don't be surprised to see skulls hanging from the ceiling, as they are still used for animist ceremonies. </p> <p> <strong> Auroville, Pondicherry, India </strong> </p> <p> A hundred miles south of Madras lies Auroville, the City of Dawn, a community of followers of the Sri Aurobindo ashram, a mystical, idealistic movement.

Alternatively you can relax in nearby quaint Pondicherry, staying in the delightful hotel, Villa Helena, set in a luxurious old colonial bungalow.

Smell the deep fragrances of musk, cinnamon or eucalyptus, then pinch yourself to remember that this is actually England. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong> If Tresco is the jewel of the Scillies, then the Island Hotel is the ideal spot to base yourself, understated luxury, fine gourmet cuisine, with a laid-back atmosphere more like the Hamptons than the West Country.

There's a hair-raising, footbridge across the gorge that takes you to Knife Edge Point. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong> Although the best views may be from the Zambian side, nothing can compare with staying in Zimbabwe's grand old relic from colonial times, the Victoria Falls Hotel, PO Box 10, Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.

      "bodyText": "2001 has finally begun and memories of Christmas and New Year are already drifting away, so it's time to start making plans for trips to recover from it all, maybe even time to start travelling with a new, fresh outlook. Call it what you like - recharging batteries, getting away from it all, just chilling out - there are many destinations that offer more than just a holiday. They are somewhere to restore your well-being, physically and mentally, places to which you definitely don't need to bring along your cell phone, Wap, portable computer or Palm. On these travels you might have a massage by a swirling whirlpool, go hiking up a mountainside, or take part in a mass meditation ceremony. You may end up staying in a luxury, expensive hotel, or cheap, spartan accommodation - and it could be thousands of miles away or just the other side of the Channel. Rejang River, Sarawak, Malaysia Sarawak is in the middle of the world's oldest rainforests in Borneo, and before becoming part of modern Malaysia was the private fief of Britain's Brooke family, known as the Land of the White Rajahs. Running through the jungle is the Rejang River, on whose banks live the Iban people, who were headhunters until half a century ago. Why there? The Ibans live in communities of longhouses, where several hundred people share the same building, where only the sleeping quarters are kept private. The Ibans are friendly and welcoming to visitors, though don't be surprised to see skulls hanging from the ceiling, as they are still used for animist ceremonies. Auroville, Pondicherry, India A hundred miles south of Madras lies Auroville, the City of Dawn, a community of followers of the Sri Aurobindo ashram, a mystical, idealistic movement. More than 1,000 people live in Auroville, and over two-thirds are foreigners, including Brits and other Europeans. Why there? Whether you find it a fraud, a rip-off or the recipe for surviving the future, a visit to Auroville - and especially its meditation centre, the Matramandir, a vast windowless globe - is a unique experience that may start you asking questions about your life. Where to stay It is possible to stay in the utopian city of the future. Alternatively you can relax in nearby quaint Pondicherry, staying in the delightful hotel, Villa Helena, set in a luxurious old colonial bungalow.

Tel: 00 91 413 226789, fax: 227087 Ubud, Bali, Indonesia Forget the claim that Bali has been ruined by tourism because with a little effort anyone can find their own corner of paradise on this island where art and culture, religion, music and dance remain inextricably woven into people's daily lives. Why there? If the island's cultural capital, Ubud, seems too busy and touristy, then head for nearby Sayan valley, Bali's most beautiful hidden vista of terraced rice fields. Spend your days having long, languid massages, witness trance dances and strange animist rites that cover Balinese life from birth to death. Where to stay You can stay in a simple wood-carver's cottage in Sayan, but if budget is no problem, don't miss one of the world's ultimate luxury hotels.

Don't bother with the carnival, which has turned into a tacky circus; choose November, January, February or March and pack Wellington boots for the Aqua Alta floods. Why there? Venice in the rain, the thick, enveloping winter fog, is Venice as it was centuries ago - silent, eerie, incredibly beautiful, and most importantly, inhabited mostly by locals rather than the thousands of tourists that flood in each day during the rest of the year. Where to stay Avoid spending a fortune at the overpriced palace hotels but equally don't end up in a depressing one-star dive with loo and bathroom down the corridor. Book months in advance, and bag a room in Locanda Ai Santi Apostoli, a small elegant palazzo with a view over the Grand Canal. Locanda Ai Santi Apostoli, Strada Nuova 4391, Cannaregio.

The Keys have an eccentric, independent island mentality. Why there? Though most visitors here can't resist the lure of Key West, Key Largo, or the romantic Matekumbe Key, head for one of the idyllic private islands.

If I lived there for years, I don't think I'd get used to the view of the waters of Loch na Cille, a few metres from the cottage. Sometimes they lapped peacefully at the shore, while at others they charged furiously up the channel between our island and the next peninsula, beyond which the Paps of Jura were occasionally visible. Every morning I scanned the water for the otters we'd been promised by the cottage's owner, Miss Pollock. They must be the shyest otters in Scotland. </p> <p>James and I decided months ago that we would spend a low-key New Year in a remote corner of the British Isles. It occurred to us that a cottage would be much cheaper and more fun than any hotel. Extensive enquiries among everyone we knew produced three other takers: Charlotte from London, Neil from Newcastle, and Jeff from New York. We searched the internet for properties and were surprised at the vast array of websites out there. The best site, in our opinion, was run by Country Holidays; it let us put in requests such as 'open fire', then listed page after page of gorgeous looking houses. We settled on one near Ullapool. </p> <p>It was not, however, as straightforward as we'd hoped: the day before our departure, we suddenly had to choose a different Country Holidays cottage, because the whole country except for our hometown, Brighton, was covered in snow, and the people who had spent Christmas in our original choice had (opportunistically, in our opinion) declared themselves unable to leave. </p> <p>Thus we arrived, on a crisp and snowy Saturday, on the Island of Danna. It is not a place that should be anybody's second choice. From Glasgow, the drive was spectacular, skirting Loch Lomond and Loch Fyne before meandering through the village of Tayvallich and over a causeway. </p> <p>'There'll be a ceilidh tomorrow night,' Miss Pollock told us, (she was surely Judi Dench's twin sister). 'I don't expect anyone would mind if you came. Just ask in the pub whose house it's at, and bring plenty of bottles.' The idea of celebrating Hogmanay at someone else's house when we weren't really invited, and the roads were icy and any expedition meant that one of us couldn't drink, was not, ultimately, as appealing as staying in making our own entertainment; which we did in some style, thanks to six magnums of champagne left over from James's brother's wedding, and a roaring fire. </p> <p>Despite good intentions, we began the New Year with a day of collective televisual sloth. We had a brief moment of self-awareness when Charlotte pointed out that we were slumped indoors on a beautiful Scottish island, watching people leaving a beautiful Scottish island, and marvelling at how beautiful it was. Looking out of the window would have been more effective. Jeff received a thorough grounding in British television, and for the rest of the week impressed us by saying things like 'Isn't that Judy Finnegan?' and, 'How did Mark Fowler get HIV?' We, in return, emerged depressingly well-informed about the iniquities and the corruption of the American election. </p> <p>Once the hangovers wore off, there was an immense amount of sightseeing to be done. Kilmartin Glen was nearby, with its standing stones and ruined castles. Skies were often blue. The fresh air hit our lungs and made us happy, and having an American on hand ensured that we appreciated how old everything was (and also led us to visit numerous establishments that offered fish and chips). One day we drove to Oban and caught a boat to Mull and then to Iona, where we saw John Smith's grave. The abbey and the ruined nunnery alone were worth the holiday, and the sense of isolation was tempered only slightly by the fact that we were far from the only tourists on the boat. </p> <p>We left Danna sadly, a bit calmer, and a lot fatter. As well as seeing in the New Year in some sort of style, we'd remained friends throughout.

A massage, a light meal and a good night's sleep banished jet lag and we were ready for the road. </p> <p>And what a road. We crossed the Lion Gate Bridge, Vancouver's Golden Gate, and headed up the stunning seal-dotted Howe Sound to Squamish (Indian for Big Wind). Here some 5,000 Bald Eagles spend the winter fishing for salmon. The last hour was a scenic mountain travel delight; Whistler almost came too soon. </p> <p>Our hotel, Chateau Whistler, dominates the upper village, at the base of the Blackcomb slopes. The Whistler and Blackcomb massifs are two inter-linked ski areas that offer a possible 7,000 skiable acres. You would be pushed to ski each run once in three days, assuming you had the legs to do it. </p> <p>Last summer the resort invested $2.3 millon on snowmaking, to some local scepticism, since they normally have 100 per cent coverage from November to May, with an average 12 metre annual snowfall. But this autumn was the driest for a decade. With a mere 3,000 acres on offer in early December, the snowmaking was put to good use. </p> <p>One of the best ways to enjoy Whistler is to join the Ski Esprit instruction programme. Fresh-faced Phil Gordon soon had us enjoying Whisky Jack, the Dave Murray Downhill and Harmony Express. He boosted our confidence on Jersey Cream and Burnt Stew trails. Serious teaching was regularly interspersed with humour and inspiration. </p> <p>The Horstman glacier provided exhilarating ski scenery. At 7,000ft, it is another of Whistler's bonuses - glaciers are usually at lung-crushing altitudes. We marvelled at the Black Tusk panorama and looked askance at the Couloir Extreme, a dou ble black-diamond shute that is the start of skiing's reputedly steepest GS race. </p> <p>As to the apr\u00e8s-ski, there are plenty of bars in which to rub shoulders with couloir extremists and restaurants with great ambience.

      "body": "<p>The broiling heat of Florida's Orlando might seem incongruous for the annual convention of North America's ski operators. Last year, however, the shorts-and-sandals weather was uncomfortably appropriate. Top of the agenda was what delegates had voted the biggest threat to skiing worldwide: the insidious encroachment of global warming. Delegates arriving in Orlando had every reason to be worried. After three bad snow years the gossip in the convention centre was about the resorts that had suffered yet another disastrous year, prominent among them the unfortunate Snow Bowl resort near Flagstaff, Arizona. High temperatures and low snowfall meant last season only lasted a few weeks. </p> <p>And it is not just North America that is suffering from the threat of rising temperatures. Wherever local economies are dependent on skiing - from Europe to the Antipodes - they are facing the same nightmare scenario: the end of skiing as we know it, and with it the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in some of Europe's and America's poorest regions. </p> <p>For tourists it poses another kind of nightmare: of muddy denuded slopes and crumbling mountains; of ski-lift pylons made unsafe by the defrosting of the very foundations on which they stand; a future in which skis and snowboards are curious museum pieces. </p> <p>'There was a survey done recently that showed what the impact would be on North American skiing,' says Auden Schendler, director of environmental affairs at the Aspen Skiing Company in Colorado, one of the world's most famous resorts. 'It showed that in 100 years our climate could be similar to that of Santa Fe. That is the equivalent of chopping the top 2,000ft off our mountains. </p> <p>'It is,' he admits, 'a worst-case scenario. But what we are seeing without doubt is heavier snow, wetter weather and warmer nights, which has a clear implication for artificial snowmaking.' And it matters to Aspen. It really does. For despite its public face as a chi-chi resort for the rich and famous, many of those servicing the resort are from the most vulnerable end of the economic spectrum. </p> <p>According to Schendler, Aspen's economy is almost entirely dependent on skiing and winter tourism. Each dollar spent on skiing brings in almost a dollar in revenue to restaurants and other outlets. In the bad snow years, income has dropped by up to 20 per cent. </p> <p>It is a story horribly familiar in the world's most famous resorts, especially after the experiences of the Nineties - the warmest decade since records began. It is also an issue some ski operators believe the industry has been slow to wake up to. Schendler's predecessor Chris Lane was one of those who, for years, had been warning about the danger. 'When I brought up global warming just two years ago,' he told the US Ski Magazine earlier this month: 'I was laughed at.' </p> <p>Now nobody's laughing. A tranche of new scientific research has revealed that the snow once taken for granted by resorts is increasingly under threat. </p> <p>Last week it was the turn of Dr Chris Harris to turn the heat up on the ski business, revealing that the very fabric of Europe's mountains, the frozen permafrost that holds the Alps together, was melting. Work by the Cardiff University academic revealed that temperatures in the icebound soil above Alpine villages such as Zermatt, St Moritz and Murren, had risen by as much as a degree in the last 15 years, a phenomenon that is also being repeated from Scandinavia's mountain ranges, through the Pyrenees down to Spain's high mountains of the Sierra Nevada. </p> <p>It may be news to most skiers, but is something that has been noted with growing alarm by mountaineers for well over a decade. Alpine ice climbs first ascended in the summer months even until the Sixties are now climbed in mid-winter, or not at all, trans formed in the summer into rocky rubble chutes. Across the globe glaciers are in retreat. Indeed, since 1850 the glacial area of western Europe has reduced by almost a half. And the loss of permafrost has serious implications for the Alps themselves. The spectacular collapse of a massive rampart on the Petit Dru, an imposing and beautiful rock pillar that towered over the French Alpine resort of Chamonix, has been blamed on the melting of the deep and ancient ice that glued it together. </p> <p>And it is a threat that could bring economic meltdown to many mountain communities, as well as endangering their very existence through the avalanches, landslips and floods that have come to be associated with the changing mountain weather patterns. </p> <p>A 1996 model of snowfall in the European Alps created by the Centre for Snow Studies in Grenoble in France calculated that at an altitude of 1,500 metres in the French Alps, a rise of 1.8C would reduce the period of snow by 20 per cent in the north and by 40 per cent in the south, with the greatest impact in the Maritime Alps. For Mont Blanc, Europe's highest mountain, it would mean half a metre less snow each year. </p> <p>It has been more than just theory. According to the same report, the predicted shrinking of the ski season at lower altitude resorts has been happening for a decade. Satellite imaging in the Nineties of the lowlands around the Alps in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and the plains of the river Po showed they were receiving between three and four weeks less snow cover than in previous decades. </p> <p>The threat to the European ski industry was laid out in apocalyptic terms by Bruno Abegg, a researcher at Zurich University in the mid-Nineties, when he warned that a rise in temperature of 3C would devastate the European mountain environment and economies, leading to a rise in the snowline of the Central Alps of 300m, threatening a third of Switzerland's resorts with the prospect of insufficient snow to ski. </p> <p>But it is at the lower altitude resorts - particularly in Austria - that the alarm bells are ringing most loudly. Three-quarters of Austria's ski-lifts are situated below 1,000 metres; 69 per cent of all winter tourist nights are also spent below this level. </p> <p>Austria, indeed, is typical of many mountainous regions of the world where skiing and mountain tourism has been established in the last half century as an alternative to low intensity agriculture. Austria too, is unusually dependent on its ski industry which generates 4.5 per cent of the country's gross national product. That figure - high as it is - hides an even higher level of economic dependence in the mountain regions themselves on winter tourism. Research commissioned by the Austrian government from Meinhard Breiling, a scientist at the Laboratory of Land Resource Sciences at the University of Tokyo, makes for chilling reading. Breiling has calculated both the possible loss of snow cover for Austria and, significantly, the economic impact it would have on theindustry. </p> <p>For like many other ski operators (Aspen included) Austrian operators, faced with a flattening of growth in the ski market, have borrowed heavily to fund improvements in their resorts they hope will give them the edge on their competitors. </p> <p>And if Austria's resorts are vulnerable, then their populations are doubly so, for reasons echoed in mountain communities around the world where work is seasonal and low paid. Incomes in some ski areas - according to Breiling's research in the Hermagor region - are 80 per cent lower than the national average. 'No industrial country in the world is as dependent on tourism as Austria, which has a share between 4 and 5 per cent of world tourism,' Breiling said in a presentation to the Japanese Snow and Ice Society at Niigata. 'Fifty per cent of tourist income derives from the winter season. A couple of bad winter seasons with poor snow cover, similar to those experienced at the end of the Eighties may ruin a population dependent on winter income.' The worst-case scenario has already been spelt out for Austria by a 1994 government report which warned that a rise of just 1C, combined with a decline in snowfall, could reduce the duration of snowcover over 1,500m by half. </p> <p>While Breiling challenges such worst-case scenario calculations he does, however, believe that the Austrian economy has already been damaged by global warming, perhaps accounting for as much as a 1.5 per cent of potential national earnings. Breiling bases his calculations on a rise in temperature of 1.5C over the next few decades. The impact of this, he calculates, would be devastating, seeing a loss of 15 days from both ends of the winter season, and damaging the profitable Christmas and Easter periods. </p> <p>The vulnerability of the Austrian ski industry was also highlighted by a report last year by the World Wide Fund for Nature on the impact of global warming on international tourism that focused on the threat to the top resort of Kitzbuhl, none of whose mountains is much above 2,000m. </p> <p>'There is obviously going to be a problem in somewhere like Kitzbuhl,' says Dr Ute Collier, the head of WWF's climate change campaign. 'The local people there will say: \"No, no, we haven't got a problem\" and point to annual variations in snowfall, but the trend is clearly for warmer winters. We have also seen a change in the winter weather patterns with snowfall patterns changing so that there are long periods of stable sunny weather with short very heavy falls of snow that bring their own kind of problems like the avalanches we have seen in Austria, Switzerland and France. I think that it is also clear that we are going to see more starts to the ski season like this year's, where low-lying resorts had no snow at all.' </p> <p>If Austria is contemplating a nightmare future without sufficient snow for skiing, the same concern is being amplified several-fold in ski areas with marginal profitability like Vermont, New Hampshire's White Mountains, California's Sierra Nevada (which includes Hollywood's resort of choice, Lake Tahoe) and Australia's Snowy Mountains, whose viability is at best close to the knuckle. In Scotland the situation is best regarded as being hopeless. </p> <p>Vanessa Haines, of the Ski Club of Great Britain, has noted the changes with concern but remains open-minded about how much temperatures will finally rise and cautious about the most pessimistic predictions for the sport. 'The research has been contradictory but temperatures do seem to have been rising. We have already seen summer glacier skiing being restricted. It is also true that Austria has had some very bad years, but last winter Austria had some amazing snow.' </p> <p>One thing she has noticed is the way in which snowfall patterns have changed away from steady snowfall throughout the season to heavy falls during wild storms. </p> <p>And on the slopes themselves ski guides and instructors are painfully aware of what is going on. Last Thursday The Observer caught up with British instructor Mark Jones as he was leading an off-piste party above the resort of Val D'Is\u00e8re. Despite abundant snow last week, he has noticed a marked change in the 10 years he has been based in the Alps. </p> <p>'Global warming comes up a lot in conversation in the resort,' he said.'Now when there is any unusual weather people immediately blame global warming. But what has been very noticeable is the way in which all the glaciers have been retreating, even in a decade. Where there was once snow and ice there are just steep rocky slopes. The other thing that I have noticed is how unpredictable the weather has become. Once you could have a pretty good idea what kind of weather you could expect in each month of the winter.' </p> <p>If it all sounds like terrible news, there is at least one straw of hope to cling to for dedicated skiers horrified by the prospect of their sport being consigned to the history books. For as well as heavier snowfall predicted for northern latitude locations such as northern Scandinavia and Alaska, at least one climate model for global warming would see Northern Europe's temperature rise and then just as quickly decline as cold water from the northern polar ice cap displaces the Gulf Stream and creates a Polar Stream cooling Europe's climate. </p> <p>Don't throw away those skis just yet.</p> <p><strong>The chilling facts</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Satellites show vast areas of the Alps already losing up to four weeks snow cover compared to a decade ago. </p> <p>\u0095 Mountain communities face the threat of avalanches, landslips and floods as the snow melts.</p> <p>\u0095 Defrosting of the ground is likely to make ski-lift pylons unsafe.</p> <p>\u0095 Hundreds of thousands of workers in the ski industry could lose their jobs.</p> <p>\u0095 4.5 per cent of Austria's gross national product could be lost.</p>",

Around me, a thousand gleaming chestnuts already littered the paving stones, left there by the hotel staff - not neglectfully, but as a warning to guests to stay under cover of the verandah. </p> <p>Why anyone allowed such an arboreal arsenal to blitz the hotel terrace was not the question to ask in Eger (pronounced Egg-air), a fortress town in eastern Hungary. The local people have been subjected to almost continuous bombardment for centuries. Being conked by a conker is the least of their worries. </p> <p>Eger's hero, whose story is taught to all Hungary's 12-year-olds, is the bathetically named Istvan Dobo (as in Dobson). Unlike Frank Dobson, however, Dobo was a natural winner. He repelled a vastly superior Turkish army in 1552 by arming his womenfolk with rocks to throw from the castle battlements and goading his men into a rage fuelled by the local red wine. The teetotal Moors, seeing the wine stains on the Hungarians' shirts, attributed their ferocity to drinking bull's blood and fled. The name Bull's Blood endured - but victory didn't. The Moors returned a few years later, captured Eger and ruled it for 91 years. </p> <p>Before them, the town had already been overrun by the Mongols; after them, it was taken by the Hapsburgs, the Nazis and the Soviets. Which means the Hungarians have been under the yoke for almost all their 1,000-year history. Despite that - or perhaps because they are at last tasting the fruits of peace and self-determination - they are open and welcoming to strangers. </p> <p>To pay homage to the valiant Dobo, I headed off to Szepasszony-Volgy, signposted in English as Nice Lady Valley, to drink Bull's Blood. After a short cab ride, a gold-painted figure of a maiden and a statue of Bacchus astride a barrel came into view. The strains of a fiddle band filled the air; women in traditional bonnets and full skirts and men in trilby hats were whirling in an open-air dance. So who is this Nice Lady, I asked. Sheepishly, the answer came back that 'nice lady' had a double meaning in Hungarian; far from being nice, she ran a bawdyhouse in one of the wine cellars cut into the hill. </p> <p>Noting a cave still sporting a red light, I headed in a different direction and entered a limestone vault where the vintner, Attila ('No, there aren't any Huns in Hungary any more; they came and went in the fifth century,' assured my guide), served me Bull's Blood and sweet red medina and white leanyka in small tumblers at the equivalent of 75p a litre. Two Gypsy fiddlers scraped away. A drunken clarinettist who tried to form a trio was sent packing. Voices and strings mingled in merriment. Only a stack of empty Tesco Value Lemonade bottles spoilt the effect. Oh well, the price of embracing capitalism. </p> <p>Next day, Rosza, my guide in Eger, invited me to help harvest her family's grapes. When I arrived, she pressed homemade meatballs and walnut cake into my hands, followed by a pair of rusty secateurs. All the precious violet-blue Zweigelt grapes had to be gathered into buckets, then wheelbarrowed to a skip, where they were stomped on by the youngest member of the family. Rosza said she and her husband had seized the chance at the end of the Communist era to work a piece of land and sell the produce. Later they were allowed to become property owners. </p> <p>Despite poverty, Eger is a fine town, rebuilt in baroque style in the eighteenth century after the departure of the Turks. It's a couple of hours' drive from Budapest. A solitary Turkish bath and minaret remain as reminders of Moorish domination. The castle houses exhibitions and Dobo's tomb. The baroque Minorite Church in Dobo Square with many-coloured marbles and elaborate altars and the Lyceum with its frescoes are spectacular. Thermal baths from natural hot springs are favoured by Polish and Slovak visitors and the Hungarians, though the English are more timid about bathing in strange minerals and radioactive radon gas. </p> <p>For most of my stay, Hungary looked and felt like western Europe - then occasionally someone or something would give it away: the staff at a motorway toll who weren't collecting because there was 'too much traffic'; the waitress at a caf\u00e9 gathering in dead pot plants at closing time; the Fifties radio in my hotel room that was larger than the modern television; the two-stroke Trabants bombing down the streets; the cloying aroma of paprika, Hungary's national spice. This sense of not quite having shaken off a bleak past is part of Hungary's melancholic charm. </p> <p>Travelling out of Eger, there's a choice: the mountains to the north; the interminable Great Hungarian Plain plain to the south. I had time to do both. I took the low road to the Puszta, a world heritage site where Gypsy horsemen showed off their riding skills and herded their animals. </p> <p>From there to Lake Tisza, an eerily empty expanse where our party was taken in small aluminium boats through open water, flooded tree stumps, reed beds and willow swamps. We emerged into the river Tisza, which last February was devastated when tonnes of cyanide sludge at a gold mine upstream in Romania escaped into the water. Had the Tisza recovered, I asked the boatman. Yes, he said, fish were back to three-quarters of former levels, thanks to restocking and a flood that purged the river. Recently a catfish more than two metres long had been caught. </p> <p>Northwards from Eger, at Szilvasvarad in the Bukk mountains, I rode in a carriage pulled by Lippizaners from the Hungarian national stud and was allowed on a trusty steed for a plod round a field. It was much like a donkey ride on a British beach, although the photos were more impressive. </p> <p>Final stop was the mediaeval hill village of Holloko, another world heritage site. After a demonstration of traditional dress, our guide explained that this was a living community, not a monument to a lost lifestyle. To prove it, he took us to meet an elderly couple, Lajos and Erzsebet, who treated us to lunch. We later discovered they had been paid \u00a325 to serve six of us four courses interspersed with pear and plum brandy. The first course was steaming bowls of chicken noodle soup and sliced paprika rings; the second was more soup and paprika with the addition of pieces of cooked chicken and vegetables. The beaming Erzsebet then presented the third course, a cauldron of chicken pieces in, guess what, paprika sauce with more pasta. But never mind the width, I felt the quality. I had had a taste of Hungary that left me hungry for more. </p> <p> <strong>Fact file</strong> </p> <p> Robert Poulton travelled with Inghams (020 8780 4433) and stayed at the baroque three-star Hotel Park in Eger, where prices start at \u00a3349 for seven nights including half-board, transfers and scheduled flights from Heathrow.

      "body": "<p>Does Tom Hanks symbolise something less than manly? Ford's US advertising people apparently think so: they built a recent ad around the idea that no truck driving man would be caught dead watching Hanks's 1998 romantic comedy, You've Got Mail. Hanks's reply came in surprising vigorous language. 'You know what? I could kick the butts of all those guys driving their trucks. Come by me, man, and I'll tear you apart. And you know what? I've only got one good shoulder.' </p> <p>The idea that Hanks is a wimp is blown away by the story of the making of his latest film, Cast Away. To play the Federal Express employee stranded on a Pacific island he managed to lose 40 pounds, not to mention surviving a dangerous leg infection. Nor is this the first time that Hanks has indulged in this kind of De Niro-like preparation: he gained 30 pounds for A League Of Their Own, lost 20 for Philadelphia, learnt to play the violin for The Man In The Red Shoes, did comedy open mic slots for Punchline and convinced his younger co-stars not to give in as they were all put through the gruelling boot camp for Saving Private Ryan. </p> <p>Yet Hanks has no ideological commitment to Method acting. And the last thing the audiences who have made Hanks one of the two biggest film stars in the world want is for him to disappear into the role. What they are seeking from him is reassurance that there is goodness in the world. Hanks, Steven Spielberg has said, is 'the most moral man I have ever known'. Of Forrest Gump, veteran US film critic Roger Ebert wrote: 'Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead.' Hanks's own take is: 'I think what I am is that I am not cynical.' </p> <p>This expresses itself most prominently in a yearning for a better, past America: the obsession with the Space Race (Apollo 13, the Hanks produced mini-series, From The Earth To The Moon ) and World War II (Saving Private Ryan, the forthcoming Hanks/Spielberg mini-series, Band Of Brothers). Like an increasing number of Americans, Left and Right, Hanks is obsessed with 'the greatest generation', the men who fought the Good War. </p> <p>He's far from stupid, though. Everyone who meets him insists that Hanks - this is rare for an actor - is brighter than the characters he plays. Despite the straightforward moral world of most of his films - including his directorial debut, That Thing You Do - he cites Alexander Payne's corrosive high school satire, Election, as his favourite recent film, and American Beauty as the film he most regrets missing out on. </p> <p>And behind the slightly stolid persona lies a turbulent childhood. He was born in Concord, California, in 1956, son of Amos and Janet Hanks. When he was five, his father - normally known as Bud - left his mother and took the kids with him. This was the start of a nomadic life with Bud, trying to make his way as a cook. Hanks lived in at least 10 towns as a child, and had two step-mothers and three step-fathers. He has claimed that he can't remember the names of some of the 11 or so step-siblings he had along the way. At one point he found himself being referred to as 'number eight'. </p> <p>However, the experience didn't traumatise the young Hanks. 'I liked a new school, a new neighbourhood. I wasn't worried about being the new kid on the block.' In time-honoured fashion, he ingratiated himself at his new schools by being the class clown. </p> <p>He did, however, adopt a strict moral code that could be seen as a reaction to the chaos. He was involved with Christian youth groups, and arrived at Chabot College a virgin for ideological reasons. He started acting in high school, when it became clear that he wasn't that good at sports. And it was to pursue acting that he dropped out of Chabot and moved to California State University at Sacramento. There he discovered girls, and dropped out when his girlfriend - soon to be wife - Samantha Lewes became pregnant. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he had started taking part in the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival. He continued appearing at the festival after leaving California State, and then headed off to New York. He made his big screen debut in a 1980 slasher movie called He Knows You're Alone. </p> <p>In so far as the Tom Hanks wild years existed, this was the time. He took coke - not excessively - and dropped in from time to time at the local Times Square porn dives. And then he got his first shot of stardom in the sitcom Bosom Buddies. It was typical of the dreadful TV comedy of the early Eighties, all situation and no comedy. The set-up has two young men trying to find a cheap place to live, and resorting to drag to get into a women-only hostel. It lasted two seasons, which was enough to establish Hanks's rubbery faced comedy skills. His next break came when he met Ron Howard, who invited him to audition for a supporting role in Splash!, and then reconsidered and made him a star. </p> <p>As the not excessively handsome, slightly bumbling and essentially likable hero of a romantic comedy, Hanks in Splash! had the template for much of his later success. But things didn't progress so smoothly from there. He had mixed success with the films he made in the Eighties, got divorced, and then on the set of Volunteers met his second wife, Rita Wilson. </p> <p>The second definitive Hanks film was Big (1988), the one where he plays a young boy temporarily inhabiting an adult's body. It began the split between the people who found Hanks charming - the larger group of film goers - and those who found him the essence of schmaltzy Hollywood. And yet Big was followed by more flops: Joe Versus The Volcano - which failed despite the first outing of the Meg Ryan-Hanks pairing - and The Bonfire Of The Vanities , when Hanks was catastrophically miscast as the nasty and ambitious Sherman McCoy. </p> <p>The fully formed Tom Hanks, the Everyman superstar with the rambling, over-emotional Oscar speeches, dates from 1993. That was the year he combined the romantic comedy success of Sleepless In Seattle with Philadelphia , his first big drama, for which he won an Oscar. It summed up something else about Hanks: although Hollywood insiders talked it up as a daring project - the first big Aids movie - the criticism came mainly from gay groups, unhappy with the sanitised, nonsexual saintliness of Hanks's character, rather than the Christian right. </p> <p>In fact, despite his financially generous support for the Democrats, Hanks has been frequently accused of being a reactionary. He is certainly a fervid patriot: that first Oscar speech concluded with 'God bless America'. And despite starring in the death row drama The Green Mile , he doesn't oppose the capital punishment. Then there is the awkward question of Forrest Gump (for which he picked up the second Oscar), seen by some as a wholesale critique of the countercultural America. In fact, what Hanks is is a pre-Vietnam liberal - one of his sons is even named Truman - unhappy to see the country in the hands of either Nixon or Abbie Hoffman, the Bush family or the philandering Bill Clinton, who he regretted giving money to. </p> <p>Cast Away - in which Hanks is alone on screen for 75 minutes - is something of an attempt by Hanks to stretch himself as an actor; he thought up the idea of the film, and nurtured it into existence. But he knows that the men he is most often compared to - pillars of decency such as Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda - took big risks later in their careers: you can't stake a claim to greatness simply by reassuring people. </p> <p>Which begs the question, is Hanks ready to do anything as ambitious as Vertigo or Rear Window ? Would he be willing to be seen on screen gunning down a little boy (Fonda in Once Upon A Time In The West)? Hanks's only real competitor for the title of the world's biggest film star - Tom Cruise - has shown an increasing daring with Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia. </p> <p>Hanks finally looks willing to give it a try. His next role is in Road To Perdition, a revenge thriller set in the Thirties and directed by Sam Mendes. Hanks will play a hitman known as the Angel Of Death. Hanks is still the hero - his character is out to deal with the men who have killed his wife and son - but this hero is nevertheless a cold blooded murderer. On paper, it is the most adventurous move of his career. </p> <p>The question is whether he has the guts to make the film as tough as the plot outline suggests. If it is, it would be a Tom Hanks film the truck drivers could watch without shame - along with those of us who don't believe America ever had an innocence to lose. </p> <p><strong> Tom Hanks</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB:</strong> 9 July 1956, California </p> <p><strong> Married to: </strong> Rita Wilson (two children); two children from previous marriage </p> <p><strong> Forebear: </strong> Direct descendant of Nancy Hanks, Abraham Lincoln's mother </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Skyline high school, Oakland, California; California State University </p> <p><strong> Film debut: </strong> He Knows You're Alone (1980) </p> <p><strong> Oscars: </strong> Philadelphia, Forrest Gump</p>",

The disclosure, which will cause acute embarrassment to London's Metropolitan Police, is contained in a confidential staff survey. More than 56 per cent of employees reported that 'people are treated differently in the Metropolitan Police according to their ethnicity' - almost two years after an independent report found evidence of institutional racism in the force. Ahead of a week of intense controversy about the issues of race and crime - reports out on Thursday will reveal the 'ethnicity' of drug offenders and the numbers of black people in jail - confirmation that the Met is racist will fuel the debate about endemic racial problems in Britain's police. In another blow to the Government, crime figures out on Tuesday are expected to show a rise in violent crime, undermining Labour's claim to be 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime'. Police advisers on race expect the Met results to be reflected around the country. Cultural audits are being carried out in police forces nationwide to test their acceptance of minority groups. Sergeant Ravi Chand, chair of the National Black Police Association, said: 'I've never known a time when we've had so many black and Asian police staff taking their forces to industrial tribunals across the country.

      "body": "<p>On a recent South Bank Show, the artist Marlene Dumas, touching on the thorny topic of relationships, observed that many young people today are 'so sensitive that they seem to be allergic to each other'. Watching Jamie Thraves's debut feature film, The Low Down, you cannot help feeling Dumas may have a point. If, as some reviewers have suggested, The Low Down is a portrait of a generation, it is a singularly undynamic one; where once we had angry young men parading their pent-up frustrations about class and identity, we now have moping late twentysomethings fretting about their career trajectories and imminent mortgage payments.</p> <p>The film tracks the meandering fortunes of Frank (Aidan Gillen), a gauche and inarticulate prop-maker with vague artistic ambitions who moves - at times as if sleepwalking - through a social and romantic obstacle course all of his own making. Frank is not so much insecure as almost inert, confused to the point of paralysis by his sudden urge to own a flat, and by the appearance of the beautiful and relatively carefree Ruby (played to perfection by Kate Ashfield) in his life. Down these mean streets, I guess, a modern man must go, but, unsurprisingly, these personal traumas do not make for comfortable or particularly dramatic viewing. It is to Thraves's credit, then, that he has crafted a small but curiously hypnotic film that, in a wealth of incidental detail, becomes much more than the sum of its wilfully meandering parts. </p> <p>'I never wanted to make a slow film,' Thraves explains, choosing his words with a caution that suggests he might well share his character's unwillingness to be pinned down, 'simply one that was light and funny and observational. There are bits of information in every scene which, if I have done my job right, should add up to a portrait of someone almost paralysed by low-level anxiety. I suppose the film's message is more in the gestures, in the things that aren't said. But,' he adds, looking visibly pained, 'I can see why that might be seen as a bit wanky.' </p> <p>If Thraves has an abiding theme, it is the insecurity and inarticulateness of his contemporaries, as well as their lack of anything tangible to rebel against. On one level, he provides a very English variation on the American 'slacker' ideal, except here it is not so much an attitude as an unregistered collective dilemma. This is not so much a Zeitgeist film as one that highlights the lack of a Zeitgeist. There is, though, a shambling, stilted naturalism on display that has struck a chord with the late twenty/ early-thirtysomething festival audiences who obviously recognise traces of their own hazy, uncertain adult lives. </p> <p>How much you like the film may well depend on how much you sympathise with the characters - most of whom are, it has to be said, pretty unlikeable - and how much time and energy you want to invest in what at another time would have been called their petit bourgeois predicaments. Ironically, given that it lays bare the neuroses of a particular generation, this is a film that may well divide audiences along generational lines: the two people I know who have hailed the film as a small masterpiece are both roughly the same age as Thraves, who is 31; older viewers of my acquaintance have been less kind, one mid-thirtysomething dismissing it as 'self-obsessed and self-indulgent'. Whatever, it certainly says something truthful about its subjects, about their suppressed desires, dreams and longings. </p> <p>'There is definitely a sense of suppression in the film that, I suppose, is crucial to understanding it,' says Thraves. 'Even in Frank's sexuality; you're never quite sure if he's enjoying being with this beautiful girl. There's the sense that he has given up slightly - which is ironic because when I was writing it, I didn't feel I was a good enough writer. In many ways, I felt I was drowning this character in order to stay afloat.' </p> <p>Despite, or maybe because of its skewed narrative and dysfunctional characters, The Low Down is unique among recent British films insofar as it pertains to the tug and sway of real life, the messiness and myriad unresolved narratives of everyday existence. It's as far away from the current vogue for faux gangster chic and souped-up kitchen sink dramas as it is possible to go without making an all-out art-house movie. That said, as well as The Sopranos, Seinfeld and The Larry Sanders Show, Thraves namechecks Godard and Fellini as formative influences. 'They're not conscious presences but I am drawn to that expressive style of storytelling. I tend to shy away from the idea of the traditional narrative, but there is a story there. You just have to look for it a bit more closely.' </p> <p>There are certainly echoes of early Godard in the seemingly random vignettes used to map out Frank's singularly unexciting life and, in certain key scenes, echoes of Cassavetes's claustrophobic human conflicts wherein no one ever says what it is exactly that makes them so physically pent-up, so emotionally dislocated. It is difficult, at times, to know whether Frank's inability to articulate his feelings feeds his anxiety or vice versa. </p> <p>'That's something I wasn't quite sure of myself,' admits Thraves, 'but in the end it doesn't seem to matter. There's an anxiety in Frank that feeds on itself and makes every decision he makes bigger than it needs to be. Five Easy Pieces [directed by Bob Rafelson, starring a young Jack Nicholson] was a definite influence; that whole idea of someone who's really talented but thinks he's not good enough.

      "bodyText": "On a recent South Bank Show, the artist Marlene Dumas, touching on the thorny topic of relationships, observed that many young people today are 'so sensitive that they seem to be allergic to each other'. Watching Jamie Thraves's debut feature film, The Low Down, you cannot help feeling Dumas may have a point. If, as some reviewers have suggested, The Low Down is a portrait of a generation, it is a singularly undynamic one; where once we had angry young men parading their pent-up frustrations about class and identity, we now have moping late twentysomethings fretting about their career trajectories and imminent mortgage payments. The film tracks the meandering fortunes of Frank (Aidan Gillen), a gauche and inarticulate prop-maker with vague artistic ambitions who moves - at times as if sleepwalking - through a social and romantic obstacle course all of his own making. Frank is not so much insecure as almost inert, confused to the point of paralysis by his sudden urge to own a flat, and by the appearance of the beautiful and relatively carefree Ruby (played to perfection by Kate Ashfield) in his life. Down these mean streets, I guess, a modern man must go, but, unsurprisingly, these personal traumas do not make for comfortable or particularly dramatic viewing.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you have never actually read the Marquis de Sade, you might not know that he layered beatings, deflowerings and buggery with long stretches of philosophy: the Marquis wanted to enlighten his readers as well as turn them on. </p> <p>Which is why it seems so appropriate that the fascinating new film about De Sade, Quills, should be directed by Philip Kaufman. Kaufman, on the evidence of his sprawling, erotically-charged epics The Unbearable Lightness Of Being and Henry And June, is a man interested in the places where serious art, the politics of liberation and lots of sex coincide. In short, you could call him the highbrow sex guy. </p> <p>Kaufman chuckles. 'The highbrow sex guy! I think my wife enjoys me being the sex guy. She gets a laugh out of that - and we've been married over 40 years. </p> <p>'I only do films that interest me, and I'm interested in sex. Everybody is interested in sex. I would like to see more sex movies, not with slapstick sex, but explorations of sexuality and ambiguity of sexuality. But I never go about a movie saying I'm going to make a \"sex movie\".' </p> <p>Sex is a major part of Quills, a flamboyant black comedy about the last days of the Marquis. Set in the feverish atmosphere of the Charenton asylum, it has a brilliantly unrestrained and occasionally naked Geoffrey Rush as De Sade, Michael Caine as his persecutor, Joaquin Phoenix as an idealistic priest and Kate Winslet as a buxom laundrymaid. It is very funny, very theatrical and enjoyably lurid. </p> <p>And despite being openly provocative it has featured heavily in US end-of-year polls, picked up Best Film at the prestigious National Board Of Review awards, and Rush looks a good bet for an Oscar nomination. </p> <p>But all that has happened since I spoke to Kaufman. Then he was still anxious about the way it was going to be received. 'Disney movies are always advertised as \"films for children of all ages\". I would say this film is definitely not for children of all ages, not even for grown-ups who are looking for the Hollywood ending.' </p> <p>He worries whether audiences these days are too literal, whether they can only accept people doing fantastical things in movies if they talk in an everyday way. In Quills, which embraces its origins as a play (by Doug Wright), the dialogue is theatrical; the performances, like the extra-large sets, are not meant to be lifesize. And it isn't intended as a historical account of the Marquis de Sade. 'By the end,' Kaufman explains in a deep, slow voice, 'the actual boring biopic approach has been forsaken, and in a way it's as though the Marquis has been brought to his end by a character who has risen out of his own literature, the perfect Sadean hero, the hypocrite who acts like he is doing good but will behave in the most abominable way. I wanted the film to have certain Grand Guignol qualities because he was a writer, he was a director, his life was about storytelling, about myths.' </p> <p>On the day we met, Kaufman could have been forgiven for not wanting to talk about films, sex or anything else. He had had food poisoning, and hadn't eaten in two days. But sitting back on a plump sofa at the Dorchester Hotel in London, he seemed to be enjoying himself. He has a decadent elegance to him, very much a match with his films. At 64, the longish hair and trimmed beard are mainly grey. Chicago-born, he has spent nearly four decades living in bohemian San Francisco. </p> <p>For a well-known director, Kaufman doesn't make a lot of films: Quills is only his fifth since 1980. This isn't due to any Kubrick-like perfectionism, he claims, it's just that the people with the money won't let him make the films he wants to make. 'Sometimes you get to the point where the producers say to you, \"you can make it, but only if you get one of four stars\". I've had that happen.' </p> <p>Kaufman doesn't much like working with stars, especially American stars. 'There is a certain spoilt quality about them. They get used to living like millionaires, and acting like millionaires, and there is often a lot of bad behaviour associated with money.' Kate Winslet, Kaufman allows, is an exception and he gratefully acknowledges that her presence in the film was the main reason Quills made it to the screen. </p> <p>Kaufman isn't one of those film-makers who always wanted to be a director, not a Spielberg type, making ambitious short films when other kids were in the playground. He studied history at the University of Chicago, tried Harvard Law School, dropped out, and went back to study more history. It shows in his early films, which examine American history and its big myths: The Great Minnesota Raid (1972), which told the story of Jesse James; The White Dawn (1974), about whaling; The Wanderers (1979) and The Right Stuff (1983). He also wrote the script for Clint Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976). 'I was thinking of being a history professor at one point, and I thought I could redo history the way it might have been.' He revisited a modern American myth in his 1978 remake of the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, and helped create one by working on the story for Raiders Of The Lost Ark. </p> <p>It was in Europe in the early Sixties, teaching English and trying to be a writer, that he decided he wanted to make films. 'I was really inspired by European films. I loved American movies but round the time I lived in Europe in the early Sixties you had the new wave. So I went back inspired by Godard and Truffaut.' </p> <p> His first film, Goldstein, released in 1965, picked up a prize in Cannes and the praise of Jean Renoir, who said it was the 'best American film I have seen in 20 years'. And his reputation was transformed when he found his way back to Europe in 1988 with The Unbearable Lightness Of Being. Its author, Milan Kundera, was at the peak of his reputation, as was the film's male star, Daniel Day-Lewis. And the film made Juliette Binoche's name for an international audience. </p> <p>Already in his fifties, Kaufman was abruptly immensely hip. The film he made on the back of that breakthrough, Henry And June, gained notoriety rather than critical acclaim. The plentiful sex, including lesbian scenes, caused the film to run into trouble with the US ratings board. The fight over its release eventually led to the creation of a whole new ratings category in the US, the No-Children Under 17 (NC-17). 'Blockbuster [the video rental chain] to this day refuses to stock Henry And June in the US, even though they do porno films, which are not rated,' Kaufman notes. 'Hypocrisy: that's what I like about the Marquis de Sade - he railed against hypocrisy.' </p> <p>Greil Marcus, a long-time Kaufman supporter, describes Quills as 'a horror movie about the Rights Of Man'. Kaufman nods. 'It is about freedom of expression. That's our First Amendment. You'd think the kind of conservatives who've criticised Quills would be the first to defend the Constitution.'</p> <p>\u0095 Quills is released on Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you have never actually read the Marquis de Sade, you might not know that he layered beatings, deflowerings and buggery with long stretches of philosophy: the Marquis wanted to enlighten his readers as well as turn them on. Which is why it seems so appropriate that the fascinating new film about De Sade, Quills, should be directed by Philip Kaufman. Kaufman, on the evidence of his sprawling, erotically-charged epics The Unbearable Lightness Of Being and Henry And June, is a man interested in the places where serious art, the politics of liberation and lots of sex coincide. In short, you could call him the highbrow sex guy. Kaufman chuckles. 'The highbrow sex guy! I think my wife enjoys me being the sex guy. She gets a laugh out of that - and we've been married over 40 years. 'I only do films that interest me, and I'm interested in sex. Everybody is interested in sex. I would like to see more sex movies, not with slapstick sex, but explorations of sexuality and ambiguity of sexuality. But I never go about a movie saying I'm going to make a \"sex movie\".' Sex is a major part of Quills, a flamboyant black comedy about the last days of the Marquis. Set in the feverish atmosphere of the Charenton asylum, it has a brilliantly unrestrained and occasionally naked Geoffrey Rush as De Sade, Michael Caine as his persecutor, Joaquin Phoenix as an idealistic priest and Kate Winslet as a buxom laundrymaid. It is very funny, very theatrical and enjoyably lurid. And despite being openly provocative it has featured heavily in US end-of-year polls, picked up Best Film at the prestigious National Board Of Review awards, and Rush looks a good bet for an Oscar nomination. But all that has happened since I spoke to Kaufman. Then he was still anxious about the way it was going to be received. 'Disney movies are always advertised as \"films for children of all ages\". I would say this film is definitely not for children of all ages, not even for grown-ups who are looking for the Hollywood ending.' He worries whether audiences these days are too literal, whether they can only accept people doing fantastical things in movies if they talk in an everyday way. In Quills, which embraces its origins as a play (by Doug Wright), the dialogue is theatrical; the performances, like the extra-large sets, are not meant to be lifesize. And it isn't intended as a historical account of the Marquis de Sade. 'By the end,' Kaufman explains in a deep, slow voice, 'the actual boring biopic approach has been forsaken, and in a way it's as though the Marquis has been brought to his end by a character who has risen out of his own literature, the perfect Sadean hero, the hypocrite who acts like he is doing good but will behave in the most abominable way. I wanted the film to have certain Grand Guignol qualities because he was a writer, he was a director, his life was about storytelling, about myths.' On the day we met, Kaufman could have been forgiven for not wanting to talk about films, sex or anything else. He had had food poisoning, and hadn't eaten in two days. But sitting back on a plump sofa at the Dorchester Hotel in London, he seemed to be enjoying himself. He has a decadent elegance to him, very much a match with his films. At 64, the longish hair and trimmed beard are mainly grey. Chicago-born, he has spent nearly four decades living in bohemian San Francisco. For a well-known director, Kaufman doesn't make a lot of films: Quills is only his fifth since 1980. This isn't due to any Kubrick-like perfectionism, he claims, it's just that the people with the money won't let him make the films he wants to make. 'Sometimes you get to the point where the producers say to you, \"you can make it, but only if you get one of four stars\". I've had that happen.' Kaufman doesn't much like working with stars, especially American stars. 'There is a certain spoilt quality about them. They get used to living like millionaires, and acting like millionaires, and there is often a lot of bad behaviour associated with money.' Kate Winslet, Kaufman allows, is an exception and he gratefully acknowledges that her presence in the film was the main reason Quills made it to the screen. Kaufman isn't one of those film-makers who always wanted to be a director, not a Spielberg type, making ambitious short films when other kids were in the playground. He studied history at the University of Chicago, tried Harvard Law School, dropped out, and went back to study more history. It shows in his early films, which examine American history and its big myths: The Great Minnesota Raid (1972), which told the story of Jesse James; The White Dawn (1974), about whaling; The Wanderers (1979) and The Right Stuff (1983). He also wrote the script for Clint Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976). 'I was thinking of being a history professor at one point, and I thought I could redo history the way it might have been.' He revisited a modern American myth in his 1978 remake of the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, and helped create one by working on the story for Raiders Of The Lost Ark. It was in Europe in the early Sixties, teaching English and trying to be a writer, that he decided he wanted to make films. 'I was really inspired by European films. I loved American movies but round the time I lived in Europe in the early Sixties you had the new wave. So I went back inspired by Godard and Truffaut.' His first film, Goldstein, released in 1965, picked up a prize in Cannes and the praise of Jean Renoir, who said it was the 'best American film I have seen in 20 years'. And his reputation was transformed when he found his way back to Europe in 1988 with The Unbearable Lightness Of Being. Its author, Milan Kundera, was at the peak of his reputation, as was the film's male star, Daniel Day-Lewis. And the film made Juliette Binoche's name for an international audience. Already in his fifties, Kaufman was abruptly immensely hip. The film he made on the back of that breakthrough, Henry And June, gained notoriety rather than critical acclaim. The plentiful sex, including lesbian scenes, caused the film to run into trouble with the US ratings board. The fight over its release eventually led to the creation of a whole new ratings category in the US, the No-Children Under 17 (NC-17). 'Blockbuster [the video rental chain] to this day refuses to stock Henry And June in the US, even though they do porno films, which are not rated,' Kaufman notes. 'Hypocrisy: that's what I like about the Marquis de Sade - he railed against hypocrisy.' Greil Marcus, a long-time Kaufman supporter, describes Quills as 'a horror movie about the Rights Of Man'. Kaufman nods. 'It is about freedom of expression. That's our First Amendment. You'd think the kind of conservatives who've criticised Quills would be the first to defend the Constitution.' \u0095 Quills is released on Friday.",

      "body": "<p>A little over eight years ago, on Saturday 9 January 1993, Jean-Claude Romand murdered his wife, his two children, his father and his mother.

What you have done is not in my eyes the deed of a common criminal, or that of a madman, either, but the action of someone pushed to the limit by overwhelming forces, and it is these terrible forces I would like to show at work.' </p> <p>So began a period of seven years in which the writer, Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, continued to be haunted by Romand's crime. He wasn't sure what drew him to it, and that was what made the book that eventually became The Adversary so hard to write. The question of what was pushing him 'to want to tell such a monstrous story' was one which frequently troubled him and made him very uneasy. In any case, he received no reply from Romand, so he translated his obsession into a novel, Class Trip, an eerie tale of a nervous child and his overactive, or perhaps all too correct, imagination. </p> <p>The plot is nothing like Romand's story, and yet, says Carr\u00e8re, Class Trip and The Adversary are 'blood relations'. Class Trip was a huge critical and popular success, and two years later, long after Carr\u00e8re thought he had got Romand out of his system, the prisoner sent him a letter. Purely by chance, Romand had read Class Trip, and had recognised his own childhood in it. The writer and the murderer embarked on a long correspondence. </p> <p>Carr\u00e8re lives in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, between the bourgeois delights of the Grands Boulevards and the seamy trendiness of Pigalle and the Moulin Rouge. He lives in a spare, sunlit apartment and appears to be, at first sight, the wrong person. Expecting a tortured 42-year-old, I am greeted by a sprightly student lookalike, a straight, boyish, floppy-fringed man who speaks in a fast stream of extraordinary articulacy. </p> <p>The reason you might expect someone else is that The Adversary is not just an account of a murder in the 'true crime' genre. Carr\u00e8re had initially planned to write it like that, to construct his own In Cold Blood out of this minor news item. But he found that to 'erase' himself from the narrative as Truman Capote had done was 'dishonest'. He had to deal with his obsession with the murder, and give an account, as he puts it, 'of my relationship to this story - my impressions, my hypotheses, my doubts, my anxieties'. In order to be truly honest, in other words, he had to implicate himself. </p> <p>Jean-Claude Romand started lying in his second year of medical school. Or perhaps it was earlier than that, though 'lying' is not what he would have called it. He grew up in a family which placed a great deal of emphasis on honesty, and yet white lies were common currency - emotions were dangerous, and harsh truths might hurt. But at medical school something more serious was set in motion. He was dumped by his girlfriend, Florence, and, depressed, he failed to turn up for his end-of-year exams. He had the whole summer to admit this, but he said the exams had gone well. And when the results were posted up, he told his parents and friends that he had passed. None of the other students noticed this wasn't true. For the next 12 years he enrolled in the second year over and over again, while reading the same books his friends were studying and pretending to graduate alongside them. Academically, he could proceed no further, but again, no one suspected anything. </p> <p>At some point, love-sick over Florence, he told people he had cancer. She came back to him immediately, but none of his doctor friends thought to inquire further about his illness. Later the couple were married, Florence passed her thesis in pharmacology, and Romand invented for himself a high-flying job. </p> <p>They had two children, and moved, along with some of their university friends, to a town near the border with Switzerland. Romand had to be there because he was, he said, a research scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva. In fact he spent his days alone in his car, reading books and magazines and spent nights in hotels when he thought it was appropriate to be away on business. He did go to the WHO sometimes, and roamed the ground floor, where he took money out of the cashpoints, posted his letters and booked holidays through the WHO travel agent. He never ventured upstairs to the offices, but he stole stationery and bits and pieces of WHO-branded equipment. He even got hold of a photograph of the building, which he gave to his parents to put on their wall, marking it with a red 'X' to indicate where his office was. </p> <p>But what, you may wonder, did the Romand family live off? This is where his lies turned to petty crime. He told people that due to his privileged professional position he could invest their money in high-interest accounts. His parents and his uncle Claude gave him their savings, amounting to tens of thousands of francs. Then came Florence's parents: a retirement bonus of 400,000 francs plus a million francs from the sale of their house. Florence's uncle was diagnosed with cancer, and Romand said he was developing a miracle cure that was at an experimental stage and naturally very expensive. He procured for him several doses of a Fr15,000 placebo. </p> <p>Years later, Romand began an affair and persuaded his mistress to give him Fr900,000. No one ever saw their cash again. Florence's father wanted some to buy a car: he died of a fall two weeks later, when Romand was alone in the house with him (Romand was not charged with his murder, and when it came up at the trial, he insisted it was an accident). Corinne, his mistress, asked him for her money back, and there was nothing he could do. The truth was closing in on him. A week later all his family were dead. </p> <p>'I think that he wanted to be found out,' Carr\u00e8re suggests during our interview. 'I think he felt trapped, and that it would have been a great relief to him to be discovered. At each stage the consequences became greater. At the beginning it was a little lie, then his wife might have asked for a divorce; later, because of his dodgy financial dealings, he might have had a brief stint in prison. But nothing more than that. And it never happened. His luck was his terrible misfortune.' </p> <p>First Corinne wanted her money. Then someone from the board of his children's school tried to get hold of Romand at work and found no trace of him. A woman whose husband worked at the WHO asked Florence if she was taking her children to the office Christmas party, of which Florence, understandably, knew nothing. For 10 years, Romand's wife never called him at work or looked at the statements of their joint bank account. And yet, in the end, all it took was a few phone calls to reveal the truth. But, says Carr\u00e8re: 'He thought it was preferable that his family should die than that they should suffer from the knowledge of the truth about him.' </p> <p>Romand bought some jerry cans of petrol and some barbiturates for himself. He went to a gun shop and purchased a stun wand, two tear-gas canisters, a box of cartridges and silencer for a .22 calibre rifle. Then, trying to convince himself that these were presents for his father, he had them gift-wrapped. </p> <p>In the early morning of 9 January 1993, Romand battered his wife with a rolling pin, washed it and put it away. He covered her with a duvet and told the children she was asleep. He poured bowls of Coco Pops for Caroline and Antoine, and, after watching a video of The Three Little Pigs with them, he took them upstairs, one by one, and shot them. </p> <p>Then he drove to his parents' house, and after lunch he shot them too. His mother was the only one shot in the front - she saw her son murder her. </p> <p>That evening, Romand went up to Paris to see Corinne. He pretended they were going for dinner with a distinguished doctor, took her to the forest of Fontainebleau and tried to kill her in the car. She looked into his eyes and pleaded with him until he stopped. He drove home and spent the next day shut in with the bodies of his dead family. That night, just in time to be rescued by the rubbish collectors, he swallowed the barbiturates and set fire to the house. </p> <p> Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re sets up his involvement with Romand's story in such a way that it is tempting to think he imagines himself as the murderer's double. 'On the morning of Saturday January 9, 1993,' the book begins, 'while Jean-Claude Romand was killing his wife and children, I was with mine in a parent-teacher meeting at the school attended by Gabriel, our eldest son. He was five years old, the same age as Antoine Romand. Then we went to have lunch with my parents, as Jean-Claude Romand did with his, whom he killed after the meal.' </p> <p>Nothing more is made of this synchronicity, but later, following in the murderer's footsteps by means of hand-drawn maps Romand has sent him, Carr\u00e8re says he feels 'a painful sympathy' for Romand and his harboured secrets. </p> <p>Almost immediately afterwards he writes that he is 'ashamed', 'ashamed in front of my children', and he begins to think that writing about the story might in itself be a crime. To the question of what drew him to the case, he replies that what got to him was that 'the lie wasn't covering up anything else. We all know stories about people who lead double lives, but here there was no double life - hiding behind the lie was nothing but a total void. And I found echoes of that emptiness in my own life... I don't go to an office, no one knows exactly what I do - I am the only witness to my life, which was the case with Romand. </p> <p>'I spend days on my own staring at the ceiling, and he spent his days alone in his car. And I'd say that in that respect there was some kind of identification - I wanted to know what went through his head all those empty days he spent in his car.' Some might say that this form of identification was quite a leap of logic. One man spent empty days and ended up writing a number of books. The other's empty days added up to multiple murder. And yet the only allegiance Carr\u00e8re will admit to is this emptiness, and even then, at another point in our conversation, he strongly rejects the idea of any identification with the murderer. </p> <p>'There was no identification on my part,' Carr\u00e8re insists, 'but I think there might have been some kind of empathy.' </p> <p>What, I ask him, would he say was the difference between identification and empathy? 'Well,' Carr\u00e8re replies, 'I didn't put myself in his position. That's why to have written it in the first person from his point of view - and I've been asked if I considered this - would have been in the realm of obscenity. Part of the story is that this man never really had access to himself, in a way, and to say, I know the truth about you, to say \"I\" on his behalf, would have been not only a literary crime but also a moral crime.' </p> <p>Carr\u00e8re is very clear on this point. It was essential that The Adversary should never become a collaborative effort between writer and murderer. He went to see Romand in prison when he had finished the book and gave him a set of proofs - on one condition: 'I could not let him change anything - not even if he'd told me his car was green instead of blue - even the smallest factual change would convert it into his version, and that for me was completely impossible.' </p> <p>And yet, Romand had his own expectations of what the book would do for him. In a letter to Carr\u00e8re he wrote: 'A writer's approach to this tragedy can transcend other, more reductive visions', such as those of psychiatrists or lawyers. </p> <p>I ask Carr\u00e8re what he made of that. 'I think it was because a writer is disengaged from the task of judging him. I felt the responsibility he was attributing to me as a very heavy one - it was as if there was, on the one hand, the justice of men, from which he could no longer expect anything, and on the other hand divine justice, in which he believes and from which he therefore expects everything. And I thought that he imagined me in a strange position between the two.' </p> <p>At one point Carr\u00e8re surprises me by referring to Romand as 'a figure of Evil'. In the book he doesn't come across as someone who would believe in such absolutes, and yet when I press him on the subject he replies that he believes 'deeply' in Evil. But, I argue, Romand seemed, from his behaviour, to be psychotic. Does Carr\u00e8re really think someone suffering from a clinical condition can be accused of being evil? </p> <p>'Yes, I think psychosis is absolute Evil. That's not a moral condemnation - psychosis is hell on earth.' </p> <p>And from this it seems clear that Carr\u00e8re's sympathy, empathy, identification - whatever you may wish to call it - has evaporated. In his uncertain guilt and shame, Carr\u00e8re had waited a year after he finished the book before publishing it. And when it was eventually published, he says, he felt relieved. The book was a success (it is now being made into a film starring Daniel Auteuil), and he was released from a 'double-bind'. A relationship that had been two-way became three-way: himself, Romand, and the readers. It meant something to others, he was not alone; and now he is separate from Jean-Claude Romand, no longer his double or his shadow. Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, at least, has been freed. </p> <p> The Adversary is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a314.99. To buy it for \u00a311.99 call 0800 3168 171</p>",

      "bodyText": "A little over eight years ago, on Saturday 9 January 1993, Jean-Claude Romand murdered his wife, his two children, his father and his mother. Seven months later he received a letter. 'Monsieur,' it began, 'my proposal may well offend you... I am a writer, the author to date of seven books. Ever since reading about your case in the newspapers I have been haunted by the tragedy of which you were the agent and sole survivor. I would like to try to understand as much as possible of what happened and to make a book out of it... I am not approaching you out of some unhealthy curiosity or a taste for the sensational. What you have done is not in my eyes the deed of a common criminal, or that of a madman, either, but the action of someone pushed to the limit by overwhelming forces, and it is these terrible forces I would like to show at work.' So began a period of seven years in which the writer, Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, continued to be haunted by Romand's crime. He wasn't sure what drew him to it, and that was what made the book that eventually became The Adversary so hard to write. The question of what was pushing him 'to want to tell such a monstrous story' was one which frequently troubled him and made him very uneasy. In any case, he received no reply from Romand, so he translated his obsession into a novel, Class Trip, an eerie tale of a nervous child and his overactive, or perhaps all too correct, imagination. The plot is nothing like Romand's story, and yet, says Carr\u00e8re, Class Trip and The Adversary are 'blood relations'. Class Trip was a huge critical and popular success, and two years later, long after Carr\u00e8re thought he had got Romand out of his system, the prisoner sent him a letter. Purely by chance, Romand had read Class Trip, and had recognised his own childhood in it. The writer and the murderer embarked on a long correspondence. Carr\u00e8re lives in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, between the bourgeois delights of the Grands Boulevards and the seamy trendiness of Pigalle and the Moulin Rouge. He lives in a spare, sunlit apartment and appears to be, at first sight, the wrong person. Expecting a tortured 42-year-old, I am greeted by a sprightly student lookalike, a straight, boyish, floppy-fringed man who speaks in a fast stream of extraordinary articulacy. The reason you might expect someone else is that The Adversary is not just an account of a murder in the 'true crime' genre. Carr\u00e8re had initially planned to write it like that, to construct his own In Cold Blood out of this minor news item. But he found that to 'erase' himself from the narrative as Truman Capote had done was 'dishonest'. He had to deal with his obsession with the murder, and give an account, as he puts it, 'of my relationship to this story - my impressions, my hypotheses, my doubts, my anxieties'. In order to be truly honest, in other words, he had to implicate himself. Jean-Claude Romand started lying in his second year of medical school. Or perhaps it was earlier than that, though 'lying' is not what he would have called it. He grew up in a family which placed a great deal of emphasis on honesty, and yet white lies were common currency - emotions were dangerous, and harsh truths might hurt. But at medical school something more serious was set in motion. He was dumped by his girlfriend, Florence, and, depressed, he failed to turn up for his end-of-year exams. He had the whole summer to admit this, but he said the exams had gone well. And when the results were posted up, he told his parents and friends that he had passed. None of the other students noticed this wasn't true. For the next 12 years he enrolled in the second year over and over again, while reading the same books his friends were studying and pretending to graduate alongside them. Academically, he could proceed no further, but again, no one suspected anything. At some point, love-sick over Florence, he told people he had cancer. She came back to him immediately, but none of his doctor friends thought to inquire further about his illness. Later the couple were married, Florence passed her thesis in pharmacology, and Romand invented for himself a high-flying job. They had two children, and moved, along with some of their university friends, to a town near the border with Switzerland. Romand had to be there because he was, he said, a research scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva. In fact he spent his days alone in his car, reading books and magazines and spent nights in hotels when he thought it was appropriate to be away on business. He did go to the WHO sometimes, and roamed the ground floor, where he took money out of the cashpoints, posted his letters and booked holidays through the WHO travel agent. He never ventured upstairs to the offices, but he stole stationery and bits and pieces of WHO-branded equipment. He even got hold of a photograph of the building, which he gave to his parents to put on their wall, marking it with a red 'X' to indicate where his office was. But what, you may wonder, did the Romand family live off? This is where his lies turned to petty crime. He told people that due to his privileged professional position he could invest their money in high-interest accounts. His parents and his uncle Claude gave him their savings, amounting to tens of thousands of francs. Then came Florence's parents: a retirement bonus of 400,000 francs plus a million francs from the sale of their house. Florence's uncle was diagnosed with cancer, and Romand said he was developing a miracle cure that was at an experimental stage and naturally very expensive. He procured for him several doses of a Fr15,000 placebo. Years later, Romand began an affair and persuaded his mistress to give him Fr900,000. No one ever saw their cash again. Florence's father wanted some to buy a car: he died of a fall two weeks later, when Romand was alone in the house with him (Romand was not charged with his murder, and when it came up at the trial, he insisted it was an accident). Corinne, his mistress, asked him for her money back, and there was nothing he could do. The truth was closing in on him. A week later all his family were dead.

      "body": "<p>Cheer up Kevin Keegan. Paving the way for the first ever foreigner to coach England might not be the most desirable way to quit the international arena, but at least the pair of Swedes who have taken over the reins are confirmed Liverpool fans. </p> <p>Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and Tord Grip used their first joint press conference yesterday to talk about their visits to England 20 years ago, when Anfield was a magnet pulling them both. 'We have both liked English football for years, we were always coming over in winter from Sweden, and I think it's fair to say we were both Liverpool fans at that time,' said Grip, Eriksson's chosen assistant and former mentor. 'I liked Liverpool a lot then,' Eriksson agreed. 'Who didn't? I liked the easy way they played. One touch, two touches, simple but effective.' </p> <p>Liverpool have spent the past 10 years trying to rediscover that brilliant simplicity, even to the extent of appointing a foreign coach of their own. Grip, who watched them against Crystal Palace last week and was impressed with both sides in the Worthington Cup semi-final, is of the opinion that Liverpool are on their way back, though, of course, he could be biased. He is on much firmer ground with the assertion that in Steven Gerrard, Liverpool possess an England star of the future. </p> <p>Grip was disappointed Gerrard missed the last international in Turin, where Eriksson could have assessed the young midfielder's potential for himself, and cannot wait for the opportunity to renew his boss's acquaintance with Liverpool. </p> <p>'The first time I saw Gerrard was at Tottenham, when Liverpool lost,' Grip said. 'But you could see he was a real Liverpool player. He only needs one or two touches, he keeps things simple, he's athletic, good in the air and a good passer.' </p> <p>England's assistant coach was not quite as effusive about anyone else, though anyone worried he might only see things through a red perspective can rest assured. Grip, like Eriksson, was impressed with the spirit and confidence of Peter Taylor's young England in Italy last year, and has already picked out several promising players from outside the England set-up. </p> <p>He expressed frustration at not seeing enough of Arsenal's Ashley Cole, a player he regards as at least as good as Silvinho, and it is not too difficult to work out why he took Eriksson to watch West Ham on his first day in the job. </p> <p>'Michael Carrick, Trevor Sinclair and Joe Cole, West Ham have some good players to watch,' he said. Plus, as Eriksson broke in to point out, he badly needed to check up on the Sunderland left back, Michael Gray, whose identity had escaped him three months ago. </p> <p>Joking apart, Grip has been watching English football for most of that time, and confessed to being pleasantly surprised by the standard. 'It's different to Italy, but it won't be hard for Sven to adapt,' he said. 'There are good players at every club, even into the First Division. I saw Fulham and Crystal Palace last week, and I like the way they both play football.' </p> <p>Yes, but how many of their players are qualified to play football for England? 'Building a national team is something else,' Grip said. 'Because of the number of foreigners here you are often looking at taking just one or two players from a number of clubs, but it has always been the same. People imagine there used to be many more players available to England, but I'm not sure that's true. </p> <p>'How many players did the great Liverpool team of 20 years ago supply to England? Ian Rush, Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness, Alan Hansen were all great players, but they were all foreigners. In some ways international management in a country like Sweden can be easier, because a top club could have seven or eight players all qualified to play for their country. It tends to simplify things if you can basically pick the Gothenburg team with a few reinforcements.' </p> <p>Grip has been a manager in his own right - he was at Malmo for six years and beat Eriksson to a job with a national side when he was briefly in charge of Norway - but he would have been assistant coach at Lazio for longer than the past two years were it not for Italian regulations. </p> <p>'I always wanted Tord as my assistant in Italy, but the rules until recently stated any foreign coach had to have an Italian assistant,' Eriksson explained. 'As soon as the rules changed, I brought Tord out to Italy.' </p> <p>The pair took the Rome side to the title last season, but that success has quickly soured for Eriksson in the couple of months since his appointment as England manager. 'I don't suppose my new job helped,' he admitted. 'It certainly came up every time we lost a game. I would have to count the last couple of months as a failure. Some players were not happy with me, and when Lazio lose to Napoli at home, nobody is happy. That was certainly a failure. I had hoped to carry on longer, but I thought it best to make a stop. To give everybody a better chance. It is never a good situation when you break a contract, but I hope it was the right decision.' </p> <p>Eriksson is surely being hard on himself here. There is no evidence Lazio regard him so uncharitably, and in the fullness of time he will be seen to have been one of the club's most successful managers. Yet the new England manager has seen most things in football and is perfectly willing to discuss the bad as well as the good. 'I was sacked with two games to play at Roma,' he said. 'I knew I'd be going anyway because I didn't have the same ideas as the chairman about what to do for next season.' </p> <p>This most erudite of football men - 'I like to read in my spare time, and not just newspapers, sometimes even books' - surely also knows that failure and the England job go hand in hand. Six managers in 10 years tells its own story. 'It means you won't have had much consistency,' he said. 'How long will I stay? That's the one question I can't answer. It's down to results, as it is with any manager, and I just hope we can do a good job. You can't go into a job like this worrying about the future though. If I thought I was going to fail I would not be here. I'm here to take decisions to make the team better, that's the only thing that is important.' </p> <p>Apart from the next match, of course. Not the friendly against Spain at the end of next month, but the World Cup qualifier against Finland a fortnight later. 'You can look at our fixtures and say Germany away will be the toughest game, maybe even the key game,' Eriksson said. 'But the next game will always be the most important. If we don't win that, the rest of the fixtures might not really matter.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cheer up Kevin Keegan. Paving the way for the first ever foreigner to coach England might not be the most desirable way to quit the international arena, but at least the pair of Swedes who have taken over the reins are confirmed Liverpool fans. Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and Tord Grip used their first joint press conference yesterday to talk about their visits to England 20 years ago, when Anfield was a magnet pulling them both. 'We have both liked English football for years, we were always coming over in winter from Sweden, and I think it's fair to say we were both Liverpool fans at that time,' said Grip, Eriksson's chosen assistant and former mentor. 'I liked Liverpool a lot then,' Eriksson agreed. 'Who didn't? I liked the easy way they played. One touch, two touches, simple but effective.' Liverpool have spent the past 10 years trying to rediscover that brilliant simplicity, even to the extent of appointing a foreign coach of their own. Grip, who watched them against Crystal Palace last week and was impressed with both sides in the Worthington Cup semi-final, is of the opinion that Liverpool are on their way back, though, of course, he could be biased. He is on much firmer ground with the assertion that in Steven Gerrard, Liverpool possess an England star of the future. Grip was disappointed Gerrard missed the last international in Turin, where Eriksson could have assessed the young midfielder's potential for himself, and cannot wait for the opportunity to renew his boss's acquaintance with Liverpool. 'The first time I saw Gerrard was at Tottenham, when Liverpool lost,' Grip said. 'But you could see he was a real Liverpool player. He only needs one or two touches, he keeps things simple, he's athletic, good in the air and a good passer.' England's assistant coach was not quite as effusive about anyone else, though anyone worried he might only see things through a red perspective can rest assured. Grip, like Eriksson, was impressed with the spirit and confidence of Peter Taylor's young England in Italy last year, and has already picked out several promising players from outside the England set-up. He expressed frustration at not seeing enough of Arsenal's Ashley Cole, a player he regards as at least as good as Silvinho, and it is not too difficult to work out why he took Eriksson to watch West Ham on his first day in the job. 'Michael Carrick, Trevor Sinclair and Joe Cole, West Ham have some good players to watch,' he said. Plus, as Eriksson broke in to point out, he badly needed to check up on the Sunderland left back, Michael Gray, whose identity had escaped him three months ago. Joking apart, Grip has been watching English football for most of that time, and confessed to being pleasantly surprised by the standard. 'It's different to Italy, but it won't be hard for Sven to adapt,' he said. 'There are good players at every club, even into the First Division. I saw Fulham and Crystal Palace last week, and I like the way they both play football.' Yes, but how many of their players are qualified to play football for England? 'Building a national team is something else,' Grip said. 'Because of the number of foreigners here you are often looking at taking just one or two players from a number of clubs, but it has always been the same. People imagine there used to be many more players available to England, but I'm not sure that's true. 'How many players did the great Liverpool team of 20 years ago supply to England? Ian Rush, Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness, Alan Hansen were all great players, but they were all foreigners. In some ways international management in a country like Sweden can be easier, because a top club could have seven or eight players all qualified to play for their country. It tends to simplify things if you can basically pick the Gothenburg team with a few reinforcements.' Grip has been a manager in his own right - he was at Malmo for six years and beat Eriksson to a job with a national side when he was briefly in charge of Norway - but he would have been assistant coach at Lazio for longer than the past two years were it not for Italian regulations. 'I always wanted Tord as my assistant in Italy, but the rules until recently stated any foreign coach had to have an Italian assistant,' Eriksson explained. 'As soon as the rules changed, I brought Tord out to Italy.' The pair took the Rome side to the title last season, but that success has quickly soured for Eriksson in the couple of months since his appointment as England manager. 'I don't suppose my new job helped,' he admitted. 'It certainly came up every time we lost a game. I would have to count the last couple of months as a failure. Some players were not happy with me, and when Lazio lose to Napoli at home, nobody is happy. That was certainly a failure. I had hoped to carry on longer, but I thought it best to make a stop. To give everybody a better chance. It is never a good situation when you break a contract, but I hope it was the right decision.' Eriksson is surely being hard on himself here. There is no evidence Lazio regard him so uncharitably, and in the fullness of time he will be seen to have been one of the club's most successful managers. Yet the new England manager has seen most things in football and is perfectly willing to discuss the bad as well as the good. 'I was sacked with two games to play at Roma,' he said. 'I knew I'd be going anyway because I didn't have the same ideas as the chairman about what to do for next season.' This most erudite of football men - 'I like to read in my spare time, and not just newspapers, sometimes even books' - surely also knows that failure and the England job go hand in hand. Six managers in 10 years tells its own story. 'It means you won't have had much consistency,' he said. 'How long will I stay? That's the one question I can't answer. It's down to results, as it is with any manager, and I just hope we can do a good job. You can't go into a job like this worrying about the future though. If I thought I was going to fail I would not be here. I'm here to take decisions to make the team better, that's the only thing that is important.' Apart from the next match, of course. Not the friendly against Spain at the end of next month, but the World Cup qualifier against Finland a fortnight later. 'You can look at our fixtures and say Germany away will be the toughest game, maybe even the key game,' Eriksson said. 'But the next game will always be the most important. If we don't win that, the rest of the fixtures might not really matter.'",

      "body": "<p>You would think, wouldn't you, that a decent kitchen would be high on a cook's list of priorities. Yet mine is as lacking as it was when I moved in to my new place almost a year ago. Pushed aside by more urgent projects - central heating, roof repairs, getting the bones of the garden installed - the kitchen still awaits the fairy godmother's wand that will transform it from a chill galley to the throbbing pulse of my home. </p> <p>Instead of a fat larder and a well-worn table bearing the scars of a thousand happy meals, the most eye-catching details of my cooking space are the bulging plaster over the work counter, the condensation that runs down the walls every time I boil water for pasta, and a lack of heating that requires me to put the oven on to warm it up before I can lift so much as a wooden spoon. </p> <p>Yet everything changes once there is a pan on the stove.The frigid air warms, the cracks heal, the unworkable layout becomes insignificant as soon as steam rises from a cast-iron cooking pot. Make its content the warming, golden, maize-meal mush known as polenta, and I might as well be sitting in my own dream kitchen, a Labrador curled up in a basket by the Aga and a treacle-and-crumpets voice emanating seductively from the old Roberts radio. </p> <p>Food that steams and bubbles in quantity brings companionship to any space. Spooning dollops of amber polenta on to everyone's plate then passing the butter, the Gorgonzola dolce and the Parmesan round on a winter's day makes it all the more clear why our European ancestors preferred stodge to sushi. </p> <p>Starch-based slop - be it porridge, rice, polenta or mash - has long kept the wolf from the door in snow-bound Europe. (As I write, there is sleet at my windows and treacherous ice outside my door.) We may dress things up by stirring salt and butter into our oats or stock and Parmesan into our rice, or turn our mashed spuds into the luxurious aligot (the French potato, cheese and garlic pur\u00e9e), but it is still the steaming starch that lies at the heart of it all. </p> <p>Stirring a pan of polenta, you feel you have stepped back a thousand years, yet it is only a decade since the hip British cook learned to love this maize flour stirred to a thick paste with water and salt. I have taken to the traditional manner, that is, serving the coarse, sand-like mush hot from the pot one day (served aside something wet and sloppy like a stew), then letting it cool and frying it in thick slabs the next. Either way, it is supper at its most spiritually warming. </p> <p>Of the two main types of polenta flour, the coarse varieties or the finer 'quick-cook' version, it is the former that gets my vote. We are only talking about a few minutes either way - one takes about 15, the other 40 - but the difference is akin to that between proper pasta and a Pot Noodle. It is quite usual to stir the flour into boiling, heavily salted water, though you find old recipes which use milk or stock. I like the stock idea, but my broth is so precious that I invariably eat it by itself. </p> <p>The stirring, incidentally, is important, and I have given in to received wisdom here: a wire whisk will mix the grain and water easily and prevent any lumps forming. A wooden spoon can then take over to stir as it thickens. Wise words, but I prefer a flat wooden spatula, one with which I can get right into the corners, where the stuff is prone to hide and burn. A friend assures me that a clean pebble added to the pan will stop any sticking. But there is no way I'm going out into that freezing mud. I shall just stand and stir, soaking up the hot steam, thinking of doing something wild like taking off my thermals, or perhaps even doodling a kitchen design on the back of the gas bill.</p> <p><strong> Roast guinea fowl with mushrooms, sage and buttered polenta</strong><br> </p> <p>Every time I roast a guinea fowl, I ask myself why I don't do it more often, then I forget about it for another year. Silly, because it is a fine bird when cooked with care, with a mildly gamey flavour nicely poised between chicken and pheasant.

      "bodyText": "You would think, wouldn't you, that a decent kitchen would be high on a cook's list of priorities. Yet mine is as lacking as it was when I moved in to my new place almost a year ago. Pushed aside by more urgent projects - central heating, roof repairs, getting the bones of the garden installed - the kitchen still awaits the fairy godmother's wand that will transform it from a chill galley to the throbbing pulse of my home. Instead of a fat larder and a well-worn table bearing the scars of a thousand happy meals, the most eye-catching details of my cooking space are the bulging plaster over the work counter, the condensation that runs down the walls every time I boil water for pasta, and a lack of heating that requires me to put the oven on to warm it up before I can lift so much as a wooden spoon. Yet everything changes once there is a pan on the stove.The frigid air warms, the cracks heal, the unworkable layout becomes insignificant as soon as steam rises from a cast-iron cooking pot. Make its content the warming, golden, maize-meal mush known as polenta, and I might as well be sitting in my own dream kitchen, a Labrador curled up in a basket by the Aga and a treacle-and-crumpets voice emanating seductively from the old Roberts radio. Food that steams and bubbles in quantity brings companionship to any space. Spooning dollops of amber polenta on to everyone's plate then passing the butter, the Gorgonzola dolce and the Parmesan round on a winter's day makes it all the more clear why our European ancestors preferred stodge to sushi. Starch-based slop - be it porridge, rice, polenta or mash - has long kept the wolf from the door in snow-bound Europe. (As I write, there is sleet at my windows and treacherous ice outside my door.) We may dress things up by stirring salt and butter into our oats or stock and Parmesan into our rice, or turn our mashed spuds into the luxurious aligot (the French potato, cheese and garlic pur\u00e9e), but it is still the steaming starch that lies at the heart of it all. Stirring a pan of polenta, you feel you have stepped back a thousand years, yet it is only a decade since the hip British cook learned to love this maize flour stirred to a thick paste with water and salt. I have taken to the traditional manner, that is, serving the coarse, sand-like mush hot from the pot one day (served aside something wet and sloppy like a stew), then letting it cool and frying it in thick slabs the next. Either way, it is supper at its most spiritually warming. Of the two main types of polenta flour, the coarse varieties or the finer 'quick-cook' version, it is the former that gets my vote. We are only talking about a few minutes either way - one takes about 15, the other 40 - but the difference is akin to that between proper pasta and a Pot Noodle. It is quite usual to stir the flour into boiling, heavily salted water, though you find old recipes which use milk or stock. I like the stock idea, but my broth is so precious that I invariably eat it by itself. The stirring, incidentally, is important, and I have given in to received wisdom here: a wire whisk will mix the grain and water easily and prevent any lumps forming. A wooden spoon can then take over to stir as it thickens. Wise words, but I prefer a flat wooden spatula, one with which I can get right into the corners, where the stuff is prone to hide and burn. A friend assures me that a clean pebble added to the pan will stop any sticking. But there is no way I'm going out into that freezing mud. I shall just stand and stir, soaking up the hot steam, thinking of doing something wild like taking off my thermals, or perhaps even doodling a kitchen design on the back of the gas bill. Roast guinea fowl with mushrooms, sage and buttered polenta Every time I roast a guinea fowl, I ask myself why I don't do it more often, then I forget about it for another year. Silly, because it is a fine bird when cooked with care, with a mildly gamey flavour nicely poised between chicken and pheasant. I tend to serve it as a two-serving roast, then make a broth with the bones, stripping off any remaining meat and adding it to the soup with a little cooked pearl barley, some dry sherry and lots of chopped parsley. Serves 2-3, with plenty for seconds. 1 guinea fowl 2 bushy sprigs of sage 1 large onion olive oil 250g large chestnut mushrooms 1 large clove of garlic 2 wine glasses of red wine 1 wine glass of Madeira for the polenta 750ml water 150g polenta 50g butter Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6. Rinse and dry the bird, then season it all over, inside and out, with salt and black pepper. Stuff one of the sprigs of sage inside, along with a quarter of the onion. Peel the remaining onion and roughly chop it - the pieces can be quite large, this is a hearty dish - and let them cook in a couple of tablespoons of the oil in a sauteuse or frying pan set over a moderate flame. As the onion starts to colour (it should be a pale gold), then cut the mushrooms into quarters and add them to the onions, with the remaining sage leaves pulled from their stem, the garlic (peeled and sliced), and a good grinding of salt and pepper. Warm a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a roasting tin, place it over a high to moderate flame, and brown the guinea fowl all over. Put the bird in the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Now make the polenta. Put the water on to boil in a large pan. One with a heavy bottom will help stop the polenta burning.

Remove the bird and the onion and mushroom mixture and keep it warm (I put it in the switched- off oven). Put the roasting tin over a high heat, pour in the glass of Madeira and let it bubble a bit, stirring away at the pan and dissolving any sediment that has collected into the bubbling juices. Carve the guinea fowl, putting a little of the mushroom and onion on each plate with a spoonful of polenta, then drizzle over some of the juice. Grilled polenta with fontina and sage Serves 4 as a light lunch. 750ml water 150g polenta flour 150-200g fontina or other easy-melting cheese finely grated Parmesan a little chopped fresh rosemary or sage olive oil Bring the water to the boil in a deep, heavy-based pan. Salt it well then slowly pour in the polenta flour, whisking hard all the time, until the mixture starts to thicken. This will happen quickly, and as it does so, will start to erupt and splutter.

Along with her footballer husband Lee Chapman, Ash is the driving force behind three restaurants - a branch of Teatro in London and Leeds and now a third, in Clapham, south London, called SO.UK - which is either pronounced like an Arabian bazaar or, with the two parts separately, as in So Graham Norton . It occupies a site which was once Ms Ash's childhood home and was, until the restaurant took over, a really good painting and decorating shop.

Yes, of course they were; no, we didn't need to book and yes, we could bring children. So we turned up, laden with child-friendly paraphernalia, to find the bastard place was closed. Hence, for the benefit of Ms Ash, I now postulate Rayner's first law of the restaurant business: always make sure the doors to your establishment are unlocked when you say they will be, in case some uppity critic arrives and, finding himself excluded, declares in print that you are a bunch of incompetent shysters. </p> <p>The problem was I still needed to review somewhere, and this is where the regret kicks in.

Gastro is a beautiful little place, a wood-lined snug with a classic zinc bar and, at one end, a huge table where people eat communally. They recently knocked through to the next-door shop and that, too, is a grand piece of work: old-fashioned booths, wood panelling and a big tank of live lobsters. The staff are friendly and the simpler stuff on the menu has never let us down.

      "body": "<p>Just when global warming was soddenly self-evident, we had a big freeze and winter became a state of grace for a week. Incredible how you forget the wet and mud and the place becomes like a ski resort without the awful kitsch of skis and skiers. Then, overnight, the damp returned and it went from -13 C to shirtsleeve warm and the sky as grey as a vicar's suit. </p> <p>So back to preparing and making the most of the wet. When it comes to perennials, there are an awful lot of things that do well in mild, moist conditions, feeding the need for fast, lush growth. In a normal year, a border is too dry for them - except in the heaviest of ground and, by August, they are looking as exhausted and dehydrated as a marathon runner crossing the finish line. There is a fine line between true bog plants - such as Gunnera and Lysichiton americanus (the skunk cabbage, whose spathes spear up out of the April mud as brightly yellow as balancing bananas) and plants that merely do well when the ground is wetter than normal. </p> <p>If it is bog plants you are after, then you need more than a mere matter of irreversible global climatic change. You must create an environment that never dries out. A bog is really permanent mud and while it certainly feels that way here for weeks on end, come May there is every chance it will shift to dry soil and, by the end of summer, the ground may well be very dry indeed. So, the perennials that are likely to adapt best to the climatic shift must be those that are happiest with a substantial amount of wet locked into the soil, but able to cope with a couple of months of real dryness each summer. </p> <p>The good news is that there are a lot of perennials that like this sort of regime. Woody plants may make the permanent structure of a garden, but perennials make the living heart of it and should be valued as such. It is worth considering just what a perennial does and how it works. Perennials are defined primarily by having no woody growth or permanent structure. In the case of herbaceous perennials, the top growth dies back completely at the end of the season while the roots remain perfectly healthy, if largely dormant, below ground, before putting on vigorous new growth in spring - sometimes, as in a cardoon, to a phenomenal extent. </p> <p>Then there are others that maintain their foliage - such as bamboos or the Corsican hellebore - with new growth adding to it. In principle, a perennial goes on living from year to year, but in practice there is a huge range of life expectancy, from three or four years for the average lupin to a minimum of 20 years for a healthy peony. However long lived, most are extremely tolerant of being dug up, split, moved around and manhandled. This is what makes them so invaluable to any gardener. </p> <p>Assuming that your ground is not waterlogged or frozen solid, now is as good a time as any to rearrange the perennials in your garden and plant any new ones that you want - or have space for. Talking of new ones, it goes without saying that as you dig up a reasonable-sized plant, you should divide it and either create a separate new plant or replant the bits in a group, giving it much greater vigour and a much more dramatic grouping than a large singleton. It also goes without saying that any perennial will do better in ground that is weed-free and deeply dug with plenty of organic material added to the soil. Every ounce of effort and drop of sweat that you put into this will repay dividends from the first year. There is no bucking it. It is a once-only job and the single most important aspect of creating a good border. </p> <p>A good tip is to start covering the proposed site of a border with organic material over the months or even years before you start digging. Anything will do - weeds, straw, vegetable thinnings - and they do not even have to be composted, just chuck them on the ground 'raw' and they will rot down and be incorporated into the soil over the months in exactly the same way as a more conventional mulch will. It is not so much fertility that you are after - although that will help - but a decent soil structure. </p> <p>If you have a new garden with a new house, you are likely to have compacted soil as a result of the builders driving over and over it with fork-lift trucks. In this case, you must break through that compaction pan and dig the soil to at least a spade's depth. There is no easy solution to this and it will be horribly hard work. Don't whinge. Get stuck in. Better still, persuade someone else to stick in with you. Either way, what you want is soil that has enough body to retain moisture, but also enough drainage to stop it from becoming waterlogged. </p> <p>I have noticed in my own garden that plants such as ligularias really do not do well in a normal border with normal soil in anything but the wettest of summers. They look fantastic in a mixed border, but are not happy. So Ligularia dentata , L przewalskii , 'The Rocket' and 'Desdemona' have all gone into a wetter, sheltered bit of the garden, together with all our hostas, dug up from about six different locations around the garden. It is surprising how tolerant hostas are of bone-dry soil, but they much prefer it wet - especially if they are in the sun. </p> <p>I am strongly influenced in this new bit of planting by Jim Reynolds's garden, Butterstream, in Trim, County Meath. The first time I went, I was entranced by his huge beds of hostas, primulas and ferns growing in a winding stream. Of course, there were scores of other species - but it was the overall effect that came from the mass planting of a few strong plant groupings sharing the same growing conditions that was so dramatic. This is not something that can be learned from a book or even an article in a Sunday newspaper. Only the combination of talent, experience and instinct will get it right, and then probably just for a few blessed weeks of the year - but it is the attempt that is so satisfying, transcending the easy fiddle of safety-first gardening. </p> <p>But if you are going to plant on a large scale, you must either have the money to buy accordingly, or be patient, propagating as much as possible and dividing plants as they grow. The latter is not only cheaper but infinitely more fun. Actually, that is pious nonsense - it is a hell of a buzz to get a huge delivery of plants, costing hundreds of pounds, but not an option many of us choose, even if we will happily spend just as much on entertainment, soft furnishings and all the other impedimenta of a soft life. Plants seem to breed a particularly austere brand of puritanism, as though they were frivolous ephemera rather than the essential building blocks of a rich and satisfied life.

You know it makes sense. </p> <p>We tend to build borders with rising height - like a banked terrace of seats.

Savour those words - frost damage... music on the tongue. But the damage, in a distinctly unfrosty aftermath, is surprisingly fierce. Every cardoon and artichoke reduced to rags.

      "bodyText": "Just when global warming was soddenly self-evident, we had a big freeze and winter became a state of grace for a week. Incredible how you forget the wet and mud and the place becomes like a ski resort without the awful kitsch of skis and skiers. Then, overnight, the damp returned and it went from -13 C to shirtsleeve warm and the sky as grey as a vicar's suit. So back to preparing and making the most of the wet. When it comes to perennials, there are an awful lot of things that do well in mild, moist conditions, feeding the need for fast, lush growth. In a normal year, a border is too dry for them - except in the heaviest of ground and, by August, they are looking as exhausted and dehydrated as a marathon runner crossing the finish line. There is a fine line between true bog plants - such as Gunnera and Lysichiton americanus (the skunk cabbage, whose spathes spear up out of the April mud as brightly yellow as balancing bananas) and plants that merely do well when the ground is wetter than normal. If it is bog plants you are after, then you need more than a mere matter of irreversible global climatic change. You must create an environment that never dries out. A bog is really permanent mud and while it certainly feels that way here for weeks on end, come May there is every chance it will shift to dry soil and, by the end of summer, the ground may well be very dry indeed. So, the perennials that are likely to adapt best to the climatic shift must be those that are happiest with a substantial amount of wet locked into the soil, but able to cope with a couple of months of real dryness each summer. The good news is that there are a lot of perennials that like this sort of regime. Woody plants may make the permanent structure of a garden, but perennials make the living heart of it and should be valued as such. It is worth considering just what a perennial does and how it works. Perennials are defined primarily by having no woody growth or permanent structure. In the case of herbaceous perennials, the top growth dies back completely at the end of the season while the roots remain perfectly healthy, if largely dormant, below ground, before putting on vigorous new growth in spring - sometimes, as in a cardoon, to a phenomenal extent. Then there are others that maintain their foliage - such as bamboos or the Corsican hellebore - with new growth adding to it. In principle, a perennial goes on living from year to year, but in practice there is a huge range of life expectancy, from three or four years for the average lupin to a minimum of 20 years for a healthy peony. However long lived, most are extremely tolerant of being dug up, split, moved around and manhandled. This is what makes them so invaluable to any gardener. Assuming that your ground is not waterlogged or frozen solid, now is as good a time as any to rearrange the perennials in your garden and plant any new ones that you want - or have space for. Talking of new ones, it goes without saying that as you dig up a reasonable-sized plant, you should divide it and either create a separate new plant or replant the bits in a group, giving it much greater vigour and a much more dramatic grouping than a large singleton. It also goes without saying that any perennial will do better in ground that is weed-free and deeply dug with plenty of organic material added to the soil. Every ounce of effort and drop of sweat that you put into this will repay dividends from the first year. There is no bucking it. It is a once-only job and the single most important aspect of creating a good border. A good tip is to start covering the proposed site of a border with organic material over the months or even years before you start digging. Anything will do - weeds, straw, vegetable thinnings - and they do not even have to be composted, just chuck them on the ground 'raw' and they will rot down and be incorporated into the soil over the months in exactly the same way as a more conventional mulch will. It is not so much fertility that you are after - although that will help - but a decent soil structure. If you have a new garden with a new house, you are likely to have compacted soil as a result of the builders driving over and over it with fork-lift trucks. In this case, you must break through that compaction pan and dig the soil to at least a spade's depth. There is no easy solution to this and it will be horribly hard work. Don't whinge. Get stuck in. Better still, persuade someone else to stick in with you. Either way, what you want is soil that has enough body to retain moisture, but also enough drainage to stop it from becoming waterlogged.

'He has two fights left on his HBO contract in America, so there is room for negotiation.'</p> <p>Already chasing the signature of the Olympic super-heavyweight gold medallist Audley Harrison, the corporation seem serious in their plans to move back into big-time boxing. Having lost several other sports over the past couple of years - most calamitously Match of the Day for next season - the BBC know that boxing can revive their portfolio.</p> <p>Hamed was turning into one of British sport's major drawcards when he moved from ITV to Sky in 1995, attracting an audience of seven million for his last terrestrial bout. He later signed a concurrent six-fight deal with the American company, HBO, and went on to amass a fortune rumoured to be at least \u00a350 million.</p> <p>Now that Hamed has made his money, a move to the BBC - or even back to ITV - as his career enters its final stages would raise his domestic profile again. While Sky retain a hardcore boxing following, the satellite channel cannot hope to match the ratings of a terrestrial broadcaster.</p> <p>Hamed's audience on Sky is sometimes as low as 300,000. He rates well in America, but HBO's plans to air his next fight on pay-per-view have struck problems. Hamed, who gave up his WBO version of the world featherweight title in October because of boxing politics, was due to meet the charismatic Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera on 3 March in a much-anticipated contest for what the promoters would like to consider the linear title. But Evander Holyfield and John Ruiz meet in their heavyweight rematch that night.</p> <p>The Hamed-Barrera fight was also pencilled in for 7 April. But it seems likely now that Lennox Lewis will take that date, possibly against Mike Tyson.

      "bodyText": "The BBC have opened informal negotiations to bring Naseem Hamed back to terrestrial television. 'We have talked to Hamed's people,' a BBC insider said yesterday. 'He has two fights left on his HBO contract in America, so there is room for negotiation.' Already chasing the signature of the Olympic super-heavyweight gold medallist Audley Harrison, the corporation seem serious in their plans to move back into big-time boxing. Having lost several other sports over the past couple of years - most calamitously Match of the Day for next season - the BBC know that boxing can revive their portfolio. Hamed was turning into one of British sport's major drawcards when he moved from ITV to Sky in 1995, attracting an audience of seven million for his last terrestrial bout. He later signed a concurrent six-fight deal with the American company, HBO, and went on to amass a fortune rumoured to be at least \u00a350 million. Now that Hamed has made his money, a move to the BBC - or even back to ITV - as his career enters its final stages would raise his domestic profile again. While Sky retain a hardcore boxing following, the satellite channel cannot hope to match the ratings of a terrestrial broadcaster. Hamed's audience on Sky is sometimes as low as 300,000. He rates well in America, but HBO's plans to air his next fight on pay-per-view have struck problems. Hamed, who gave up his WBO version of the world featherweight title in October because of boxing politics, was due to meet the charismatic Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera on 3 March in a much-anticipated contest for what the promoters would like to consider the linear title. But Evander Holyfield and John Ruiz meet in their heavyweight rematch that night. The Hamed-Barrera fight was also pencilled in for 7 April. But it seems likely now that Lennox Lewis will take that date, possibly against Mike Tyson. (Reports on Friday that Lewis will fight Tyson in Malaysia on 3 March are fanciful and have subsequently been denied.) So, Hamed might yet fight on 3 March - but in Britain as part of a double-header with the American card. More likely, he will box later in the summer. Hamed, whose 16-fight reign as world champion fluctuated between brilliant and ordinary, needs a big fight to recapture his considerable British fan base. Barrera on BBC late in 2001 would be such an event - although HBO and Sky will have something to say about that. Lighter boxers may be more likely to sustain severe head injuries than their heavyweight counterparts according to the doctor, who performed emergency surgery on Paul Ingle. Robert Battersby, a consultant neurosurgeon at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, said professional boxing was a recipe for disaster and added that he is surprised the sport does not cause more serious injuries. Ingle was injured in the final round of his IBF featherweight defence against South Africa's Mbulelo Botile in Sheffield last month. He is making good progress following an operation to remove a blood clot from his brain, and the British Boxing Board of Control will continue their inquiry into the fight at the end of this month.",

      "body": "<p>'So, you want to talk about oil.' As understatements go, this one was worthy of a laconic Clint Eastwood. For the man sitting on the other side of a fruit-strewn table, dressed in a well cut three-piece suit, is none other than His Excellency Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, a man whose name is synonymous with black gold. </p> <p>It is late on Friday evening and Yamani is tired. He has flown in from his home in Saudi Arabia's seaside city, Jeddah, to address the Royal Institute of International Affairs on the future of the oil market. </p> <p>As ever he had barely spoken what was on his mind before his words were flashing around the world's newswires. The man who dominated the oil market as oil minister of Saudi Arabia in the Seventies is no longer a decision-maker at Opec, but he still has it in his power to captivate market traders, executives, politicians - even presidents - with his views. </p> <p>His presence in London comes at a fragile time for the world economy, as concerns mount that further jumps in the oil price could tip slowdown in to global recession. </p> <p>So, yes, we did want to talk about oil. </p> <p>As it happens Yamani does not believe that his commodity was directly responsible for the US economy putting on the brakes: 'The slowdown in the US cannot really be attributed to the high price of oil. The reason we have a problem now within the US economy is corporate earnings, which are shrinking.' </p> <p>However, he believes higher energy costs are a significant factor in slowing US corporate earnings: 'The corporates are paying more for their energy bills. It is not a direct reflection on industry - but it is on corporate earnings.' </p> <p>Against this backdrop he questions the wisdom of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries taking steps to shore up the price of oil by making cuts in production of up to 2 million barrels per day when it meets on Wednesday in Vienna. </p> <p>He believes increasing the price could worsen the economic situation in the US - with knock-on effects in the Far East and Europe - to the long-term detriment of producers, as industrialised nations seek other sources of oil, and of power. </p> <p>In this, he has remained consistent for 30 years: in the Seventies he was not persuaded of the benefits to Opec of hiking crude prices by the 400 per cent that came about in 1973. The importance of North Sea oil and the fall in Opec's contribution to global production, from 70 per cent to less than 30 per cent, are testimony to his wisdom. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Yamani is only too aware that Opec has the power to influence events in the current climate. He thinks there is a 50 per cent chance that Opec will follow Saudi Arabia's lead and agree to cuts of 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd). </p> <p>However he has made it clear that a cut now would be unwise, because Iraq has reduced its own production from around 1.2million bpd to around 600,000. </p> <p>Yamani is especially concerned about the hawkish role played by Venezuela since the arrival of Hugo Chavez as its President. Chavez and his Oil Minister - new Opec Secretary-General Ali Rodriguez - have galvanized the cartel over the past two years in a successful attempt to treble an oil price that had slumped to less than $10. He believes this policy derives from Venezuela's moves to cut investment in new production. </p> <p>'In Venezuela it is a new government with a new philosophy. When they came they stopped investment in upstream and the capacity of Venezuela came down. Instead of having 800,000 barrels a day surplus, it disappeared. Now it cannot produce any more [than it is currently].' </p> <p>Yamani believes that if hawkish tactics are employed, they will have seriously detrimental implications both for Venezuela and for Opec as a whole. </p> <p>'There are countries which want to extract every last barrel. They are part of a group who would like to have a higher oil price - Venezuela, Libya, Algeria and Iran.' </p> <p>As a result of pressures between these countries and 'core' states with huge reserves such as his own Saudi Arabia, he believes Opec itself may begin to unravel.He says candidly: 'Opec will be less in number.' </p> <p>By when? </p> <p>'Probably by the end of the decade. Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela will be there in future.' </p> <p>The sheikh says he does not miss the day-to-day cut and thrust that characterised the Seventies oil crisis. However, it is with a smile that he adds: 'When you deal with oil you have to take so many other things into consideration.' </p> <p>The suggestion is that politics, rather than economics, is the key. And the fascination of oil diplomacy clearly animates him more than the numbers, which he can rattle effortlessly off the top of his elegant head. </p> <p>The key political question in his mind now is the same as it was in 1973 - relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours. </p> <p>'It is very worrying,' he says. 'Barak is cornered. He brought back his Foreign Minister from Paris, met him in the airport and said \"Go and talk to the Palestinians.\" The man is desperate.' </p> <p>He singles out the period between 20 January, when President Clinton leaves office, and 6 February, the date of Israeli elections, as especially sensitive times, given recent Middle Eastern history. </p> <p>The implications for oil prices are unquantifiable. But Yamani ventures: 'Perhaps people will panic and think they have to buy oil.' </p> <p>However, he is at pains to point out that the global polit ical backdrop is now very different. </p> <p>His voice quickens further when he reminisces about the era of great oil diplomacy in the Seventies and his contemporary, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. </p> <p>At this point he makes an extraordinary claim: 'I am 100 per cent sure that the Americans were behind the increase in the price of oil. The oil companies were in in real trouble at that time, they had borrowed a lot of money and they needed a high oil price to save them.' </p> <p>He says he was convinced of this by the attitude of the Shah of Iran, who in one crucial day in 1974 moved from the Saudi view, that a hike would be dangerous to Opec because it would alienate the US, to advocating higher prices. </p> <p>'King Faisal sent me to the Shah of Iran, who said: \"Why are you against the increase in the price of oil? That is what they want? Ask Henry Kissinger - he is the one who wants a higher price\".' </p> <p>Yamani contends that proof of his long-held belief has recently emerged in the minutes of a secret meeting on a Swedish island, where UK and US officials determined to orchestrate a 400 per cent increase in the oil price. </p> <p>These extraordinary insights come as US/Opec relations once again return to the spotlight: President-elect George W Bush last week warned Opec of the implications of a price hike. </p> <p>When asked whether oil had proved to be a blessing or a curse for oil-producing countries, the Sheikh smiled enigmatically: 'I am worried about the future. If you get money so easily, you relax and you lose your muscles.' </p> <p>He believes that the oil age will end not for lack of oil, but because of technology. His concern for the long-term economic prospects of his people is clear. </p> <p>For him, that cut on Wednesday may be the first step in the wrong direction. </p> <p><strong>Fast facts</strong></p> <p> 'Yamani or your life,' cried one headline during the oil crises of the Seventies. That reflected Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani's role as the public face of the Opec oil-producer's cartel. </p> <p>Yamani was Saudi Oil Minister from 1962 to 1986. During that time he escaped the assassin who killed King Faisal, and survived kidnapping by Carlos 'The Jackal'. </p> <p>He now chairs the respected Centre for Global Energy Studies, famous for its exhaustive knowledge of world trends. He also runs the Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Centre in south London. </p> <p>Last year Yamani said that the oil prices were destined to crash in the long term and, the world would never use up the last drop of oil, because it would not need to: 'The Stone Age did not come to an end because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will not come to an end because we have a lack of oil.'</p>",

The warning, from the Saudi minister who was at the centre of the oil crisis in the Seventies, comes at a time of increasing tension between the West and the Opec cartel. The incoming Bush administration in the US and the European Union Energy Commissioner have warned of the impact of higher prices on Western economies. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Friday that production cuts would result in higher prices for US consumers. The EU cautioned: 'Producing nations should be extremely careful about cutting production, and should consult with countries that will feel the greatest impact.'

      "body": "<p>Paranoia is a great theme of Dennis Hopper's work, and his house is Paranoia Central. It must be one of the few houses in the world where you could be run over by a truck while sitting watching television. It is in Venice Beach, a notoriously dangerous part of Los Angeles, and designed as a fortress. It presents a blank, windowless wall to the street with entry via a steel door and you need to know a special code even to ring the doorbell. Inside, the compound consists of two artists' studios designed by Frank Gehry, which Hopper bought 18 years ago, and another building he added later, linked by steel walkways and stairs. The patio has a steel mesh roof in case anyone tries to lob a grenade in from the street. </p> <p>A maid lets me in through the steel door, into a sort of auditorium with a large broken sculpture on a stage. It is a Dennis Hopper work called Bomb Drop currently awaiting repair. The seats of the auditorium are all piled high with framed photographs, again by Dennis Hopper, and there is a hologram of a sinister man in silhouette (Dennis Hopper?) overlooking the stage. This auditorium leads into a hangar-like room which has a giant flat-screen television and furniture made of crinkled cardboard. Across the room are several sliding screens for storing paintings, and a steel staircase going up to a walkway above. On the walls all round there is a stunning collection of contemporary American art - an Andy Warhol Chairman Mao, a Basquiat, a Haring, a David Salle, a Julian Schnabel, a Cindy Sherman - several million dollars' worth of prime museum fodder housed in one of the highest-crime areas in the USA. </p> <p>A young woman introduces herself as Hopper's assistant and asks me to wait. An older woman in running shorts glides through the room and introduces herself as Hopper's mother-in-law. Next, a tiny childlike woman in jodhpurs and riding boots appears from nowhere and nervously introduces herself as Victoria - the current Mrs Dennis Hopper, the fifth. She says that she is sorry she can't stay but she is going to Topanga Canyon to train her horses. So saying, she walks to the far end of the room where a huge Land Cruiser is parked in the distant gloom, gets in and starts the engine. A steel wall rolls up, revealing a corridor of metal gates sliding open, and off she drives. It is an incongruously James Bondian exit for such a tiny, fragile-looking woman. </p> <p>After she has gone and the steel wall has clanged down again, I get seriously spooked. The acoustics of the house are most peculiar - the whole place clangs and throbs like a ship's engine room, there is a constant whispery static from the intercom, and voices and footsteps seem to advance and recede overhead, echoing along the steel walkways and pipes. It is a paranoiac's castle but it also seems designed to induce paranoia - sitting in this blind fortress, it is easy to imagine the Mad Max tanks rolling up the street with their battering rams poised, the advance troops of crazies throwing grappling hooks over the roof, the wirecutters and oxyacetylene torches getting stuck into the steel doors. </p> <p>By the time Dennis Hopper finally appeared, I was fully expecting some gibbering Blue Velvet character in a gasmask, and for a moment failed to recognise the small, neat elderly man (he is 64) in navy blue sweater and grey slacks. For the supposedly 'scariest man in Hollywood', he seemed disappointingly quiet. His assistant brought us tea but then he decided he wanted to do the interview upstairs, and led me up a clanking staircase across a walkway to another even stranger room, perched on a sort of ledge high up. It had a conventional Christmas tree and a rather kitsch cocktail bar with swirly coloured glasses -an incongruously sub-urban touch in this all-throbbing, all-clanging hi-tech setting. </p> <p>It took me a while to notice that there was a woman lying under a blanket on the sofa. Hopper sat down beside her and introduced her as his eldest daughter, Marin. She uttered a feeble 'Hi!' and said she had rung the doctor and was waiting for him to call back. She seemed to have flu, so I offered her an Anadin from my handbag. Marin examined it closely and asked me to name the ingredients. Of course I couldn't, so we both struggled to read the small print on the packaging. Luckily her doctor rang soon afterwards and Marin asked if it was OK to take Anadin, and he reassured her that it was. I suppose if you are Dennis Hopper's daughter, you are brought up to be wary of strangers bearing pharmaceutical gifts. </p> <p>It was distinctly odd trying to interview Hopper with his sick daughter lying on the sofa beside him. Once or twice, when I was asking about his drugs and his drinking and his failed marriages, I suggested that we might move elsewhere but he said no, it was fine. But when I got back to London there was a message saying, 'Delete all references to Marin.' No way, Jos\u00e9. He imposed Marin on me - we could have done the interview downstairs and I need never even have met her. Or she could have stayed in bed where she belonged. Actually, she perked up after a bit, maybe thanks to my Anadin, and chatted while he took phone calls. She is 38 (five years older than her current stepmother), and till recently worked for Elle magazine in New York. But I found it tiresome that whenever he laughed - a particular sort of heh-heh Aren't-I-a-wacky-drug-monster cackle - she would do it too, louder, and then he would do it louder still, and they would set each other off into a ghastly hyena antiphon. </p> <p>Heaven knows Dennis Hopper is quite difficult to interview anyway, partly because he has certain set-piece riffs that he does for every journalist, but also because his career is so large and so diffuse you hardly know where to begin. He has acted in more than 50 films, including classics such as Blue Velvet and Apocalypse Now, and directed half a dozen, starting with Easy Rider. FilmFour's recent retrospective, Dennis Hopper - Hollywood Rebel, showed a good range of his filmwork, but only a fraction of it.</p> <p>He also has a secondary career as an artist and photographer (some of his photographs can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.eyestorm.com\">www.eyestorm.com</a> and also in a monograph published in 1988 called Out of the Sixties). And then, as we have seen, he is a serious collector of contemporary American art, now on to his third collection, having lost the first two to divorce. He has been married five times and has three children, ranging in age from 10 to 38. All this, despite having blown away a large chunk of his life with drugs and alcohol. </p> <p>He has been around so long - he was in Rebel Without a Cause with James Dean in 1955. He was discovered as a teenager acting Shakespeare at the San Diego Old Globe Theater, and signed on a three-year contract to Warner Bros. But in 1958 he had a stand-off with director Henry Hathaway on a John Wayne movie called From Hell to Texas and was told he would never work in Hollywood again. So he went to New York, worked as a photographer, got in with the art crowd (he bought one of Andy Warhol's first soup-can paintings for $75), and studied Method acting under Lee Strasberg. He married Marin's mother, Brooke 'Haywire' Hayward, the daughter of film star Margaret Sullavan, and through her met her childhood friend Peter Fonda, with whom he made Easy Rider in 1969. </p> <p> Easy Rider is the film by which he must stand or fall. He says it is his masterpiece, his pitch for posterity, and it is his, all his. He wrote, directed, acted in it. No matter that the writing credits read Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Terry Southern - 'Terry Southern never wrote one fucking word of Easy Rider. Only the title Easy Rider came from him. He broke his hip; he couldn't write. I used his office and I dictated the whole fucking thing in 10 days.' Surely Peter Fonda made some contribution? 'He did. He had a name. He had a credit card. And he loved motorcycles [Hopper hates them]. But Jack Nicholson was the one who put the deal together, he went in and told them there was no way they could lose money on a motorbike picture.' </p> <p>Rashly, I mention Peter Biskind's book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, which purports to tell the background story of the film, and it is like lighting the blue touchpaper. 'Total horseshit! I read one chapter and decided it was a good thing I was homicidal rather than suicidal - except I didn't know who to kill, there were so many people up for it. My brother-in-law, Bill Hayward, said I was the worst editor he'd ever seen - as if he'd know an editor if he saw one. And then Peter Fonda called me a fascist punk. And Buck Henry said there was no director on that movie - the movie directed itself! Oh really! Great! These are really good friends, nice people, people you just want to have over and cuddle. With your gun at their heads, heh heh!' And he and Marin go into one of their hyena fits. </p> <p>Well, I said, according to Biskind he was out of his head most of the time and he certainly didn't sound like a fun drunk. 'I was a productive one! And they were a bunch of pussies. I went out and made a movie and put it together and they posed a lot and afterwards took a lot of credit for doing absolutely nothing. I was hellbent to make a movie - I mean, talk about obsession. I didn't give a fuck if I ran over people in the street: if they got in the way, then they'd better get out of the way - that was my objective and that's what I did. And at the end of it there were a lot of people standing there wondering what had happened and thinking that I'd ruined this great masterpiece they were going to make. And then when they suddenly realised I'd gone and made the masterpiece, they all started talking about how much they'd done on it.' </p> <p>Right, right, I say soothingly, noticing that Marin has gone quite rigid under her blanket, whether from fear or boredom I'm not sure - I suspect she has heard this rant 900 times before. Anyway, at the time he certainly got the credit for making Easy Rider - he was on the cover of Time magazine and the studio gave him carte blanche to make his next project, The Last Movie. According to Biskind again, it was a disaster - first the filming in Peru, which attracted every freak and cokehead on the continent, and then the editing in Taos, which dragged on for a year and 'kept growing, like a malignancy'. When Universal executives finally saw the movie, they released it just long enough for the critics to pan it, then buried it. But Hopper is still very proud of it. 'It won the only award given at the Venice Film Festival in 1971 - it would be nice for people to look at it.' </p> <p>But The Last Movie effectively ended the brief bankability he'd gained from Easy Rider - no major studio would back him again. 'I didn't direct again for 12 years and during that period Spielberg, Lucas, Francis [Ford Coppola] all went on and had tremendous success while I was watching it all happen.' Anyway, by this stage, he was deep into drugs and alcohol, drinking half a gallon of rum and up to 27 beers a day, then using 3g of cocaine - 'lines the length of a fountain pen every 10 minutes' - to sober up. He didn't bother to hide it, either - one director told Biskind he went through a script with Hopper, working out which drugs he'd take for which scene and marking them on the call sheets. And yet even in the 70s - his lost decade - he still delivered some great performances, for instance in Wim Wenders' The American Friend, and possibly the greatest of all as a drug-crazed war photographer in Apocalypse Now, though most of his scenes were cut. </p> <p>He cleaned up in the mid-80s and says that one of his best acting years was the year he turned sober, 1986, when he made three very different films, Blue Velvet, Hoosiers and River's Edge, back to back. Since then his performances have gone up and down - he was great in Waterworld and Basquiat, but terrible by his own admission in Super Mario Brothers. He chooses roles purely on the basis of when he's available, because he'd rather be working than not - hence the wildly variable quality of his filmography. </p> <p>Perhaps this is why he's never won an Oscar, and thinks now he never will. 'You know, I've been scraping the bottom of the creative bowl here in Hollywood for so long that I don't really get any of the roles that one gets nominated for. I'm not on their A list at the studios, nor on their B list nor their C list nor their D list. So I have to go out and do independent films that most of the time never see a theatre, go directly to video or Home Box Office. Some of them turn out very well, but you don't win Academy Awards for things that go straight to television. I was in a producer's office the other day with a script he wanted to do of mine and he said, \"Now if you can get these actors\" - and he gave me a list - \"I can get you $90m; if you can get these actors, I can get you 70; these 40, and these 15 to 20.\" And my name wasn't even on the list! I'm not bankable on any level.' So is he bitter about it? 'No! Just because I'm green and look like The Grinch! No. I'm too old to be bitter. And it's been that way for my entire career, except for one moment after Easy Rider.' </p> <p>So he works as a jobbing supporting actor and, between films, gets on with his art. He has spent most of the past two years assembling a big retrospective of his artwork for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. It opens in mid-February, and goes on to Vienna at the end of May. It consists of 'photography, painting, sculpture, light machine, billboard, sets, video, digital work - just about everything'. He has no hopes of making money from his art. 'I do it totally out of an ego problem, that's all.' </p> <p>The ego problem - this is the crux of Dennis Hopper, but what is it exactly? It's something to do with coming from nowhere - an alfalfa farm in Kansas - and having a huge ambition - nothing less than to be a genius. His determination to be a genius was, perhaps still is, total, but he never quite decided what sort of genius he would be. Joanne Woodward remarked when he was in his twenties: 'Dennis is a genius. I'm not sure of what, and I'm not sure Dennis knows of what. Certainly not acting. But he is a genius.'</p> <p>Unfortunately he made the common mistake of studying the lifestyles of geniuses rather than the work - what one might call the If-I-cut-off-my-ear-I-will-paint-like-Van-Gogh delusion. He observed that great actors were often drunks, so he started drinking, and then he observed that some of them also took drugs, so he did that too - 'It was all like part of the creative process to me.' And in the beginning, he insists, it was creative - all the energy from the drugs went into his filmwork. But eventually it became just boring old addiction. 'We were all going to hold hands, take LSD, find God - and what happened? We ended up at the drug dealer's door, carrying guns and in total madness.' </p> <p>The madness finally overcame him when he was making a film in Mexico and ran off naked into the jungle - 'I thought the Third World War had started. I masturbated in front of a tree and thought I'd become a galaxy - that was a good mood!' he roars, going into a fit of the heh-hehs with Marin obligingly heh-hehing along. He loves telling this story - he tells it to every interviewer. He ran about in the jungle all night and was eventually picked up by the police and put on a plane back to Los Angeles, but he thought the plane was on fire and tried to climb out of the emergency exit. Pause for more heh-heh-hehs. </p> <p>Anyway, the upshot was not so funny - he was put in a psychiatric hospital and given an antipsychotic drug which gave him all the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 'It lasted for three months without them knowing what had happened. I was in lockup cleaning toilets and shaking so badly I screamed: \"I can't do it\" and the guard said, \"You're going to do it!\" but I couldn't hold the rag. I couldn't make a gesture, I couldn't speak, and I was taken to three meetings a day and they'd say, \"This is what happens if you use drugs and alcohol.\" And this went on for a long time, but finally I got through all that. Quite honestly, I was in such bad shape that to survive and to come out with a mind and to have a second chance was really an amazing thing.' </p> <p>Meanwhile three marriages had come and gone and two children - Marin and another daughter, Ruthanna, by his third marriage - had grown up barely seeing him. This was a subject I didn't want to raise in front of Marin, but he insisted, 'No it's fine. Go ahead.' OK, I said, the Biskind book claimed he was violent to his wives. 'Well, I didn't read it, so can you tell me what it said?' 'It said you threatened Brooke Hayward so much that she ran away.' 'I don't know about threatened. I hit her. There was a moment when I became violent with her. And she was probably afraid of me after that. That was a very young and stupid mistake because I didn't understand her illness.' Her illness? 'Yes. She had an illness. She was manic depressive and I couldn't cope with it. So that was that one. What was the next one?' </p> <p>Wife number two, Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and Papas. According to Biskind, 'Hopper terrified her and her daughter Chynna by firing guns in the house, and handcuffing her to prevent her from running away, saying he thought she was a witch.' 'Oh Michelle,' Hopper says wearily. 'Well, we were married for eight days and we did everything we could possibly think of. Then she went off to sing with Leonard Cohen and she said, \"I've decided music is my life and I never want to see you again.\" So. When I was young, was I aggressive towards women? Yes. If we had an argument and they physically attacked me, I didn't have any problems treating them much as I would a male. I slapped a few women. But that, very honestly, ended with alcohol. I've never threatened my current wife and we've been together nine years.' </p> <p>What about his last wife, Katherine La Nasa, whom he married when she was 20 and by whom he has a 10-year-old son, Henry Lee? 'No, I didn't use violence on Katherine La Nasa, even though she used it as an excuse in court. I was sober and I used no violence on her.' Why does she say you did? 'Because she could. Why do people say I didn't write Easy Rider? Because they can.' He and La Nasa divorced in 1991 when their son was only one and he has been fighting for equal custody ever since. At present the boy lives with him five days a fortnight - Hopper showed me his room, which featured a Julian Schnabel crockery painting among all the normal schoolboy clutter. 'I missed my daughters' upbringing and I tried to be so involved in this one, but karma has dealt me the same kind of hand again - it's been hard on me.' </p> <p>Karma indeed. Anyway, his current marriage seems to be surviving, though it is still childless. He has been with Victoria Duffy nine years, since she was 24, and is very proud of the fact that she is a champion three-day eventer who trains her own horses. But she is younger than his daughter and he admitted when they married that the age gap scared him. Has it been a problem? 'Well, I mean, so far, so good. It's a problem when I look in the mirror, not with my mind.' </p> <p>His mind is still bent on being a genius, on leaving something for posterity. 'I'd like to establish a place in time. I went to a party the other night - Nic Cage and Francis Ford Coppola had a party -and I said, \"This house is really familiar\" and they said, \"Well, it's Dean Martin's house.\" They didn't say it was Coppola or Nic Cage's house; it was Dean Martin's house. And David Lynch said, \"Yes, and he's gone and we're standing here now and just in a flash there'll be another group standing here and we'll be gone.\" The only reason you go into art is that you hope you can cheat death a little by leaving something that's going to last a little bit beyond your own time.' </p> <p>Will he succeed? He's pinning his hopes on Easy Rider, but even if he gets all the credit, it's not exactly Citizen Kane. By any normal standards, he's had a good film career and an immensely long one - almost half a century - but not by the genius standards he sets himself. Perhaps that's why he's awkward about being interviewed - perhaps that's why he needed Marin for support. He told me, 'I'm an introvert by nature. Social things are not my best. I would prefer sitting quietly rather than thinking that I have to make some sort of conversation to prove myself, advance some philosophies. I was always unbearably shy. That was probably one of the reasons that I drank and took drugs. And also because of the roles that I played, and people expecting me to be those roles or they were disappointed.' </p> <p>I wasn't disappointed exactly, but I found it terribly oppressive to be in his company - or maybe it was just the house. When I left, he came to the door to see me off, and actually stepped outside for a minute and I thought: 'How brave of him, to come outside!' And then I almost skipped across the street, taking deep breaths of freedom, while he went back inside his castle and clanged the steel door shut.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> FilmFour will show a repeat of the interview Dennis Hopper - Rebel Without a Pause on 16 February at 12.05am.

He married Marin's mother, Brooke 'Haywire' Hayward, the daughter of film star Margaret Sullavan, and through her met her childhood friend Peter Fonda, with whom he made Easy Rider in 1969. Easy Rider is the film by which he must stand or fall. He says it is his masterpiece, his pitch for posterity, and it is his, all his. He wrote, directed, acted in it. No matter that the writing credits read Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Terry Southern - 'Terry Southern never wrote one fucking word of Easy Rider. Only the title Easy Rider came from him. He broke his hip; he couldn't write. I used his office and I dictated the whole fucking thing in 10 days.' Surely Peter Fonda made some contribution? 'He did. He had a name. He had a credit card. And he loved motorcycles [Hopper hates them]. But Jack Nicholson was the one who put the deal together, he went in and told them there was no way they could lose money on a motorbike picture.' Rashly, I mention Peter Biskind's book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, which purports to tell the background story of the film, and it is like lighting the blue touchpaper. 'Total horseshit! I read one chapter and decided it was a good thing I was homicidal rather than suicidal - except I didn't know who to kill, there were so many people up for it. My brother-in-law, Bill Hayward, said I was the worst editor he'd ever seen - as if he'd know an editor if he saw one. And then Peter Fonda called me a fascist punk. And Buck Henry said there was no director on that movie - the movie directed itself! Oh really! Great! These are really good friends, nice people, people you just want to have over and cuddle. With your gun at their heads, heh heh!' And he and Marin go into one of their hyena fits. Well, I said, according to Biskind he was out of his head most of the time and he certainly didn't sound like a fun drunk. 'I was a productive one! And they were a bunch of pussies. I went out and made a movie and put it together and they posed a lot and afterwards took a lot of credit for doing absolutely nothing. I was hellbent to make a movie - I mean, talk about obsession. I didn't give a fuck if I ran over people in the street: if they got in the way, then they'd better get out of the way - that was my objective and that's what I did. And at the end of it there were a lot of people standing there wondering what had happened and thinking that I'd ruined this great masterpiece they were going to make. And then when they suddenly realised I'd gone and made the masterpiece, they all started talking about how much they'd done on it.' Right, right, I say soothingly, noticing that Marin has gone quite rigid under her blanket, whether from fear or boredom I'm not sure - I suspect she has heard this rant 900 times before. Anyway, at the time he certainly got the credit for making Easy Rider - he was on the cover of Time magazine and the studio gave him carte blanche to make his next project, The Last Movie. According to Biskind again, it was a disaster - first the filming in Peru, which attracted every freak and cokehead on the continent, and then the editing in Taos, which dragged on for a year and 'kept growing, like a malignancy'. When Universal executives finally saw the movie, they released it just long enough for the critics to pan it, then buried it. But Hopper is still very proud of it. 'It won the only award given at the Venice Film Festival in 1971 - it would be nice for people to look at it.' But The Last Movie effectively ended the brief bankability he'd gained from Easy Rider - no major studio would back him again. 'I didn't direct again for 12 years and during that period Spielberg, Lucas, Francis [Ford Coppola] all went on and had tremendous success while I was watching it all happen.' Anyway, by this stage, he was deep into drugs and alcohol, drinking half a gallon of rum and up to 27 beers a day, then using 3g of cocaine - 'lines the length of a fountain pen every 10 minutes' - to sober up. He didn't bother to hide it, either - one director told Biskind he went through a script with Hopper, working out which drugs he'd take for which scene and marking them on the call sheets. And yet even in the 70s - his lost decade - he still delivered some great performances, for instance in Wim Wenders' The American Friend, and possibly the greatest of all as a drug-crazed war photographer in Apocalypse Now, though most of his scenes were cut. He cleaned up in the mid-80s and says that one of his best acting years was the year he turned sober, 1986, when he made three very different films, Blue Velvet, Hoosiers and River's Edge, back to back. Since then his performances have gone up and down - he was great in Waterworld and Basquiat, but terrible by his own admission in Super Mario Brothers. He chooses roles purely on the basis of when he's available, because he'd rather be working than not - hence the wildly variable quality of his filmography. Perhaps this is why he's never won an Oscar, and thinks now he never will. 'You know, I've been scraping the bottom of the creative bowl here in Hollywood for so long that I don't really get any of the roles that one gets nominated for. I'm not on their A list at the studios, nor on their B list nor their C list nor their D list. So I have to go out and do independent films that most of the time never see a theatre, go directly to video or Home Box Office. Some of them turn out very well, but you don't win Academy Awards for things that go straight to television. I was in a producer's office the other day with a script he wanted to do of mine and he said, \"Now if you can get these actors\" - and he gave me a list - \"I can get you $90m; if you can get these actors, I can get you 70; these 40, and these 15 to 20.\" And my name wasn't even on the list! I'm not bankable on any level.' So is he bitter about it? 'No! Just because I'm green and look like The Grinch! No. I'm too old to be bitter. And it's been that way for my entire career, except for one moment after Easy Rider.' So he works as a jobbing supporting actor and, between films, gets on with his art. He has spent most of the past two years assembling a big retrospective of his artwork for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. It opens in mid-February, and goes on to Vienna at the end of May. It consists of 'photography, painting, sculpture, light machine, billboard, sets, video, digital work - just about everything'. He has no hopes of making money from his art. 'I do it totally out of an ego problem, that's all.' The ego problem - this is the crux of Dennis Hopper, but what is it exactly? It's something to do with coming from nowhere - an alfalfa farm in Kansas - and having a huge ambition - nothing less than to be a genius. His determination to be a genius was, perhaps still is, total, but he never quite decided what sort of genius he would be. Joanne Woodward remarked when he was in his twenties: 'Dennis is a genius. I'm not sure of what, and I'm not sure Dennis knows of what. Certainly not acting. But he is a genius.' Unfortunately he made the common mistake of studying the lifestyles of geniuses rather than the work - what one might call the If-I-cut-off-my-ear-I-will-paint-like-Van-Gogh delusion. He observed that great actors were often drunks, so he started drinking, and then he observed that some of them also took drugs, so he did that too - 'It was all like part of the creative process to me.' And in the beginning, he insists, it was creative - all the energy from the drugs went into his filmwork. But eventually it became just boring old addiction. 'We were all going to hold hands, take LSD, find God - and what happened? We ended up at the drug dealer's door, carrying guns and in total madness.' The madness finally overcame him when he was making a film in Mexico and ran off naked into the jungle - 'I thought the Third World War had started. I masturbated in front of a tree and thought I'd become a galaxy - that was a good mood!' he roars, going into a fit of the heh-hehs with Marin obligingly heh-hehing along. He loves telling this story - he tells it to every interviewer. He ran about in the jungle all night and was eventually picked up by the police and put on a plane back to Los Angeles, but he thought the plane was on fire and tried to climb out of the emergency exit. Pause for more heh-heh-hehs. Anyway, the upshot was not so funny - he was put in a psychiatric hospital and given an antipsychotic drug which gave him all the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 'It lasted for three months without them knowing what had happened. I was in lockup cleaning toilets and shaking so badly I screamed: \"I can't do it\" and the guard said, \"You're going to do it!\" but I couldn't hold the rag. I couldn't make a gesture, I couldn't speak, and I was taken to three meetings a day and they'd say, \"This is what happens if you use drugs and alcohol.\" And this went on for a long time, but finally I got through all that. Quite honestly, I was in such bad shape that to survive and to come out with a mind and to have a second chance was really an amazing thing.' Meanwhile three marriages had come and gone and two children - Marin and another daughter, Ruthanna, by his third marriage - had grown up barely seeing him. This was a subject I didn't want to raise in front of Marin, but he insisted, 'No it's fine. Go ahead.' OK, I said, the Biskind book claimed he was violent to his wives. 'Well, I didn't read it, so can you tell me what it said?' 'It said you threatened Brooke Hayward so much that she ran away.' 'I don't know about threatened. I hit her. There was a moment when I became violent with her. And she was probably afraid of me after that. That was a very young and stupid mistake because I didn't understand her illness.' Her illness? 'Yes. She had an illness. She was manic depressive and I couldn't cope with it. So that was that one. What was the next one?' Wife number two, Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and Papas. According to Biskind, 'Hopper terrified her and her daughter Chynna by firing guns in the house, and handcuffing her to prevent her from running away, saying he thought she was a witch.' 'Oh Michelle,' Hopper says wearily. 'Well, we were married for eight days and we did everything we could possibly think of. Then she went off to sing with Leonard Cohen and she said, \"I've decided music is my life and I never want to see you again.\" So. When I was young, was I aggressive towards women? Yes. If we had an argument and they physically attacked me, I didn't have any problems treating them much as I would a male. I slapped a few women. But that, very honestly, ended with alcohol. I've never threatened my current wife and we've been together nine years.' What about his last wife, Katherine La Nasa, whom he married when she was 20 and by whom he has a 10-year-old son, Henry Lee? 'No, I didn't use violence on Katherine La Nasa, even though she used it as an excuse in court. I was sober and I used no violence on her.' Why does she say you did? 'Because she could. Why do people say I didn't write Easy Rider? Because they can.' He and La Nasa divorced in 1991 when their son was only one and he has been fighting for equal custody ever since. At present the boy lives with him five days a fortnight - Hopper showed me his room, which featured a Julian Schnabel crockery painting among all the normal schoolboy clutter. 'I missed my daughters' upbringing and I tried to be so involved in this one, but karma has dealt me the same kind of hand again - it's been hard on me.' Karma indeed. Anyway, his current marriage seems to be surviving, though it is still childless. He has been with Victoria Duffy nine years, since she was 24, and is very proud of the fact that she is a champion three-day eventer who trains her own horses. But she is younger than his daughter and he admitted when they married that the age gap scared him. Has it been a problem? 'Well, I mean, so far, so good. It's a problem when I look in the mirror, not with my mind.' His mind is still bent on being a genius, on leaving something for posterity. 'I'd like to establish a place in time. I went to a party the other night - Nic Cage and Francis Ford Coppola had a party -and I said, \"This house is really familiar\" and they said, \"Well, it's Dean Martin's house.\" They didn't say it was Coppola or Nic Cage's house; it was Dean Martin's house. And David Lynch said, \"Yes, and he's gone and we're standing here now and just in a flash there'll be another group standing here and we'll be gone.\" The only reason you go into art is that you hope you can cheat death a little by leaving something that's going to last a little bit beyond your own time.' Will he succeed? He's pinning his hopes on Easy Rider, but even if he gets all the credit, it's not exactly Citizen Kane. By any normal standards, he's had a good film career and an immensely long one - almost half a century - but not by the genius standards he sets himself. Perhaps that's why he's awkward about being interviewed - perhaps that's why he needed Marin for support. He told me, 'I'm an introvert by nature. Social things are not my best. I would prefer sitting quietly rather than thinking that I have to make some sort of conversation to prove myself, advance some philosophies. I was always unbearably shy. That was probably one of the reasons that I drank and took drugs. And also because of the roles that I played, and people expecting me to be those roles or they were disappointed.' I wasn't disappointed exactly, but I found it terribly oppressive to be in his company - or maybe it was just the house. When I left, he came to the door to see me off, and actually stepped outside for a minute and I thought: 'How brave of him, to come outside!' And then I almost skipped across the street, taking deep breaths of freedom, while he went back inside his castle and clanged the steel door shut. \u00b7 FilmFour will show a repeat of the interview Dennis Hopper - Rebel Without a Pause on 16 February at 12.05am.

      "byline": "Tim Adams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Lee Miller and Erwin Wurm</strong> Photographers' Gallery, London, WC2 </p> <p>Lee Miller's early life looked like a discrete series of impossible stolen moments; as a result, perhaps, she intuited that photography might have been invented just for her. She got her break as a Vogue model one day when she fell into the path of an oncoming car in New York. Her life was saved by the publisher, Cond\u00e9 Nast, who, passing by, pulled her from under the car's wheels, and was so struck by her wide-eyed beauty that he put her on the cover of the next issue of his magazine. </p> <p>Not content to be a subject for long, Miller determined to be a muse and an artist, too. In 1929, she introduced herself to Man Ray in a Paris caf\u00e9 by informing him she was his new and only pupil; they left later that day to holiday in Biarritz, and subsequently lived together for three years, a relationship which produced the classic images of surrealist photography. </p> <p>During the war Miller transformed herself from committed salon snapper into the most glamorous of front-line reporters, capturing the bombardment of St Malo from the honeymoon suite of a five-star hotel for Vogue; personally liberating Picasso's studio in Paris. Her war ended in Munich, where she lodged briefly in Hitler's abandoned house, soaped herself in his bath, and later slept, 'comfily and creepily', up the road in Eva Braun's bedroom. </p> <p>Her photographs, surprising, fugitive geometries captured from this extraordinary life, look like the wedding album from a no-expense-spared marriage of heaven and hell. A small selection of them, mingling fashion shoots and death camps - Miller was among the advance guard that arrived at Buchenwald and Dachau - are on display upstairs in the Print Room of the Photographers' Gallery. It is a measure of how far she travelled that, for all the disparities of their subject matter, each is so insistently hers. The formal game-playing experiments of her years with Man Ray, (including the 'solarisation' technique Miller discovered by accident when a mouse ran over her foot in the dark room and she momentarily switched on the light), equipped her to deal, photographically at least, with all the horrors that followed. </p> <p>A regular star of surrealist costume balls, Miller could bring an unmistakable sense of iconic shock to both her portraiture - here, of Meret Oppenheim, the creator of the fur-lined teacup, and of Man Ray shaving in his bathroom - and to her landscapes. At the Great Pyramids, the backdrop to her ill-fated first marriage to an Egyptian millionaire in the Thirties, she found a landscape to counterpoint her sense of comedic alienation; 'Portrait of Space', one of her desert compositions, framed by the torn accident of a flyscreen, became a dislocating inspiration for Magritte when he saw it in London.

      "bodyText": "Lee Miller and Erwin Wurm Photographers' Gallery, London, WC2 Lee Miller's early life looked like a discrete series of impossible stolen moments; as a result, perhaps, she intuited that photography might have been invented just for her. She got her break as a Vogue model one day when she fell into the path of an oncoming car in New York. Her life was saved by the publisher, Cond\u00e9 Nast, who, passing by, pulled her from under the car's wheels, and was so struck by her wide-eyed beauty that he put her on the cover of the next issue of his magazine. Not content to be a subject for long, Miller determined to be a muse and an artist, too. In 1929, she introduced herself to Man Ray in a Paris caf\u00e9 by informing him she was his new and only pupil; they left later that day to holiday in Biarritz, and subsequently lived together for three years, a relationship which produced the classic images of surrealist photography. During the war Miller transformed herself from committed salon snapper into the most glamorous of front-line reporters, capturing the bombardment of St Malo from the honeymoon suite of a five-star hotel for Vogue; personally liberating Picasso's studio in Paris. Her war ended in Munich, where she lodged briefly in Hitler's abandoned house, soaped herself in his bath, and later slept, 'comfily and creepily', up the road in Eva Braun's bedroom. Her photographs, surprising, fugitive geometries captured from this extraordinary life, look like the wedding album from a no-expense-spared marriage of heaven and hell. A small selection of them, mingling fashion shoots and death camps - Miller was among the advance guard that arrived at Buchenwald and Dachau - are on display upstairs in the Print Room of the Photographers' Gallery. It is a measure of how far she travelled that, for all the disparities of their subject matter, each is so insistently hers. The formal game-playing experiments of her years with Man Ray, (including the 'solarisation' technique Miller discovered by accident when a mouse ran over her foot in the dark room and she momentarily switched on the light), equipped her to deal, photographically at least, with all the horrors that followed. A regular star of surrealist costume balls, Miller could bring an unmistakable sense of iconic shock to both her portraiture - here, of Meret Oppenheim, the creator of the fur-lined teacup, and of Man Ray shaving in his bathroom - and to her landscapes. At the Great Pyramids, the backdrop to her ill-fated first marriage to an Egyptian millionaire in the Thirties, she found a landscape to counterpoint her sense of comedic alienation; 'Portrait of Space', one of her desert compositions, framed by the torn accident of a flyscreen, became a dislocating inspiration for Magritte when he saw it in London. Along the way, though her heart was perhaps not quite in it, Miller boldly revolutionised fashion photography, too, taking her models outside the studio for the first time. Her coutured subjects, collected on one wall, lean towards planes, trains and automobiles, holding - superfluously - onto the sharp lines of their hats. These tailored vignettes of escapism were war photos of a kind, but Miller found in herself a characteristic hunger to be at the centre of conflict.

      "body": "<p>When I took office as Minister of Education in December 1999, I knew what my first task had to be. It was to listen, and look, and find out what people thought of the education system, what the strengths and weaknesses were, what they thought could be improved. </p> <p>In the last year I have visited a great number of schools and talked with a great many people from all walks of life: teachers, parents, pupils, representatives from the education authorities and business people. </p> <p>The education system I found was not perfect. However, it is a system where there is great optimism and enthusiasm, and where teachers and those who work with them and support them are doing the best they can for the pupils and their communities. The results are good - Northern Ireland traditionally out-performs England and Wales, for example, by several percentage points on all the main indicators at A level, GCSE and key stage tests. We also have a lower percentage of young people leaving school with no qualifications. </p> <p>But when I asked people what they would like me to do to improve the education system, one answer kept coming back: 'Do something about the league tables'. (This was second only to 'do something about the 11-plus', so I decided to look more closely at both.) </p> <p>Over and over, school heads and teachers, particularly in socially disadvantaged areas, would tell me how unfairly the tables portrayed their school: that the tables took no account of the ability of their pupils on entry or the circumstances in which they worked; that all the hard work they and their pupils had put in over the year was made to look like poor performance when their school was ranked against more affluent schools in the leafy suburbs. </p> <p>It annoyed and frustrated them that the things their schools did well - the arts, sports, pastoral care, provision for special needs, personal and social development, community work, careers preparation, after-school clubs - were not reflected in the tables. They felt that all this wider education was regarded as unimportant, that only exam results mattered. Their pupils felt it too. </p> <p>They felt this even though the annual performance tables listed schools alphabetically and never in rank order, and showed grammar and secondary schools in separate sections. However, our local press had a passion for reorganising the tables into ranked lists and, for many schools, their ranking had become a matter of dissension. Teachers found this demoralising and unfair. I felt I had to look at whether the objectives we had for the performance tables could be met in other ways. </p> <p>The main point of publishing the tables is to enable parents, particularly the parents of pupils transferring to secondary school, to compare performance. As far as the schools are concerned, my department also publishes each year a set of 'benchmarking' information for both primary and post-primary schools, which enables each school to judge its own performance against the full range of performance of schools of a similar size, or with similar proportions of pupils on free school meals. This provides a better basis than the league tables to set targets for improvement. </p> <p>There are many reasons why a system that suits England might not be appropriate to Northern Ireland. Outside Belfast and Derry, we do not have the major conurbations that are typical of England. We have a selective post-primary system, although this is now under review. By parental choice, we have a school system that is largely segregated by religion. In addition, parents in Northern Ireland are less willing to have their children travel long distances to school. Ten miles would be the outside limit and most would want far shorter journeys. So, for most parents outside Greater Belfast, the choice is limited to a couple of schools ... and for some there is just one option. Examination performance and comparison among schools are not, therefore, deciding factors for most parents when it comes to choosing a secondary school. </p> <p>So I decided to see if teachers' views on the tables were widely shared, and in the autumn my department consulted a wide range of bodies on three options: to keep the tables (but do whatever was possible to improve the indicators); to have schools publish their own results in their prospectuses; or to have the five Education and Library Boards publish the information in their 'Transfer Booklets' (annual compendia of information about post-primary schools compiled for parents of children at 11-plus stage). </p> <p>In addition to schools, churches, district councils, voluntary organisations and teacher unions, the options went to the Education Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly and to the parents of all pupils in the first year of their post-primary schools - Year 8 - who would have received a copy of the tables when they were choosing their schools. </p> <p>More than three-quarters of the responses were opposed to the continued publication of the tables. This was true not only of the responses from teachers and boards of governors, but also from parents (who made up three-quarters of the respondents). Many respondents took the opportunity to condemn the tables as divisive and uninformative. </p> <p>More than half the responses favoured the second option - publishing performance information in prospectuses - and that is what I decided to do. </p> <p>This year's tables, due at the end of this month, will not now be published. </p> <p>Schools here are already required to publish information about examination performance in their prospectuses, and will make this available to parents at open nights or on request. We will now carry out a review of this information and consult schools and others about the form it should take from next year. I want to make sure that schools publish what is of most value to parents. </p> <p>Parents will be able to get relevant information about any school from a single source and form a more rounded picture of what the school provides. Schools can set their examination performance in the fuller context of school life as a whole and show how they are working on behalf of their pupils. </p> <p>I believe this is right for our schools and for parents. Judging by the response over the past few days to my decision, many others share my view. </p> <p>\u0095 Martin McGuinness is Northern Ireland Education Minister</p>",

In addition to schools, churches, district councils, voluntary organisations and teacher unions, the options went to the Education Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly and to the parents of all pupils in the first year of their post-primary schools - Year 8 - who would have received a copy of the tables when they were choosing their schools.

Schools here are already required to publish information about examination performance in their prospectuses, and will make this available to parents at open nights or on request. We will now carry out a review of this information and consult schools and others about the form it should take from next year. I want to make sure that schools publish what is of most value to parents. Parents will be able to get relevant information about any school from a single source and form a more rounded picture of what the school provides. Schools can set their examination performance in the fuller context of school life as a whole and show how they are working on behalf of their pupils. I believe this is right for our schools and for parents. Judging by the response over the past few days to my decision, many others share my view. \u0095 Martin McGuinness is Northern Ireland Education Minister",

      "body": "<p>Ken Burns says he feels like a presidential candidate. He has been doing 24 interviews a day, flying from city to city and facing television exposure for two hours for the past three nights. The chances are that, if he really was running for office, he would probably have been elected comfortably without any need for recounts. </p> <p>But Burns is not a politician - not in the strict sense of the word anyway - but a filmmaker. Over the past week, his new epic, 10-part, 17-hour, $13 million documentary series, Jazz, has become one of the cultural talking-points in the United States, seen by some critics as a chance not only to examine the social and racial overtones of jazz and to ponder on the future of the documentary but nothing less than an examination of the state of the American psyche and its possibilities of redemption. </p> <p>In case you miss the two-hour programmes unravelling seductively on public TV (to be shown later in the year by the BBC), there is a fat, glossy book on the series, a five-CD boxed set - which Starbucks is playing in coffee houses across America, teaching aids on the subject have been provided to 75,000 teachers through the sponsorship of General Motors and there is an agreement with the National Basketball Association to play jazz during half-time breaks in games. </p> <p>Jazz, which accounts for less than 5 per cent of CD sales in the US, has never been so honoured by the mainstream. But Burns and his collaborators say their aim is set higher than merely introducing the hip-hop generation to the magic of Louis Armstrong and Ethel Waters, the stories of Benny Goodman and Bessie Smith - who confronts a band of Ku Klux Klanners at one of her concerts and chases them off with a cry of: 'You just pick up those sheets and run!' What the series aspires to do, with its 2,000 archival clips and its 500 pieces of music, is much, much more. </p> <p> As far as Wynton Marsalis, the gifted trumpet player, enthusiastic cheerleader for and teacher of jazz and one of the series's linchpins is concerned, it is about hope: 'That's the thing in jazz that got Bix Beiderbecke up out of his bed at two o'clock in the morning to pick up that cornet and practise with it into the pillow for another two or three hours. Or that would make Louis Armstrong travel around the world for 50 years non-stop, just get up out of his sickbed, crawl up on the bandstand and play. The thing that would make Duke Ellington, Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker... give their lives. And they did give their lives for it; because it gives us a glimpse into what America is going to be when it becomes itself.' </p> <p>And it is this aspect of jazz and its relationship with the US - the series is sub-titled 'A History of America's Music' - that Burns feels is so important, an opportunity to tell America its own history obliquely but educationally in the hope that it may help the nation 'become itself'. This is, after all, the third and final part of Burns's American trilogy, the first and most famous being his 1990 series The Civil War, the second, lesser known in Britain for obvious reasons, Baseball made in 1994, and now this. </p> <p>It all goes back, says Burns, to a conversation he had with the writer Gerald Early while working on the baseball series. Early had said to him: 'When they study our civilisation 2,000 years from now, there will only be three things that Americans will be known for: the Constitution, baseball and jazz.' Burns says that part of the resonance of jazz lies within its improvisational quality, just as the framers of the Constitution improvised with their aspiration to 'the pursuit of happiness... improvisation is our genius'. And he feels jazz, America's one original major art form, encapsulates that genius. </p> <p>Not that this is an unremittingly celebratory series; far from it. While Burns does tell the history of jazz, it is also the story of the darker side of America: of segregation and discrimination, of the Depression and war, of civil rights struggles and drugs, of Prohibition and addiction, of sexual politics and the exploitative side of the entertainment industry. But he has chosen to use the canon of jazz to tell a story that manages to encompass everything from the First World War to Freud and Einstein. History with a musical accompaniment. </p> <p>'I'd go to hell to hear a good band,' Beiderbecke wrote to his brother from boarding school, whither his parents had dispatched him to stop him playing his infernal jazz. And, on the musical side of the documentary, it is this infatuation with the music itself that the series seeks to celebrate. </p> <p>Burns himself came to jazz as an outsider. He had worked throughout his high-school years at a record store in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but his tastes were the typical ones of a young white boy, of rock'n'roll and rhythm'n'blues. When he embarked six years ago on Jazz, he had no more than half a dozen 'jazz' records of his own. 'I had 'Girl from Ipanema', Glenn Miller's greatest hits, John Coltrane's A Love Supreme and Andr\u00e9 Previn and Shelly Manne's My Fair Lady,' he says. All that has changed with the epiphanous discovery of the music's roots: 'I listen to jazz all the time - old and new, straight-ahead and avant-garde and fusion, swing and bop and cool. I play it night and day.' And he clearly hopes that his excitement will be infectious. He is thrilled that the series has had a (mainly) rapturous reception even as he turns his attention to his current task of a film biography of Mark Twain. </p> <p>Certainly few TV series in recent years in the United States have been awaited with such anticipation or greeted with such reverence. This is partly due to Burns's record and reputation - he has been winning Emmys and Oscar nominations since his first documentary, Brooklyn Bridge, in 1981. But it is also an indication of the decline - mirrored in Britain - of 'serious' big-budget television and its replacement with big-budget 'reality' television. </p> <p>There could have been no neater contrast for the American television viewer at 9pm last Wednesday than Burns's exploration of the Twenties, of Sidney Bechet and Earl Hines, and the offering on Rupert Murdoch's Fox network of the first episode of Temptation Island, in which the commitment of four couples is tested by a team of coquettish singles of both sexes on a Belize beach. </p> <p> The exploration and celebration of jazz and what it means also comes at a particularly apt moment in American popular music history when the nomination of Eminem for a Grammy for his last album has sparked anger because of its misogynistic and homophobic tone. It is as if there is a subconscious subtext that compares the respectful documenting of the nobility of jazz's history - the battle against segregation, the police raids, the 'jungle music' derision - with what Burns calls the 'execrable voyeurism' of reality TV and the casual misanthropy of a rich white rapper. </p> <p>Eleanor Earl, professor of communications studies and humanities at Pepperdine University in southern California and herself a jazz singer, says the series is significant in placing jazz in its proper place in history. 'It is very important that people finally understand the importance of jazz as an American art form and one that was never recognised as such. Jazz was in danger of being pushed out of the picture. Generations grew up without knowing how important it was.' She feels it is particularly relevant now to remind people how jazz had once desegregated social lives. 'Jazz allowed you the freedom to experiment and with that came the freedom to experiment socially.' </p> <p>The great scrutiny to which the series has been subjected is understandable. TV critics welcome an epic that helps to restore the image of the medium as something more than a purveyor of sitcoms, sport and cable laddishness. Burns said that after his Civil War series, there was a perceptible increase in the number of documentaries being made, although he agrees that the big networks now look too often for the quick fix for their schedules. He is delighted that, for a few days this month anyway, every night is Burns Night. </p> <p>Not that Burns has met with universal applause by any means. He has been criticised by some jazz lovers for using the televisual equivalent of the concertina on the past 40 years of jazz, giving the period from 1960 to the present day just one programme, the same amount of time as, for instance, the period from 1924 to 1928 merits. </p> <p>Part of this sensitivity among some jazz writers is because there is a recognition that no one is going to get another shot at the subject on the same scale for probably another couple of generations, and the programme by its sheer weight will define jazz for the lay person. </p> <p>Ben Ratcliff wrote in the New York Times of the series: ' Jazz will fix in the minds of millions of Americans a particular set of notions when the word jazz is uttered: a serious and heroic undertaking. An art of erotic depth and trigonometric accuracy. An entirely American invention mirroring the ideals of democracy. A kind of moral endeavour to make black and white worlds intersect in America. A responsible accounting of the shared history of the races. A welcoming gesture to all Americans, no matter their cultural background. A means of coming into one's own maturity.' Phew. </p> <p>But Ratcliff and others have criticised the series for leaning too heavily on the 'great man' theory of history, focusing on a few heavyweights such as Armstrong, Ellington, Goodman, Parker and Davis and in so doing downplaying the collegiate nature of the music. Some suggest it is 'a' history of jazz not 'the' history. </p> <p>The Guardian's jazz critic John Fordham sees the complexities of such an endeavour and notes the way the once forbidden and twilight world of jazz has now won the stamp of corporate approval. 'High-profile, serious exposure for jazz in the media has been pretty rare, so an in-depth study like this with a big budget behind it has to be a good thing if it helps people realise how crucial jazz has been to so much of the music we hear every day,' says Fordham. 'But I don't think it's a coincidence that all that corporate money has gone to a history that concentrates mainly on the period before 1960. In Britain, business people wanting to entertain clients have become increasingly likely to take them to a Sonny Rollins concert at the Barbican as to the opera now, because after decades of marginalisation, the earlier forms of jazz are becoming a classical music.' </p> <p> Burns defends the involvement of General Motors and the like on the grounds that unless such partnerships are made the message of the films disappears 'like sky writing' as soon as the films are shown. Six million schoolchildren will now have a chance to learn about an important and often ignored part of their culture, he feels. He has also responded to criticisms of the truncation of the history in the American media magazine, Brill's Content, by saying: 'I'm a historian; I'm not in the business of telling the present.' </p> <p>He sees further nuances to the series which he explains in the companion book: 'Jazz is about sex, the way men and women talk to each other and conduct the complicated rituals of courtship - a sophisticated and elegant mating call that has all but disappeared from popular music in recent times. It is about drugs and the terrible cost of addiction and the high price of creativity. It's about solitude, loneliness and the nearly unbearable burden of consciousness.' </p> <p>But while there may be disagreements about just how much such a series can hope to accomplish in lifting the burden of consciousness and whether the spotlight has been shone on all the right people, the moment that Armstrong starts playing 'West End Blues' or that Ellington appears on stage, any viewer with blood in their veins must surely be transported. And that really is reality TV.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Paul Hedge Paul and I got to know each other in the early 80s when we were both working with the local church on an anti-drugs programme. I had left Goldsmith's in 1983 and was working as a postman and Paul was about to go to Cambridge to study economics. He's a Deptford boy and I got the impression he felt a bit isolated there. </p> <p> After Cambridge, he spent a year in Senegal digging ditches and doing school maintenance. When he returned he got a good job with Swiss Bank. I think he was drinking too much and feeling miserable because he didn't enjoy the job. I suggested he give it up and come and work with me. </p> <p> I worked as a postman for nine years. The post office was like a refugee camp for creative people. After I left Goldsmith's I had found it difficult to survive financially as an artist. So I worked at the SW1 post office, delivering a lot of mail to galleries in the St James's area. I would regularly quiz the gallery staff about their exhibitions. I don't think they expected it. As a postman you are sort of invisible. I hated it all the time I was there because I wanted to run a gallery. </p> <p> When the church was bequeathed a derelict undertaker's building in Deptford High Street, it had neither the funds nor energy to do anything with it. I convinced them to let us convert it. It was to be an art gallery for people like Paul and me. We weren't aiming at the upper social set. Galleries can be very snooty and unwelcoming. We decided to open a caf\u00e9 because we wanted the gallery to be more socially inclusive. People would come in and have to walk past the art on the way to the toilet. We'd be there in our chefs' outfits to answer questions. </p> <p> Paul's talents are organisational. He's excellent at sorting out the accounting, computers, even the plumbing. But he's also a fantastic troubleshooter. Mostly he's happy to stay in the background while I travel the world linking artists with galleries and selling their work. </p> <p> We've got to the point where my wife refers to Paul as my second partner. We know each other so well we can tell each other anything. </p> <p> Paul Maslin When we were younger Paul was like an older brother. He was always one step ahead of me. Leaving my job in the City to set up the gallery with Paul was a rather insane thing to do. I had never been interested in art. I thought more about being a vicar. But Paul had a tremendous vision and I was won over by that. He was so passionate that when we had to dig the undertaker's basement out by 2ft he'd have done it with a teaspoon. </p> <p> In 1992, we started the caf\u00e9 which generated some cash, but we struggled for five years. We always felt that credibility was key, and Paul has always run a curatorial programme that couldn't be ignored. We held the first show of Jake and Dinos Chapman, and Charles Saatchi came down to Deptford - although at the time he thought he was going to Dartford - and bought some John Frankland works. </p> <p> We were still trying to build the business in 1995 when I fell in love with an old college friend who was living in Prague. They say if you want to keep your friends, then don't put them to the test. But I was so often in Prague during what was a difficult time for the business that it was a real test. But Paul didn't resent me not being around, which meant so much to me. </p> <p> In 1997, things started to take off. We hired staff and started to concentrate on representing artists rather than making cappucinos and pasta sauces. Paul spotted Tomoko Takahashi in a competition in Norwich and she came down to Deptford, saw the gallery and liked the atmosphere. When she made her show here, she often slept in the gallery. We would come in early and find loud opera music blaring and have to step over her. </p> <p> Paul is a great observer of people and a great empathiser and conversationalist. I don't have any input into the curatorial process, but I will say when I think something is rubbish. We are equal partners, but he puts more time and effort into it. I am a Labour councillor for Lewisham and prefer to put spare time and energy into that. It's Paul's dream and I've just helped him realise it.</p>",

After Cambridge, he spent a year in Senegal digging ditches and doing school maintenance. When he returned he got a good job with Swiss Bank. I think he was drinking too much and feeling miserable because he didn't enjoy the job. I suggested he give it up and come and work with me. I worked as a postman for nine years. The post office was like a refugee camp for creative people. After I left Goldsmith's I had found it difficult to survive financially as an artist. So I worked at the SW1 post office, delivering a lot of mail to galleries in the St James's area. I would regularly quiz the gallery staff about their exhibitions. I don't think they expected it. As a postman you are sort of invisible. I hated it all the time I was there because I wanted to run a gallery. When the church was bequeathed a derelict undertaker's building in Deptford High Street, it had neither the funds nor energy to do anything with it. I convinced them to let us convert it. It was to be an art gallery for people like Paul and me. We weren't aiming at the upper social set. Galleries can be very snooty and unwelcoming. We decided to open a caf\u00e9 because we wanted the gallery to be more socially inclusive. People would come in and have to walk past the art on the way to the toilet. We'd be there in our chefs' outfits to answer questions. Paul's talents are organisational. He's excellent at sorting out the accounting, computers, even the plumbing. But he's also a fantastic troubleshooter. Mostly he's happy to stay in the background while I travel the world linking artists with galleries and selling their work. We've got to the point where my wife refers to Paul as my second partner. We know each other so well we can tell each other anything. Paul Maslin When we were younger Paul was like an older brother. He was always one step ahead of me. Leaving my job in the City to set up the gallery with Paul was a rather insane thing to do. I had never been interested in art. I thought more about being a vicar. But Paul had a tremendous vision and I was won over by that. He was so passionate that when we had to dig the undertaker's basement out by 2ft he'd have done it with a teaspoon. In 1992, we started the caf\u00e9 which generated some cash, but we struggled for five years. We always felt that credibility was key, and Paul has always run a curatorial programme that couldn't be ignored. We held the first show of Jake and Dinos Chapman, and Charles Saatchi came down to Deptford - although at the time he thought he was going to Dartford - and bought some John Frankland works. We were still trying to build the business in 1995 when I fell in love with an old college friend who was living in Prague. They say if you want to keep your friends, then don't put them to the test. But I was so often in Prague during what was a difficult time for the business that it was a real test. But Paul didn't resent me not being around, which meant so much to me. In 1997, things started to take off. We hired staff and started to concentrate on representing artists rather than making cappucinos and pasta sauces. Paul spotted Tomoko Takahashi in a competition in Norwich and she came down to Deptford, saw the gallery and liked the atmosphere. When she made her show here, she often slept in the gallery. We would come in early and find loud opera music blaring and have to step over her. Paul is a great observer of people and a great empathiser and conversationalist. I don't have any input into the curatorial process, but I will say when I think something is rubbish. We are equal partners, but he puts more time and effort into it. I am a Labour councillor for Lewisham and prefer to put spare time and energy into that. It's Paul's dream and I've just helped him realise it.",

Ikea's campaign of five years ago was so successful that even the most traditional British homes have come over all, well, Swedish. As we creep into the first few weeks of 2001, we do so along varnished, blond-plywood floors. We relax on plain, neutral-coloured, no-nonsense sofas, rest our feet on square poufs made of suede, and enjoy the soft, flickering light of scented candles. There's a wall made of glass bricks between living room and kitchen, where the electric kettle - designed to look like the good old-fashioned variety which is heated up on the stove - boils up little ceramic bowls of green tea. The halogen lights, suspended from the ceiling on wires, illuminate the shiny stainless steel worktop and splashback with a cool glow. It's all very minimal, very domestic-industrial, so very turn of the century. </p> <p>For many of us, our homes and interiors have become more fashionable than our wardrobes. Priorities have changed for both the consumer and the designer. Ralph Lauren was one of the first to focus on bedlinen and paint ranges. Now everyone from Calvin Klein to Benetton has moved into 'homeware' - even if that just means producing pyjamas and towels. For the Dublin-based designer John Rocha, a talent for interior decoration has opened up a whole new world that spans Waterford crystal, an award-winning hotel in Dublin, and loft conversions in Liverpool. </p> <p>But are we really ready for our homes to become battlegrounds for trends, colourways, fabrics and chair silhouettes? Up until the 80s, decoration was a generational thing. Our parents lived in homes that were relatively unchanged since they moved in 20 years previously. Our grandparents would find that the odd piece of furniture - a family heirloom, or a Utility chair left over from the war years - would drift in and out of fashion, but their homes would just remain their homes. The walls would be given a lick of paint every few years, or perhaps a new coat of paper. Over the decades, rooms evolved, rather than experienced drastic makeovers. Now, before we can say Laurence Llewelyn Bowen, we've got the dream kitchen we've always wanted. </p> <p>Over the past five to 10 years, interiors trends seem to have accelerated from changing every decade or so to changing every month. Magazines such as Elle Deco and Living etc offer new ideas each issue - the look might be minimal in January and flowery in February. Of course, nobody actually changes their decor that frequently, because who wants to live in a home that dates as quickly as a pair of bell bottoms? </p> <p>Before we've even completed the first month of 2001, there are some clear indications of what the fashionable home should and shouldn't be 'wearing' this year. Start with the floor. Bare floors are so 90s. How about a deep, shagpile carpet wall-to-wall (just in the bedroom, perhaps)? Sheepskin rugs are a less permanent option. Or, if you're really flash, you can invest in a hand-tufted rug, designed by the Italian fashion house Marni. There's a choice of two designs: Cube (\u00a31,350) and Kimono (\u00a31,750). The rugs have been adapted from prints by Marni's designer Consuelo Castiglioni. </p> <p>If you're in the market for a coffee table, you can't go wrong with Robin Day's Alpha system, in shiny red laminate or minimal glass. Robin Day, who gave the world the utility polypropylene stacking chairs that we sit on everywhere from doctors' waiting rooms to our own kitchens (thanks to their introduction to the Habitat range as part of its Living Legends series last year), is the subject of a major retrospective at the Barbican next month, alongside his wife, the textile designer Lucienne Day. Both are veterans of modern design, who began redesigning our worlds over 50 years ago. </p> <p>The consumer is only just catching up. The north London furniture showroom twentytwentyone is manufacturing a handful of pieces by Day, including his three simple coffee tables and the Tri Tray, a triangular plywood tray that can be attached to a steel base to make it into a little table. (A similar idea has been utilised by Jasper Morrison at Tate Modern's chic member's bar on Bankside.) </p> <p>It seems as though it will be a good year for the UK design group Gusto too. The small, three-person company became a finalist in the Peugeot Design Awards last year with Sticklebook, a shelving system for paperbacks that uses fine teeth to hold the pages of the book. Sticklebook was voted 'the people's choice' in a touring exhibition, and has gone into limited production at a recommended retail price of \u00a349.95 plus carriage (if you order direct from Gusto). </p> <p>If you want to get ahead and set the trend for 2002, put in an order for the company's Altitude Light, which they describe as 'a lighting concept which uses the raising or lowering of the lamp to adjust the brightness'. To see the light in action, pay a visit to the Craft Council's new show, Industry of One, which opens 1 February. For instant millennial illumination, there is the Bubble by Mathmos (\u00a339.95; enquiries 0207 549 2743), which was developed from an original concept by Aaron Rincover. Made from tactile silicon, it's sold with a recharger so that it can apparently light up of its own accord, without the need for wires or batteries, wherever you care to roll or juggle it. </p> <p>For the serious fashion victim, however, the 2001 home will not be complete without a visit to Armani Casa, currently only at the recently opened, fluorescent-lit Armani department store on Milan's Via Manzoni. Who's counting the price of an airfare when the dinky Conversation Sofa costs \u00a32,500? There's also a choice of dining tables, writing desks, dining chairs and beds, as well as bedlinen (wool and spun cashmere blankets, hand-dyed in Tibet, no less), and a whole collection of vases, plates, cutlery and Murano glass. Armani has taken the 'home' collection very seriously and even won praise from the highly critical eye of Blueprint magazine. Perhaps the world of interiors will belong to Armani for 2001. For a whole 12 months at least. By then it will definitely be time to get out the chintz again. I can't wait.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When you hear mention of creativity, do you automatically think of some new marketing fad or team-building concept? Or do you see struggling artists in frayed knitwear on the Cornish coast? Perhaps it conjures images of art-therapy sessions or amateur photography classes. In short, does the idea of creativity elicit a response of, 'Oh, creativity, that's something for other people who haven't got more important things to do'? In fact, everyone is an artist or potential artist of some kind. The artistic or creative faculty is built into the circuitry as a preset in your DNA. That you may not yet have found the relevant command to activate it, or perhaps found it only to lose it again, is probably down to faulty conditioning by those in charge of your education.</p> <p>The expression of the creative urge as some form of artistic offering to be enjoyed by others was considered by the ancient Orientals to be vital to one's wellbeing, not just emotionally, spiritually and psychologically, but also physically and energetically. They adhered to a concept known as mastering the 'five excellences', which comprised the arts of meditation, self-defence, healing, composition and presentation skills. A well-rounded, masterful individual was seen as one who was conversant in all five. The benefits of the first three are self-evident, but how, you'd probably wonder, would composition and presentation skills be beneficial to your health?</p> <p>During the act of composing a piece of art, whether visual, filmic, sonic, literary, performance-oriented or indeed any other creativity-carrier of your choice, you ideally enter a quasi-meditative or contemplative state. When composing a painting, for instance, you gaze at the blank canvas until it reveals a subliminal shape, then, with mind emptied of preconceptions and with your energy extending through to the tip of the brush, you simply interpret the given shape, allowing yourself to get in the way as little as possible. If, say, you are approaching the composition of a piece of music, let the instrument or recording studio reveal the piece to you and proceed to interpret the information revealed according to your taste, allowing the music to play itself. You could call this the Tao or Sen of composition.</p> <p>The necessary ego-voiding process involved allows your local mind precious moments of repose from the pressures of daily responsibilities, which helps slow your pulse and is generally good for energy flow and, by extension, immune response.</p> <p>This process also implies a certain degree of conscious union with the a-priori creative force, which tends to deepen your moment-by-moment experience of life in much the same way as does meditation, yoga or t'ai chi.</p> <p>In the execution or presentation of the piece, you take a risk that others may deride you or your work. It requires courage to risk rejection and humiliation, making the act of carrying something through to this stage subtly exhilarating and self-esteem-building. It implies that you love or at least like yourself enough to spend time nurturing yourself. Moreover, it is at these times during which your overworked mind takes a brief holiday that some of your most original, important and life-changing ideas will emerge.</p> <p>To enhance the creative flow, the ancient Taoists, who first developed the 'five excellences' concept, also devised certain meditative exercises, which if practised on a daily basis for 30 days or so, will yield positive results.</p> <p>Visualise a clear tube or channel of approximately 1in diameter beginning in the centre of the forehead between your eyebrows, running back along the mid-line of your skull, over the top of your brain to the medulla oblongata at the base of the skull where it meets the back of your neck.</p> <p>As you breathe in, imagine you can feel the breath enter the channel through your forehead and travel backwards over the brain to the back of your head. As you breathe out, feel the breath return through the tube to the forehead.

      "bodyText": "When you hear mention of creativity, do you automatically think of some new marketing fad or team-building concept? Or do you see struggling artists in frayed knitwear on the Cornish coast? Perhaps it conjures images of art-therapy sessions or amateur photography classes. In short, does the idea of creativity elicit a response of, 'Oh, creativity, that's something for other people who haven't got more important things to do'? In fact, everyone is an artist or potential artist of some kind. The artistic or creative faculty is built into the circuitry as a preset in your DNA. That you may not yet have found the relevant command to activate it, or perhaps found it only to lose it again, is probably down to faulty conditioning by those in charge of your education. The expression of the creative urge as some form of artistic offering to be enjoyed by others was considered by the ancient Orientals to be vital to one's wellbeing, not just emotionally, spiritually and psychologically, but also physically and energetically. They adhered to a concept known as mastering the 'five excellences', which comprised the arts of meditation, self-defence, healing, composition and presentation skills. A well-rounded, masterful individual was seen as one who was conversant in all five. The benefits of the first three are self-evident, but how, you'd probably wonder, would composition and presentation skills be beneficial to your health? During the act of composing a piece of art, whether visual, filmic, sonic, literary, performance-oriented or indeed any other creativity-carrier of your choice, you ideally enter a quasi-meditative or contemplative state. When composing a painting, for instance, you gaze at the blank canvas until it reveals a subliminal shape, then, with mind emptied of preconceptions and with your energy extending through to the tip of the brush, you simply interpret the given shape, allowing yourself to get in the way as little as possible. If, say, you are approaching the composition of a piece of music, let the instrument or recording studio reveal the piece to you and proceed to interpret the information revealed according to your taste, allowing the music to play itself. You could call this the Tao or Sen of composition. The necessary ego-voiding process involved allows your local mind precious moments of repose from the pressures of daily responsibilities, which helps slow your pulse and is generally good for energy flow and, by extension, immune response. This process also implies a certain degree of conscious union with the a-priori creative force, which tends to deepen your moment-by-moment experience of life in much the same way as does meditation, yoga or t'ai chi. In the execution or presentation of the piece, you take a risk that others may deride you or your work. It requires courage to risk rejection and humiliation, making the act of carrying something through to this stage subtly exhilarating and self-esteem-building. It implies that you love or at least like yourself enough to spend time nurturing yourself. Moreover, it is at these times during which your overworked mind takes a brief holiday that some of your most original, important and life-changing ideas will emerge. To enhance the creative flow, the ancient Taoists, who first developed the 'five excellences' concept, also devised certain meditative exercises, which if practised on a daily basis for 30 days or so, will yield positive results. Visualise a clear tube or channel of approximately 1in diameter beginning in the centre of the forehead between your eyebrows, running back along the mid-line of your skull, over the top of your brain to the medulla oblongata at the base of the skull where it meets the back of your neck. As you breathe in, imagine you can feel the breath enter the channel through your forehead and travel backwards over the brain to the back of your head. As you breathe out, feel the breath return through the tube to the forehead. You can augment the exercise by mentally imbuing the breath with bright, clarifying light. Repeat this cycle up to nine times each sitting. Don't make a big deal over it. Do it while watching TV or sitting on the train. As well as stimulating and enhancing creativity, this exercise brings great mental clarity, increases your ability to focus and tends to make you feel cheerful. If you're of the persuasion that creativity is visited upon you by your muse or from the divine or heavenly realms, it also helps to visualise the top of your head opening up to receive or download information as if from above. The biggest block to healthy and healing creative expression is the belief in an imaginary internal critic, who sits poised like a monkey on your shoulder ready at all times to tell you what you're doing is worthless and wrong. There's no point trying to argue with the critic. The best approach is either to use a stun gun or simply to ignore whatever negative messages you receive. Either way, overriding the critic is essential not only for bringing works of art to completion, but also for ensuring peace of mind in general. The other block you'll have to surmount is impatience. It takes a long time and consistent application to develop a reliable creative channel and the skill to interpret and shape the information coming through into a form worthy of sharing. Finally, remember creativity can be applied to every aspect of your life including the way you relate to yourself and others, the way you organise your timetable and the places you choose to spend your time in. However, pay attention lest the creative urge runs away with you and you end up a compulsive content-spewer like this barefoot doctor.

      "body": "<p>There can't be many people who would willingly return to the days of food shortages and rationing, but that doesn't usually stop our mums and grans fondly recalling the stodgy puddings, bread and dripping and shepherd's pies of their wartime diet. Today, as we tuck into ready-made curries and lasagne, it's tempting to smile smugly and think we all know what's good for us now. But as nutritional experts believe - and the Hymers family from Otley in Yorkshire can confirm - it may well be that Mum knows best.</p> <p>Dieticians have long argued that wartime rationing provided the healthiest diet the British population has ever eaten, leading to dramatic post-war improvements in the nation's health. But now that ration books are consigned to museums, nutritionists still believe there are valuable lessons we can learn from the 40s diet that could help us beat the biggest threats to health today.</p> <p>The proof of the pudding lies in the experience of the Hymers family who volunteered to go back in time and spend nine weeks surviving on austere rations for the series The 1940s House , currently showing on Channel 4. Not only did all the adult Hymers lose weight and show modest health improvements by the end of the experiment but, six months after filming has ended, grandmother Lyn Hymers has stuck with her wartime regime and insists her health has benefited.</p> <p>'I feel so much better,' says Lyn, 50. 'It really has become a way of life for me.'</p> <p>Taking up the wartime challenge was no easy option for the Hymers. The family - Lyn and husband Michael, their daughter, Kirstie, 29, and grandsons Ben, 10 and Thomas, seven - previously ate a typical modern British diet. Their staple fare consisted of ready-made meals, tinned and frozen convenience foods and takeaways. Lyn rarely cooked, had no idea how to bake a cake and enjoyed smoking and drinking. Not surprisingly, both she and Michael, 52, were overweight and unfit.</p> <p>After nine weeks of spartan rations and, without the benefits of modern time-saving conveniences, heavy physical labour, it is hardly surprising the adult members of the family lost weight. But after just nine weeks, medical tests also showed their cholesterol, blood pressure and bodyfat levels had fallen moderately and their muscles grown stronger.</p> <p>More significantly, despite returning to their 21st-century home comforts, Lyn and Michael have continued their wartime regime, complete with Spam fritters and home-made cooking. While Michael feels more ambivalent about the benefits of his revolutionary lifestyle change, Lyn has now lost more than a stone, feels healthier, fitter and more energetic than ever before and has given up both alcohol and coffee, without the aid of any weight-reduction programme or exercise regime.</p> <p>Instead of driving to the supermarket for weekly shopping, she now walks daily to her local bakery, grocer's and butcher's shops to buy fresh produce. She no longer buys convenience foods or ready-made meals, but cooks everything from basic ingredients. And while previously she threw away vast quantities of food each week, she now wastes nothing. One day for lunch she may make soup with fresh peas and the following day a broth from leftover pea pods. She is even converted to the delights of Spam, and although she still smokes, she has given up coffee and alcohol because she simply doesn't want them any more.</p> <p>To her amazement, she has not regained the weight lost during the 40s experiment and feels healthier all round. 'I have battled weight all my life with different diets and going to Weight Watchers,' says Lyn. 'But whatever I did, the weight always yo-yoed back to its old level. This time it is just staying off and I am not hungry.'</p> <p>In addition, she says, her teeth are whiter, her gums no longer bleed, her eyes are no longer bloodshot, she rarely becomes breathless and her skin is as clear as ever, without the aid of expensive creams.</p> <p>The fact the Hymers lost weight and their short-term health improved confirms nutritionists' faith in the benefits of combining exercise with a diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat. But more importantly, nutritional experts also argue that a return to aspects of the wartime diet could, for all of us, be the secret to surviving modern-day killers such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes.</p> <p>At first sight, the typical 40s meal of tiny meat portions, mounds of potatoes, carrots, cabbage and bread, followed by a stodgy pudding, may not sound like the pathway to true health. Yet, at the start of the war, the average British diet, with its higher carbohydrate and lower fat content, was closer to modern recommendations than today's diet, explains Susan Jebb, head of the Medical Research Council's human nutrition research unit, who advised on the television series. When war brought food shortages and rationing, the diet improved further, as people relied more on carbohydrates while fats and sugar were severely restricted.</p> <p>British people derived 32 per cent of their calories from fat in the 40s - almost spot on the 33 per cent level now recommended by government - compared to 40 per cent today, says Dr Jebb. Although we are now more likely to spread polyunsaturated fats, such as margarine, on our bread than the butter or dripping of the war years, overall fat consumption is still too high, she says. Similarly, whereas war families consumed 55 per cent of calories as carbohydrates, the figure today is down to 45 per cent. We now eat about half the potatoes and a third of the bread typically consumed during the 40s. And although we partly compensate with pasta and rice, this is still insufficient, she argues.</p> <p>These two major shifts in British diet are held partly to blame for our high incidence of several killer diseases. Nutritionists agree that too much fat can lead to raised cholesterol and obesity, which put us at risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Eating more carbohydrates provides essential fibre, which can protect against some cancers. It is also more likely to fill us up without making us resort to unhealthy biscuits, cakes and other bad habits. Higher vegetable consumption also protects against certain cancers.</p> <p>Experts estimate that up to a third of all cancers are caused by dietary factors. Since 1950, cancer deaths have grown from 17 per cent to 25 per cent of all mortality, and while treatment has improved survival in many cases, incidence is still rising. Diabetes and obesity have also both increased significantly and although deaths from heart disease are now falling, they have not dropped as fast as many experts believe feasible.</p> <p>'Many people ate a lot better during the war,' says Dr Jebb. Ironically, although we now enjoy more choice and variety in what we eat, diet has generally worsened. 'It is certainly possible to eat more healthily now than then, but not all of us choose to do it.'</p> <p>There were other health advantages to the wartime diet, too. Although fruit was a rarity, there were free supplies of fruit juice, milk and vitamins for children. The standardised wartime national wholemeal loaf contained far more fibre than traditional white bread and was fortified with calcium, while vitamins A and D were added to margarine. At the same time, fair shares meant many poorer families ate a better diet than before. The difference in death rates between rich and poor reached its narrowest gap in the 20th century after the war, before widening to its current gulf.</p> <p>'It was the best diet we have ever had in Britain,' declares Aubrey Sheiham, professor of dental public health at University College London. The government based rationing on sound nutritional principles, while equal shares ensured the benefits were enjoyed by all. After the war, there were dramatic reductions in diabetes and dental decay, which can both be linked to better diet, he points out.</p> <p>Obviously, health trends have not all moved in one direction. We now live longer than ever before and have largely seen off infectious diseases such as TB, measles and polio. Yet the greatest increases in life expectancy during the last century happened during the war decades, according to Richard Wilkinson, professor of social epidemiology at Sussex University.</p> <p>From 1911 to 1921 and again from 1940 to 1951, life expectancy increased by between six and seven years - more than double the rise in other decades, he says. In the 40s, deaths from many causes, including heart disease, diabetes, flu and pneumonia, fell significantly. He believes full employment, higher earnings, more equality and social cohesion all played a part in this dramatic health improvement. The wartime diet was clearly another factor. 'Food certainly is part of the more general picture.'</p> <p><b> On the home front</b></p> <p>Rationing was introduced in 1940 and lasted 14 years. For most of that time, meat, cheese, butter, cooking fats and sugar were heavily restricted, but potatoes, other root vegetables and bread were freely available. People ate a diet much higher in carbohydrates and lower in fats. After rationing ended, people rushed to buy butter, sugar and white bread. The National Food Survey, conducted since 1950, shows our consumption of fruit has slowly risen over the past 50 years, but that consumption of bread, cereals, potatoes and other vegetables has steadily fallen. We eat fewer visible fats, but consume hidden quantities in processed foods, takeaways and restaurant meals.</p> <p>\u0095 The 1940s House continues on Thursdays at 9pm on Channel 4.

If you're pregnant, there is even more reason to eat your quota of oily fish, as new research suggests that omega-3 fatty acid encourages the development of your unborn baby's brain.

      "body": "<p>In July 1976, Nadia Comaneci won the overall gold medal for women's artistic gymnastics at the Montreal Olympics. She also won gold on the beam, gold on asymmetric bars, bronze on floor and a silver medal with her fellow Romanians in the team event. Even more astonishingly, during the five-day competition, she scored a perfect 10 out of 10 seven times - four times on bars, three on beam - an achievement which remains unbeaten to this day. In July 1976, Nadia Comaneci was 14 years old. </p> <p>It's December 2000, and photographer Zed Nelson and I are wandering around an out-of-town shopping centre outside Glasgow, trying to find a World Cup Final. The International Federation of Gymnastics World Cup Final 1999-2000, no less. You'd think it would be easy to spot, but somehow, among the Sainsbury's and the Salisbury's, the C&amp;A and the M&amp;S, we just can't seem to track the thing down. It's meant to be in an arena and the arena is meant to be near. We check the map, traipse along miles of glinting arcade, our eyes bleeding in the air conditioning. Is the World Cup buried beneath Beaverbrooks? Is it taking place around us, secretly, in the aisles? I start looking carefully at small children in tracksuits, to see if they're gymnasts in disguise. You know how little those Russkies are. </p> <p>Eventually we spot an arrow stuck to a wall near McDonald's, which we follow to the press area. And finally, we find our World Cup. Through double doors into a bright-lit hall which jumps with silent, wild activity, its floor alive with teeny-tiny people swinging around bars, somersaulting on the beam, screaming along the ground like noiseless Formula Ones before chucking their bantam bodies into the air as though propelled from a car crash. The air boils with energy, but the only sounds are the squeak of the bars, the muffled thud of feet on matted floor. </p> <p>I start babbling to Zed: 'Look, there's Andreea Raducan, she won the gold but had it taken from her, and see the one with the ponytail, that's Simona Amanar, she won the silver but took the gold, and that one is the Russian who won floor and vault...' </p> <p>Zed is unimpressed. Our press passes only allow us into the front row of the audience. As far as he is concerned, this is not near enough. It's training day, the only one before the competition, and he was hoping for intimate close-ups. He isn't happy. </p> <p>As for me, the mere fact of breathing the same recycled air as these athletes has made me quite ecstatic. Imagine how excited you'd be to walk into a church and find Zinadine Zidane, Steve Redgrave and Tiger Woods all hanging out at the altar. That's how this feels for me. I am a big gymnastics fan. During the Sydney Olympics, I set my alarm in order to watch the 5 am shift. I followed every twist and turn, every stumble and fall, and I bored everyone I knew with the drama. So, to have some of the principal players running through that same theatre - in real life! right next to me! - makes me gulp. </p> <p>Also, I think I'm experiencing my first-ever Proustian rush. This world of French chalk and springboards and sprung floors and crashmats, of stomach strengtheners and stretching exercises and standing on your hands, is familiar yet long-forgotten. From the age of seven until I moved to London at 21, I spent up to three nights a week practising gymnastics. Why, I don't know: I was pretty good at it, but never strong enough to make Stockport, my county team. Though, on one occasion, I trained at Lilleshall, in the national gymnastics centre. I can still remember it: the tumbling floor was so highly sprung, I threw a back somersault from standing. </p> <p>I gave up at 21, because, well, every gymnast gives up around then. Your body won't do what you tell it any more. Worse, your mind won't tell your body to do it any more. Adulthood brings fear, and gymnastics is impossible if you're afraid. Concentration is essential; consideration - of snapped neck, ripped ears, shattered ankle - spoils everything. When I was 11 and so shortsighted I could barely see my feet, I thought nothing of hurtling at full speed towards a vault that only clicked into focus when I slammed on to the springboard. At 14, I was flinging myself from one uneven bar to another, wrapping my pelvis around a fibreglass pole with no thought for a child-bearing future. Drunk at 17, I'd throw free - no-handed - cartwheels around concrete town centres, chuck flips on park benches, handsprings on dark paths. I was brave. My body was all mine. </p> <p>Until I left home at 18, I trained at Bramhall High, just south of Manchester. It was just a school sports hall, nothing special, with those long ropes that pulled out from the ceiling and wooden climbing bars on the walls. Every session, we'd set up and take down the equipment; click the asymmetric bars into place, French-chalk them, angle their uprights, tighten the steel ropes; lug out the beam, push the mats underneath, the crashmat at the end; set the vault and springboard; lay the floor, its strips held together with Velcro. I look at the beam in the Glasgow arena, and I know its texture - smooth moleskin wrapped around cold, dense wood. I know its height - 4ft, its width - 4in, I can feel it between my fingers - and I know how heavy it is to carry back into a storeroom. It has 'Continental' stamped on its side. All gymnastic equipment is made by Continental. </p> <p> A cameraman squeezes past me. He gestures with his head towards a tumbling tot and says: 'Few whiskies and I could do all this.' Except, of course, he couldn't. And neither could I, not even when I trained so hard that gymnastics danced through my dreams. Actually, neither could the all-conquering Nadia Comaneci, at the very height of her powers. If she were to perform her 1976 perfect-10 routines in front of today's judges, she'd be lucky to get above 8.5. Gymnastics has moved on. </p> <p>I watch the Romanian Andreea Raducan perform a full twisting back somersault on the beam. When Comaneci was Olympic champion, only the top girls could manage such a move on the floor. Raducan did her first triple twist on that apparatus seven years ago. When she was 10. Andreea has grown since, but not much: she's 4ft 7in and weighs 5st. During the Sydney Olympics, a male commentator said, wistfully, 'She has lovely sparkling eyes.' Which she has, and dimples, and a dark, flippy ponytail. She also had the all-around individual Olympic gold medal, Romania's first since Comaneci, for seven whole days, until she was disqualified for failing a drugs test. The Romanian team doctor had prescribed her two Nurofen Cold &amp; Flu tablets for a sniffle; the resulting pseudoephedrine in her urine cost her the gold. </p> <p>Andreea is a superstar now: after the Olympics, when she arrived home on her 17th birthday, she was welcomed into Bucharest's airport by a crowd of thousands, including Romania's prime minister Mugur Isarescu. She received all the privileges traditionally given by her country for winning an Olympic title - a car, an apartment - plus \u00a320,000, twice the money usually awarded. A jeweller made her a replica medal, out of 18ct gold. Someone wrote 'A Song For Andreea Raducan'. And she became the gymnastics fans' darling, worldwide. Every time she takes a rest near the arena barrier, scores of little girls rush up to ask her for her autograph. </p> <p>Little girls, little girls: gymnastics' life-blood and its most dedicated disciples. I started gymnastics in its mad post-Korbut heyday, when every girl under ten wanted to be Olga. I was five when she exploded into the 1972 Olympics, scooping gold on floor and beam, silver on bars. Olga Korbut was the first gymnast ever to perform a back somersault on the beam; I wore my hair like her, in two bunches. </p> <p>In the early to mid-70s, with ambassadors like Korbut and Comaneci, gymnastics was at its popular peak. Even now, when I meet women of my age working in the music business, or in magazines, or PR, or telly, as far from a sporting life as can be imagined, you'd be surprised at how many are ex-gymnasts. We all tried it. Most dropped out, usually in their teenage years; exams took over or boys came along or bodies grew too big, too womanly. The more immature, like me, stuck it out. There was nothing I found that I enjoyed more. Why would I have given up? </p> <p>By the late 70s, though, the image of gymnastics was suffering. Partly because its greatest legend was suffering, too. In 1978, Nadia Comaneci reappeared, post puberty, a stone heavier and, at 5ft 3in, three-and-a-half inches taller than in 1976. By the end of 1979, she'd lost all her weight and was shockingly gaunt, suffering from a bad wrist and blood poisoning. Articles accused her of bulimia, and the 'gymnastics is bad for your health' rumours started. It stunts your growth. You'll never have babies. The champions are only good because they take steroids. </p> <p>The 1980 Moscow Olympics saw Nadia win a controversial overall silver. A year later, her coach, Bela Karolyi, defected to the US, and Nadia disappeared from view. Then, in 1989, Nadia suddenly turned up in the States, fat, sluttish, unresponsive. 'See what happens when you stop taking those Eastern European drugs?' crowed the papers. </p> <p>But she recovered eventually and married Bart Connor, a US gymnast, in 1995. Thousands of well-wishers turned up. Soon after, she was named one of the 100 athletes of the century. Nadia appeared at Andreea Raducan's side during her Sydney appeal: she looked slim, blonde, glamorous. Andreea looked very pale and small. </p> <p> Today, though, Andreea's perky, chatting to her rivals as she waits for her turn on the bars. She's wearing a black Lycra swimsuit-style leotard and black Lycra shorts. In my day, the fashion was for long sleeves with contrasting V necks, or stripes up the inside of the arm. We wore footless tights, with leg warmers; never shorts. </p> <p>The only girls in footless tights here are the modern rhythmic gymnasts down the far end, the long-limbed girls with the ball and the ribbon and the hoop, gymnastics' ballet dancers. Zed is photographing them and I go down to join him. He's focusing on one razor-boned poppet who snaps her ribbon with elegant disdain. 'It doesn't take much imagination to have her dressed in leather and turn that into a whip,' he muses. </p> <p>Gymnasts always score highly in the male fantasy league. It's the bendy sex thing. And also, I think, the fact that you'll never meet a proper gymnast down the pub; and if you did, she wouldn't go out with you, you out-of- condition drunk. Since Comaneci's day, however, sexy gymnasts have become far fewer: Nadia capitalised on the cute acrobat trend started by Korbut, and the womanly, balletic element of gymnastics disappeared after her 1976 triumph, to be replaced by tumbling skills nicked straight from the men. Today's gymnasts are sturdy, and smaller than ever. Russia's pouting Svetlana Khorkina, who recently posed for Playboy , is one of a kind. Whereas once your dad had a choice of curvy beauties to sigh over: Ludmila Tourischeva, Elvira Saadi, Nelli Kim... </p> <p>Nelli Kim! There she is! Unmistakable, even 26 years on, Eurasian cheekbones, lovely smile, the only true challenge to Comaneci in the late 70s, she's clicking across the arena floor surrounded by elderly women in fur coats. I flick through my programme: Kim is head of judges. The fur-coat brigade must be judges, too: they prod at the beam as though it's an on-sale sofa. </p> <p>I grab Nelli as she makes her way to the press area. She hasn't got long and, suddenly, I don't know what to say. I ask her about artistry and luckily it gets her going: she talks of lost elegance and beauty and femininity and of gymnastics being 'the grandmother of all sports'. Nelli tells me she lives in Missouri with her 15-year-old daughter; that she judges and coaches and lectures in gymnastics. Occasionally, Nelli performs her old medal-winning routines; in her sleep, in her dreams. </p> <p>The next day dawns drizzly. Not that we care; we taxi between hotel and out-of-town shopping centre. We never see the weather, or pavements. Several competitors are staying at our hotel, with their coaches and chaperones. I checked out what the gymnasts ate for tea: mostly salmon and salad, though some boys had Yorkshire puddings. </p> <p>Men's gymnastics has never caught the world's imagination in the way that women's has. Perhaps it's the lack of music for the floor exercises; perhaps it's because they look like they're built for gym, with their super-buff torsos, their over-muscled legs. It's no surprise that they can throw themselves around a bit, is it? Still, there are some stars. At the arena, during warm-up, I hear two teenage girls behind me discuss Gervasio Deferr, the pierced and tattooed Spanish Olympic vault champion. </p> <p>'Ten out of 10 for the hair,' says one. </p> <p>'Ten out of 10 for the body,' says the other, and they collapse into giggles. </p> <p>The atmosphere today is far more serious; even Andreea has stopped smiling. The coaches are more evident, arms folded, ignoring each other, barking instructions. There are few women coaches. And the men, it seems, all have Freddie Mercury moustaches. </p> <p>The World Cup Final is a two-day event; the last international competition of 2000. The top eight performers on each apparatus are due to compete today, although, post-Olympics, some haven't bothered to show, including Russia's Number One Svetlana Khorkina, who's off taking the Yankee dollar in an exhibition tour across the States. </p> <p>Romania has brought its two best gymnasts: Andreea, and Simona Amanar, who was made all-around Olympic champion after Andreea's disqualification. Initially, Simona declined her medal, but then took it, 'for Romania'. China's Liu Xuan, bumped up from fourth into third, refused to take hers. Yesterday, I spoke to Octavian Belu, Romanian national coach since Bela Karolyi's 1981 defection, and he said that Andreea, 'a child', had found it hard to have her gold taken from her 'through a stupid error of adult people'. </p> <p>'Why the small must pay for mistake of big person?' he asked, his arms spread wide. </p> <p>Andreea still took home one gold medal, for her part in Romania's team win: Belu trains his gymnasts to think of their team first, their individual performance second. Even today, in a specifically individual competition, you notice how supportive the two Romanian girls are of each other. </p> <p>They both earn their share of whoops from the far-from-capacity crowd. But it's the rhythmic gymnasts who steal the show. When I was young, I turned my nose up at rhythmic gymnastics - not pure enough, the gymnastic equivalent of synchronised swimming - but watching today, I change my mind. The top three girls are very closely matched: all a joy to watch. </p> <p>The two Russians are gorgeous, too, which helps. Zed is really quite taken with one, Alina Kabaeva, the world's number one. He calls her Chippy, because he thinks she's got a chipmunk face. I prefer the other Russian, Yulia Barsoukova, all angles and haughty expression. Her ball routine is done to the dying-swan music from Swan Lake , and is so technically accomplished that she was asked to perform it before the Bolshoi Ballet. Yesterday, though, we spotted her in her civvies - Puffa jacket, tracksuit bottoms, hair scraped back into straggly ponytail - and this, combined with her razor cheekbones, led us to nickname her (perhaps unfairly) Crack Ho. </p> <p>Chippy and Cracky hoover up the medals. In the women's artistic competition, Andreea clocks up two golds and a bronze. Her perky charm reminds me of Olga Korbut; her tumbling is more Comaneci. Simona gets two silvers and a bronze. Elena Zamolodtchikova, a Russian who won Olympic gold on vault and floor, does well, too. </p> <p>But there are more than a few champions who have stayed away - Khorkina, and a couple of other Russians, plus two very talented Chinese girls. There are plenty jostling for top position at the moment. Which might explain gymnastics' dormant popularity. It's renowned as a spectator sport - its seats were some of the quickest to sell out in both Atlanta and Sydney - but in order for it to recapture the news, in order for the little girls to come back in their hordes, it needs a dominant talent. A heroine who can sweep all before her and get the world behind her as she does. An Olga, a Nadia. It nearly had it in the flawed Svetlana Khorkina, but she cracked and fell in Sydney. Perhaps it has it in the tiny, composed form of Andreea Raducan. </p> <p>I watch her at the post-competition press conference. She is asked, again, about losing her Olympic gold. She answers in her sing-song little girl voice, and Octavian Belu translates. 'Andreea says she nearly to stop to do gym because she don't trust the adult people who made her guilty. But she was very impressed by her support, from the people and from important places, and maybe she get a big help from God to be strong. She don't cry or ask for pity. She says: I want to finish with the nightmare in Sydney,' says her coach. 'She says: I want to show what I am able to do.' </p> <p>Andreea looks straight ahead as he speaks. Her medals flash under the lights, but her dark-circled eyes are unreadable.</p>",

She also won gold on the beam, gold on asymmetric bars, bronze on floor and a silver medal with her fellow Romanians in the team event. Even more astonishingly, during the five-day competition, she scored a perfect 10 out of 10 seven times - four times on bars, three on beam - an achievement which remains unbeaten to this day. In July 1976, Nadia Comaneci was 14 years old. It's December 2000, and photographer Zed Nelson and I are wandering around an out-of-town shopping centre outside Glasgow, trying to find a World Cup Final. The International Federation of Gymnastics World Cup Final 1999-2000, no less. You'd think it would be easy to spot, but somehow, among the Sainsbury's and the Salisbury's, the C&amp;A and the M&amp;S, we just can't seem to track the thing down. It's meant to be in an arena and the arena is meant to be near. We check the map, traipse along miles of glinting arcade, our eyes bleeding in the air conditioning. Is the World Cup buried beneath Beaverbrooks? Is it taking place around us, secretly, in the aisles? I start looking carefully at small children in tracksuits, to see if they're gymnasts in disguise. You know how little those Russkies are. Eventually we spot an arrow stuck to a wall near McDonald's, which we follow to the press area. And finally, we find our World Cup. Through double doors into a bright-lit hall which jumps with silent, wild activity, its floor alive with teeny-tiny people swinging around bars, somersaulting on the beam, screaming along the ground like noiseless Formula Ones before chucking their bantam bodies into the air as though propelled from a car crash. The air boils with energy, but the only sounds are the squeak of the bars, the muffled thud of feet on matted floor. I start babbling to Zed: 'Look, there's Andreea Raducan, she won the gold but had it taken from her, and see the one with the ponytail, that's Simona Amanar, she won the silver but took the gold, and that one is the Russian who won floor and vault...' Zed is unimpressed. Our press passes only allow us into the front row of the audience. As far as he is concerned, this is not near enough. It's training day, the only one before the competition, and he was hoping for intimate close-ups. He isn't happy. As for me, the mere fact of breathing the same recycled air as these athletes has made me quite ecstatic. Imagine how excited you'd be to walk into a church and find Zinadine Zidane, Steve Redgrave and Tiger Woods all hanging out at the altar. That's how this feels for me. I am a big gymnastics fan. During the Sydney Olympics, I set my alarm in order to watch the 5 am shift. I followed every twist and turn, every stumble and fall, and I bored everyone I knew with the drama. So, to have some of the principal players running through that same theatre - in real life! right next to me! - makes me gulp. Also, I think I'm experiencing my first-ever Proustian rush. This world of French chalk and springboards and sprung floors and crashmats, of stomach strengtheners and stretching exercises and standing on your hands, is familiar yet long-forgotten. From the age of seven until I moved to London at 21, I spent up to three nights a week practising gymnastics. Why, I don't know: I was pretty good at it, but never strong enough to make Stockport, my county team. Though, on one occasion, I trained at Lilleshall, in the national gymnastics centre. I can still remember it: the tumbling floor was so highly sprung, I threw a back somersault from standing. I gave up at 21, because, well, every gymnast gives up around then. Your body won't do what you tell it any more. Worse, your mind won't tell your body to do it any more. Adulthood brings fear, and gymnastics is impossible if you're afraid. Concentration is essential; consideration - of snapped neck, ripped ears, shattered ankle - spoils everything. When I was 11 and so shortsighted I could barely see my feet, I thought nothing of hurtling at full speed towards a vault that only clicked into focus when I slammed on to the springboard. At 14, I was flinging myself from one uneven bar to another, wrapping my pelvis around a fibreglass pole with no thought for a child-bearing future. Drunk at 17, I'd throw free - no-handed - cartwheels around concrete town centres, chuck flips on park benches, handsprings on dark paths. I was brave. My body was all mine. Until I left home at 18, I trained at Bramhall High, just south of Manchester. It was just a school sports hall, nothing special, with those long ropes that pulled out from the ceiling and wooden climbing bars on the walls. Every session, we'd set up and take down the equipment; click the asymmetric bars into place, French-chalk them, angle their uprights, tighten the steel ropes; lug out the beam, push the mats underneath, the crashmat at the end; set the vault and springboard; lay the floor, its strips held together with Velcro. I look at the beam in the Glasgow arena, and I know its texture - smooth moleskin wrapped around cold, dense wood. I know its height - 4ft, its width - 4in, I can feel it between my fingers - and I know how heavy it is to carry back into a storeroom. It has 'Continental' stamped on its side. All gymnastic equipment is made by Continental. A cameraman squeezes past me. He gestures with his head towards a tumbling tot and says: 'Few whiskies and I could do all this.' Except, of course, he couldn't. And neither could I, not even when I trained so hard that gymnastics danced through my dreams. Actually, neither could the all-conquering Nadia Comaneci, at the very height of her powers. If she were to perform her 1976 perfect-10 routines in front of today's judges, she'd be lucky to get above 8.5. Gymnastics has moved on. I watch the Romanian Andreea Raducan perform a full twisting back somersault on the beam. When Comaneci was Olympic champion, only the top girls could manage such a move on the floor. Raducan did her first triple twist on that apparatus seven years ago. When she was 10. Andreea has grown since, but not much: she's 4ft 7in and weighs 5st. During the Sydney Olympics, a male commentator said, wistfully, 'She has lovely sparkling eyes.' Which she has, and dimples, and a dark, flippy ponytail. She also had the all-around individual Olympic gold medal, Romania's first since Comaneci, for seven whole days, until she was disqualified for failing a drugs test. The Romanian team doctor had prescribed her two Nurofen Cold &amp; Flu tablets for a sniffle; the resulting pseudoephedrine in her urine cost her the gold. Andreea is a superstar now: after the Olympics, when she arrived home on her 17th birthday, she was welcomed into Bucharest's airport by a crowd of thousands, including Romania's prime minister Mugur Isarescu. She received all the privileges traditionally given by her country for winning an Olympic title - a car, an apartment - plus \u00a320,000, twice the money usually awarded. A jeweller made her a replica medal, out of 18ct gold. Someone wrote 'A Song For Andreea Raducan'. And she became the gymnastics fans' darling, worldwide. Every time she takes a rest near the arena barrier, scores of little girls rush up to ask her for her autograph. Little girls, little girls: gymnastics' life-blood and its most dedicated disciples. I started gymnastics in its mad post-Korbut heyday, when every girl under ten wanted to be Olga. I was five when she exploded into the 1972 Olympics, scooping gold on floor and beam, silver on bars. Olga Korbut was the first gymnast ever to perform a back somersault on the beam; I wore my hair like her, in two bunches. In the early to mid-70s, with ambassadors like Korbut and Comaneci, gymnastics was at its popular peak. Even now, when I meet women of my age working in the music business, or in magazines, or PR, or telly, as far from a sporting life as can be imagined, you'd be surprised at how many are ex-gymnasts. We all tried it. Most dropped out, usually in their teenage years; exams took over or boys came along or bodies grew too big, too womanly. The more immature, like me, stuck it out. There was nothing I found that I enjoyed more. Why would I have given up? By the late 70s, though, the image of gymnastics was suffering. Partly because its greatest legend was suffering, too. In 1978, Nadia Comaneci reappeared, post puberty, a stone heavier and, at 5ft 3in, three-and-a-half inches taller than in 1976. By the end of 1979, she'd lost all her weight and was shockingly gaunt, suffering from a bad wrist and blood poisoning. Articles accused her of bulimia, and the 'gymnastics is bad for your health' rumours started. It stunts your growth. You'll never have babies. The champions are only good because they take steroids. The 1980 Moscow Olympics saw Nadia win a controversial overall silver. A year later, her coach, Bela Karolyi, defected to the US, and Nadia disappeared from view. Then, in 1989, Nadia suddenly turned up in the States, fat, sluttish, unresponsive. 'See what happens when you stop taking those Eastern European drugs?' crowed the papers. But she recovered eventually and married Bart Connor, a US gymnast, in 1995. Thousands of well-wishers turned up. Soon after, she was named one of the 100 athletes of the century. Nadia appeared at Andreea Raducan's side during her Sydney appeal: she looked slim, blonde, glamorous. Andreea looked very pale and small. Today, though, Andreea's perky, chatting to her rivals as she waits for her turn on the bars. She's wearing a black Lycra swimsuit-style leotard and black Lycra shorts. In my day, the fashion was for long sleeves with contrasting V necks, or stripes up the inside of the arm. We wore footless tights, with leg warmers; never shorts. The only girls in footless tights here are the modern rhythmic gymnasts down the far end, the long-limbed girls with the ball and the ribbon and the hoop, gymnastics' ballet dancers. Zed is photographing them and I go down to join him. He's focusing on one razor-boned poppet who snaps her ribbon with elegant disdain. 'It doesn't take much imagination to have her dressed in leather and turn that into a whip,' he muses. Gymnasts always score highly in the male fantasy league. It's the bendy sex thing. And also, I think, the fact that you'll never meet a proper gymnast down the pub; and if you did, she wouldn't go out with you, you out-of- condition drunk. Since Comaneci's day, however, sexy gymnasts have become far fewer: Nadia capitalised on the cute acrobat trend started by Korbut, and the womanly, balletic element of gymnastics disappeared after her 1976 triumph, to be replaced by tumbling skills nicked straight from the men. Today's gymnasts are sturdy, and smaller than ever. Russia's pouting Svetlana Khorkina, who recently posed for Playboy , is one of a kind. Whereas once your dad had a choice of curvy beauties to sigh over: Ludmila Tourischeva, Elvira Saadi, Nelli Kim... Nelli Kim! There she is! Unmistakable, even 26 years on, Eurasian cheekbones, lovely smile, the only true challenge to Comaneci in the late 70s, she's clicking across the arena floor surrounded by elderly women in fur coats. I flick through my programme: Kim is head of judges. The fur-coat brigade must be judges, too: they prod at the beam as though it's an on-sale sofa. I grab Nelli as she makes her way to the press area. She hasn't got long and, suddenly, I don't know what to say. I ask her about artistry and luckily it gets her going: she talks of lost elegance and beauty and femininity and of gymnastics being 'the grandmother of all sports'. Nelli tells me she lives in Missouri with her 15-year-old daughter; that she judges and coaches and lectures in gymnastics. Occasionally, Nelli performs her old medal-winning routines; in her sleep, in her dreams. The next day dawns drizzly. Not that we care; we taxi between hotel and out-of-town shopping centre. We never see the weather, or pavements. Several competitors are staying at our hotel, with their coaches and chaperones. I checked out what the gymnasts ate for tea: mostly salmon and salad, though some boys had Yorkshire puddings. Men's gymnastics has never caught the world's imagination in the way that women's has. Perhaps it's the lack of music for the floor exercises; perhaps it's because they look like they're built for gym, with their super-buff torsos, their over-muscled legs. It's no surprise that they can throw themselves around a bit, is it? Still, there are some stars. At the arena, during warm-up, I hear two teenage girls behind me discuss Gervasio Deferr, the pierced and tattooed Spanish Olympic vault champion. 'Ten out of 10 for the hair,' says one. 'Ten out of 10 for the body,' says the other, and they collapse into giggles. The atmosphere today is far more serious; even Andreea has stopped smiling. The coaches are more evident, arms folded, ignoring each other, barking instructions. There are few women coaches. And the men, it seems, all have Freddie Mercury moustaches. The World Cup Final is a two-day event; the last international competition of 2000. The top eight performers on each apparatus are due to compete today, although, post-Olympics, some haven't bothered to show, including Russia's Number One Svetlana Khorkina, who's off taking the Yankee dollar in an exhibition tour across the States. Romania has brought its two best gymnasts: Andreea, and Simona Amanar, who was made all-around Olympic champion after Andreea's disqualification. Initially, Simona declined her medal, but then took it, 'for Romania'. China's Liu Xuan, bumped up from fourth into third, refused to take hers. Yesterday, I spoke to Octavian Belu, Romanian national coach since Bela Karolyi's 1981 defection, and he said that Andreea, 'a child', had found it hard to have her gold taken from her 'through a stupid error of adult people'. 'Why the small must pay for mistake of big person?' he asked, his arms spread wide. Andreea still took home one gold medal, for her part in Romania's team win: Belu trains his gymnasts to think of their team first, their individual performance second. Even today, in a specifically individual competition, you notice how supportive the two Romanian girls are of each other. They both earn their share of whoops from the far-from-capacity crowd. But it's the rhythmic gymnasts who steal the show. When I was young, I turned my nose up at rhythmic gymnastics - not pure enough, the gymnastic equivalent of synchronised swimming - but watching today, I change my mind. The top three girls are very closely matched: all a joy to watch. The two Russians are gorgeous, too, which helps. Zed is really quite taken with one, Alina Kabaeva, the world's number one. He calls her Chippy, because he thinks she's got a chipmunk face. I prefer the other Russian, Yulia Barsoukova, all angles and haughty expression. Her ball routine is done to the dying-swan music from Swan Lake , and is so technically accomplished that she was asked to perform it before the Bolshoi Ballet. Yesterday, though, we spotted her in her civvies - Puffa jacket, tracksuit bottoms, hair scraped back into straggly ponytail - and this, combined with her razor cheekbones, led us to nickname her (perhaps unfairly) Crack Ho. Chippy and Cracky hoover up the medals. In the women's artistic competition, Andreea clocks up two golds and a bronze. Her perky charm reminds me of Olga Korbut; her tumbling is more Comaneci. Simona gets two silvers and a bronze. Elena Zamolodtchikova, a Russian who won Olympic gold on vault and floor, does well, too. But there are more than a few champions who have stayed away - Khorkina, and a couple of other Russians, plus two very talented Chinese girls. There are plenty jostling for top position at the moment. Which might explain gymnastics' dormant popularity. It's renowned as a spectator sport - its seats were some of the quickest to sell out in both Atlanta and Sydney - but in order for it to recapture the news, in order for the little girls to come back in their hordes, it needs a dominant talent. A heroine who can sweep all before her and get the world behind her as she does. An Olga, a Nadia. It nearly had it in the flawed Svetlana Khorkina, but she cracked and fell in Sydney. Perhaps it has it in the tiny, composed form of Andreea Raducan. I watch her at the post-competition press conference. She is asked, again, about losing her Olympic gold. She answers in her sing-song little girl voice, and Octavian Belu translates. 'Andreea says she nearly to stop to do gym because she don't trust the adult people who made her guilty. But she was very impressed by her support, from the people and from important places, and maybe she get a big help from God to be strong. She don't cry or ask for pity. She says: I want to finish with the nightmare in Sydney,' says her coach. 'She says: I want to show what I am able to do.' Andreea looks straight ahead as he speaks. Her medals flash under the lights, but her dark-circled eyes are unreadable.",

      "body": "<p>Every year in Britain, about 27,000 couples receive fertility treatment, although only one in six is successful. There are babies who are born who were not planned or wanted. There are babies who are born after medical help, and for their parents they seem like a miracle. And then there are the babies who are not born who are desperately wanted and struggled for; whose absence is felt as a deep loss and mourned like a bereavement. </p> <p>According to Child, the National Infertility Support Network, infertility now affects one in six couples, and the number that seek help is up by 55 per cent in the last five years. An awful lot of hope and misery is hidden under this statistic. Yet those of us who are lucky, who don't have any reproductive problems, who spend the early part of our sexual life avoiding pregnancy, the next part having the number of children that we want, and who can take our fertility and the invisible workings of our body for granted - how much do we actually care, after all? </p> <p>A survey was recently carried out in Oregon, in which people were asked to assess how important they thought different health services were, and how important to the community as a whole - their responses were married to costs, thus giving a crude assessment of health priorities. If something was not very important, but cheap, it moved up the table; if something else was important but exorbitant, price pushed it down. The responses were not entirely predictable; some of them were heartening. People cared more about Aids and Alzheimer's, say, than had been expected. But the one thing that scored surprisingly low was infertility. Perhaps this is because we don't know what to think about childlessness in general, either enforced or voluntary, or how to place it. </p> <p>Until a few decades ago, it was regarded as a woman's function and duty to bear children if she married. To be a woman was to be a mother. Men sow and women bear fruit. The present gives birth to the future. If a woman had no maternal longings, that was her problem. On the other side of the coin, there was nothing a couple could do about problems in having children. It wasn't really a health issue, but a rough hand dealt by fate. 'Let nature take its course'; 'What will be will be.' And it was also a secret. A stigma. A failure. Unnaturalness and incompleteness. Men who had low sperm counts were, somehow, less of a man (in rather the same way that today, young boys who become teenager fathers see it as a sign of their macho virility: sure evidence that they've 'done it').

      "bodyText": "Every year in Britain, about 27,000 couples receive fertility treatment, although only one in six is successful. There are babies who are born who were not planned or wanted. There are babies who are born after medical help, and for their parents they seem like a miracle. And then there are the babies who are not born who are desperately wanted and struggled for; whose absence is felt as a deep loss and mourned like a bereavement. According to Child, the National Infertility Support Network, infertility now affects one in six couples, and the number that seek help is up by 55 per cent in the last five years. An awful lot of hope and misery is hidden under this statistic. Yet those of us who are lucky, who don't have any reproductive problems, who spend the early part of our sexual life avoiding pregnancy, the next part having the number of children that we want, and who can take our fertility and the invisible workings of our body for granted - how much do we actually care, after all? A survey was recently carried out in Oregon, in which people were asked to assess how important they thought different health services were, and how important to the community as a whole - their responses were married to costs, thus giving a crude assessment of health priorities. If something was not very important, but cheap, it moved up the table; if something else was important but exorbitant, price pushed it down. The responses were not entirely predictable; some of them were heartening. People cared more about Aids and Alzheimer's, say, than had been expected. But the one thing that scored surprisingly low was infertility. Perhaps this is because we don't know what to think about childlessness in general, either enforced or voluntary, or how to place it. Until a few decades ago, it was regarded as a woman's function and duty to bear children if she married. To be a woman was to be a mother. Men sow and women bear fruit. The present gives birth to the future. If a woman had no maternal longings, that was her problem. On the other side of the coin, there was nothing a couple could do about problems in having children. It wasn't really a health issue, but a rough hand dealt by fate. 'Let nature take its course'; 'What will be will be.' And it was also a secret. A stigma. A failure. Unnaturalness and incompleteness. Men who had low sperm counts were, somehow, less of a man (in rather the same way that today, young boys who become teenager fathers see it as a sign of their macho virility: sure evidence that they've 'done it'). Women who failed to conceive were barren, empty, useless; the seed was falling on stony ground. It used to be a ground for divorce. For many couples, it remains a reason. Even now, when one in 80 children are born with medical help, we are ambivalent about fertility treatment. It raises such ethical dilemmas and poses such large, spooky questions.

Fertility facts One in 80 children born in Britain today was conceived as a result of IVF. One in six couples try infertility treatment. Denmark has the highest proportion of test-tube babies in Europe - 2.6 per cent of all live births (it is 1.2 per cent in the UK). IVF can produce high rates of multiple births because up to three embryos can be implanted in the uterus. 27 per cent of all IVF births produce two or more babies, compared to 1.4 per cent of all babies conceived naturally. 47 per cent of individual babies born as a result of IVF came from a multiple pregnancy. One third of all infertility is caused by male fertility difficulties, one third by female factors and another third is unaccounted for.80 per cent of infertility treatment is carried out privately. \u0095 Some names have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>I wake up to discover that my wife has already broken my New Year resolution not to introduce more than eight children into the house before a male parent has had the chance to think up a plausible reason to vacate it, but how else is she supposed to offer free unlimited cr\u00e8che facilities to anyone she has ever met in the supermarket on the grounds that you never know when we might have enough money left to go to the Comet sale one year, and where would we be without a few morally indebted neighbours to have our four miscreants round at their house for a few short hours running riot and eating them out of Penguin biscuits? </p> <p>But then I suddenly remember I have my own alternative pressing engagement, owing to my mum ringing up on Wednesday to give me five minutes' notice that it's their golden wedding anniversary and dad is being rushed out of hospital for the occasion, so if I do just fancy popping hundreds of miles up the motorway and back the same day at the drop of a hat maybe I could find room in the car for the old sofa that John and Fiona didn't want but which will go nicely in the dining room where dad has to sleep, it being just the right green to go with the cushion on his commode. But golden wedding! It doesn't seem 25 years since I missed their silver one. Naturally I'm quite keen to make an early departure from this temple of chaos but my wife is making such a banquet of taking all the seats out of our Fiat people carrier and unscrewing the legs off the sofa and carrying it single-handedly downstairs in grudging deference to my poor left arm, which has done itself a mischief trying to keep up with the right one on the rowing machine in our local gym, where they are offering injury holidays throughout January for people who can't afford to go skiing. </p> <p>'Hurry up,' I suggest, unnecessarily holding the tailgate up while she opines that there is indeed something to be said for observing the ritual of congratulating married couples on having gone another year without killing each other. Which is all very amusing but did it cross her mind to get a card? The answer is no. Apparently they are, after all, my parents. But luckily we do have a bottle of Asti spumanti that just needs the raffle ticket taking off, plus a giant box of chocolates with only one layer missing left over from Christmas, and the children have cobbled together a set of unstable golden candlesticks out of clay and glitter so that my mum can set the curtains on fire when the electric meter runs out. </p> <p>Ten minutes later I'm thundering up the M11, with just the eldest to keep me entertained with his monologue on the endless variety of 007's novelty weaponry in the Nintendo 64 version of The World Is Not Enough and the arm of a Habitat three-seater clomping into the back of my head every time I put the brakes on. The journey seems very long, but at last we are pulling up outside Mum's and putting CrookLocks on all the wheels. I am slightly concerned about my dad having to drag the sofa up the icy path on his Zimmer frame - he is quite active for someone who has had four strokes - but my brother and sisters are here with all their towering grown-up sons and daughters, and I'm sure they won't mind coming out to push in eight different directions at once as soon they have finished admiring my new I, Claudius haircut, which according to Bunny, my barber, is just the thing to avoid waking up one day to find Arthur Scargill staring out from the bathroom mirror. </p> <p>My dad is thrilled with the chocolates. Unfortunately, he is not allowed to eat any of them. Mum says if he has too much sugar he gets up in the middle of the night and starts getting dressed for work and she has to run down and remind him that he retired 11 years ago. 'That's what you think,' he says. Though it is lovely to have him home, Mum says. There are sausage rolls and quartered pork pies and cups of tea and fruitcake, and the house full of children. Happily, nearly all of us are over 21.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:phil.hogan@observer.co.uk\">phil.hogan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "I wake up to discover that my wife has already broken my New Year resolution not to introduce more than eight children into the house before a male parent has had the chance to think up a plausible reason to vacate it, but how else is she supposed to offer free unlimited cr\u00e8che facilities to anyone she has ever met in the supermarket on the grounds that you never know when we might have enough money left to go to the Comet sale one year, and where would we be without a few morally indebted neighbours to have our four miscreants round at their house for a few short hours running riot and eating them out of Penguin biscuits? But then I suddenly remember I have my own alternative pressing engagement, owing to my mum ringing up on Wednesday to give me five minutes' notice that it's their golden wedding anniversary and dad is being rushed out of hospital for the occasion, so if I do just fancy popping hundreds of miles up the motorway and back the same day at the drop of a hat maybe I could find room in the car for the old sofa that John and Fiona didn't want but which will go nicely in the dining room where dad has to sleep, it being just the right green to go with the cushion on his commode. But golden wedding! It doesn't seem 25 years since I missed their silver one. Naturally I'm quite keen to make an early departure from this temple of chaos but my wife is making such a banquet of taking all the seats out of our Fiat people carrier and unscrewing the legs off the sofa and carrying it single-handedly downstairs in grudging deference to my poor left arm, which has done itself a mischief trying to keep up with the right one on the rowing machine in our local gym, where they are offering injury holidays throughout January for people who can't afford to go skiing. 'Hurry up,' I suggest, unnecessarily holding the tailgate up while she opines that there is indeed something to be said for observing the ritual of congratulating married couples on having gone another year without killing each other. Which is all very amusing but did it cross her mind to get a card? The answer is no. Apparently they are, after all, my parents. But luckily we do have a bottle of Asti spumanti that just needs the raffle ticket taking off, plus a giant box of chocolates with only one layer missing left over from Christmas, and the children have cobbled together a set of unstable golden candlesticks out of clay and glitter so that my mum can set the curtains on fire when the electric meter runs out. Ten minutes later I'm thundering up the M11, with just the eldest to keep me entertained with his monologue on the endless variety of 007's novelty weaponry in the Nintendo 64 version of The World Is Not Enough and the arm of a Habitat three-seater clomping into the back of my head every time I put the brakes on. The journey seems very long, but at last we are pulling up outside Mum's and putting CrookLocks on all the wheels. I am slightly concerned about my dad having to drag the sofa up the icy path on his Zimmer frame - he is quite active for someone who has had four strokes - but my brother and sisters are here with all their towering grown-up sons and daughters, and I'm sure they won't mind coming out to push in eight different directions at once as soon they have finished admiring my new I, Claudius haircut, which according to Bunny, my barber, is just the thing to avoid waking up one day to find Arthur Scargill staring out from the bathroom mirror. My dad is thrilled with the chocolates. Unfortunately, he is not allowed to eat any of them. Mum says if he has too much sugar he gets up in the middle of the night and starts getting dressed for work and she has to run down and remind him that he retired 11 years ago. 'That's what you think,' he says. Though it is lovely to have him home, Mum says. There are sausage rolls and quartered pork pies and cups of tea and fruitcake, and the house full of children. Happily, nearly all of us are over 21. phil.hogan@observer.co.uk",

Depending on your view, that's either sweetly romantic or idiotically naive, maybe a combination of both. These days, the pressure seems to be on, for all of us, but especially women, to 'shop' wisely, cold bloodedly, for a suitable mate, just as one would for any other commodity.

So this would be the psychosexual version of cutting your coat according to your cloth. Good-looking, confident girls get the good-looking, successful guys, and the Plain Janes with low self-esteem get the boring jerks who can't get laid to save their lives.

It's entirely possible for the same woman to feel like one of the the ugliest freaks in the world one second, and borderline-beautiful the next. Which somewhat makes a mockery of the argument that how beautiful a woman feels she is dictates which mate she will end up with. In reality, it's always been more a case of how beautiful he thinks she is. The good-looking man choosing the good-looking woman, rather than vice versa.

Like most women, I've tended to just sort of mooch about, quasi passively, making yes/no decisions about the ones who liked me.

      "body": "<b> The Elixir of Love</b> Opera North, Leeds <br> <b> Park Lane Group New Year Series </b> Purcell Room, London SW1 <p> Donizetti's <b> The Elixir of Love</b>, premiered in Milan in 1832, had a roughly contemporary setting. Daniel Slater's Opera North production relocates the action to the Fifties and in the symbolic code of opera stagings, 'Fifties Italy' means heat, sensuality, a little light skulduggery, bright skies and even brighter people. So it is here. It doesn't matter whether that's what the Fifties were really like in Italy; this is a magical place where the sort of things that go on in nineteenth-century Italian comic opera might really happen. </p> <p>So Slater's choice of location works well enough, and Robert Innes Hopkins's designs radiate everything that we northern Europeans might think of as Mediterranean warmth. The risk is that we spend too much time spotting authentic period detail when we should be attending to the drama.

      "bodyText": "The Elixir of Love Opera North, Leeds Park Lane Group New Year Series Purcell Room, London SW1 Donizetti's The Elixir of Love, premiered in Milan in 1832, had a roughly contemporary setting. Daniel Slater's Opera North production relocates the action to the Fifties and in the symbolic code of opera stagings, 'Fifties Italy' means heat, sensuality, a little light skulduggery, bright skies and even brighter people. So it is here. It doesn't matter whether that's what the Fifties were really like in Italy; this is a magical place where the sort of things that go on in nineteenth-century Italian comic opera might really happen. So Slater's choice of location works well enough, and Robert Innes Hopkins's designs radiate everything that we northern Europeans might think of as Mediterranean warmth. The risk is that we spend too much time spotting authentic period detail when we should be attending to the drama. Sure enough, there's the Gaggia espresso machine, and here comes an echt-Fifties scooter. Donizetti labelled The Elixir not an opera buffa but an opera comica, which suggests a certain distance, albeit short, from standard knockabout. Our hero, Nemorino, may not be a sophisticate, but through drinking Dulcamara's bogus elixir (plain old wine) he learns a little about himself and about his beloved Adina.

      "body": "<p><strong> Cast Away </strong> (144 mins, 12) Directed by Robert Zemeckis; starring Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, Nick Searcy </p> <p> From Shakespeare's The Tempest and Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe to William Golding's Lord of the Flies and the 1964 science-fiction movie Robinson Crusoe on Mars, writers have been intrigued by the notion of people cast ashore on desert islands. Audiences share this fascination and every week since Roy Plomley devised Desert Island Discs in 1942 several million listeners have tuned in to hear how various celebrities would cope with loneliness and privation, and what eight gramophone records they'd take with them to ease the pain. </p> <p>The latest exercise in the Crusoe genre is Cast Away, which reunites Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, the director and star of Forrest Gump, which was, of course, an updating of another eighteenth-century moral fiction, Voltaire's Candide. </p> <p>Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a workaholic FedEx systems engineer who spends his time flying around the world trying to make his company's parcel delivery service faster than that of its rivals. We first meet him a couple of blocks from Red Square trying to imbue FedEx's Moscow branch with the Stakhanovite spirit. 'We live or die by the clock,' he tells them. </p> <p>Back home in Memphis, Tennessee, he has a fianc\u00e9e, Kelly (Helen Hunt), a research scientist working on her doctorate and, except for a nagging tooth, all seems well with his life. After a pre-Christmas dinner, he promises to be home for New Year and possible nuptials, after he's accompanied a Fed-Ex cargo plane to the Antipodes. Unfortunately, the plane loses radio contact with Tahiti in a storm and in a superbly extended crash sequence that leaves you searching for a seat belt, Chuck is washed up on a small island, the only survivor. </p> <p>Robinson Crusoe actually had it lucky with a wrecked ship from which to salvage for rifles, gunpowder, tools, clothes, timber and so on. He also had a rather grand island to explore, to map and to colonise. Chuck Noland, whose name suggests someone dumped in no man's land, has wound up on a hard place as inhospitably rocky as the one that provided the briefest of sanctuaries to the eponymous hero of William Golding's brilliant and remorseless Pincher Martin. </p> <p>Chuck has nothing except for a few random parcels, containing a woman's party dress, a pair of ice-skates, a volleyball, some VHS cassettes and a document annulling a marriage. When the body of his dead pilot is washed up, he keeps the man's boots but can't bring himself to remove the belt. Crusoe managed to retrieve some of the ship's instruments; Chuck has a fine pocket watch, a family heirloom given him by his fianc\u00e9e, whose photo is in the cover. </p> <p>The first days on the island are well managed - the discovery of coconuts, the shaping of tools, the hope of imminent rescue, the descent into despair. The film's colour is cold, unromantic, quite unlike the gorgeous Technicolor hues of the 1949 (British) and 1980 (American) versions of The Blue Lagoon, both shot in the same area of the South Seas. </p> <p>There are neat details here. The retrieved volleyball is given a face painted in blood, named Wilson after its manufacturer, and becomes a cross between a mute companion and a fetishist Cargo Cult object. An ice skate becomes a primitive dental tool for the most painful exercise in sadomasochistic orthodontics since Marathon Man. </p> <p>Unlike Crusoe, Noland defecates (hiding behind a bush) and urinates boldly into the sea, and it's during a moonlight slash that he spots a distant light which raises rapidly dashed hopes of rescue. Of his sexual yearnings, we hear nothing and, unlike Crusoe, he has little in the way of larger social or spiritual experiences. </p> <p>There's no frisson like the solitary footstep on the sand. No modern Man Friday appears.

      "bodyText": "Cast Away (144 mins, 12) Directed by Robert Zemeckis; starring Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, Nick Searcy From Shakespeare's The Tempest and Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe to William Golding's Lord of the Flies and the 1964 science-fiction movie Robinson Crusoe on Mars, writers have been intrigued by the notion of people cast ashore on desert islands. Audiences share this fascination and every week since Roy Plomley devised Desert Island Discs in 1942 several million listeners have tuned in to hear how various celebrities would cope with loneliness and privation, and what eight gramophone records they'd take with them to ease the pain. The latest exercise in the Crusoe genre is Cast Away, which reunites Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, the director and star of Forrest Gump, which was, of course, an updating of another eighteenth-century moral fiction, Voltaire's Candide. Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a workaholic FedEx systems engineer who spends his time flying around the world trying to make his company's parcel delivery service faster than that of its rivals. We first meet him a couple of blocks from Red Square trying to imbue FedEx's Moscow branch with the Stakhanovite spirit. 'We live or die by the clock,' he tells them. Back home in Memphis, Tennessee, he has a fianc\u00e9e, Kelly (Helen Hunt), a research scientist working on her doctorate and, except for a nagging tooth, all seems well with his life. After a pre-Christmas dinner, he promises to be home for New Year and possible nuptials, after he's accompanied a Fed-Ex cargo plane to the Antipodes. Unfortunately, the plane loses radio contact with Tahiti in a storm and in a superbly extended crash sequence that leaves you searching for a seat belt, Chuck is washed up on a small island, the only survivor. Robinson Crusoe actually had it lucky with a wrecked ship from which to salvage for rifles, gunpowder, tools, clothes, timber and so on. He also had a rather grand island to explore, to map and to colonise. Chuck Noland, whose name suggests someone dumped in no man's land, has wound up on a hard place as inhospitably rocky as the one that provided the briefest of sanctuaries to the eponymous hero of William Golding's brilliant and remorseless Pincher Martin. Chuck has nothing except for a few random parcels, containing a woman's party dress, a pair of ice-skates, a volleyball, some VHS cassettes and a document annulling a marriage. When the body of his dead pilot is washed up, he keeps the man's boots but can't bring himself to remove the belt. Crusoe managed to retrieve some of the ship's instruments; Chuck has a fine pocket watch, a family heirloom given him by his fianc\u00e9e, whose photo is in the cover. The first days on the island are well managed - the discovery of coconuts, the shaping of tools, the hope of imminent rescue, the descent into despair. The film's colour is cold, unromantic, quite unlike the gorgeous Technicolor hues of the 1949 (British) and 1980 (American) versions of The Blue Lagoon, both shot in the same area of the South Seas. There are neat details here. The retrieved volleyball is given a face painted in blood, named Wilson after its manufacturer, and becomes a cross between a mute companion and a fetishist Cargo Cult object. An ice skate becomes a primitive dental tool for the most painful exercise in sadomasochistic orthodontics since Marathon Man. Unlike Crusoe, Noland defecates (hiding behind a bush) and urinates boldly into the sea, and it's during a moonlight slash that he spots a distant light which raises rapidly dashed hopes of rescue. Of his sexual yearnings, we hear nothing and, unlike Crusoe, he has little in the way of larger social or spiritual experiences. There's no frisson like the solitary footstep on the sand. No modern Man Friday appears. In fact, there are no unforgettable images that lodge in the mind like those scenes in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Robinson Crusoe, where the hero climbs a hill to shout out the Twenty-third Psalm as a defiant challenge to an indifferent universe, or where Friday innocently puts on a woman's dress and throws Crusoe into a perverse crisis of revulsion and attraction. Cast Away, in fact, jumps four years from the first terrible weeks to the final period, when Noland has adapted to his new environment, but is preparing to escape on a raft. The big change is not internal (we never discover his religion, his politics or his aesthetic interests other than his love of Elvis Presley) but purely physical. Tom Hanks spent 18 months getting into condition for the second part of the movie under Dr Paul McAuley, credited as 'Weight Loss Adviser', and the American Humane Society saw to it that in the scenes involving the skewering of crabs and other foodstuffs 'no animal was harmed'. To reveal that Hanks makes it home is merely to acknowledge that this is a big-budget Hollywood picture, produced by its star, and there is a drawn-out, sentimental coda that more or less re-enacts Tennyson's 'Enoch Arden', that great Victorian poem about a desert-island survivor returning to discover that life has changed and his wife has remarried. Weirdly, however, this finale turns into a tribute to Noland's employers, and the real-life boss of the organisation, Paul Smith (billed 'As Himself'), turns up to welcome Chuck back to 'the FedEx family'. Unlike FedEx, however, Cast Away finishes up delivering a neatly wrapped, somewhat disappointing package rather slowly.",

Out with the old, in with the firm and shiny, taut and trim... this was TV's designated National Inadequacy Week. 'Happiness is something we all want,' warned Nigel Planer's voiceover at the start of BBC1's The Secret Life of Happiness. So, will more money make us happy? Well, here was media-friendly, Schadenfreude-inducing Lottery winner Karl Crompton (\u00a310.9 million) to tell us why it won't: 'The main problem has been jealousy!' Karl gave a million pounds each to his mum, dad and brother and now flies helicopters, drives fast cars, sponsors a motorbike team and is 'project managing' the completion of the obligatory Lottery dream home. </p> <p> Unfortunately, he has also lost his best friend - the friend who thought \u00a3100,000 was a tangible measure of their mateship. But Karl had told him: 'If I give you \u00a3100,000, do I give \u00a380,000 to someone else I've known for less time? Do I put a price on all your heads?' Personally, I think, Karl might succeed in dampening some of this envy if he avoided appearing quite so often on television. </p> <p> The best advertisement for happiness seemed to be Kelly Holmes, thrilled with her Olympic 800m bronze simply because she hadn't expected a medal at all (tip: set yourself relatively low goals and then accidentally exceed them). Or perhaps happiness might come as part of the DNA package, especially if one was born as half of a pair of irritatingly giggly identical twins: 'What makes you laugh most, Daphne?' asked Barbara. 'You!' replied Daphne, laughing. This year, then, I shall enter the London marathon in the expectation that I will pass out with cramp long before I've waddled a mile. Imagine my joy, laughter and the accompanying serotonin-high if I were to complete two miles. Weak with happiness just thinking about it - maybe I'll just carry on thinking about it after all. </p> <p> My word, I'm feeling optimistic now. Got a bad track record when it comes to relationships? Never fear: Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider are two terrifyingly thin and fearsome Manhattanites - a cross between party-scene extras from Sex And The City and Channel 5's no-nonsense House Doctor, Ann Maurice - who wrote a book called The Rules which promises to bludgeon the man of one's dreams into marriage, whether he wants it or not. On hand to test The Rules, in C4's Living By The Book, were three women, including Karen, 28, a divorced mother of one, who tended to be just a wee bit needy 'and wifey' with boyfriends. </p> <p> 'I'm shocked,' said Ellen as she watched a video of Karen preparing an elaborate dinner for David, a man she'd known only a month. 'You only make dinner on his birthday,' agreed a disapproving Sherrie. 'She sounds desperate.' 'No man marries you because you're making a perfect whatever-she's-making. This is a Monday ? This is so not meant to be happening. He's getting a frightened look on his face,' raved Ellen. </p> <p> Soon, however, thanks to at least some of 'the rules' (Karen ignored 'wear short skirts and get a nose job', but went along with 'always end a phone call first', 'don't accept a Saturday night date after Wednesday' and 'be a creature unlike any other') she had David wrapped around her little finger; emotional foreplay that would, apparently, result in her getting something even shinier wrapped around another finger. Then David invited Karen away for a week in Tunisia, discovered her copy of The Rules and they argued non-stop. Karen dumped him a month later which, for a former serial dumpee, was presumably a victory of sorts. </p> <p> There had been so much press surrounding Channel 4's Perfect Breasts that, to be honest, I was feeling desperately inadequate long before I saw the show. Unlike all my female columnar peers, not only had I not yet written a thousand frothing words about the tragedy of teenage girls wanting breast implants but I was still a pathetically unfashionable 36B. Obviously, something had to give and bigger boobs could well be the key to my elusive happiness. After all, having lived with these ones most of my life, they're starting to bore me - and what self- respecting woman wears the same shoes they were wearing 20 years ago? </p> <p> 'Life's tough when you've got no boobs,' intoned several serious, doll-faced young women. While 19-year-old Laura's floppy funbags were getting her down so much she was starting to scowl like Patsy Palmer. 'I thought swimming might do it,' said Laura's dad, Gill, 'but Laura can't swim. 'How would you feel if you had a small penis?' said Laura. 'It's not the same thing at all,' said Gill. 'Yes it is.' 'No it isn't...' </p> <p> Happily, however, Laura's mum had the full measure of her daughter's misery and took her off to Harley Street where Laura gently fondled 350 cubic centimetres of silicone. I was poised to make the call myself - at least until the operation, which was both hilarious and horrific by turns. No, fresh perky breasts might well bring me considerable joy, but I am not ready to have my fleshy scatter-cushions restuffed quite so brutally. Apparently, they need replacing quite often, too, but if you can't buy the pads in the John Lewis sale and do it yourself, I'm really not interested. </p> <p> Perhaps a New Year diet will do the trick? 'Dieting's like being with Liz Taylor,' said Arabella 'Does my bum look big in this?' Weir, in Channel 4's To Diet For. 'You must know from the start that it's not going to work...' From flat-chested flappers to Twiggy and Kate Moss, a century of skinny-minnies were paraded for our envious delectation: 'Women look better slim,' said an unrepentant Mary Quant, 'and clothes look better if some of the bones show'. Sadly, I don't think she was talking about underwiring. </p> <p> This was an amusing programme, with a pithy commentary from Mel Giedroyc, but, so keen was it to trash the concept of faddy diets - something ghastly from the 1960s called The New Sego Spoon-Up from Pet, to SlimFast, the F-Plan, the Cambridge and The Zone - in favour of witty soundbites from Ms Weir, that even when it came across a diet that works, it didn't dare spoil the fun. Last year, reader, I lost a stone in three weeks thanks to Dr Atkins' high protein, low-carb Diet Revolution and felt great, even before I'd found out that Jennifer Aniston, Anna Wintour and Nigella Lawson were all devotees. Nigella was featured on To Diet For but they weren't about to let a cute documentary idea get in the way of the truth: that you really can eat, as Ms Lawson admitted, 'egg and bacon for breakfast... butter sauces with steak... and as much fat and protein as you like', and lose weight. Perhaps the best short-term advice, though, came from Weir: 'Never eat in the nude.' </p> <p> Fully dressed (with a smile), abdominals rippling and a packet of trusty macadamia nuts to hand, perhaps it is only my unhappy head that still needs fixing? Time to check into groovy country hotel, Babington House, with BBC2's Confidence Lab (and, in a very good week for resting comedians doing voiceover work, Dawn French). </p> <p> The first episode in this new series concentrated on instilling confidence into Nigel the 'lazy-minded' chef and Maria, a charity worker who is so terrified of public speaking that she vomits and pulls out her hair. </p> <p>Coached and coaxed by a battalion of therapists - psychiatrists, business psychologists, body language experts, communications coaches, voice coaches, dance therapists, sports motivators and more besides - Nigel and Maria eventually emerged, tearily, into a bright new world of success, achievement and rampant positivity. </p> <p> It was lovely, really, but also quite an exhausting emotional journey, even for the viewer. 'Unzip the clavicles,' said the beautifully named dance therapist, Kerry Ribchester, to Nigel. Later, Nigel admitted that he would probably have preferred to unzip her Rib-chesters: 'Big thank you to Kerry. You're inspirational, you're sassy, you're sexy... and \"sorry\" to your boyfriend.' Nigel is now in charge of food for 170 Whitbread pubs, while Maria even enjoys making presentations to the police. Yes, there's no doubt at all that a week spent on Dr Atkins's diet at Babington House with a copy of The Rules and a Wonderbra will ensure unbridled happiness for all.</p>",

After all, having lived with these ones most of my life, they're starting to bore me - and what self- respecting woman wears the same shoes they were wearing 20 years ago? 'Life's tough when you've got no boobs,' intoned several serious, doll-faced young women. While 19-year-old Laura's floppy funbags were getting her down so much she was starting to scowl like Patsy Palmer. 'I thought swimming might do it,' said Laura's dad, Gill, 'but Laura can't swim. 'How would you feel if you had a small penis?' said Laura. 'It's not the same thing at all,' said Gill. 'Yes it is.' 'No it isn't...' Happily, however, Laura's mum had the full measure of her daughter's misery and took her off to Harley Street where Laura gently fondled 350 cubic centimetres of silicone. I was poised to make the call myself - at least until the operation, which was both hilarious and horrific by turns. No, fresh perky breasts might well bring me considerable joy, but I am not ready to have my fleshy scatter-cushions restuffed quite so brutally. Apparently, they need replacing quite often, too, but if you can't buy the pads in the John Lewis sale and do it yourself, I'm really not interested. Perhaps a New Year diet will do the trick? 'Dieting's like being with Liz Taylor,' said Arabella 'Does my bum look big in this?' Weir, in Channel 4's To Diet For. 'You must know from the start that it's not going to work...' From flat-chested flappers to Twiggy and Kate Moss, a century of skinny-minnies were paraded for our envious delectation: 'Women look better slim,' said an unrepentant Mary Quant, 'and clothes look better if some of the bones show'. Sadly, I don't think she was talking about underwiring. This was an amusing programme, with a pithy commentary from Mel Giedroyc, but, so keen was it to trash the concept of faddy diets - something ghastly from the 1960s called The New Sego Spoon-Up from Pet, to SlimFast, the F-Plan, the Cambridge and The Zone - in favour of witty soundbites from Ms Weir, that even when it came across a diet that works, it didn't dare spoil the fun. Last year, reader, I lost a stone in three weeks thanks to Dr Atkins' high protein, low-carb Diet Revolution and felt great, even before I'd found out that Jennifer Aniston, Anna Wintour and Nigella Lawson were all devotees. Nigella was featured on To Diet For but they weren't about to let a cute documentary idea get in the way of the truth: that you really can eat, as Ms Lawson admitted, 'egg and bacon for breakfast... butter sauces with steak... and as much fat and protein as you like', and lose weight. Perhaps the best short-term advice, though, came from Weir: 'Never eat in the nude.' Fully dressed (with a smile), abdominals rippling and a packet of trusty macadamia nuts to hand, perhaps it is only my unhappy head that still needs fixing? Time to check into groovy country hotel, Babington House, with BBC2's Confidence Lab (and, in a very good week for resting comedians doing voiceover work, Dawn French). The first episode in this new series concentrated on instilling confidence into Nigel the 'lazy-minded' chef and Maria, a charity worker who is so terrified of public speaking that she vomits and pulls out her hair. Coached and coaxed by a battalion of therapists - psychiatrists, business psychologists, body language experts, communications coaches, voice coaches, dance therapists, sports motivators and more besides - Nigel and Maria eventually emerged, tearily, into a bright new world of success, achievement and rampant positivity. It was lovely, really, but also quite an exhausting emotional journey, even for the viewer. 'Unzip the clavicles,' said the beautifully named dance therapist, Kerry Ribchester, to Nigel. Later, Nigel admitted that he would probably have preferred to unzip her Rib-chesters: 'Big thank you to Kerry. You're inspirational, you're sassy, you're sexy... and \"sorry\" to your boyfriend.' Nigel is now in charge of food for 170 Whitbread pubs, while Maria even enjoys making presentations to the police. Yes, there's no doubt at all that a week spent on Dr Atkins's diet at Babington House with a copy of The Rules and a Wonderbra will ensure unbridled happiness for all.",

      "body": "<p>Around this time of year, financial institutions are fond of publishing surveys showing that, if you gave up eating chocolate, made your own sandwiches and stopped going for a quick drink after work, you could be rich. Perhaps they are right. But why give up life's small pleasures when you could save far more by cutting back on what you spend on the boring stuff? </p> <p>Could it be that doing something about the boring stuff is, well, so boring as to be apathy-inducing? </p> <p>It would appear so. According to a recent report by the Department of Trade and Industry on consumer attitudes to switching suppliers, most people are overcome with inertia. </p> <p>We're not that bad at taking action to make savings on the really tedious stuff: 53 per cent of consumers shop around for car insurance and 30 per cent regularly change buildings and contents policies. </p> <p>But when it comes to changing mortgage lenders, apathy reigns. While a third of the people surveyed had thought about switching their mortgage in the past five years, a mere 12 per cent had gone through with it. Yet moving your mortgage could finance a chocolate habit many times over: on an interest-only mortgage of \u00a375,000, shaving just one percentage point off the interest rate you currently pay would save \u00a3750 a year. </p> <p>Then there are the savings to be made from switching gas and electricity suppliers. The DTI says we're getting better at taking advantage of competition in these markets but figures from the energy regulator, Ofgem, suggest there is still a long way to go. Although consumers have had the freedom to change the company that supplies their domestic energy for at least two years now, 70 per cent have stuck with British Gas and 80 per cent prefer to remain with their local ex-monopoly electricity supplier. </p> <p>Consumers have also been slow to profit from lower prices as a result of the opening up of the telecoms market. 'Loyalty levels to BT are high,' concludes the DTI. Only 11 per cent of people have taken steps to save money on their phone bills by moving away from BT. </p> <p>But apathy isn't entirely to blame. Research commissioned by the telecoms regulator, Oftel, found that 15 million consumers weren't aware that there are at least three different types of telecoms services supplier, and didn't realise they could save up to 20 per cent on phone bills by shopping around. </p> <p>The DTI puts consumer reluctance to change energy supplier down to the perceived 'hassle factor combined with the risk of change and a view that the savings will not be sub- stantial'. But could it be that the majority of non-switchers are happy with the savings that competition in the energy markets has already brought? Figures from the National Audit Office, show that doing nothing results in a combined saving of \u00a370 a year on gas and electricity. </p> <p>Or perhaps the doorstep sales methods employed by many of the new energy suppliers put a lot of people off. If the doorsteppers of South London are anything to go by, even when asked nicely, they are unable to give actual tariff information - asking you take their word for it that you will save money. And no fine upstanding consumer is going to fall for that. </p> <p>The trouble is, they're probably right. On average, the NAO says people who have switched saved \u00a378 a year on gas and \u00a345 on electricity. Not a huge amount compared with switching your mortgage, but enough to pay for the occasional guilt-free chicken tikka sandwich.</p> <p><strong>Telephone: Good line in cheap calls</strong></p> <p>To save money on your phone bills, you needn't even change your phone number. One option is to stick with BT but switch to a special package. BT Together costs \u00a32 a month more than standard line rental at \u00a39.99, but halves the cost of national calls and brings international discounts. The \u00a311.99 monthly line rental also includes free calls to the value of \u00a32.40 a month. </p> <p>The BT Talk Together package costs \u00a314.99 a month and covers all local weekend and evening calls. To make the extra \u00a35 a month worthwhile, you would need to make at least 17 minutes of local off-peak calls each day.</p> <p>But you can save more on national and international calls through an indirect access company. According to a recent Which? report, a 10-minute national daytime call routed through Eurobell (0800 499 994) will cost 50p less than BT standard rate and 11p less than the BT Together rate. Using <a href=\"http://www.onetel.co.uk\">One.Tel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.quip.co.uk\">quip</a> or WorldxChange (0800 975 1500) could cut the cost of a 10-minute call to the US by as much as \u00a31.70.</p> <p>Until now, using an indi rect access company involved either dialling a four-digit access code or plugging a special autodialler into your BT phone socket. But thanks to a new service, carrier pre-selection, (CPS) calls can now be switched through to a different company at the telephone exchange.</p> <p>At the moment you can choose a different company only for national and international calls - although you can use a different company for each type of call. But by the end of the year, you should be able to use different companies for all calls, including premium-rate and those to mobile phones.</p> <p>One disadvantage of CPS is that pre-selecting one company for a particular type of call won't get the best deal at all times of day. Another is that shopping around for the best deal could involve trawling through the tariff information of over 90 companies (available at <a href=\"http://www.magsys.co.uk\">www.magsys.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>But for \u00a324.98 (including VAT and delivery) for a special unit the size of a paperback book, Talk (0800 107 0139) will ensure your calls are always charged at the most competitive rate on the market. The service costs \u00a32 a month (\u00a31 if you pay by direct debit) and there's a connection charge of 2p a call.</p> <p><strong>Gas: Hot air on savings</strong></p> <p>There are three ways to save on your gas bills: use less; change the way you pay your bill; and/or change your supplier. </p> <p>If you pay your British Gas bill quarterly, you can save just over \u00a330 a year if you manage to pay all four bills within 10 days of their issue. But you will save slightly more if you change to monthly direct debit. This secures a price reduction of around 8 per cent which, on a typical annual gas consumption of 19,050 kilowatt hours, represents an annual saving of \u00a334.</p> <p>Changing the company that sends the bill can produce bigger savings. And since your gas pipes and meter stay the same, the only hassle involved, if you want an accurate idea of how much you could save, is working out your annual gas consumption.</p> <p>How large the savings will be depends on the size of your gas bill, how you currently pay it and whether you would be prepared to change your payment method on switching supplier. Using figures published by Ofgem, the table on page 2 shows the savings you can make if your annual gas consumption is small (10,000 kWh), medium (19,050 kWh) and large (28,000 kWh).</p> <p>Cash has calculated that, whatever your consumption, you will save the most - up to 25 per cent - if you currently pay quarterly, don't qualify for British Gas's prompt payment discount and change to paying by monthly direct debit with a new supplier. Next best is the 20 per cent savings if you continue to pay quarterly with a new company. The savings go down to 10 to 15 per cent if you currently pay by monthly direct debit and would carry on after switching supplier.</p> <p>To achieve those kind of reductions, you need to pick the cheapest supplier. In all cases, the highest savings were from Amerada's Internet-based operation at <a href=\"http://www.amerada.co.uk\">www.amerada.co.uk</a>. Powergen (0500 24 0500) came a close second but beat amerada.co.uk for those prepared to apply through its website (<a href=\"http://www.powergen.co.uk\">www.powergen.co.uk</a>) and qualify for its \u00a315 cash-back.</p> <p>Other companies offering savings worth switching for include: Eastern Energy (0800 092 9292); ScottishPower (0800 400 200); Sweb Gas (0845 073 4343); Yorkshire Electricity (0800 073 4343); and Internet-based <a href=\"http://www.servista.com\">Servista Power</a>.</p> <p><strong>Electricity: Switch on to current bargains</strong></p> <p>Although the savings tend to be smaller, if you're going to change gas supplier, you may as well change your electricity company too. </p> <p>Your cables and meter are unaffected and, as with switching gas suppliers, the amount you'll save depends on how you pay, how much electricity you use and who you switch to.</p> <p>But because electricity prices vary according to where you live - and whether you use standard or Economy 7 electricity - the size of saving you can expect also depends on which regional ex-monopoly company supplies your home. The table gives potential savings if you use standard electricity and switched to the cheapest supplier in your area.</p> <p>Different prices in different parts of the country also means that no single supplier will provide the best deal in all regions. Your payment method and annual consumption will also have a bearing on which companies will provide the best incentives to switch.</p> <p>However, it would be worth getting a quote from <a href=\"http://www.amerada.co.uk\">Amerada</a>'s web-based company (0845 305 3000), which was one of the cheapest suppliers in all regions, beaten only by Npower.

But if you keep to paying by monthly direct debit, the picture is less clear cut. If you get your gas from British Gas and your electricity from London Electricity, Norweb Energi, Scottish Hydro-Electric, Scottish Power, SWEB or Yorkshire Electricity, the cheapest dual-fuel deal available in your area will reap the same savings as the best deals from separate suppliers.</p> <p>A dual-fuel deal may be no more expensive if you consume a medium or large amount of energy and you change from paying quarterly to monthly. However, small users tend to get bigger savings from separate deals unless their electricity is currently supplied by London Electricity, Northern Electric &amp; Gas, Norweb Energi, Scottish Hydro-Electric or Yorkshire Electricity.</p> <p>Companies worth approaching for dual-fuel quotes include <a href=\"http://www.amerada.co.uk\">www.amerada.co.uk</a> (which was the cheapest in all areas); Powergen (0500 240 500) and ScottishPower (0800 400 200).</p> <p><strong>A step-by-step guide to switching</strong></p> <p>1.

With rolling contracts, the supplier is free to change the tariff after giving you 10 days' notice, but you are usually free to change to another supplier without penalty. With fixed contracts, the price can't go up during the fixed period, but you could be charged a fee if you decide to switch again before the period is over.</p> <p>4.

Garde \u00e0 Vue (released in Britain as The Inquisitor) starred rough, tough Lino Ventura as a police inspector who calls in smooth, haut-bourgeois lawyer Michael Serrault, dressed in dinner jacket for a smart party, to answer questions about the deaths of two teenage girls, both raped and murdered.

It is not, however, a subtle exercise. The picture gets off to a bad start with a succession of slow-motion and speeded-up shots of San Juan, then Hopkins and his screenwriters open up this chamber piece with flashy flashbacks that go beyond the ambiguity of the French original to place the interrogator in surreal fashion at the scene of the crime. Everything is made explicit, and this undermines the central performances that start out like house-trained dogs and end up with the avidity of hungry East German Dobermans digging into fugitives. Hackman challenges us with a couple of eloquent, dangerous speeches about the attractions of young girls, and the double-ending is disturbing, but less so than intended. </p> <p>Last year saw a plethora of lousy British gangster movies. The New Year opens with a pair of promising directorial debuts that help to redeem the genre. They're not in the same class as Joseph Losey's The Criminal, Mike Hodges's Get Carter, Nic Roeg and Donald Cammell's Performance, John Mackenzie's The Long Good Friday or Stephen Frears's The Hit. But they're stylish films, worthy of lower-rung positions in the British low-life canon. </p> <p>Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast has an indefensibly awful title and is a spin on its producer Jeremy Thomas's far superior The Hit. A sad, overweight cockney criminal, the emblematically named Gary Dove (Ray Winstone), has retired in his early forties to the Costa del Sol with his bruised ex-porn-flick wife (Amanda Redman). But if you have skills the mob needs you can never escape, and Gary is pursued by the psychotic hoodlum Don Logan (a brilliant Ben Kingsley). Don's been instructed by underworld king-pin Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) to recruit Gary for one last big heist. </p> <p>Before Logan arrives, Gary experiences a premonition in the form of a boulder that rolls down the adjacent Spanish mountainside and lands in his pool. Sisyphus is talking to him, and we recognise that Gary is Philoctetes, the reclusive archer, whose bow was needed for the Trojan War, and that Don is a modern version of Ulysses, sent to lure him back to the fray. The mode is tough-sentimental and it falls off badly. </p> <p>Julian Simpson's The Criminal adheres to a more recent mythic model, calling his victim-hero 'J' (Steven Mackintosh), the way Franz Kafka named the protagonist of The Trial 'K'. His J is a sad, down-at-heel London musician who gets sucked into an insane, subterranean intrigue involving Scotland Yard and a secret freelance intelligence agency that functions only through a website. Minute by minute this paranoid thriller grabs you, with sharp contributions from Bernard Hill, Holly Aird and Eddie Izzard. But it never makes sense, socially or politically, the way its 1970s American models - The Parallax View, All the President's Men - do. However, both The Criminal and Sexy Beast are professionally turned movies, worthy of commercial distribution. </p> <p>Another fairly promising British debut is the Nigerian-born Newton I. Aduaka's Rage, a low-budget movie about three teenage musicians - one white and middle-class, the other two black and living on a Brixton estate - briefly turning to crime. Their motive is to pay for the cutting of a rap record and to settle the drug debts of a wise, elderly Rastafarian who acts as mentor to one of the lads. It's a rough and ready piece shot in documentary style, much of it at night, but it has drive and energy. </p> <p>The directorial debut of the gifted Polish cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (who won Oscars for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan), the sanctimonious millennium horror flick Lost Souls is further sad confirmation that the way into the director's chair doesn't lie through the director of photography's light meter. This badly told tale, deliberately lit in a sickly fashion, has the usual team of obsessed Manhattan Catholics ready to confront Satan - in this case as he prepares to take over the body of Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin), an agnostic criminal psychologist. Winona Ryder is the misunderstood anti-Satanist, John Hurt is the obligatory European priest conducting dangerous exorcisms. There isn't a jot of humour in this solemn movie. </p> <p>The welcome two-month long Robert Altman retrospective at the NFT sees the return of his 1973 version of The Long Goodbye. It sets out to turn Chandler's romantic, chivalric thriller on its head, but Altman is closer than he recognises to Chandler. Elliott Gould, however, is the antithesis of the earnest, confident WASPish Marlowes in preceding films (e.g. Dick Powell, Humphrey Bogart, Robert Montgomery, James Garner) and he drifts like a sleepwalker through the movie, very much not in control of events, more a victim than an existential hero. </p> <p>The picture is studded with references to earlier movies (the gatekeeper at a luxurious private estate will admit people only when they've identified the stars he's impersonating), and apart from Gould most of the leading parts are played by non-actors or people who bring to their roles a variety of associations, mostly now forgotten - Nina Van Pallandt, for instance, who was involved the previous year with Clifford Irving during the Howard Hughes fraud scandal; Sterling Hayden, the guilt-ridden namer-of-names before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, who had come to hate Hollywood; and Jim Bouton, the baseball star turned author. For all the liberties taken with the plot by screenwriter Leigh Brackett, the movie is close in spirit to Chandler and is more optimistic in tone than the novel had been perceived to be when it appeared in 1954 as Chandler's final masterpiece.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It can't get much more nerve-racking than this: you're 15, you've never acted in a feature film before, and now you're in a big Hollywood movie. Worse still: you're playing the central character, who is, for all intents and purposes, the director as a teenager. Fortunately for Patrick Fugit, star of Almost Famous, that was all part of the plan. </p> <p>Inspired by Mike Leigh, Cameron Crowe decided that the lives of his actors should mirror the lives of his actors. So to play William Miller, the round-faced, awkward, na\u00efve and precocious 15-year-old who grows up fast as a journalist on tour with a Seventies rock band, he wanted someone who would start off as innocent as possible. </p> <p>Even Crowe had reservations about what he was doing. 'I was worried. You know, he doesn't have a lot of so-called technique, which is why I cast him, but it also made us run long and go over budget. But he's so real that I fell in love with the idea of the character being gloriously passive, being the observer at the circus. I just put the camera on him and we watch him watch everything else.' </p> <p>Fugit's previous experience amounted to two episodes of the sickly drama Touched By An Angel, a Weird Al Yankovic video and a TV movie called Legion Of Fire: Killer Ants. He didn't even know anything about music. 'The [script] pages I was given had been rewritten as politics to keep the movie secret, so I thought it was a movie about politics,' he says. 'And while we were reading, Cameron said, \"You're doing great, Patrick. So, do you like rock'n'roll?\" I went, \"Um, no.\" And it was silent for a minute. I thought it was an odd question.' </p> <p>These days, he's thoroughly immersed in Seventies rock, and wouldn't go anywhere without his Led Zeppelin CDs.

      "bodyText": "It can't get much more nerve-racking than this: you're 15, you've never acted in a feature film before, and now you're in a big Hollywood movie. Worse still: you're playing the central character, who is, for all intents and purposes, the director as a teenager. Fortunately for Patrick Fugit, star of Almost Famous, that was all part of the plan. Inspired by Mike Leigh, Cameron Crowe decided that the lives of his actors should mirror the lives of his actors. So to play William Miller, the round-faced, awkward, na\u00efve and precocious 15-year-old who grows up fast as a journalist on tour with a Seventies rock band, he wanted someone who would start off as innocent as possible. Even Crowe had reservations about what he was doing. 'I was worried. You know, he doesn't have a lot of so-called technique, which is why I cast him, but it also made us run long and go over budget. But he's so real that I fell in love with the idea of the character being gloriously passive, being the observer at the circus. I just put the camera on him and we watch him watch everything else.' Fugit's previous experience amounted to two episodes of the sickly drama Touched By An Angel, a Weird Al Yankovic video and a TV movie called Legion Of Fire: Killer Ants. He didn't even know anything about music. 'The [script] pages I was given had been rewritten as politics to keep the movie secret, so I thought it was a movie about politics,' he says. 'And while we were reading, Cameron said, \"You're doing great, Patrick. So, do you like rock'n'roll?\" I went, \"Um, no.\" And it was silent for a minute. I thought it was an odd question.' These days, he's thoroughly immersed in Seventies rock, and wouldn't go anywhere without his Led Zeppelin CDs. Meanwhile, he's feeling guilty about the instant success. 'It's crazy. Most people work up to this point by doing something like walking a dog in the background of a Harrison Ford movie. I got rushed to the front of the line. Sometimes it gets uncomfortable when I'm around those starving-actor types. I just want to apologise.'

      "bodyText": "Plans to allow no-fault divorces for couples who have been married for as little as a year are to be abandoned by the Government as unworkable. In a significant victory for the pro-family lobby, the Lord Chancellor, Derry Irvine, will announce in the next two weeks that legislation aimed at relaxing the laws on divorce is too difficult to implement and that pilot mediation schemes supposed to end acrimonious divorce battles have caused more problems than they have solved. Irvine backed away from the reforms when research by academics at Newcastle University for the Government showed that the plans could cost as much as \u00a350 million a year. Critics pointed out that the money would be better used boosting marriage support services. The research also revealed that couples who have gone through the new schemes have become embroiled in bitter legal battles because the pilots do not work. The announcement will signal the death of the ill-fated Family Law Act, one of the last pieces of legislation passed by John Major's government. The act proposed that couples would not have to prove adultery or unreasonable behaviour before a split could be agreed. 'The results of the research were disappointing,' a source at the Lord Chancellor's Department said. 'In June the interim results showed that there were problems. Now we have the final results and that picture has not changed.' The move will be welcomed by pro-family campaigners who say that the new legislation was making it too easy for couples to dissolve their marriages. The act originally said that couples could break up after one year or 18 months if there were children involved, fundamentally changing the present rules which allow couples no-fault divorces after five years only if the couple do not agree on the terms of the divorce. But an analysis of the way the legislation would work revealed that compulsory 'information meetings' with marriage guidance counsellors exacerbated problems and policies to identify 'saveable marriages' were pushing people more quickly into the hands of lawyers, moves that the new legislation was supposed to stop. Irvine, who is a close ally of the pro-marriage Prime Minister, will make the announcement alongside a raft of measures aimed at shoring up the family. Marriage registrars will be given increased powers to warn couples of the commitment they are making before they get married, meaning that register office marriages will now more closely reflect church marriages where vicars and priests often meet couples two or three times before the ceremony. Marriage counselling and support services will also be given an enhanced role. It is also expected that the Children Act will be used to block some divorces where there are no agreements in place on how children will be looked after. Last year The Observer revealed that the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Home Office's family policy committee were supporting a new book which will give couples advice on the perfect marriage. The Government agreed to support the book after new figures revealed that more than 300,000 couples a year get married, down by 100,000 on the figure 20 years ago. A third of marriages now end in divorce. Although officials insist that the Government does not want to be seen as interfering in people's private lives, senior figures including Tony Blair and the Home Office Minister, Paul Boateng, are pushing for a more marriage-friendly image from the Government.",

      "bodyText": "British airline companies ignored warnings for more than three decades about the deadly effects of blood clots on passengers during long-haul flights, The Observer can reveal. Despite being warned as long ago as 1968 by leading medical experts about the problems of so-called 'economy-class syndrome', the airlines played down the dangers and gave no advice to passengers on how to minimise the risks. Hundreds of people are feared to have died as a result. As recently as 1998, airlines and aviation authorities dismissed disclosures in The Observer about the potential danger of cramped seating causing clots, saying there was no evidence. Yet in a letter published 16 years ago in the Lancet medical journal, experts warned that 'airline passengers, even those on very long flights, are given no specific advice to prevent venous thrombosis'. Three doctors working at a hospital near Heathrow - Yvonne Hart, D. J. Holdstock and William Lynn - wrote: 'Working in a hospital on the perimeter of London Airport we see a steady stream of illnesses which have developed in flight. The major manifestation of the illness may not occur until after disembarkation. We have seen several patients with thromboembolism presenting in this way, with a near-fatal outcome in one case.' Dr Dale Egerton, a Hampshire GP who saved his wife's life in 1998 after she suffered a massive blood clot, said last night: 'It beggars belief that the medical team at British Airways did not read that letter to the Lancet.

But nothing was done - an utter disgrace.' Our investigation has uncovered a culture of deceit at some airlines which has been allowed to thrive due to complacency at the Department of Health and the Civil Aviation Authority. Today we reveal that: \u0095 airline company doctors have known about the risks of immobility since 1940 and the risks of immobility on long-haul flights since 1968 \u0095 British Airways highlights a misleading study on its website which downplays the risks of long flights \u0095 a new study to be published in the Lancet will show compelling evidence of a link between long-haul flights and DVT \u0095 British Airways has not allowed doctors access to its passengers to do more research \u0095 no data on the number of cases of DVT caused by long flights is collected nationally or at major casualty hospital units \u0095 the Civil Aviation Authority has no responsibility to look after passengers \u0095 water, vital to prevent dehydration in long flights, was found, in tests by Britain's Public Health Laboratories, to be contaminated with E.coli and human excrement in 15 per cent of the fountains surveyed on jets using major British airports. Only now are major air lines alerting customers to DVT on tickets. British Airways now tells passengers to flex their ankles while seated. The first study warning of the dangers of immobility was published in 1940, and follow-up reports looking at blood-clot risks to passengers in air flights first appeared in 1968. Dr John Scurr, of University College Hospital, London, is soon to publish fresh research in the Lancet which will show a conclusive link between long-haul flights and DVT. Dr John Belstead, of Ashford Hospital, near Heathrow, estimates that 15 Britons die a year from DVT developed on long-haul flights. Egerton, the Hampshire GP, said that if the airlines and the authorities had acted on the warning in the Lancet in 1985, the lives of 225 people could have been saved. Scurr suspects that the number of deaths could be very much higher. 'Maybe hundreds of Britons are dying every year,' he said. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority pointed out that it had no responsibility for air passengers. A spokesman for the Department of Health said that DVT was 'very much a now issue' but admitted that it had not been a high priority in the past. British Airways has in the past downplayed the prevalence of mortalities from DVT, saying that only two people in the world die each year from blood clots caused on long-haul flights. Last week BA pointed to its website, showing 'facts and research' on DVT. One study shows that DVT is more likely to be caused in cars rather than planes. Egerton said: 'What British Airways doesn't say is that this study was done in a part of France where there is no international airport. It is a grotesquely misleading way to deal with a major scandal in the public health.'",

      "body": "<p>One of Ireland's most respected soldiers has rejected a proposal that Irish troops should be used to plug the security gap left by a large-scale British Army withdrawal from south Armagh.</p> <p>Retired Lt-Gen Gerry McMahon said the Irish Defence Forces would be unable to cope with the extra demands put on them by a massive scaling down of the British military presence in the most dangerous part of Northern Ireland. McMahon, who was chief-of-staff of the defence forces between 1995 and 1998, said such a commitment would mean Ireland closing down its United Nations peacekeeping operations and its commitment to the European Union's rapid reaction force.</p> <p>Republicans are calling for widespread demilitarisation in south Armagh in return for further IRA moves to decommission its arsenal of illegal weapons.</p> <p>But British Army commanders have warned Tony Blair that if they withdraw and troops or police are killed by dissident republicans as a result, it will be the Prime Minister, not the military, who must take responsibility.</p> <p>McMahon also told The Observer he was confident Sinn Fein would decouple from the IRA as the price for entering a coalition government in the Republic.</p> <p>At the end of last year Irish government officials suggested that if the British withdrew large numbers of troops and tore down hilltop spy posts in south Armagh, Dublin would deploy extra soldiers on the Co Louth side of the border.</p> <p>McMahon, however, said that with 8,500 full-time troops, Ireland had one of the smallest armed forces in the EU. Despite spending less on defence than almost any other European country, the Irish forces had relatively large commitments to UN peacekeeping from East Timor to Kosovo and Lebanon.</p> <p>'We have three battalions and one armoured squadron stretched along the border. There is a virtual brigade there and I think that is quite sufficient for the job we are currently doing,' he said.</p> <p>'The army certainly can't move into south Armagh because it's still UK territory and that's where all the action is. And if we were given extra commitments on the border, the only way we could do that is to shift our troops away from UN peace keeping missions and re-think our proposed role in the EU's rapid reaction force. At present we could not plug the gap. The numbers are just not there,' he said.</p> <p>The general, who served in the Irish Defence Forces for almost half a century, poured scorn on the Dublin government's new Defence White Paper, particularly its assertion that armed republican violence north of the border was over.</p> <p>'The military have been telling the politicians that it's not settled yet and that our troops are going to be needed there for a long time to come,' said McMahon.</p> <p>The conflicting demands of domestic security or aid to the civil power, UN peacekeeping and plans to send an Irish battalion to the EU force were putting enormous strain on the military, he added.</p> <p>The border between south Armagh and Louth has the most active and militant republicans in Ireland. During the Troubles the region was the most dangerous posting in the world for British troops. It is now a stronghold for the dissident republican terrorist group, the Real IRA, which launched its disastrous bomb attack on Omagh in August 1998 from that area.</p> <p>McMahon said: 'If I was still chief-of-staff and the politicians asked me for more troops along the border I would tell them we don't have enough.'</p> <p>As the prospect of an Irish general election this year becomes more likely, political leaders in the Republic are turning their attention to Sinn Fein's fortunes and the possibility of the IRA's political wing entering a coalition.</p> <p>McMahon said the party would have to redefine its relationship with the IRA and declare sole allegiance to one army, the Irish Defence Forces, to enter a government. He was optimistic that this would eventually happen.</p> <p>'I am convinced Sinn Fein will be pragmatic about this, in the same way that Fianna Fail was following the civil war. When Fianna Fail eventually came into the Dail and then government, they recognised the sole legitimacy of the Irish national army. These were people who were deadly enemies of the army only a few years before during the civil war.</p> <p>'There is historical precedence for this, and I have no reason to think it will be any different this time,' he said.</p> <p>Sinn Fein's desire to be in government on both sides of the border is tempered by the Republic's constitution, which Eamon de Valera drew up in 1936. It says that ministers, civil servants and soldiers must swear loyalty to the state's defence forces.</p> <p>Bertie Ahern, the taoiseach, has also insisted that Sinn Fein must resolve its relationship with the IRA before it can enter any coalition with his party, Fianna Fail.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of Ireland's most respected soldiers has rejected a proposal that Irish troops should be used to plug the security gap left by a large-scale British Army withdrawal from south Armagh. Retired Lt-Gen Gerry McMahon said the Irish Defence Forces would be unable to cope with the extra demands put on them by a massive scaling down of the British military presence in the most dangerous part of Northern Ireland. McMahon, who was chief-of-staff of the defence forces between 1995 and 1998, said such a commitment would mean Ireland closing down its United Nations peacekeeping operations and its commitment to the European Union's rapid reaction force. Republicans are calling for widespread demilitarisation in south Armagh in return for further IRA moves to decommission its arsenal of illegal weapons. But British Army commanders have warned Tony Blair that if they withdraw and troops or police are killed by dissident republicans as a result, it will be the Prime Minister, not the military, who must take responsibility. McMahon also told The Observer he was confident Sinn Fein would decouple from the IRA as the price for entering a coalition government in the Republic. At the end of last year Irish government officials suggested that if the British withdrew large numbers of troops and tore down hilltop spy posts in south Armagh, Dublin would deploy extra soldiers on the Co Louth side of the border. McMahon, however, said that with 8,500 full-time troops, Ireland had one of the smallest armed forces in the EU. Despite spending less on defence than almost any other European country, the Irish forces had relatively large commitments to UN peacekeeping from East Timor to Kosovo and Lebanon. 'We have three battalions and one armoured squadron stretched along the border. There is a virtual brigade there and I think that is quite sufficient for the job we are currently doing,' he said. 'The army certainly can't move into south Armagh because it's still UK territory and that's where all the action is. And if we were given extra commitments on the border, the only way we could do that is to shift our troops away from UN peace keeping missions and re-think our proposed role in the EU's rapid reaction force. At present we could not plug the gap. The numbers are just not there,' he said. The general, who served in the Irish Defence Forces for almost half a century, poured scorn on the Dublin government's new Defence White Paper, particularly its assertion that armed republican violence north of the border was over. 'The military have been telling the politicians that it's not settled yet and that our troops are going to be needed there for a long time to come,' said McMahon. The conflicting demands of domestic security or aid to the civil power, UN peacekeeping and plans to send an Irish battalion to the EU force were putting enormous strain on the military, he added. The border between south Armagh and Louth has the most active and militant republicans in Ireland. During the Troubles the region was the most dangerous posting in the world for British troops. It is now a stronghold for the dissident republican terrorist group, the Real IRA, which launched its disastrous bomb attack on Omagh in August 1998 from that area. McMahon said: 'If I was still chief-of-staff and the politicians asked me for more troops along the border I would tell them we don't have enough.' As the prospect of an Irish general election this year becomes more likely, political leaders in the Republic are turning their attention to Sinn Fein's fortunes and the possibility of the IRA's political wing entering a coalition. McMahon said the party would have to redefine its relationship with the IRA and declare sole allegiance to one army, the Irish Defence Forces, to enter a government. He was optimistic that this would eventually happen. 'I am convinced Sinn Fein will be pragmatic about this, in the same way that Fianna Fail was following the civil war. When Fianna Fail eventually came into the Dail and then government, they recognised the sole legitimacy of the Irish national army. These were people who were deadly enemies of the army only a few years before during the civil war. 'There is historical precedence for this, and I have no reason to think it will be any different this time,' he said. Sinn Fein's desire to be in government on both sides of the border is tempered by the Republic's constitution, which Eamon de Valera drew up in 1936. It says that ministers, civil servants and soldiers must swear loyalty to the state's defence forces. Bertie Ahern, the taoiseach, has also insisted that Sinn Fein must resolve its relationship with the IRA before it can enter any coalition with his party, Fianna Fail.",

That's how vital the nearby Japanese car factory is to the local economy. But will the 'Nissan Hector' be replaced by a dedicated man at the dole office? If an imminent, knife-edge decision currently being chewed over in Brussels and Tokyo goes the wrong way, the most likely answer is yes. Nissan supervisor Steve, 37, sits in a pub three miles from the plant after his Friday shift, sipping whisky and flicking cigarette ash from his denim jacket. He used to make ships, now it's cars and says any idea that the Nissan plant will not continue to flourish is 'horrifying' for the north-east, but particularly Sunderland.

Around 3,000 of the 5,000 workers at the factory are from the Sunderland area. A further 11,000 component supplier jobs in the north-east are supported by Nissan. The issue at stake is where Nissan plans to build the next version of that favourite urban runaround - the Micra. The new model will not go into production until 2003, but the decision to build it in Sunderland or at a factory in France belonging to Nissan's recently-acquired partner Renault, will be made by the end of the month. The very idea that the north-east might lose out to the French has put the region in shock for two reasons. First, the Nissan plant is the most productive car factory in the western world and, following Rover's recent decline, has become the largest car maker in the UK, building 320,000 a year with capacity for half a million. Each Nissan worker makes a record 105 cars a year.

Second, although losing the Micra will not see the closure of the factory overnight, it is widely acknowledged that it would spell the 'beginning of the end'. The factory also makes the Primera and Almera cars and these would continue. But for how long, in a global industry that is hugely oversupplied and where factory closures are increasingly commonplace? The added factors of a weak euro against a rampant pound, for a factory that exports 75 per cent of its production to the Continent, and Nissan's slowness to drive down prices from its suppliers, pushed the Sunderland outfit into loss last year. Senior Nissan executives insist the decision has not yet been taken and is 'too close to call' until the final numbers on currency projections and cost-cutting programmes are crunched in Tokyo in the next fortnight. Supervisor Steve is optimistic. He says he has 'inside information' from his engineering colleagues that vital work has already been done to prepare the assembly line at Sunderland for the new model. Sunderland City Council leader Colin Anderson has had exhaustive meetings with local MPs and believes that, in contrast with earlier gloom, there is now a 'quiet optimism' that the UK plant will win out after intense lobbying and the plant's pledge to cut costs by 30 per cent by working around the clock. The French unions have also thrown a spanner in the works by declaring that their factory is already overworked.

As the shots rang out across the town, a crowd of thousands who had gathered for the killing shouted: 'God is great!' Afterwards friends and relatives of the 25-year-old revealed that in his last hours, as he waited to be shot, the young man had sat weeping, holding his three-year-old daughter's hand. Alam Bani Odeh was not alone in going before firing squad of his own people yesterday morning in the first public executions of collaborators in the present intifada. In Gaza City too a similarly brutal scene was being played out as Majdi Mikkawi, 28, convicted for his part in the killing by Israeli forces of a senior Fatah official and several of his fighters near Gaza, was also put to death.

      "body": "<p>It is a timeless country scene: groups of people innocently enjoying fresh air as they walk their dogs.</p> <p>But there will be nothing innocent about a new form of dog-walking set to spring up throughout Britain. Fox hunters have drawn up a secret strategy to bypass a law against hunting. They will pretend to exercise their pets when they are, in fact, in pursuit of their quarry.</p> <p>In a confidential email obtained by The Observer, the former Tory Home Office Minister David Maclean - a key political adviser to the Countryside Alliance - outlines its strategy ahead of Wednesday's House of Commons vote on whether to ban hunting with dogs.</p> <p>The email, sent on 3 January to the alliance's political unit, states: 'We must work on the assumption that in 12 months' time there will be legislation banning hunting with dogs. I think the banning option is impossible to enforce, and once we stir up the police about its weakness they will be terrified of trying to implement it.'</p> <p>He advises that the best hope is to ensure that there are flaws in the Bill and to see that pro-hunting MPs do not 'expose or tighten up the loopholes'.</p> <p>Maclean states: 'It is absolutely vital that the legislation is flawed and sloppy as possible. The Lords must not clean it up. I want every inconsistency, every dubiety, every ambiguity left in. If the law is clear then we are finished, because most of us will not break the law.</p> <p>'However, the endgame must be that, on the day that a hunting ban comes into force, we can all turn out with our doggies to go walking and the police and learned professors of law will all say that probably no crime is being committed because the law is so unclear.'</p> <p>Maclean says the alliance should then mount a legal challenge in Europe using the human rights laws, and secondly bring ' the banning legislation into disrepute by testing it to the limit and exploiting all the loopholes'.</p> <p>According to Maclean, the alliance plans to sabotage the Bill at its committee stage, where a group of MPs scrutinise the Bill before it goes to the House of Lords. In order to introduce flaws, he advises that 'for the committee upstairs, we will need lots of amendments which do not deal with fundamental weakness nor injustices in the Bill'.</p> <p>The alliance's tactics have outraged backbench MPs. Ian Cawsey, Labour MP and chair of the Commons All-party Animal Welfare Group, said: 'This would be an appalling abuse of parliamentary procedure. The alliance has failed to win the argument in the Commons and now seems to be trying to sabotage the democratic process instead. There is no way we will let them succeed.'</p> <p>This is not the first time Maclean's role with the alliance has prompted controversy. In May a confidential letter written by the Tory MP for Penrith to Lord Kimball, the alliance's deputy chairman, revealed how Maclean had orchestrated a plot to wreck the Fireworks Bill which would have protected people from bonfire night injuries.</p> <p>Maclean did this to 'punish' the Government for 'letting their backbenchers play around with hunting', the letter said.</p> <p>Other confidential alliance documents passed to The Observer show that the group is worried about losing control of some of its members. A strategy document, written towards the end of last year, states: 'Many supporters are threatening to take aggressive action - even eventually to go to prison.'

      "bodyText": "It is a timeless country scene: groups of people innocently enjoying fresh air as they walk their dogs. But there will be nothing innocent about a new form of dog-walking set to spring up throughout Britain. Fox hunters have drawn up a secret strategy to bypass a law against hunting. They will pretend to exercise their pets when they are, in fact, in pursuit of their quarry. In a confidential email obtained by The Observer, the former Tory Home Office Minister David Maclean - a key political adviser to the Countryside Alliance - outlines its strategy ahead of Wednesday's House of Commons vote on whether to ban hunting with dogs. The email, sent on 3 January to the alliance's political unit, states: 'We must work on the assumption that in 12 months' time there will be legislation banning hunting with dogs. I think the banning option is impossible to enforce, and once we stir up the police about its weakness they will be terrified of trying to implement it.' He advises that the best hope is to ensure that there are flaws in the Bill and to see that pro-hunting MPs do not 'expose or tighten up the loopholes'. Maclean states: 'It is absolutely vital that the legislation is flawed and sloppy as possible. The Lords must not clean it up. I want every inconsistency, every dubiety, every ambiguity left in. If the law is clear then we are finished, because most of us will not break the law. 'However, the endgame must be that, on the day that a hunting ban comes into force, we can all turn out with our doggies to go walking and the police and learned professors of law will all say that probably no crime is being committed because the law is so unclear.' Maclean says the alliance should then mount a legal challenge in Europe using the human rights laws, and secondly bring ' the banning legislation into disrepute by testing it to the limit and exploiting all the loopholes'. According to Maclean, the alliance plans to sabotage the Bill at its committee stage, where a group of MPs scrutinise the Bill before it goes to the House of Lords. In order to introduce flaws, he advises that 'for the committee upstairs, we will need lots of amendments which do not deal with fundamental weakness nor injustices in the Bill'. The alliance's tactics have outraged backbench MPs. Ian Cawsey, Labour MP and chair of the Commons All-party Animal Welfare Group, said: 'This would be an appalling abuse of parliamentary procedure. The alliance has failed to win the argument in the Commons and now seems to be trying to sabotage the democratic process instead. There is no way we will let them succeed.' This is not the first time Maclean's role with the alliance has prompted controversy. In May a confidential letter written by the Tory MP for Penrith to Lord Kimball, the alliance's deputy chairman, revealed how Maclean had orchestrated a plot to wreck the Fireworks Bill which would have protected people from bonfire night injuries. Maclean did this to 'punish' the Government for 'letting their backbenchers play around with hunting', the letter said. Other confidential alliance documents passed to The Observer show that the group is worried about losing control of some of its members. A strategy document, written towards the end of last year, states: 'Many supporters are threatening to take aggressive action - even eventually to go to prison.' Another paper talks of the formation of a 'provisional wing' of the Countryside Alliance. Further confidential documents suggest a growing concern among alliance members about the group's chief executive Richard Burge, who is a Labour Party member. One email from chairman John Jackson to the alliance board and other key supporters including Maclean and the Duke of Westminster, says: 'I am furious about the attacks on Richard. It is those people who will lose the game for everyone if we are not careful.' Mike Baker, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: 'It looks like we can expect increasing desperate actions from the hunt lobby. Their attempts to mislead people into voting for hunting via the so-called Middle Way have failed and [they] now admit that a hunting ban is inevitable... ' An alliance spokeswoman said Maclean's email 'was simply a result of some post- new year brainstorming. We get many such suggestions from supporters inside and outside Parliament. The Government has been working on this Bill for months, so it ought to be well drafted.' She stressed that 'supporters of hunting do not have a majority on the standing committee and therefore pro-hunting amendments are hardly likely to be accepted'. Maclean was not available for comment.",

The families of his victims claim that the move, made possible under new Human Rights Act legislation, to 'export' Mark Nash from Ireland to an English prison avoids a new trial that would throw up allegations of police incompetence and the framing of an innocent man. They have accused the Garda and the Irish Republic's Director of Public Prosecutions of being involved in a massive cover-up. The decision to allow Nash to exercise his right to be transferred under the Human Rights Act has only confirmed their sus picions that the Irish state wants rid of this troublesome prisoner. Nash is currently serving a life sentence in Dublin's Arbour Hill jail for the frenzied murder in August 1997 of a young Roscommon couple, Catherine and Carl Doyle. Nash also confessed to another double murder the same year. But despite giving a detailed confession Nash only ever faced a trial for killing the Doyles. The trouble for the Garda in the other murder six months earlier was that they had already charged another man with the killings, Dean Lyons, a 24-year-old homeless heroin addict. On the night of 6 March 1997, Sylvia Shields, 59, and Mary Callinan, 61, were repeatedly stabbed and mutilated at their home in the grounds of Grangegorman Hospital in north Dublin. The double murder was extraordinarily brutal and the forensic psychiatrist warned gardai that the murderer would strike again. Dean Lyons who was living rough in Grangegorman was arrested on 25 July and after hours of questioning gave detectives a series of statements admitting he carried out the killings. During the interrogation he was suffering the 'cold turkey' effect of heroin withdrawal. Lyons also suffered from severe psychiatric problems, which caused him to fear authority figures and put his hand up for things he had never done. But while gardai trumpeted their triumph in catching the Grangegorman murderer on the Irish state broadcaster RTE, the real killer struck again. On 16 August 1997, with Lyons in jail on remand, a young couple were brutally murdered at their home on the County Roscommon/ Galway border. Catherine Doyle's sister Sarah-Jane, who was Nash's girlfriend at the time, was beaten around the head with a stove handle, but managed to survive. The killing, involving frenzied stabbing with a kitchen knife, bore striking similarities to the one in Grangegorman. Mark Nash, the son of an Irish prostitute and a Jamaican father, was arrested the following day by gardai in Galway. After admitting to the murder of the Doyles, Nash then gave a detailed account of how Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan met their deaths. The Observer has seen Nash's statements, which include a detailed map he sketched of Shields and Callinan's home. Beside the map Nash wrote: 'Rough Sketch of House where I killed The Two Ladies.' Critically, Nash also told gardai in his confession to the Grangegorman murder that there was another woman in the house, who he spared. This was a crucial piece of evidence because none of the news broadcasts or reports into the murder had mentioned the presence of a third woman in the house. Despite Nash's confession Dean Lyons was held on remand in Mountjoy Prison for nine months. Then without explanation or apology, Ireland's Chief State Solicitor withdrew the murder charges against Lyons and ordered his release from jail. Nash meanwhile was subsequently charged with only the Doyle murders while the Garda carried out an internal inquiry into the handling of the Grangegorman case. The results of that inquiry have yet to be published. The 27-year-old murderer later retracted his Grangegorman confession on the advice of cellmates in Arbour Hill or, as one garda officer put it, 'jail house lawyers'. A spokesman for the Irish Prison Service confirmed last week that Nash has now applied to be transferred to a jail closer to his home in Leeds, where he can receive visits from his daughter. 'No decision has been made yet as it requires the consent of the prisoner and the two states, Ireland and Britain,' he said. Catherine Doyle's father Pat, however, said he has been told by the authorities that Nash will be shifted to a prison in England. Pat Doyle and his wife have been left to bring up Catherine and Carl Doyle's four children, the youngest of whom was only a new-born baby when Nash butchered their parents. 'The authorities are looking to get rid of this animal so they can avoid the other trial on the Grangegorman killing. They made a bollocks of that case and now they need to get him out of Ireland before the truth comes out. 'I would like people in England to know what kind of bastard is being transferred to one of their prisons. Several people in the Irish prison service have told me that Nash is a model prisoner, that he has served three years and could be out on good behaviour in five or six years time. This man will kill again. I want him to remain in an Irish jail for life for what he did to my family,' Doyle said. He added that justice must be done for Dean Lyons given that he had spent nine months in jail for an horrific crime he did not commit. Lyons's father Jackie supported the Doyle family's call for Nash to be kept in Ireland regardless of the Human Rights Act. 'The Garda were very quick to fit my fellah up for those murders in Grangegorman, which he never did. Dean was innocent, he was an addict and incapable of doing something terrible like that. I want a trial to go ahead into those killings and see that bastard Nash on trial. 'Even though the charges were dropped and he was freed, there is still a cloud of suspicion over Dean. No one apologised or said sorry to Dean about what happened to him.' The Irish state no longer needs to apologise to Lyons.

      "body": "<p>Hunted for its pelt and boiled to make soup, it last gnawed down a tree and dammed a river in these islands four centuries ago. But this year, pitting landowners in a fierce battle against environmentalists, the beaver is set to make a historic comeback.</p> <p>Originally as British as badgers and foxes, beavers were hunted to extinction about 800 years ago in England and 400 years ago in Scotland. Now two separate projects aim to reintroduce the species to the wild, north and south of the border, following the example of other European countries, including the Netherlands and Germany. Scottish Natural Heritage plans to release beavers in Knapdale forest, Argyll, while English Nature has given the provisional go-ahead to release them in the Fens of East Anglia.</p> <p>'It's a keystone species,' said David Gow, project manager of the Wild Wood Centre in Kent, a beaver breeder who is campaigning for its reintroduction. 'It makes and manages wetlands, creating habitats for other species. It would bring immense ecological benefits.'</p> <p>If it has an expanse of water no more than two yards wide, the beaver builds a dam from trees and mud to create a pond as a place to live. It then builds a huge lodge on the edge of the water, with submerged entrances. If anyone damages the dam, it immediately comes out of the lodge to repair it. The ponds can flood huge areas - drowning trees - but they also create habitats and drinking places for many other animals such as otter and deer.</p> <p>Beavers - which are vegetarians - sometimes graze like sheep, leaving well-trimmed 'beaver lawns' by the waterside.</p> <p>Looking at a massive mud and log beaver lodge and a felled oak tree in a huge enclosed pond, Gow enthused about their virtues. 'Baby beavers are so cute. They hold hands when they sleep,' he said. He plans to place some Norwegian beavers in a 100-acre enclosure in the Fens, before releasing them completely in the wild.</p> <p>A survey by Scottish Natural Heritage two years ago showed the public was keen on beavers. Having identified the exact site in Argyll, the body has just finished consulting with those in the immediate vicinity. 'The vast majority of locals are in favour of it. Only a few landowners are opposed,' said SNH spokesman George Anderson.</p> <p>Landowner Robin Malcolm, whose family has owned 5,000 acres in the area for 200 years, is the most vociferously opposed. He is worried they will bring disease, cut down or drown valuable trees, ruin the drainage of the area, and damage salmon stocks. Top of his concern is their effect on the River Add: 'What happens if they dam some of the tributaries? It could do untold damage to the spawning of salmon,' he said.</p> <p>SNH insists it is just conducting a trial release of 12 animals, which will be tagged. 'If they do a runner they'll be brought back,' insisted Anderson. If they do too much damage, they'll be hunted down and the project abandoned. 'The only way we'll know how beavers act in the wild will be in a trial,' said Anderson. 'They are very, very easy to trap. We got rid of them before with nothing more than bows and arrows.'</p> <p>Alison Hay, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, is also committed to reintroducing the beaver, seeing it as an aid to the local economy. 'We think tourists would be drawn to this area, and we see this as a benefit,' she said.</p> <p>Gow dismisses fears about disease and damage to salmon - which can jump over dams - as nonsense. But on the other issues, he admits that landowners like Malcolm have a point: 'You are going to have a degree of commercial loss when the beaver population develops.'</p> <p>He also agrees it is likely that, once they are released, they're here to stay, however much damage they cause. 'Do you think the Government is going to tell the public that it is going to kill these cute alphabet animals?'</p> <p>However, he insists that's a small price to pay, and farmers can be compensated. 'We've got to shed these Victorian values, where every animal that causes any trouble has to be exterminated. Do you need all this timber? Does it really matter if a beaver floods an area? We'll lose a few conifers, but so what? The other environmental benefits will be immense.'</p> <p>Next month the board of SNH will vote whether to go ahead with the project, which must then be passed by the Scottish Executive. If it gives the thumbs up, beavers will be imported from Norway this summer, held in quarantine for six months and then released in the wild in a year's time. The Environment Agency and local landowners have to give the go-ahead to the fenland project.</p> <p>The beaver crusade is rapidly getting support in Westminster. Jon Owen Jones, a Welsh Labour MP, said: 'There's a moral obligation on a country that believes you should retain tigers and lions in other countries to reintroduce species we've made extinct.'</p> <p>There is also an obligation under European law for countries to consider ways to bring back species they have made extinct in recent centuries. Gow sees a long battle ahead with landowners, but is confident of victory. 'This is going to happen. It's inevitable,' he said.</p> <p><b>From pelts to painkillers: a guide to Europe's biggest rodent</b></p> <p>\u0095 The last record of beavers in Scotland is in the seventeenth century when German traders came to Inverness to buy pelts.</p> <p>\u0095 Beavers were last recorded south of the border in Wales when the monk Geraldus was recruiting for the Crusades in the twelfth century.</p> <p>\u0095 Beavers were hunted for their exceptionally warm pelts, used to make coats and hats.</p> <p>\u0095 Hats were also made by shaving off the fur, boiling it and compressing it to make a form of felt.</p> <p>\u0095 Beavers are vegetarian, eating water plants and willow bark, and grazing on grass.</p> <p>\u0095 Beavers build dams from logs and mud if there are no open expanses of water to live in.</p> <p>\u0095 The anal gland of the beaver was prized as a source of salicylic acid, a painkiller chemically similar to aspirin.</p> <p>\u0095 It is Europe's largest rodent, can weigh up to 20 kilograms and lives to about 12 years old.</p> <p>\u0095 Beavers were popular food at Lent, since church authorities said they were 'of the water' and, like fish, could be eaten.</p> <p>\u0095 The beaver has been reintroduced to almost all countries in mainland Europe.

Scottish Natural Heritage plans to release beavers in Knapdale forest, Argyll, while English Nature has given the provisional go-ahead to release them in the Fens of East Anglia. 'It's a keystone species,' said David Gow, project manager of the Wild Wood Centre in Kent, a beaver breeder who is campaigning for its reintroduction. 'It makes and manages wetlands, creating habitats for other species. It would bring immense ecological benefits.' If it has an expanse of water no more than two yards wide, the beaver builds a dam from trees and mud to create a pond as a place to live. It then builds a huge lodge on the edge of the water, with submerged entrances. If anyone damages the dam, it immediately comes out of the lodge to repair it. The ponds can flood huge areas - drowning trees - but they also create habitats and drinking places for many other animals such as otter and deer. Beavers - which are vegetarians - sometimes graze like sheep, leaving well-trimmed 'beaver lawns' by the waterside. Looking at a massive mud and log beaver lodge and a felled oak tree in a huge enclosed pond, Gow enthused about their virtues. 'Baby beavers are so cute. They hold hands when they sleep,' he said. He plans to place some Norwegian beavers in a 100-acre enclosure in the Fens, before releasing them completely in the wild. A survey by Scottish Natural Heritage two years ago showed the public was keen on beavers. Having identified the exact site in Argyll, the body has just finished consulting with those in the immediate vicinity. 'The vast majority of locals are in favour of it. Only a few landowners are opposed,' said SNH spokesman George Anderson. Landowner Robin Malcolm, whose family has owned 5,000 acres in the area for 200 years, is the most vociferously opposed. He is worried they will bring disease, cut down or drown valuable trees, ruin the drainage of the area, and damage salmon stocks. Top of his concern is their effect on the River Add: 'What happens if they dam some of the tributaries? It could do untold damage to the spawning of salmon,' he said. SNH insists it is just conducting a trial release of 12 animals, which will be tagged. 'If they do a runner they'll be brought back,' insisted Anderson. If they do too much damage, they'll be hunted down and the project abandoned. 'The only way we'll know how beavers act in the wild will be in a trial,' said Anderson. 'They are very, very easy to trap. We got rid of them before with nothing more than bows and arrows.' Alison Hay, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, is also committed to reintroducing the beaver, seeing it as an aid to the local economy. 'We think tourists would be drawn to this area, and we see this as a benefit,' she said. Gow dismisses fears about disease and damage to salmon - which can jump over dams - as nonsense. But on the other issues, he admits that landowners like Malcolm have a point: 'You are going to have a degree of commercial loss when the beaver population develops.' He also agrees it is likely that, once they are released, they're here to stay, however much damage they cause. 'Do you think the Government is going to tell the public that it is going to kill these cute alphabet animals?' However, he insists that's a small price to pay, and farmers can be compensated. 'We've got to shed these Victorian values, where every animal that causes any trouble has to be exterminated. Do you need all this timber? Does it really matter if a beaver floods an area? We'll lose a few conifers, but so what? The other environmental benefits will be immense.' Next month the board of SNH will vote whether to go ahead with the project, which must then be passed by the Scottish Executive. If it gives the thumbs up, beavers will be imported from Norway this summer, held in quarantine for six months and then released in the wild in a year's time. The Environment Agency and local landowners have to give the go-ahead to the fenland project. The beaver crusade is rapidly getting support in Westminster. Jon Owen Jones, a Welsh Labour MP, said: 'There's a moral obligation on a country that believes you should retain tigers and lions in other countries to reintroduce species we've made extinct.' There is also an obligation under European law for countries to consider ways to bring back species they have made extinct in recent centuries. Gow sees a long battle ahead with landowners, but is confident of victory. 'This is going to happen. It's inevitable,' he said. From pelts to painkillers: a guide to Europe's biggest rodent \u0095 The last record of beavers in Scotland is in the seventeenth century when German traders came to Inverness to buy pelts. \u0095 Beavers were last recorded south of the border in Wales when the monk Geraldus was recruiting for the Crusades in the twelfth century. \u0095 Beavers were hunted for their exceptionally warm pelts, used to make coats and hats. \u0095 Hats were also made by shaving off the fur, boiling it and compressing it to make a form of felt. \u0095 Beavers are vegetarian, eating water plants and willow bark, and grazing on grass. \u0095 Beavers build dams from logs and mud if there are no open expanses of water to live in. \u0095 The anal gland of the beaver was prized as a source of salicylic acid, a painkiller chemically similar to aspirin. \u0095 It is Europe's largest rodent, can weigh up to 20 kilograms and lives to about 12 years old. \u0095 Beavers were popular food at Lent, since church authorities said they were 'of the water' and, like fish, could be eaten. \u0095 The beaver has been reintroduced to almost all countries in mainland Europe. There are North American beavers in every state of the US and every Canadian province. anthony.browne@observer.co.uk Useful links: Scottish National Heritage Wildwood Centre Beavers site",

      "body": "<p>When Ronaldo, the footballer hailed as one of the greatest players in the world, appeared in the Brazilian Congress last week to be interrogated about why the national team lost the 1998 World Cup final, the spectacle quickly descended into farce. 'We lost,' he told the hushed audience, 'because we didn't win.' Yet the star's testimony on what happened to the team in Paris two and a half years ago had a significance that belied his banal replies. </p> <p>Ronaldo's testimony was part of an unprecedented attempt by Brazil's politicians to call football to account after two years of scandals that have plunged the game into the worst crisis in its history. </p> <p>While the flamboyant soccer skills of players like Pel\u00e9 and Romario are a great advertisement for the romance of Brazil, the organisation of the game has always characterised the most corrupt and secretive parts of Brazilian society. </p> <p>A rising tide of allegations involving illicit enrichment, tax evasion, bribery - even that cocaine has been smuggled in footballs - has left faith in the game at its lowest ever ebb. Football is the strongest symbol of Brazilian national pride, and the health of the game is reflected in the country's self-esteem. </p> <p>Domestic competitions are farcically run, stadiums are almost empty and the best players play in Europe and Japan. Even the Brazilian national team - once seen as a byword for footballing perfection - has been playing its worst football in decades. It has suffered recent embarrassing defeats to Paraguay and Chile and elimination from the Sydney Olympics by a nine-man Cameroon. </p> <p>Congress hopes to put football's book in order and restore faith in the beautiful game. The task cannot be underestimated. It is a serious test of Brazil's 16-year-old democracy to modernise itself. 'If there is an area of public life that retains the authoritarianism of the dictatorship, it is football. There is a complete absence of laws,' says campaigning sports broadcaster Juca Kfouri. </p> <p>Since football is so deeply entrenched in Brazilian life, public confidence in the political system is at stake if the attempt fails. Congress has installed two football inquiries - one in the Chamber of Deputies and the other in the Senate. Dozens of players, coaches, journalists, agents and administrators are being summoned to Brasilia to be questioned. The inquiries have stronger powers of investigation than the police and already have asked for the personal bank records of the presidents of the 20 biggest clubs. </p> <p>Some of the hearings verge on farce. Congressmen interrogating Ronaldo appeared unable to ask probing questions and instead behaved as if it was a World Cup Final post-match press conference - two and a half years after the event. </p> <p>Ronaldo was called to shed light on the role the US sportswear manufacturer Nike is alleged to have played within the Brazil squad. Ever since Nike signed a \u00a3100 million contract with the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) in 1996 it has been eyed with suspicion. After the defeat against France it became the scapegoat. Brazilians feel that under the normal course of events they would have won, so the defeat must have been someone else's fault. </p> <p>The contract is widely seen as a betrayal of national sovereignty. Not only does it require the team to use Nike kit but it gives Nike the power to organise friendly games with at least eight first team regulars. 'The deal was very good for Nike but very bad for Brazil,' says Congressman Aldo Rebelo, president of the inquiry. 'The CBF sold the team. They betrayed the nation. They may not have had that intention, but that's what they did.' Nike denies exerting undue influence over the team. </p> <p>Rebelo, a Communist deputy who campaigns to rid Portuguese of English words, believes the psychological pressure of the Nike contract contributed to the convulsions - which some believe were an epileptic fit - Ronaldo is believed to have suffered on the day of the final. He was taken for tests, given the all-clear and played in the match - but only as a shade of his former self. </p> <p>The real target of the Nike hearing is CBF president Ricardo Teixeira - a national symbol of nepotism and impunity. There is great suspicion over how he accumulated his vast wealth, and he is such a despised figure he rarely attends football matches any more for fear of chants from the terraces. Teixeira had no involvement in sport until he was handpicked to run the CBF in the late Eighties by his then father-in-law, former Fifa president Joao Havelange - another vastly unpopular man. </p> <p>The inquiries can also be seen as a reaction to the economic liberalisation that has happened since the end of the Brazilian dictatorship in 1985 - a freedom that allowed the CBF to make mega-deals with multinationals. Rather than confining its business to Nike, however, Congressmen have widened the inquiry to a more general exploration of how Brazilian football has sold its soul. </p> <p>The investigations - which have another year to run - have thrown light on the 'trafficking' of underage players to foreign countries, the connivance of diplomatic officials in forging players' passports and the vast personal fortunes club presidents are alleged to have made illegally from selling players. Brazil exports more footballers abroad than any other country - currently about 10,000. </p> <p>In the Senate, the hearings started with the colourful testimony of Renata Alves, the former secretary and lover of Brazil's ex-coach Wanderley Luxemburgo. Alves said there was a house in Rio called the 'embassy' where club coaches and presidents would take suitcases of money for illegal deals. </p> <p>She also turned Luxemburgo into a Brazilian David Mellor, saying he liked her to wear the club Palmeiras's green socks up to her knees when they had sex. Luxemburgo is accused of selecting substandard players for the national team and earning kickbacks on their raised value. He admitted not declaring \u00a33m from tax returns, saying it was a result of disorganisation rather than intent. </p> <p>The inquiries are the first time football administrators have been called to book by Congress. There is an element of politicians turning their sword on themselves, since the investigations are an unprecedented attack on the promiscuity of football and political power. </p> <p>Running a football club has long been a route into politics, since it gives you a high public profile and fan loyalty. Before Fernando Collor de Mello was elected Brazilian president in 1989 he had established himself at the helm of the north-eastern club CSA. His son, 24-year-old Arnon de Mello, is now club president, the first step in his political career. </p> <p>The cosy relationship between football and politics is personified by Eurico Miranda, president-elect of Rio club Vasco da Gama. He was voted to Congress six years ago on a manifesto of defending his club's interests. Vasco fans re-elected him in 1998 with more than 100,000 votes, the seventh highest in Rio state. </p> <p>He is not the only one. The presidents of first division clubs Cruzeiro, Sport and Santa Cruz are also elected Congressmen, as are many state federation directors and presidents of smaller clubs. </p> <p>David Fleischer, professor of politics at Brasilia university, says: 'Miranda is flamboyant and a caricature, but he is not the only Congressman representing a corporate interest. Brazilian politics involves interest representation. People say not just that \"I represent an interest\" but \"I am the interest\".' </p> <p>Congress's football politicians form a powerful lobby that has blocked almost all attempts to modernise football legislation - most famously defeating Pel\u00e9's attempts to make club administration more transparent when he was Sports Minister from 1995-98. The football lobby managed to stop an inquiry for 18 months, until the Olympic defeat made it politically impossible. When the hearings started last October the football lobby rushed to fill them with its members, hoping to neutralise their effects. </p> <p>One of Rebelo's main worries is that the lower house's inquiry has been greatly weakened since football-linked deputies now make up about half of its members. As if reflecting the malaise over the game, the 2000 national football championship almost ended in tragedy a fortnight ago when the fencing at Vasco da Gama's stadium caved in and more than 150 people were taken to hospital. </p> <p>The incident shocked even people already disillusioned with the game. Miranda charged on to the pitch and demonstrated a predictable insensitivity as he tried to have the injured removed as quickly as possible to restart the match. When the Rio state governor, watching at home, called the club to overrule the restart on grounds of security, Miranda on live television called the governor 'incompetent, weak and a poof'. </p> <p>For the public and press, Miranda's demagogic actions highlighted the need for reform. The poet Geraldo Carneiro said: 'Miranda represents a world that hasn't passed yet, a psychological feudalism that, wherever it goes, rules, and that we as Brazilians need to free ourselves from.'</p>",

Yet the star's testimony on what happened to the team in Paris two and a half years ago had a significance that belied his banal replies. Ronaldo's testimony was part of an unprecedented attempt by Brazil's politicians to call football to account after two years of scandals that have plunged the game into the worst crisis in its history. While the flamboyant soccer skills of players like Pel\u00e9 and Romario are a great advertisement for the romance of Brazil, the organisation of the game has always characterised the most corrupt and secretive parts of Brazilian society. A rising tide of allegations involving illicit enrichment, tax evasion, bribery - even that cocaine has been smuggled in footballs - has left faith in the game at its lowest ever ebb. Football is the strongest symbol of Brazilian national pride, and the health of the game is reflected in the country's self-esteem. Domestic competitions are farcically run, stadiums are almost empty and the best players play in Europe and Japan. Even the Brazilian national team - once seen as a byword for footballing perfection - has been playing its worst football in decades. It has suffered recent embarrassing defeats to Paraguay and Chile and elimination from the Sydney Olympics by a nine-man Cameroon. Congress hopes to put football's book in order and restore faith in the beautiful game. The task cannot be underestimated. It is a serious test of Brazil's 16-year-old democracy to modernise itself. 'If there is an area of public life that retains the authoritarianism of the dictatorship, it is football. There is a complete absence of laws,' says campaigning sports broadcaster Juca Kfouri. Since football is so deeply entrenched in Brazilian life, public confidence in the political system is at stake if the attempt fails. Congress has installed two football inquiries - one in the Chamber of Deputies and the other in the Senate. Dozens of players, coaches, journalists, agents and administrators are being summoned to Brasilia to be questioned. The inquiries have stronger powers of investigation than the police and already have asked for the personal bank records of the presidents of the 20 biggest clubs. Some of the hearings verge on farce. Congressmen interrogating Ronaldo appeared unable to ask probing questions and instead behaved as if it was a World Cup Final post-match press conference - two and a half years after the event. Ronaldo was called to shed light on the role the US sportswear manufacturer Nike is alleged to have played within the Brazil squad. Ever since Nike signed a \u00a3100 million contract with the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) in 1996 it has been eyed with suspicion. After the defeat against France it became the scapegoat. Brazilians feel that under the normal course of events they would have won, so the defeat must have been someone else's fault. The contract is widely seen as a betrayal of national sovereignty. Not only does it require the team to use Nike kit but it gives Nike the power to organise friendly games with at least eight first team regulars. 'The deal was very good for Nike but very bad for Brazil,' says Congressman Aldo Rebelo, president of the inquiry. 'The CBF sold the team. They betrayed the nation. They may not have had that intention, but that's what they did.' Nike denies exerting undue influence over the team. Rebelo, a Communist deputy who campaigns to rid Portuguese of English words, believes the psychological pressure of the Nike contract contributed to the convulsions - which some believe were an epileptic fit - Ronaldo is believed to have suffered on the day of the final. He was taken for tests, given the all-clear and played in the match - but only as a shade of his former self. The real target of the Nike hearing is CBF president Ricardo Teixeira - a national symbol of nepotism and impunity. There is great suspicion over how he accumulated his vast wealth, and he is such a despised figure he rarely attends football matches any more for fear of chants from the terraces. Teixeira had no involvement in sport until he was handpicked to run the CBF in the late Eighties by his then father-in-law, former Fifa president Joao Havelange - another vastly unpopular man. The inquiries can also be seen as a reaction to the economic liberalisation that has happened since the end of the Brazilian dictatorship in 1985 - a freedom that allowed the CBF to make mega-deals with multinationals. Rather than confining its business to Nike, however, Congressmen have widened the inquiry to a more general exploration of how Brazilian football has sold its soul. The investigations - which have another year to run - have thrown light on the 'trafficking' of underage players to foreign countries, the connivance of diplomatic officials in forging players' passports and the vast personal fortunes club presidents are alleged to have made illegally from selling players. Brazil exports more footballers abroad than any other country - currently about 10,000. In the Senate, the hearings started with the colourful testimony of Renata Alves, the former secretary and lover of Brazil's ex-coach Wanderley Luxemburgo. Alves said there was a house in Rio called the 'embassy' where club coaches and presidents would take suitcases of money for illegal deals. She also turned Luxemburgo into a Brazilian David Mellor, saying he liked her to wear the club Palmeiras's green socks up to her knees when they had sex. Luxemburgo is accused of selecting substandard players for the national team and earning kickbacks on their raised value. He admitted not declaring \u00a33m from tax returns, saying it was a result of disorganisation rather than intent. The inquiries are the first time football administrators have been called to book by Congress. There is an element of politicians turning their sword on themselves, since the investigations are an unprecedented attack on the promiscuity of football and political power. Running a football club has long been a route into politics, since it gives you a high public profile and fan loyalty. Before Fernando Collor de Mello was elected Brazilian president in 1989 he had established himself at the helm of the north-eastern club CSA. His son, 24-year-old Arnon de Mello, is now club president, the first step in his political career. The cosy relationship between football and politics is personified by Eurico Miranda, president-elect of Rio club Vasco da Gama. He was voted to Congress six years ago on a manifesto of defending his club's interests. Vasco fans re-elected him in 1998 with more than 100,000 votes, the seventh highest in Rio state. He is not the only one. The presidents of first division clubs Cruzeiro, Sport and Santa Cruz are also elected Congressmen, as are many state federation directors and presidents of smaller clubs. David Fleischer, professor of politics at Brasilia university, says: 'Miranda is flamboyant and a caricature, but he is not the only Congressman representing a corporate interest. Brazilian politics involves interest representation. People say not just that \"I represent an interest\" but \"I am the interest\".' Congress's football politicians form a powerful lobby that has blocked almost all attempts to modernise football legislation - most famously defeating Pel\u00e9's attempts to make club administration more transparent when he was Sports Minister from 1995-98. The football lobby managed to stop an inquiry for 18 months, until the Olympic defeat made it politically impossible. When the hearings started last October the football lobby rushed to fill them with its members, hoping to neutralise their effects. One of Rebelo's main worries is that the lower house's inquiry has been greatly weakened since football-linked deputies now make up about half of its members. As if reflecting the malaise over the game, the 2000 national football championship almost ended in tragedy a fortnight ago when the fencing at Vasco da Gama's stadium caved in and more than 150 people were taken to hospital. The incident shocked even people already disillusioned with the game. Miranda charged on to the pitch and demonstrated a predictable insensitivity as he tried to have the injured removed as quickly as possible to restart the match. When the Rio state governor, watching at home, called the club to overrule the restart on grounds of security, Miranda on live television called the governor 'incompetent, weak and a poof'. For the public and press, Miranda's demagogic actions highlighted the need for reform. The poet Geraldo Carneiro said: 'Miranda represents a world that hasn't passed yet, a psychological feudalism that, wherever it goes, rules, and that we as Brazilians need to free ourselves from.'",

      "bodyText": "A bitter political fight is marking the days before President-elect George W Bush's assumption of office on Thursday and will grow into the defining issue of the hand-over to the Republicans. Bush's determination to appoint John Ashcroft, an extreme right-winger, as his Attorney-General is arousing mounting objections within the Democratic Party and US society. Ashcroft has hardline views against abortion, even in rape and incest cases. He is against gun control and led the impeachment of President Clinton. He comes second in the vote score card of the John Birch Society. He calls the National Endowment for the Arts 'communist-style central planning'. In his native Missouri - where voters were so unhappy with his views that he lost his Senate seat in November to Democrat Mel Carnahan, who had died in a plane crash the month before - he blocked the nomination of a black judge to the federal bench and hankers for the Confederacy's values. The Senate must ratify the appointment and the Republican leadership is mobilising its whip. The Democrats are debating whether to go to war now or later.

'Germany experienced a wholesale denial of Fascism, after the war. This has never happened here, so people remain unwilling to focus on the guilt of the old regime. It's easier to forget about it.' Author Leonid Borodin, who spent five years in the harsher quarters of the Special Regime, said Russians should not be blamed for their lack of interest. 'People are struggling with so many other problems, they don't have time to be weighed down by the past. Conditions in most Russian prisons today are in any case far worse.' Perm 36 was bulldozed by the KGB after closure to prevent it from becoming a pilgrimage spot. Volunteers recently rebuilt it and opened Russia's first gulag museum, in tribute to the victims of political repression. But because the country remains in denial about this aspect of its past, the museum has not attracted anything like the number of visitors to German camp memorials. Director Victor Shmirov said it was urgent to inform people. 'We have to confront people's indifference, especially now when we are seeing a revival of authoritarian tendencies in the Kremlin,' he said. 'People have such short memories and are thirsting again for strong government. They have forgotten what this can lead to; we have to remind them.'",

      "body": "<p>Friday evening. In nearly all Bilbao's telephone booths the receivers have been ripped off - because the telephone company is Spanish. Cash dispensers have been smashed for a similar reason. The tension in the wet, narrow streets of the Basque city is palpable. 'Gora [long live] Eta!' screams the graffiti next to the pulverised money-machine.</p> <p>Here, three months ago, an Eta commando unit carrying 25 kilograms of dynamite accidentally blew itself up. One of them was 22 years old, another 23.</p> <p>Harriet Iragi (a man) was also 23 when he was arrested with his friend Jon Solana, 26, for killing an army doctor in Seville. They had shot the doctor in the face. The authorities suspect that Iragi and Solana, who were born in the old city centre of Bilbao a couple of doors from each other, were also involved in last summer's shootings of a public prosecutor in Granada and a city councillor from Malaga.</p> <p>Now their faces, looking like shiny pop stars, hang alongside those of a dozen other arrested activists above the bottles in Lariko, a bar in Bilbao. Igor, to whom I am talking, stares pensively for a moment at the pictures, then puts the change left over from the beers he ordered in a collection box for them. 'These people are all from this neighbourhood,' he says. Igor knows a few of them.</p> <p>'Those four were murdered by the Spanish police,' he says, echoing the inflammatory rhetoric of the abertzale, the Basque patriot movement.</p> <p>According to its supporters, the Basque country is an occupied state, and the imprisoned members of Eta ( Euskadi Ta Askatasuna , or 'Basque Country and Freedom') are political prisoners.</p> <p>No region in the world enjoys such a high degree of self-government as the Basque country of Spain. It has its own regional rule, its own police and its own tax system - but Igor curses the Spanish identity card he has to carry. 'I am Basque, not Spanish. Believe me, as long as they don't acknowledge our rights, many more will die,' he warns, sipping his beer.</p> <p>He is far from unusual. A recent survey revealed that one in three Basque youths considers urban guerrilla tactics a good way to bring the 'foreign occupation' to its knees. One in 10 would not hesitate to use a weapon.</p> <p>The Lariko bar is crowded. Punk music blares in Euskera , the Basque language. The age of the average customer cannot be more than 24. They wear sweaters and mountaineering boots, and the girls show off their striking ponytails.</p> <p>'Very pretty girls up here. Last summer we had some guys from Sinn Fein visiting us. They couldn't believe their eyes,' Igor says. 'At first, those guys from Belfast didn't understand it. It was not anything like Belfast. We don't have soldiers marching through the streets, tanks or any physical barriers, but at any moment streets might be closed off and riot police could enter the bar. They even use girls to infiltrate our movement.'</p> <p>Lariko is run by the radical nationalist party Herri Batasuna, the political backbone of Eta. In the last regional elections Herri Batasuna won 18 per cent of the votes. In other words, 223,262 Basques supported Eta's agenda. But that figure fails to reflect the support of those under the voting age. These youths join Haika, an Eta-led organisation that controls many separate groups. Haika is left-wing, anti-nuclear power, against Spain, in favour of squatters, feminism, conscientious objectors and the IRA.</p> <p>Harriet Iragi and Jon Solana are Haika products, as are all young recruits to Eta in the past decade. According to a study by the University of Bilbao, they are ordinary youths, aged between 15 and 26. The report says: 'They come from middle- and lower-middle-class backgrounds and are strongly influenced by the separatist ideology preached by the moderate nationalist parties. They believe violence is the only answer to the real oppression, exercised by an occupying force. As a result, they feel they have to do certain things.'</p> <p>Igor indignantly rejects the report's idea of a generation without any opportunity. 'It claims it is something new for young people to end up with Eta. Take Harriet Iragi for instance. He studied to become a technical engineer and was a nice bloke, timid even.'</p> <p>Four years ago, Iragi suddenly vanished after being released on bail following a petrol-bomb attack on a police patrol. 'So we all knew where Harriet had ended up.'</p> <p>Exactly what makes an engineering student attack a police patrol and end up with Eta, Igor can't say. 'One day, Eta just asks you.. and if they want you, you go.'</p> <p>A man and two women enter Lariko and are instantly surrounded. 'They are Harriet's parents and lawyer.' The latest news gets around: of how he has been put into isolation, and how a net has been stretched above the prison yard. 'Why did they do that?' a girl wants to know. 'So helicopters can't land,' the lawyer explains.</p> <p>'Then why doesn't Harriet take the subway?' This remark sets off laughter in Lariko.</p> <p>Iragi's father looks weary. After a cat-and-mouse game in Seville, Iragi had surrendered to the police. 'He had partly undressed himself to prevent them thinking he was wearing a gun under his clothes and shooting him.'</p> <p>New laws are being prepared. 'In future, a minor may get up to 10 years for smashing telephones,' Igor growls. 'It'll only make the step to armed struggle easier. Before, you went as far as you felt like. But if they give you 10 years for a broken telephone booth, you might as well just kill someone.' When asked whether he would be prepared to go that far, Igor repeats his formula. 'If they want you, you go.'</p> <p>Under the heading 'Urban Terrorism', the Interior Ministry reported a 30 per cent increase in street vandalism last year. In the first half of 2000 the Ministry recorded 298 attacks, mostly incendiary bombs against public buildings and 'property of individuals'. In July a member of the ruling political party, the Partido Popular, had a Molotov cocktail thrown at the front of his house, and his horses were sprayed with ' Gora Eta!'.</p> <p>It is Saturday evening, and Igor has invited me to a party being thrown by the Basque patriotic students' union. On the way there he tells of the eight months he spent in prison after being arrested for acts of public disorder. He had a plastic bag put over his head until he choked, and he claims he is not the only one to have had such an experience. 'Nobody believes Basque prisoners are maltreated in Spanish prisons, but it definitely happens. Beatings, forcing your head in a bucket filled with water until you almost drown, humiliating people by questioning them while they are naked. Rapes.'</p> <p>In a June 1999 briefing, Amnesty International expressed its concerns about 'allegations of torture and ill-treatment' of Eta suspects. In several of these cases the accusations were supported by medical evidence, 'although other allegations were, by their nature, almost impossible to substantiate'. In the same briefing, Amnesty called on Eta to put an immediate end to its 'numerous violent and intimidating acts'.</p> <p>Rain falls mercilessly as we trudge around the muddy ground of the open-air party. It doesn't bother the thousands of cheerful students. A canvas, on which an axe and a snake are painted (Eta's coat of arms), is lying submerged in a pool of water on the path to one of the stages.</p> <p>Further on, two of Igor's female friends are drinking Cokes. Zaloa is 19, Irune, 21. 'You know how it is. Whenever I travel to Madrid, I don't find anything I can identify myself with. I always end up back here, in the Basque country,' Zaloa says. What most offends her are the tourists, walking through the streets of Bilbao, clapping to flamenco. 'I want them to recognise that I have my own culture.'</p> <p>The conversation shifts to the increase in the criminal penalties for minors. Irune shrugs. 'I don't know anybody who has not been fined. I know this guy who had to pay 50,000 pesetas [\u00a3180] for writing a slogan on a wall. That is not news to us. You're risking your life, so you have to be prepared.'</p> <p>Zaloa adds: 'They want to get rid of us, though I know I sound fanatical when I say so. But I am convinced the Basque country would have been wiped off the maps if Eta had not existed.'</p> <p>The singer with the band Su Tu Gar, playing ska, shouts: 'All police officers, remain on your feet!' As one, the audience hits the ground.</p> <p>As for the people killed by Eta, Zaloa bites her lips: 'I am dreadfully sorry for those people, but it is the only solution we have. That is the way it is.' But would she be prepared to meet someone and just kill him? Silence. 'Yes, I think I definitely would,' she says. Irune adds: 'Me, too. People would be surprised at what we are willing to do.'</p> <p>Driving back to Bilbao in the middle of the night, Igor explains: 'People would show up on my doorstep in the middle of the night, asking me if it was all right if they stayed with me. I never knew why they asked me, but I always agreed. Everybody knows someone who might be involved ... you never know. It's a risk you take.'</p> <p>The next afternoon, Sunday, in Abusu, a small town near Bilbao, Joseba Tzaga is being welcomed home.

      "bodyText": "Friday evening. In nearly all Bilbao's telephone booths the receivers have been ripped off - because the telephone company is Spanish. Cash dispensers have been smashed for a similar reason. The tension in the wet, narrow streets of the Basque city is palpable. 'Gora [long live] Eta!' screams the graffiti next to the pulverised money-machine. Here, three months ago, an Eta commando unit carrying 25 kilograms of dynamite accidentally blew itself up. One of them was 22 years old, another 23. Harriet Iragi (a man) was also 23 when he was arrested with his friend Jon Solana, 26, for killing an army doctor in Seville. They had shot the doctor in the face. The authorities suspect that Iragi and Solana, who were born in the old city centre of Bilbao a couple of doors from each other, were also involved in last summer's shootings of a public prosecutor in Granada and a city councillor from Malaga. Now their faces, looking like shiny pop stars, hang alongside those of a dozen other arrested activists above the bottles in Lariko, a bar in Bilbao. Igor, to whom I am talking, stares pensively for a moment at the pictures, then puts the change left over from the beers he ordered in a collection box for them. 'These people are all from this neighbourhood,' he says. Igor knows a few of them. 'Those four were murdered by the Spanish police,' he says, echoing the inflammatory rhetoric of the abertzale, the Basque patriot movement. According to its supporters, the Basque country is an occupied state, and the imprisoned members of Eta ( Euskadi Ta Askatasuna , or 'Basque Country and Freedom') are political prisoners. No region in the world enjoys such a high degree of self-government as the Basque country of Spain. It has its own regional rule, its own police and its own tax system - but Igor curses the Spanish identity card he has to carry. 'I am Basque, not Spanish. Believe me, as long as they don't acknowledge our rights, many more will die,' he warns, sipping his beer. He is far from unusual. A recent survey revealed that one in three Basque youths considers urban guerrilla tactics a good way to bring the 'foreign occupation' to its knees. One in 10 would not hesitate to use a weapon. The Lariko bar is crowded. Punk music blares in Euskera , the Basque language. The age of the average customer cannot be more than 24. They wear sweaters and mountaineering boots, and the girls show off their striking ponytails. 'Very pretty girls up here. Last summer we had some guys from Sinn Fein visiting us. They couldn't believe their eyes,' Igor says. 'At first, those guys from Belfast didn't understand it. It was not anything like Belfast. We don't have soldiers marching through the streets, tanks or any physical barriers, but at any moment streets might be closed off and riot police could enter the bar. They even use girls to infiltrate our movement.' Lariko is run by the radical nationalist party Herri Batasuna, the political backbone of Eta. In the last regional elections Herri Batasuna won 18 per cent of the votes. In other words, 223,262 Basques supported Eta's agenda. But that figure fails to reflect the support of those under the voting age. These youths join Haika, an Eta-led organisation that controls many separate groups. Haika is left-wing, anti-nuclear power, against Spain, in favour of squatters, feminism, conscientious objectors and the IRA. Harriet Iragi and Jon Solana are Haika products, as are all young recruits to Eta in the past decade. According to a study by the University of Bilbao, they are ordinary youths, aged between 15 and 26. The report says: 'They come from middle- and lower-middle-class backgrounds and are strongly influenced by the separatist ideology preached by the moderate nationalist parties. They believe violence is the only answer to the real oppression, exercised by an occupying force. As a result, they feel they have to do certain things.' Igor indignantly rejects the report's idea of a generation without any opportunity. 'It claims it is something new for young people to end up with Eta. Take Harriet Iragi for instance. He studied to become a technical engineer and was a nice bloke, timid even.' Four years ago, Iragi suddenly vanished after being released on bail following a petrol-bomb attack on a police patrol. 'So we all knew where Harriet had ended up.' Exactly what makes an engineering student attack a police patrol and end up with Eta, Igor can't say. 'One day, Eta just asks you.. and if they want you, you go.' A man and two women enter Lariko and are instantly surrounded. 'They are Harriet's parents and lawyer.' The latest news gets around: of how he has been put into isolation, and how a net has been stretched above the prison yard. 'Why did they do that?' a girl wants to know. 'So helicopters can't land,' the lawyer explains. 'Then why doesn't Harriet take the subway?' This remark sets off laughter in Lariko. Iragi's father looks weary. After a cat-and-mouse game in Seville, Iragi had surrendered to the police. 'He had partly undressed himself to prevent them thinking he was wearing a gun under his clothes and shooting him.' New laws are being prepared. 'In future, a minor may get up to 10 years for smashing telephones,' Igor growls. 'It'll only make the step to armed struggle easier. Before, you went as far as you felt like. But if they give you 10 years for a broken telephone booth, you might as well just kill someone.' When asked whether he would be prepared to go that far, Igor repeats his formula. 'If they want you, you go.' Under the heading 'Urban Terrorism', the Interior Ministry reported a 30 per cent increase in street vandalism last year. In the first half of 2000 the Ministry recorded 298 attacks, mostly incendiary bombs against public buildings and 'property of individuals'. In July a member of the ruling political party, the Partido Popular, had a Molotov cocktail thrown at the front of his house, and his horses were sprayed with ' Gora Eta!'. It is Saturday evening, and Igor has invited me to a party being thrown by the Basque patriotic students' union. On the way there he tells of the eight months he spent in prison after being arrested for acts of public disorder. He had a plastic bag put over his head until he choked, and he claims he is not the only one to have had such an experience. 'Nobody believes Basque prisoners are maltreated in Spanish prisons, but it definitely happens. Beatings, forcing your head in a bucket filled with water until you almost drown, humiliating people by questioning them while they are naked. Rapes.' In a June 1999 briefing, Amnesty International expressed its concerns about 'allegations of torture and ill-treatment' of Eta suspects. In several of these cases the accusations were supported by medical evidence, 'although other allegations were, by their nature, almost impossible to substantiate'. In the same briefing, Amnesty called on Eta to put an immediate end to its 'numerous violent and intimidating acts'. Rain falls mercilessly as we trudge around the muddy ground of the open-air party. It doesn't bother the thousands of cheerful students. A canvas, on which an axe and a snake are painted (Eta's coat of arms), is lying submerged in a pool of water on the path to one of the stages. Further on, two of Igor's female friends are drinking Cokes. Zaloa is 19, Irune, 21. 'You know how it is. Whenever I travel to Madrid, I don't find anything I can identify myself with. I always end up back here, in the Basque country,' Zaloa says. What most offends her are the tourists, walking through the streets of Bilbao, clapping to flamenco. 'I want them to recognise that I have my own culture.' The conversation shifts to the increase in the criminal penalties for minors. Irune shrugs. 'I don't know anybody who has not been fined. I know this guy who had to pay 50,000 pesetas [\u00a3180] for writing a slogan on a wall. That is not news to us. You're risking your life, so you have to be prepared.' Zaloa adds: 'They want to get rid of us, though I know I sound fanatical when I say so. But I am convinced the Basque country would have been wiped off the maps if Eta had not existed.' The singer with the band Su Tu Gar, playing ska, shouts: 'All police officers, remain on your feet!' As one, the audience hits the ground. As for the people killed by Eta, Zaloa bites her lips: 'I am dreadfully sorry for those people, but it is the only solution we have. That is the way it is.' But would she be prepared to meet someone and just kill him? Silence. 'Yes, I think I definitely would,' she says. Irune adds: 'Me, too. People would be surprised at what we are willing to do.' Driving back to Bilbao in the middle of the night, Igor explains: 'People would show up on my doorstep in the middle of the night, asking me if it was all right if they stayed with me. I never knew why they asked me, but I always agreed. Everybody knows someone who might be involved ... you never know. It's a risk you take.' The next afternoon, Sunday, in Abusu, a small town near Bilbao, Joseba Tzaga is being welcomed home. He has been in prison for four years for his involvement with Eta and is being received as a hero by about 200 fellow villagers. In return, he has some stirring words: 'If they think they can trample us down in their prisons, they are making a big mistake.' Aitor, a 21-year-old construction worker, applauds. He is wearing silver rings in both ears and an Adidas shirt. He spent a few days last summer in a squat in Amsterdam. 'Nice people, although they didn't understand our commitment to Basque independence at all. They confused nationalism with the things they saw in Serbia, something to do with the extreme right, and referring all the time to Nazism.' Aitor's eyes reflect his incredulity. 'They weren't aware at all of how we were fighting imperialism, just like in Holland.' Tzaga clenches his fist. 'We're going to win this fight!' Two people step forward, presenting him with a gift from the village. He waves it above his head. On a wooden shield, the axe and the snake are ingeniously carved. Under it, in the bleak afternoon sun, the letters of Eta glimmer. \u0095 This article appears in the current issue of the New Statesman",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Twenty three years after the mysterious disappearance of a casino heiress in Nice, her former lover is being investigated for her kidnapping and murder.</p> <p>Jean-Maurice Agnelet always denied playing any role in the disappearance of Agn\u00e8s Le Roux, last seen driving out of Nice in a Range Rover on 30 October 1977.</p> <p>He claimed she had organised her own disappearance after salting away several million francs that she received from the sale of her interest in the Palais de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e casino. 'She must be living it up in Marrakesh or LA,' he told friends at the time.</p> <p>Agnelet claimed to be in Geneva on the day of Le Roux's disappearance, and had an apparently watertight alibi - the testimony of Fran\u00e7oise Lausseure, another woman with whom he was having an affair. As a result of Lausseure's statement, in 1985, the case against Agnelet was dropped.</p> <p>But in October last year the former lawyer's alibi collapsed when Lausseure, who subsequently became Agnelet's wife, withdrew her statement. 'I gave a false alibi for Jean-Maurice Agnelet,' she told judges.</p> <p>Now investigating judges have ordered the reopening of one of the most murky and intriguing criminal cases in recent French history. It is one of those affairs that has everything - sex, the Mafia, gambling, betrayal, a whiff of murder and the stink of money. Everything, that is, apart from a corpse.</p> <p>The story started in May 1977 when Le Roux tried to withdraw her inheritance from the Palais de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, one of Nice's two biggest casinos. Her mother, Ren\u00e9e, a reportedly tough businesswoman who directed the casino, refused.</p> <p>At this point, Le Roux took the advice of Agnelet, who recommended her to sell for three million francs (about \u00a3300,000) her right to vote on the casino's administrative council to the notorious Jean-Dominique Fratoni, a Mafia emissary, who was at the time implicated in a corruption scandal at the rival Ruhl casino along the Promenade des Anglais in Nice.</p> <p>Indeed, Frantoni was eager to buy out the competition and he was assisted, if unintentionally, by Agnelet. 'What Ren\u00e9e Le Roux didn't know was that, inside the Palais de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e which she ran, Frantoni had his Trojan horse in the shape of Agnelet,' recalled Le Figaro last week.</p> <p>When Frantoni bought up Le Roux's vote on the administrative council, that put Ren\u00e9e in the minority and enabled him to take control of the casino.</p> <p>At the time Nice was in thrall to organised crime; even the flamboyant mayor, Jacques M\u00e9decin, felt the need to have links with the Mafia. 'Avoid the region of Nice,' wrote Graham Greene, at the time living along the coast in Antibes, in a polemic entitled J'Accuse, 'reserve of some of the most criminal organisations in the South of France.'</p> <p>Frantoni is now dead, but Nice police belatedly suspect him of having used his new acquisition to launder Mafia drug money.</p> <p>During the summer, Agnelet and Le Roux put most of the money Frantoni had paid them into joint accounts. Later, after repeated transfers, the money wound up in accounts in the names of Agnelet and his other mistress, Fran\u00e7oise.</p> <p>In early October, Le Roux twice attempted suicide. According to reports, Agnelet tried to stop her only half-heartedly, but by 26 October he was promising her a trip away from Nice in order to rekindle their relationship.</p> <p>Four days later, Le Roux disappeared. Only her mother seemed concerned and, in March the following year, reported her disappearance to the police. Detectives searched Le Roux's flat and found a note: 'Sorry, I'm at the end of my road, I stop here. I want Maurice to look after everything.' Questioned by police, Agnelet told a lie, saying he scarcely knew her. But when detectives searched his flat they found a photocopy of Le Roux's farewell note and keys to her flat.</p> <p>Agnelet told detectives he had been in Geneva when Le Roux disappeared and the following day had gone to Paris to attend a conference of the League of the Rights of Man. Swiss police could confirm only that Lausseure stayed in a Geneva hotel on the night in question but could not say with whom. In Paris, the president of the league said Agnelet had not attended the conference.Yet, in 1985, an investigating judge closed the dossier on the case.</p> <p>Only Ren\u00e9e Le Roux, Agn\u00e8s's mother, kept a candle burning, despite having been betrayed by her daughter. She wrote books accusing freemasons of hushing up the affair. Her stubborness seems to have paid off. Late last year, investigating judge Anne Vella re-interviewed Lausseure, who had been living in Canada as Agnelet's wife.</p> <p>Then Agnelet had an interview with Vella. 'My client has come back to France to put himself in the hands of the judges,' said his lawyer. 'For him this is an opportunity to show his total innocence.'

      "bodyText": "Twenty three years after the mysterious disappearance of a casino heiress in Nice, her former lover is being investigated for her kidnapping and murder. Jean-Maurice Agnelet always denied playing any role in the disappearance of Agn\u00e8s Le Roux, last seen driving out of Nice in a Range Rover on 30 October 1977. He claimed she had organised her own disappearance after salting away several million francs that she received from the sale of her interest in the Palais de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e casino. 'She must be living it up in Marrakesh or LA,' he told friends at the time. Agnelet claimed to be in Geneva on the day of Le Roux's disappearance, and had an apparently watertight alibi - the testimony of Fran\u00e7oise Lausseure, another woman with whom he was having an affair. As a result of Lausseure's statement, in 1985, the case against Agnelet was dropped. But in October last year the former lawyer's alibi collapsed when Lausseure, who subsequently became Agnelet's wife, withdrew her statement. 'I gave a false alibi for Jean-Maurice Agnelet,' she told judges. Now investigating judges have ordered the reopening of one of the most murky and intriguing criminal cases in recent French history. It is one of those affairs that has everything - sex, the Mafia, gambling, betrayal, a whiff of murder and the stink of money. Everything, that is, apart from a corpse. The story started in May 1977 when Le Roux tried to withdraw her inheritance from the Palais de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, one of Nice's two biggest casinos. Her mother, Ren\u00e9e, a reportedly tough businesswoman who directed the casino, refused. At this point, Le Roux took the advice of Agnelet, who recommended her to sell for three million francs (about \u00a3300,000) her right to vote on the casino's administrative council to the notorious Jean-Dominique Fratoni, a Mafia emissary, who was at the time implicated in a corruption scandal at the rival Ruhl casino along the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. Indeed, Frantoni was eager to buy out the competition and he was assisted, if unintentionally, by Agnelet. 'What Ren\u00e9e Le Roux didn't know was that, inside the Palais de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e which she ran, Frantoni had his Trojan horse in the shape of Agnelet,' recalled Le Figaro last week. When Frantoni bought up Le Roux's vote on the administrative council, that put Ren\u00e9e in the minority and enabled him to take control of the casino. At the time Nice was in thrall to organised crime; even the flamboyant mayor, Jacques M\u00e9decin, felt the need to have links with the Mafia. 'Avoid the region of Nice,' wrote Graham Greene, at the time living along the coast in Antibes, in a polemic entitled J'Accuse, 'reserve of some of the most criminal organisations in the South of France.' Frantoni is now dead, but Nice police belatedly suspect him of having used his new acquisition to launder Mafia drug money. During the summer, Agnelet and Le Roux put most of the money Frantoni had paid them into joint accounts. Later, after repeated transfers, the money wound up in accounts in the names of Agnelet and his other mistress, Fran\u00e7oise. In early October, Le Roux twice attempted suicide. According to reports, Agnelet tried to stop her only half-heartedly, but by 26 October he was promising her a trip away from Nice in order to rekindle their relationship. Four days later, Le Roux disappeared. Only her mother seemed concerned and, in March the following year, reported her disappearance to the police. Detectives searched Le Roux's flat and found a note: 'Sorry, I'm at the end of my road, I stop here. I want Maurice to look after everything.' Questioned by police, Agnelet told a lie, saying he scarcely knew her. But when detectives searched his flat they found a photocopy of Le Roux's farewell note and keys to her flat. Agnelet told detectives he had been in Geneva when Le Roux disappeared and the following day had gone to Paris to attend a conference of the League of the Rights of Man. Swiss police could confirm only that Lausseure stayed in a Geneva hotel on the night in question but could not say with whom. In Paris, the president of the league said Agnelet had not attended the conference.Yet, in 1985, an investigating judge closed the dossier on the case. Only Ren\u00e9e Le Roux, Agn\u00e8s's mother, kept a candle burning, despite having been betrayed by her daughter. She wrote books accusing freemasons of hushing up the affair. Her stubborness seems to have paid off. Late last year, investigating judge Anne Vella re-interviewed Lausseure, who had been living in Canada as Agnelet's wife. Then Agnelet had an interview with Vella. 'My client has come back to France to put himself in the hands of the judges,' said his lawyer. 'For him this is an opportunity to show his total innocence.' Agnelet told Vella he had spent the night of 30 October 1977 with Lausseure and produced a bill from a Paris hotel for the following night. His lawyer said he wanted to confront his estranged wife. Le Roux's body has not been found and claims that she has spent the past 23 years living it up in a foreign hotspot have not been confirmed. They seem unlikely: after all, Le Roux saw little of her inheritance - enough to buy the Range Rover in which she was last seen. Her mother believes she was murdered by a gold-digging former lover: 'Agnelet has always wriggled out of it. But today the inquiry is being led with much more energy than before,' she said. Only one problem persists for Mrs Le Roux's hopes of seeing Agnelet put behind bars: even if police do find her daughter's body and Agnelet is found guilty of murdering her, he cannot be convicted because of France's 10-year statute of limitations on capital offences.",

      "body": "<p>On a dark evening several months ago, my teenage son was stopped at the end of the road by a bigger boy who asked him to turn out his pockets and hand over his mobile phone. The mugger said he was carrying a knife. This minor incident seemed unlikely to raise a flicker of interest from the police, but they behaved as if confronted with a reprise of the Great Train Robbery. Friendly officers camped in our kitchen and took multiple statements. They drove my son round the district to see if he could spot his assailant, which he did. They urged him to pick the boy out at an identity parade and, subsequently, to give evidence in court.</p> <p>The process took weeks and my son grew frightened. He said that he would be identified as a grass and beaten up whenever he walked home late. I said, piously, that it was his duty to co-operate to save anyone else being threatened or hurt. Besides, he would have wasted hours of police time if he pulled out. As it transpired, the helpful officers were wasting their own. We were driven miles to the parade, installed in a waiting-room for an hour and dismissed.</p> <p>The suspect's solicitor had, quite properly, objected that no one in the line-up resembled his client and demanded that the procedure be aborted. There would be a replay, the police said, in another part of London better supplied with phone-snatcher lookalikes. They would let us know the date. We never heard from them again.</p> <p>I suppose such pointless and expensive exercises go on constantly, hence Jack Straw's move last week to shift the pressure to mobile phone companies. Thefts are fuelling the rise in street muggings. Ergo, the manufacturers must improve product security. If it worked for cars, it will work for phones. Another Home Office winner, except that car thieves are specific in their targets. Teenage muggers are less focused. The real object for the bully-boy element is not to cut a resale deal or do something clever with a phone smart card but to assert power and secure a trophy. Anything would do.</p> <p>At the sinister end of the spectrum, police now surmise that the murder of Damilola Taylor was part of a new pattern in which attackers 'mark' their victims with a slash wound denoting the stamp of the controller on the controlled. This week, Damilola will be laid to rest in a private funeral. Recorded crime statistics, due out in a few days, are expected to show yet another rise in youth-on-youth violence. Police numbers dwindle and beat cops are such a spectral presence that the force, if wishing to emulate Consignia (the Post Office, as was) might usefully rebrand itself Etherea.</p> <p>Something must be done on youth crime. But what, exactly? By a curious irony, the Government's half-baked phone initiative coincided with one of the greatest lessons of our time on redeeming violent children. The treatment of James Bulger's killers is a tribute to the best in teaching and rehabilitation and a testament to the humanity of the judicial system. Against a backdrop of escalating crime and grim young offenders' institutions, the transformation of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables into educated, repentant young men is a beacon of what a decent society should aspire to.</p> <p>No one said so. Not William Hague, who spent the week embroidering his vision of bogeyman Britain. Not Jack Straw, who was busy berating Nokia. No political voice countered the cries for vengeance in the debate that followed Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss's correct decision to give the boys their anonymity on release. The agenda of hatred was led by the Sun, replete with details of the supposedly sybaritic lives of killers permitted to see videos and watch Shakespeare (hardly the high watermark of teenage roistering), when natural justice should decree a life spent fleeing newsdesk scrutineers and brutish vigilantes.</p> <p>It would be wrong, however, to single out newspapers as the sole crucible of loathing for boys who will remain notorious long after the names of Anna Climbie's killers have slipped from memory. The fulcrum of press interest is Denise Fergus, who wants her son's killers 'haunted and hunted'. In her television interview with Martin Bashir, she denied seeking revenge but could not bring herself to say that she did not wish harm to befall them. Mrs Fergus's sorrow rightly puts her beyond criticism. It does not place her beyond influence.</p> <p>The suspicion is that solicitors or advisers have encouraged her to believe that her views, on sentencing and punishment, should constitute a surrogate form of law. Her despair, on learning that it is not so, nourishes a heartbreak that spills over into papers harnessing her anguish as justification for their frenzy. To break such vicious circles is hard.</p> <p>For parents who have lost children to violence, there is no normal land to reclaim. Some, like Colin Parry, whose son was murdered at Warrington, or Diana Lamplugh, sublimate their grief in work for the public good. Even then, release is not an option. Gordon Wilson, the draper whose daughter, Marie, was killed in the Enniskillen bombing, became an Irish senator and a crusader against conflict. As an old man, he demanded to meet the IRA, who gave him orange juice and buns and listened, in a mood he interpreted as silent scorn, to his imprecations.</p> <p>He died several years later, alone in his bedroom, with his papers spread in front of him. His wife told me that he had worked himself to death, in the knowledge that the peace he strove for would forever elude him.</p> <p>There is another, bleaker course. Ann West, mother of one of the Moors victims, railed from her deathbed against Myra Hindley, the author of her daughter's death and her own, ruined life. The fate of corrosive misery without limit seems to be the route down which Denise Fergus is being steered by those who fail to tell her that the public, though it weeps for her, no longer shares her cause. The mood on the street is that justice has been done and the tariff paid. The wish is that the Bulger killers should be left, undisturbed, to face the huge and perhaps insuperable difficulties facing them.

      "bodyText": "On a dark evening several months ago, my teenage son was stopped at the end of the road by a bigger boy who asked him to turn out his pockets and hand over his mobile phone. The mugger said he was carrying a knife. This minor incident seemed unlikely to raise a flicker of interest from the police, but they behaved as if confronted with a reprise of the Great Train Robbery. Friendly officers camped in our kitchen and took multiple statements. They drove my son round the district to see if he could spot his assailant, which he did. They urged him to pick the boy out at an identity parade and, subsequently, to give evidence in court. The process took weeks and my son grew frightened. He said that he would be identified as a grass and beaten up whenever he walked home late. I said, piously, that it was his duty to co-operate to save anyone else being threatened or hurt. Besides, he would have wasted hours of police time if he pulled out. As it transpired, the helpful officers were wasting their own. We were driven miles to the parade, installed in a waiting-room for an hour and dismissed. The suspect's solicitor had, quite properly, objected that no one in the line-up resembled his client and demanded that the procedure be aborted. There would be a replay, the police said, in another part of London better supplied with phone-snatcher lookalikes. They would let us know the date. We never heard from them again. I suppose such pointless and expensive exercises go on constantly, hence Jack Straw's move last week to shift the pressure to mobile phone companies. Thefts are fuelling the rise in street muggings. Ergo, the manufacturers must improve product security. If it worked for cars, it will work for phones. Another Home Office winner, except that car thieves are specific in their targets. Teenage muggers are less focused. The real object for the bully-boy element is not to cut a resale deal or do something clever with a phone smart card but to assert power and secure a trophy. Anything would do. At the sinister end of the spectrum, police now surmise that the murder of Damilola Taylor was part of a new pattern in which attackers 'mark' their victims with a slash wound denoting the stamp of the controller on the controlled. This week, Damilola will be laid to rest in a private funeral. Recorded crime statistics, due out in a few days, are expected to show yet another rise in youth-on-youth violence. Police numbers dwindle and beat cops are such a spectral presence that the force, if wishing to emulate Consignia (the Post Office, as was) might usefully rebrand itself Etherea. Something must be done on youth crime. But what, exactly? By a curious irony, the Government's half-baked phone initiative coincided with one of the greatest lessons of our time on redeeming violent children. The treatment of James Bulger's killers is a tribute to the best in teaching and rehabilitation and a testament to the humanity of the judicial system. Against a backdrop of escalating crime and grim young offenders' institutions, the transformation of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables into educated, repentant young men is a beacon of what a decent society should aspire to. No one said so. Not William Hague, who spent the week embroidering his vision of bogeyman Britain. Not Jack Straw, who was busy berating Nokia. No political voice countered the cries for vengeance in the debate that followed Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss's correct decision to give the boys their anonymity on release. The agenda of hatred was led by the Sun, replete with details of the supposedly sybaritic lives of killers permitted to see videos and watch Shakespeare (hardly the high watermark of teenage roistering), when natural justice should decree a life spent fleeing newsdesk scrutineers and brutish vigilantes. It would be wrong, however, to single out newspapers as the sole crucible of loathing for boys who will remain notorious long after the names of Anna Climbie's killers have slipped from memory. The fulcrum of press interest is Denise Fergus, who wants her son's killers 'haunted and hunted'. In her television interview with Martin Bashir, she denied seeking revenge but could not bring herself to say that she did not wish harm to befall them. Mrs Fergus's sorrow rightly puts her beyond criticism. It does not place her beyond influence. The suspicion is that solicitors or advisers have encouraged her to believe that her views, on sentencing and punishment, should constitute a surrogate form of law. Her despair, on learning that it is not so, nourishes a heartbreak that spills over into papers harnessing her anguish as justification for their frenzy. To break such vicious circles is hard. For parents who have lost children to violence, there is no normal land to reclaim. Some, like Colin Parry, whose son was murdered at Warrington, or Diana Lamplugh, sublimate their grief in work for the public good. Even then, release is not an option. Gordon Wilson, the draper whose daughter, Marie, was killed in the Enniskillen bombing, became an Irish senator and a crusader against conflict. As an old man, he demanded to meet the IRA, who gave him orange juice and buns and listened, in a mood he interpreted as silent scorn, to his imprecations. He died several years later, alone in his bedroom, with his papers spread in front of him. His wife told me that he had worked himself to death, in the knowledge that the peace he strove for would forever elude him. There is another, bleaker course. Ann West, mother of one of the Moors victims, railed from her deathbed against Myra Hindley, the author of her daughter's death and her own, ruined life. The fate of corrosive misery without limit seems to be the route down which Denise Fergus is being steered by those who fail to tell her that the public, though it weeps for her, no longer shares her cause. The mood on the street is that justice has been done and the tariff paid. The wish is that the Bulger killers should be left, undisturbed, to face the huge and perhaps insuperable difficulties facing them. But who dares publicly to hail their impending release as a milestone in justice and rehabilitation? Instead, the legacy of the case is a cold collation of spite and bitterness. The press has been muzzled because it cannot be trusted not to imperil the boys' lives and nurture the desires of ill-wishers, Ralph Bulger included, who threaten to hunt them down. For newspapers to complain that a dangerous precedent has been set is pointless now. Press freedom, however sacrosanct, is not to be bought in blood. Myra Hindley should have her anonymity, too, if she ever genuinely faces execution as a result of media-confected rage. And it is confected. The danger is that the focus on a retributive minority hints, falsely but perilously, at a cruel society to which redemption is anathema. No wonder youth crime is a problem. How are the juvenile bullies, the phone-snatchers and the slashers to absorb a sense of mercy when the available evidence tells them how fixated grown-ups are on savagery?",

On 21 September last year, he told an influential committee of the Senate that 'in fact, we project that US territory is probably more likely to be attacked with weapons of mass destruction from non-missile delivery means (most likely from non-state entities) than by missiles, primarily because non-missile delivery means are less costly, and more reliable and accurate. They can also be used without attribution.' Why, then, the announced haste to build a National Missile Defence System, and why has William Hague so precipitately thrown his inconsiderable weight behind it?</p> <p>Cast your mind back to the dark days of the Cold War. The United States Missile Threat Commission was chaired by President Ford's former Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. His Cold War vision was of threats on all sides, threats which led to his opposition to the Salt II Treaty of 1979, and eventually to an apocalyptic paper in the 'CIA Historical Review Program' of 12 September, 1983, entitled 'Possible Soviet Responses to the SDI [Strategic Defence Initiative]'.</p> <p>It seems that Mr Rumsfeld has not challenged his view, other than to replace the Soviets with an assortment of selected and so-called rogue regimes. The problem is that he is once again to be Defence Secretary, with another former defence secretary - Dick Cheney - as Vice-President, and America's favourite soldier - Colin Powell - as Secretary of State. Jesse Helms is reinvigorated, and it seems the Cold War warriors are back with a vengeance.</p> <p>What gives rise to their anxieties, and how does a United Kingdom politician become so embroiled in another country's dangerous flight of fancy? It appears that the United States fears that a rogue country might develop a missile capable of striking American soil and might be insane enough to kill a handful of Americans in the sure knowledge that America's retaliation would be terse, terrible and total. To that improbable scenario the American Right has turned its attention, with the likely upgrading of the Star Wars programme. George W. Bush has already signalled his approval.</p> <p>The snag is that the SDI has failed on each of the three attempts to knock out a target missile. Nor are the potential enemies seen as credible in the role in which they have been cast. These awkward facts seem to be of little consequence to Mr Hague, who has pledged his party to this destabilising American proposal in his Gadarene rush to grab at political gimmicks. Already, both Russia and China are incensed by this wholly questionable spur to a new arms race; and our European allies are extremely uneasy at these American plans.</p> <p>Perhaps that is part of the attraction for Mr Hague, in a week in which he told the European Democrat Union that he was passionate about European Union enlargement, even as he attacked that same European Union and its 'unreasonable demands' and 'stubborn refusal to reform itself'. So keen is he to lead his party ever further into the wilderness that, as he proclaimed himself a supporter of diplomatic efforts to win over rogue states, he then urged that the we should take a lead in Europe for a global missile defence shield.</p> <p>Mr Hague represents Richmond in North Yorkshire, not a million miles from the Fylingdales early warning station. Without this station being upgraded, the American SDI cannot work (assuming the small difficulty of accuracy can be overcome). However, the American plan does not protect the United Kingdom, although Fylingdales would become the first target for those supposed Korean or Iranian missiles.</p> <p>Fylingdales may well be a future Greenham Common - except that Greenham Common reflected a strategy which placed the United Kingdom within the Nato nuclear umbrella. SDI merely turns the United Kingdom into a target to cater for American paranoia.</p> <p>Yet this faux pas of Mr Hague in his unseemly haste to cosy up to the new American administration, and his enthusiasm for irritating our fellow Europeans, does not leave the Labour Government untouched. On the contrary, given the improbability of a Hague-led Tory party being other than the handrags of the next parliament, Tony Blair and his colleagues face a potentially momentous challenge.</p> <p>Last Thursday, retiring US Defence Secretary William S. Cohen spoke to the Woodrow Wilson Centre for Scholars in Washington. Speaking of Europe, he said: 'After all, we in the United States have been banging on the door saying you've got to do more, you haven't spent enough, you haven't reformed your military, do more. They say OK, now we're prepared to do more. Suddenly, you have people over here saying, well that is not quite what we meant. There is some confusion.'</p> <p>Quite. Europe gets its act together and is attacked by the American Right and its Tory party cohorts. Part of this is ideological, where the good ol' boys of the Republican Party see most Europeans as proto-pinkos at best. There is also the small matter of defence industry dollars. The United States' military-industrial complex (Eisenhower's description) feels uneasy about any challenge to its supremacy. There is consistent opposition from some across the pond to closer European cooperation or integration, whether on the equipment procurement side, or in operational matters, unless this occurs in areas of little interest to the US.</p> <p>Thus, an American general could state categorically on British radio last November that Americans will not allow anyone else to be 'in charge' within Nato. Such comments do not reflect partnership, but domination, and irritate those who wish to see a mature relationship develop between a more co-ordinated Europe, and our North American partners. Likewise, pan-European defence companies reflect not only economic common sense, but co-ordinated procurement standards. The Americans should surely see these developments as a positive response to the demands recalled by William Cohen, rather than as threats to American military and industrial hegemony. For some observers, these differences portend a potentially seismic shift in the way alliances of the twentieth century will develop in the twenty first. In the short term, the British Government must decide how much it is worth to offer itself as a hostage to the fortune of the misguided - literally and metaphorically - Strategic Defence Initiative. If America's putative enemies do have plans to suicidally attack America, why should we be the primary target?</p> <p>In the longer term, will there be significant reasons to maintain the increasingly mythical special relationship with the US if it is to be at the cost of our political, economic (and, possibly, security) interests in Europe? Where will our longer term interests lie? These are profound questions which cannot easily continue to be dismissed, and which will demand a considered response to Mr Bush from the British Government. The incoming American administration - with its isolationist and authoritarian instincts - might very well put us to the test rather sooner than we expected.</p> <p>The Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation had intended that the next phase of SDI should commence in mid-2000. After all, organisations like the Rand Corporation and the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, have been working on it for 20 years. Many American companies have a big investment in SDI. Last year, the politicians deferred a decision on it given the impending elections of 2000. George W. Bush and his people, now that they are to assume power, will have no such hesitation in implementing Star Wars. The ice man cometh, and may freeze out an unprepared Labour Government.</p>",

Part of this is ideological, where the good ol' boys of the Republican Party see most Europeans as proto-pinkos at best. There is also the small matter of defence industry dollars. The United States' military-industrial complex (Eisenhower's description) feels uneasy about any challenge to its supremacy. There is consistent opposition from some across the pond to closer European cooperation or integration, whether on the equipment procurement side, or in operational matters, unless this occurs in areas of little interest to the US. Thus, an American general could state categorically on British radio last November that Americans will not allow anyone else to be 'in charge' within Nato. Such comments do not reflect partnership, but domination, and irritate those who wish to see a mature relationship develop between a more co-ordinated Europe, and our North American partners. Likewise, pan-European defence companies reflect not only economic common sense, but co-ordinated procurement standards. The Americans should surely see these developments as a positive response to the demands recalled by William Cohen, rather than as threats to American military and industrial hegemony. For some observers, these differences portend a potentially seismic shift in the way alliances of the twentieth century will develop in the twenty first. In the short term, the British Government must decide how much it is worth to offer itself as a hostage to the fortune of the misguided - literally and metaphorically - Strategic Defence Initiative. If America's putative enemies do have plans to suicidally attack America, why should we be the primary target? In the longer term, will there be significant reasons to maintain the increasingly mythical special relationship with the US if it is to be at the cost of our political, economic (and, possibly, security) interests in Europe? Where will our longer term interests lie? These are profound questions which cannot easily continue to be dismissed, and which will demand a considered response to Mr Bush from the British Government. The incoming American administration - with its isolationist and authoritarian instincts - might very well put us to the test rather sooner than we expected. The Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation had intended that the next phase of SDI should commence in mid-2000. After all, organisations like the Rand Corporation and the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, have been working on it for 20 years. Many American companies have a big investment in SDI. Last year, the politicians deferred a decision on it given the impending elections of 2000. George W. Bush and his people, now that they are to assume power, will have no such hesitation in implementing Star Wars. The ice man cometh, and may freeze out an unprepared Labour Government.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Helene and Brian Torr</strong></p> <p>Helene Torr speaks to me with the exuberant noise of children in the background. This turns what she has to say into a story: something in the past, an unhappiness she can look back on happily. She was 31 when she started trying to have children - just after she got married six years ago. 'I always wanted children,' she says. 'My husband Brian is older than I am and he already had children. We knew we wanted to try for our own family immediately.' You initially think, she says, that it will be fine. 'You're told you should try for at least a year before worrying. I'm glad now that we didn't know the road ahead, the battle.'</p> <p>Nothing happened. 'It is on your mind all the time. You see pregnant women everywhere. It can turn into an obsession. I remember once having to leave work when someone brought their new baby in. I couldn't do what other women do so easily. I wasn't a real woman - I had failed. The monthly cycle is a torment: life becomes a matter of periods. Everything has a new timescale to it. </p> <p>I started doing the pregnancy tests even before my period was due. I'd always be thinking, \"This might be the month.\" I used to plan how I would tell my husband that I was pregnant. What I'd say, how he'd look; the joy of it.</p> <p>'Trying to conceive is very private. I think I can only talk about it now that it's happened. At the time, it's hard. </p> <p>I didn't want to discuss it - I just wanted to announce the good news, like everybody else: I'm having a baby! People don't really understand, unless they've been through it themselves. They think that if you have a good job, a nice life, then you will be all right. But to think you'll not have children when it's all you really want - and everywhere you look you see families and you don't feel part of it at all I knew friends were talking among themselves, wondering why we didn't have children. It was the logical progression, after all. But they didn't ask, because somehow you're not meant to, and I didn't say anything.'</p> <p>They never talked together about what they would do if Helene never became pregnant: 'We couldn't bear to. It was unthinkable.' Eventually, the cause of their infertility was diagnosed - Brian had 'poor sperm shape and mobility'. It hit him hard. 'He had two children already; he'd succeeded and now he'd deteriorated. I think he felt he shouldn't be married to me - he should let me be free and go to someone who would give me the child I desperately wanted. He felt he was a burden. And to be completely honest, it did cross my mind that what he said was true. </p> <p>I could go and have a one-night stand and get pregnant and pretend it was his. I thought about things like that. But you know, I didn't just want a baby -I wanted our baby.'</p> <p>Once the diagnosis came it was easier, because then Helene and Brian felt that they could move forward: 'It wasn't just a life of hoping and wishing, and feeling alone with your problem.' However, they were not eligible for fertility treatment on the NHS. 'In Nottingham, there are six criteria, and we didn't meet all of them. But Nottingham is better than some places, where no one can have treatment on the NHS. It's as if your postcode determines whether you get a family or not. We had to raise the money. It's about \u00a33,000 a go. Borrowing money is always easier than paying it back.</p> <p>'I injected drugs for five weeks and had my eggs removed; he gave a sperm sample. They put the eggs and the sperm in a dish. The embryo is transferred two days later. You wait, pray, for two weeks, then you find out if you're pregnant or not.' She was. And then she wasn't, because a few weeks after the positive pregnancy test, she had a miscarriage. 'I'd been so excited, so happy, and I'd told everyone. I couldn't stop myself. I felt open to all sorts of pain after the miscarriage. It had worked and then it had been taken away. It seemed so cruel.' But there was also a sense of renewed hope.</p> <p>'We'd done it once, so we could do it again. And now, family and friends realised what was going on - because we'd told them about it at last, I suppose - and everyone rallied round and gave us support, without asking too many questions. Some people wait after a miscarriage; they need to recover emotionally before trying again. But I had to try as soon as possible - as soon as we'd raised the money for it. The only way I could deal with it was to do something, have some kind of control. So we borrowed money, and this time it worked. I was pregnant with twins. I lost one of the twins, but there was still one left. I was always at my GP with worries, niggles, fears. I suppose I was deeply aware that pregnancies don't go smoothly, that you can't take anything for granted.</p> <p>'And when he was born - oh, I'd wanted him for so long, I'd dreamt of this, prayed for it, struggled so hard for it. And I think it took a long time to sink in that it had really happened. Now Adam's three, and we have twins of 10 months - by IVF again, but this time I wasn't so desperate. Some people accused us of being selfish. Well, it's hard for people to understand.</p> <p>'For years I was prodded, pushed around. I lost all dignity. I conceived in a theatre full of people looking at me, staring at me. I was turned into an object, a medical failure. But I kept within myself the sense that there was something very special in the end - a great bond between me and my baby. Because of everything, I know and can never forget how very much he was wanted, how precious he is.'</p> <p><strong>Alex and Will Thorpe</strong></p> <p>Alex and Will talk with their three-week-old daughter on their lap. She has just been fed; she is drunk and bleary with milk. Every so often she whimpers and stretches her fists in the air. They look down at her as they speak - this is her story, too. She still feels like a miracle to them. 'It is all about timescales,' says Alex. 'At what point do you say you're infertile? At what point does it become a problem? It took three years, I suppose - that isn't very long. But that is 39 cycles, and a terrible long time.'</p> <p>Now in their mid-thirties, Alex and Will had talked about having children when they first met, though they waited until they felt financially secure before they started trying. 'We were broody,' says Will. 'But then, when we were really trying in a focused way, we forgot what broodiness was, because being broody is a sweet idea, really, happy and positive. But not succeeding is a dark place. The baby isn't there. It's like mourning - grieving for a child you don't have.'</p> <p>'And you can't let yourself be broody and believe,' adds Alex. 'You have to control your emotions. It's a mind game. If you tell yourself it won't happen, then maybe it will. You lose the joyful sense of possibility.'</p> <p>After nine months, and an abnormally painful period, Alex went to her GP, who referred her. There were the usual investigations and blood tests, and four months later the first appointment - but never any clear sense of what was wrong: a slightly odd hormone level, maybe polycystic ovaries, but each time the doctors said something different. 'And I started to feel,' says Alex, 'not guilty, exactly. But certainly low in self-esteem.'</p> <p>'And there is something about fertility that's like a virtue,' says Will. 'People talk about not being \"meant\" to have children. It is like a failure, somehow. We never talked about the realistic possibility that we would never have a child. And in dark, low moments we did ask: \"Why us? Does it mean anything about us?\" Sometimes you can't help saying that it's not fair. People have children they don't want. You see them screaming disgusting things at their children. They dislike them, abuse them. And here we are, doing everything we can - but no one ever said life would be fair.' </p> <p>'And we were out of synch,' says Alex. 'I was sad a lot of the time, and I felt low and bad because I no longer fitted in. Friends were just waiting for us to have a baby. Before, we were all the same. Now they were doing it and we were left behind, out of the loop. And not just in practical terms. The way you look at life is profoundly affected by having children. </p> <p>'It's hard to talk about. Most people don't get it - unless they're in the same situation. Then you don't even need to say anything, there's just empathy. People tried to protect us - not talking about their babies when we were there, things like that. I felt sad about that, and it added to the sense of being left out. So many of the emotions you feel are very childish, actually - like being left out, like wanting the things that other people have. Pretty basic stuff.' </p> <p>'It's part of you that hasn't happened,' adds Will. 'A bit of you hasn't been born, either.' </p> <p>There was a 'demoralising gap' when treatment happened very slowly, and the sludge of waiting lists and bureaucracy thwarted them. Alex had two bouts of hormone treatment which made her feel 'bizarre - hot flushes, shifting emotions, manic stretches'. Sex became 'totally unspontaneous, sometimes a real drag', says Will. The periods kept on coming. They were headed for IUI (Inter-Uterine Insemination), but the doctors were 'very good' about letting them do it in their own time. Alex wasn't ready. She started having acupuncture and herbal medicine. 'The acupuncturist hoped that within a year, even if nothing happened with conceiving, I would at least feel better. She treated me as a whole person, not just a womb that wasn't working. Everything had become so mechanistic and functional. Sex was functional. Sperm was functional. You're an object. She saw that I was demoralised and at a low ebb. She made me feel so much better about myself.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, they agreed to go ahead with the IUI. They had a holiday planned, and the treatment would begin after that. They would arrange the appointment straight after Alex's period. Their holiday was wonderful. They returned and waited for Alex's period. It didn't come.</p> <p>'We had to do two tests,' says Alex. 'The first was inconclusive. There was nothing at all in the window.' </p> <p>'A shadow,' says Will. 'A shadow of a shadow.' </p> <p>They were supposed to wait three days before the next test. 'I kept wanting to do it sooner,' says Alex. 'But Will just said, \"Wait, wait, wait.\"' </p> <p>'I was asleep when she did it,' says Will. 'She woke me up by pushing this pee-stained stick in my face and shouting.' </p> <p>'I couldn't stop laughing.' </p> <p>'Laughing and poking this stick in my face.' </p> <p>'The way it happened after the holiday, just before the IUI, it was unreal, almost mystical.' </p> <p>Will worried his way through the pregnancy. Alex didn't. 'I knew it would be all right,' she says. When their daughter was born, they cried for days, for sheer joy.</p> <p><strong>Joanne and Lester Evans</strong></p> <p>Although they have been trying for six years, the Evans do not have children. Now in their late thirties, they got married when they were ready to start trying ('Though looking back,' says Joanne, 'I wouldn't have minded having them before we married'). For several months, they remained reasonably phlegmatic about not succeeding; they knew that a year of waiting was not unusual. They were focused but not tyrannised: Joanne was taking folic acid, drinking little alcohol. Sex was quite planned - 'but nothing,' says Lester, 'in comparison with later, when we were doing it by the clock.'</p> <p>'Then, after a year or so, I thought I'd had an early miscarriage,' says Joanne. 'I went to my GP, who was extremely unsympathetic. She told me lots of couples had to be patient; I should go away and lose some weight. </p> <p>I hadn't thought I was overweight. But we did try and be patient. We concentrated on our jobs, doing the house up. We never made a secret that we were having problems with conceiving - that was our way of dealing with it. Everyone around us seemed to be having babies. Pregnant women were a problem for me, generally. I'd give them a wide berth.

I know that for some people it becomes an emotional black hole.'</p> <p>Lester and Joanne had the tests done, and as with so many couples, they were inconclusive - which perhaps helped them, they think, because there was no sense of blame about it. It was no one's fault or failure, and they have never found out what, exactly, is wrong. They tried IVF. Five times. At \u00a33,000 a time. 'With IVF came a gradual decay of hope,' says Lester. 'We kept on with it, but each time the peak of expectation was higher and the trough of darkness was lower. We were in an increasingly unhappy place. We weren't in control of our destinies. We were in the hands of the doctor, at the mercy of the waiting lists. And doctors are not good at dealing with failed treatment. Particularly when their patients are private, which we were obliged to be, and therefore are customers as well as patients. We did it, five times, and it was, well interesting, maybe; fascinating, you could even say - but it's a course of action I would recommend people to think very, very, very hard about. Because it's a high-stake game and the odds are that you will lose and continue to lose, and physically and emotionally it is very draining.'</p> <p>They had agreed that they would try three times. Because the third time was a botched attempt, with low-grade embryos, they went for a fourth. Then, because Joanne entered an egg-donor scheme, they tried a fifth. It wasn't the money that made them stop; Lester is well-paid. 'But the gambling analogy is a really good one,' says Lester. 'You can keep going back to the table. We were getting older; the odds were getting longer all the time.'</p> <p>'And I was on a roller coaster of emotions,' says Joanne. 'High and low. Every time I had treatment, I'd be really happy. This one could be our baby. We'd look at the embryos down a microscope. Everyone at the hospital would be very nice to us, and we had things we could do. Then every time it didn't work, we'd have nothing. No more hospital appointments, no more hope. Nothing. It was like being on hot coals. Periods were a devastation.</p> <p>'With our fifth attempt, we saw a doctor who was more candid with us, and treated us as individuals. He said we could keep on trying, but that we should know that it would always be marginal for us. And after everything we'd been through, we came to terms with that quite quickly, actually.

As I speak to them, they are waiting for the photograph of their baby to arrive.</p> <p>I ask them about the strain on their relationship, and they laugh. 'Strain. Well, we don't know anything else,' says Joanne. 'There are other strains from having children, too.' </p> <p>'All I can say,' adds Lester, 'is that we are still together and happy. That's a testament.' There are all sorts of ways, says Joanne, for life to be unfair. 'We are lucky in other ways. Life's been good to us.

In her mid-twenties, she had a hysterectomy. 'I always wanted to have this big family,' she says.

'From the age of 15, I had 12 operations and lots of hormonal treatment to suppress my periods. I was on big painkillers, and every month I had to be catheterised. The side effects of the hormones were unpleasant - hot flushes, mood swings, weight gain.

Gynaecologists are usually chauvinists who ignore the fact you're an anxious young woman. All these men prod you, examine you, shove things up you. I hated being a woman, hated my periods, hated my body. My body was like my enemy.' She had a few sexual relationships - but 'I numbed myself. I liked being cuddled, but the rest'</p> <p>When she was 23, May was told that her only option was surgical. 'I thought: \"OK, I can learn to live with the pain, then.\" I had learnt how to administer morphine myself, and catheterise myself. Now, though, I started taking more and more to kick out the pain, and one day I ended up hallucinating and my flatmate carted me off to hospital.'

I'd become a person I didn't want to be. </p> <p>I felt androgynous. I'd lost all sense of my femininity. So I agreed to the operation. Afterwards I sobbed and sobbed.

I couldn't open up sexually.'</p> <p>Gradually, May has come to terms with her situation. She has channelled a lot of energy into her career. She has close friends and a 'man who makes me feel I'm the most beautiful woman in the entire world'. She tells people how a chunk of her life was lost to her, how she has had to re-think her whole identity, because she so wanted a family. And she still feels guilty, though she knows that guilt is a strange and unhelpful emotion. </p> <p>'But I think it's time to forgive myself. Don't you?'</p> <p><strong>Beating the baby blues: how to treat infertility</strong></p> <p><strong>In Vitro Fertilisation and egg transfer</strong><br> Originally used for women with tubal damage, IVF is increasingly prescribed for patients experiencing infertility with no known origin. Drugs are used to stimulate egg production. The eggs are harvested and mixed with sperm to create embryos. Up to three embryos are deposited in the uterus, after which hormones are often given to support any possible pregnancy. Many clinics store and freeze unused embryos for later use but the implantation rate is lower. IVF offers a success rate of 15 per cent for one treatment cycle and up to 77 per cent for couples who undergo three to five cycles.</p> <p><strong>Artificial Insemination</strong><br> This method aims to fertilise the egg by placing a sample of sperm either in the cervix (intracervical) or the uterus (intrauterine) and waiting for fertilisation to take place naturally. Intracervical insemination can be helpful when the male partner suffers from anatomical problems or abnormalities that prevent him from ejaculating normally. Otherwise, it has no advantage over intercourse. Intrauterine insemination involves placing the sperm sample directly into the uterus and is used in cases of poor cervical mucus and unexplained infertility. Drug therapy is used to increase production of eggs before treatment and the semen is analysed to make sure it is suitable. The success rate is about 6 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Donor insemination</strong><br> When the male partner's sperm count is very low, artificial insemination using a donor's sperm may be considered. Clinics match the donor profile to the male partner, so that characteristics such as height, hair colour and ethnic origin are very similar. Each sample is screened for sexually transmitted diseases and genetic defects and frozen for six months to allow time to repeat an HIV test. The sample is then placed in either the cervix or uterus, possibly after a course of hormones to stimulate egg production. </p> <p><strong>Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT)</strong><br> A method that is particularly successful with couples suffering from infertility of unknown origin, GIFT may be used only if the female has at least one fully open fallopian tube. Following a course of drug treatment to increase egg production, eggs are harvested and the best two or three are selected. These are placed in a catheter with the partner's sperm and inserted into the outer ends of one or both fallopian tube. Hormone therapy is usually given to support the pregnancy. Success rates are slightly higher than IVF, but most clinics have stopped practising GIFT because it causes the woman extra discomfort. </p> <p><strong>Tubal surgery</strong><br> When blocked fallopian tubes prevent the passage of the egg to the uterus, for example as a result of endometriosis, surgery may be carried out to clear the blockage.</p> <p><strong>Alternative treatments</strong><br> A growing number of couples are trying alternative treatments. Chinese herbalism has been credited anecdotally with increases in male sperm levels, while cranial osteopaths work on a woman's skull and pelvis, looking for problems with the natural rhythm of the spinal fluid so as to correct the energy flow. Homeopathy remedies, used for male or female fertility, are based on an assessment of the patient's emotional history. Some are thought to increase egg production. Hypnotherapy treats infertility by working on the belief that it relaxes people and gives the subconscious a message that pregnancy is possible. Acupuncture operates on the principle that infertility may be caused by blocked energy pathways or meridians. Needles are inserted to clear the obstructions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Helene and Brian Torr Helene Torr speaks to me with the exuberant noise of children in the background. This turns what she has to say into a story: something in the past, an unhappiness she can look back on happily. She was 31 when she started trying to have children - just after she got married six years ago. 'I always wanted children,' she says. 'My husband Brian is older than I am and he already had children. We knew we wanted to try for our own family immediately.' You initially think, she says, that it will be fine. 'You're told you should try for at least a year before worrying. I'm glad now that we didn't know the road ahead, the battle.' Nothing happened. 'It is on your mind all the time. You see pregnant women everywhere. It can turn into an obsession. I remember once having to leave work when someone brought their new baby in. I couldn't do what other women do so easily. I wasn't a real woman - I had failed. The monthly cycle is a torment: life becomes a matter of periods. Everything has a new timescale to it. I started doing the pregnancy tests even before my period was due. I'd always be thinking, \"This might be the month.\" I used to plan how I would tell my husband that I was pregnant. What I'd say, how he'd look; the joy of it. 'Trying to conceive is very private. I think I can only talk about it now that it's happened. At the time, it's hard. I didn't want to discuss it - I just wanted to announce the good news, like everybody else: I'm having a baby! People don't really understand, unless they've been through it themselves. They think that if you have a good job, a nice life, then you will be all right. But to think you'll not have children when it's all you really want - and everywhere you look you see families and you don't feel part of it at all I knew friends were talking among themselves, wondering why we didn't have children. It was the logical progression, after all. But they didn't ask, because somehow you're not meant to, and I didn't say anything.' They never talked together about what they would do if Helene never became pregnant: 'We couldn't bear to. It was unthinkable.' Eventually, the cause of their infertility was diagnosed - Brian had 'poor sperm shape and mobility'. It hit him hard. 'He had two children already; he'd succeeded and now he'd deteriorated. I think he felt he shouldn't be married to me - he should let me be free and go to someone who would give me the child I desperately wanted. He felt he was a burden. And to be completely honest, it did cross my mind that what he said was true. I could go and have a one-night stand and get pregnant and pretend it was his. I thought about things like that. But you know, I didn't just want a baby -I wanted our baby.' Once the diagnosis came it was easier, because then Helene and Brian felt that they could move forward: 'It wasn't just a life of hoping and wishing, and feeling alone with your problem.' However, they were not eligible for fertility treatment on the NHS. 'In Nottingham, there are six criteria, and we didn't meet all of them. But Nottingham is better than some places, where no one can have treatment on the NHS. It's as if your postcode determines whether you get a family or not. We had to raise the money. It's about \u00a33,000 a go. Borrowing money is always easier than paying it back. 'I injected drugs for five weeks and had my eggs removed; he gave a sperm sample. They put the eggs and the sperm in a dish. The embryo is transferred two days later. You wait, pray, for two weeks, then you find out if you're pregnant or not.' She was. And then she wasn't, because a few weeks after the positive pregnancy test, she had a miscarriage. 'I'd been so excited, so happy, and I'd told everyone. I couldn't stop myself. I felt open to all sorts of pain after the miscarriage. It had worked and then it had been taken away. It seemed so cruel.' But there was also a sense of renewed hope. 'We'd done it once, so we could do it again. And now, family and friends realised what was going on - because we'd told them about it at last, I suppose - and everyone rallied round and gave us support, without asking too many questions. Some people wait after a miscarriage; they need to recover emotionally before trying again. But I had to try as soon as possible - as soon as we'd raised the money for it. The only way I could deal with it was to do something, have some kind of control. So we borrowed money, and this time it worked. I was pregnant with twins. I lost one of the twins, but there was still one left. I was always at my GP with worries, niggles, fears. I suppose I was deeply aware that pregnancies don't go smoothly, that you can't take anything for granted. 'And when he was born - oh, I'd wanted him for so long, I'd dreamt of this, prayed for it, struggled so hard for it. And I think it took a long time to sink in that it had really happened. Now Adam's three, and we have twins of 10 months - by IVF again, but this time I wasn't so desperate. Some people accused us of being selfish. Well, it's hard for people to understand. 'For years I was prodded, pushed around. I lost all dignity. I conceived in a theatre full of people looking at me, staring at me. I was turned into an object, a medical failure. But I kept within myself the sense that there was something very special in the end - a great bond between me and my baby. Because of everything, I know and can never forget how very much he was wanted, how precious he is.' Alex and Will Thorpe Alex and Will talk with their three-week-old daughter on their lap. She has just been fed; she is drunk and bleary with milk. Every so often she whimpers and stretches her fists in the air. They look down at her as they speak - this is her story, too. She still feels like a miracle to them. 'It is all about timescales,' says Alex. 'At what point do you say you're infertile? At what point does it become a problem? It took three years, I suppose - that isn't very long. But that is 39 cycles, and a terrible long time.' Now in their mid-thirties, Alex and Will had talked about having children when they first met, though they waited until they felt financially secure before they started trying. 'We were broody,' says Will. 'But then, when we were really trying in a focused way, we forgot what broodiness was, because being broody is a sweet idea, really, happy and positive. But not succeeding is a dark place. The baby isn't there. It's like mourning - grieving for a child you don't have.' 'And you can't let yourself be broody and believe,' adds Alex. 'You have to control your emotions. It's a mind game. If you tell yourself it won't happen, then maybe it will. You lose the joyful sense of possibility.' After nine months, and an abnormally painful period, Alex went to her GP, who referred her. There were the usual investigations and blood tests, and four months later the first appointment - but never any clear sense of what was wrong: a slightly odd hormone level, maybe polycystic ovaries, but each time the doctors said something different. 'And I started to feel,' says Alex, 'not guilty, exactly. But certainly low in self-esteem.' 'And there is something about fertility that's like a virtue,' says Will. 'People talk about not being \"meant\" to have children. It is like a failure, somehow. We never talked about the realistic possibility that we would never have a child. And in dark, low moments we did ask: \"Why us? Does it mean anything about us?\" Sometimes you can't help saying that it's not fair. People have children they don't want. You see them screaming disgusting things at their children. They dislike them, abuse them. And here we are, doing everything we can - but no one ever said life would be fair.' 'And we were out of synch,' says Alex. 'I was sad a lot of the time, and I felt low and bad because I no longer fitted in. Friends were just waiting for us to have a baby. Before, we were all the same. Now they were doing it and we were left behind, out of the loop. And not just in practical terms. The way you look at life is profoundly affected by having children. 'It's hard to talk about. Most people don't get it - unless they're in the same situation. Then you don't even need to say anything, there's just empathy. People tried to protect us - not talking about their babies when we were there, things like that. I felt sad about that, and it added to the sense of being left out. So many of the emotions you feel are very childish, actually - like being left out, like wanting the things that other people have. Pretty basic stuff.' 'It's part of you that hasn't happened,' adds Will. 'A bit of you hasn't been born, either.' There was a 'demoralising gap' when treatment happened very slowly, and the sludge of waiting lists and bureaucracy thwarted them. Alex had two bouts of hormone treatment which made her feel 'bizarre - hot flushes, shifting emotions, manic stretches'. Sex became 'totally unspontaneous, sometimes a real drag', says Will. The periods kept on coming. They were headed for IUI (Inter-Uterine Insemination), but the doctors were 'very good' about letting them do it in their own time. Alex wasn't ready. She started having acupuncture and herbal medicine. 'The acupuncturist hoped that within a year, even if nothing happened with conceiving, I would at least feel better. She treated me as a whole person, not just a womb that wasn't working. Everything had become so mechanistic and functional. Sex was functional. Sperm was functional. You're an object. She saw that I was demoralised and at a low ebb. She made me feel so much better about myself.' Nevertheless, they agreed to go ahead with the IUI. They had a holiday planned, and the treatment would begin after that. They would arrange the appointment straight after Alex's period. Their holiday was wonderful. They returned and waited for Alex's period. It didn't come. 'We had to do two tests,' says Alex. 'The first was inconclusive. There was nothing at all in the window.' 'A shadow,' says Will. 'A shadow of a shadow.' They were supposed to wait three days before the next test. 'I kept wanting to do it sooner,' says Alex. 'But Will just said, \"Wait, wait, wait.\"' 'I was asleep when she did it,' says Will. 'She woke me up by pushing this pee-stained stick in my face and shouting.' 'I couldn't stop laughing.' 'Laughing and poking this stick in my face.' 'The way it happened after the holiday, just before the IUI, it was unreal, almost mystical.' Will worried his way through the pregnancy. Alex didn't. 'I knew it would be all right,' she says. When their daughter was born, they cried for days, for sheer joy. Joanne and Lester Evans Although they have been trying for six years, the Evans do not have children. Now in their late thirties, they got married when they were ready to start trying ('Though looking back,' says Joanne, 'I wouldn't have minded having them before we married'). For several months, they remained reasonably phlegmatic about not succeeding; they knew that a year of waiting was not unusual. They were focused but not tyrannised: Joanne was taking folic acid, drinking little alcohol. Sex was quite planned - 'but nothing,' says Lester, 'in comparison with later, when we were doing it by the clock.' 'Then, after a year or so, I thought I'd had an early miscarriage,' says Joanne. 'I went to my GP, who was extremely unsympathetic. She told me lots of couples had to be patient; I should go away and lose some weight. I hadn't thought I was overweight. But we did try and be patient. We concentrated on our jobs, doing the house up. We never made a secret that we were having problems with conceiving - that was our way of dealing with it. Everyone around us seemed to be having babies. Pregnant women were a problem for me, generally. I'd give them a wide berth. Maybe I can have children in other ways, and I can touch babies and hold them and love them. But I can never be pregnant. You have to be self-protective; you shouldn't put yourself willingly into the firing line.' 'You can't join in. You haven't got the ticket,' says Lester. 'You don't have the same diaries, the same schedules.' 'We went on lots of exotic holidays,' says Joanne. 'Our friends were poorer than us, messy and tired. But I'd have given anything to be in their position. Anything. People were self-conscious about it, which I understand - how should you behave? There isn't a right way. One couple even had their baby before we even knew they were expecting. People don't want to churn it all up for you.' 'My brother's just had his first baby,' adds Lester. 'And he was very apprehensive about telling us. But our pain shouldn't lessen their joy, and their joy just accentuates the fact that you don't have what they have. We don't resent other people's happiness. I know that for some people it becomes an emotional black hole.' Lester and Joanne had the tests done, and as with so many couples, they were inconclusive - which perhaps helped them, they think, because there was no sense of blame about it. It was no one's fault or failure, and they have never found out what, exactly, is wrong. They tried IVF. Five times. At \u00a33,000 a time. 'With IVF came a gradual decay of hope,' says Lester. 'We kept on with it, but each time the peak of expectation was higher and the trough of darkness was lower. We were in an increasingly unhappy place. We weren't in control of our destinies.

Because it's a high-stake game and the odds are that you will lose and continue to lose, and physically and emotionally it is very draining.' They had agreed that they would try three times. Because the third time was a botched attempt, with low-grade embryos, they went for a fourth. Then, because Joanne entered an egg-donor scheme, they tried a fifth. It wasn't the money that made them stop; Lester is well-paid. 'But the gambling analogy is a really good one,' says Lester. 'You can keep going back to the table. We were getting older; the odds were getting longer all the time.' 'And I was on a roller coaster of emotions,' says Joanne. 'High and low. Every time I had treatment, I'd be really happy. This one could be our baby. We'd look at the embryos down a microscope. Everyone at the hospital would be very nice to us, and we had things we could do.

And after everything we'd been through, we came to terms with that quite quickly, actually. People say to us: \"Oh, it might still happen,\" and of course it might. But we're not banking on it. We're looking ahead, instead, and going down another route.' Eighteen months ago, with the failure of their fifth IVF attempt, they started the labyrinthine process of adopting a Chinese baby. They have 'paid for the pleasure' of being approved by the Department of Health. Their papers are in China now. They have a room waiting (not kitted out - 'that would be tempting fate'). As I speak to them, they are waiting for the photograph of their baby to arrive. I ask them about the strain on their relationship, and they laugh. 'Strain. Well, we don't know anything else,' says Joanne. 'There are other strains from having children, too.' 'All I can say,' adds Lester, 'is that we are still together and happy. That's a testament.' There are all sorts of ways, says Joanne, for life to be unfair. 'We are lucky in other ways. Life's been good to us. And we've got through this and we are so ready for children, I can't tell you how ready.' May Hickman May has only just started telling people she is unable to have children. In her mid-twenties, she had a hysterectomy. 'I always wanted to have this big family,' she says. 'But then, I also had an aunt who was married but didn't have children, and she was wonderful to us, so I knew there were different ways of being connected with children. And that helps now.' She grimaces. 'A bit.' From adolescence, May had a severe form of endometriosis, and every month her intestines would obstruct.

I liked being cuddled, but the rest' When she was 23, May was told that her only option was surgical. 'I thought: \"OK, I can learn to live with the pain, then.\" I had learnt how to administer morphine myself, and catheterise myself. Now, though, I started taking more and more to kick out the pain, and one day I ended up hallucinating and my flatmate carted me off to hospital.' When she came round, her father was at the foot of her bed, weeping. Her eyes fill with tears at the memory. 'I knew I couldn't do this any more. I'd become a person I didn't want to be. I felt androgynous. I'd lost all sense of my femininity. So I agreed to the operation. Afterwards I sobbed and sobbed. I was in a ward with newborn babies everywhere. I was 25 and I could never have babies. For a long time after, I felt empty - well, I was empty, wasn't I? I dressed in baggy clothes. I couldn't open up sexually.' Gradually, May has come to terms with her situation. She has channelled a lot of energy into her career. She has close friends and a 'man who makes me feel I'm the most beautiful woman in the entire world'. She tells people how a chunk of her life was lost to her, how she has had to re-think her whole identity, because she so wanted a family. And she still feels guilty, though she knows that guilt is a strange and unhelpful emotion. 'But I think it's time to forgive myself. Don't you?'

Tubal surgery When blocked fallopian tubes prevent the passage of the egg to the uterus, for example as a result of endometriosis, surgery may be carried out to clear the blockage. Alternative treatments A growing number of couples are trying alternative treatments. Chinese herbalism has been credited anecdotally with increases in male sperm levels, while cranial osteopaths work on a woman's skull and pelvis, looking for problems with the natural rhythm of the spinal fluid so as to correct the energy flow. Homeopathy remedies, used for male or female fertility, are based on an assessment of the patient's emotional history. Some are thought to increase egg production. Hypnotherapy treats infertility by working on the belief that it relaxes people and gives the subconscious a message that pregnancy is possible. Acupuncture operates on the principle that infertility may be caused by blocked energy pathways or meridians. Needles are inserted to clear the obstructions.",

      "bodyText": "The Scottish stepfather of a six-year-old schoolgirl seized at gunpoint from her home in the Philippines has angrily dismissed reports that the child's mother may have masterminded the kidnapping in an extortion attempt. Douglas Grant, 50, speaking from his home in Inverness, said that comments made by a Philippine army officer that his wife, Mina Rasul, was behind the snatch at their home on the remote island of Basilan were 'an outrage'. The Foreign Office confirmed that it had no evidence to suggest an 'inside' job, but a Philippine army spokesman insisted that 'intelligence reports' pointed to the possibility that the 'kidnap' had been carried out by the mother or a neighbour rather than by some extremist Islamic faction. Earlier reports suggested that Eiman, who was adopted by Grant when she was a baby, was kidnapped from her front room by four gunmen from the Islamic rebel group Abu Sayyaf, or the larger separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Grant told The Observer last night that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had contacted him to say that a statement would be released disputing reports that Rasul was involved. He added that he had received a handwritten letter from the British ambassador in Manila commiserating with him about his ordeal and explaining that 'everything possible' was being done. 'I have a friend over there who was in my home with my family in the Philippines just 12 hours ago,' said Grant. 'He told me, \"Don't worry. I believe your wife. Unless she is a very good actress, she has nothing to do with this\". 'It seems to me that people are just making up stories about my wife. I want as much media attention as possible to go back and say that these stories are a load of garbage.' Grant, a hospitality manager who ran a taxi business in the Philippines and converted to Islam, came back to Scotland last August to care for his elderly parents. He added: 'You cannot believe the stress that this has caused for me and my family. My mother has Alzheimer's, my father is 81 and they have been forced to watch TV - first the story that Eiman has been taken and then they are told that their daughter-in-law is a crook, a thief, a liar and a kidnapper.' A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'Our embassy in Manila has spoken to the police task force who are investigating the case, and the task force say that they have no evidence to suggest that it was an \"inside job\".' He confirmed that the police were 'keeping an open mind', but stressed there was no evidence pointing to the mother's involvement. Although Grant has said that he would like to go back to the Philippines to be with his wife and their 22-month-old daughter Khadija, the region has been declared a no-go area. A duty officer for the 103rd Army Brigade, which is based on the island of Basilan, said yesterday the military were investigating intelligence reports suggesting that either Rasul or her neighbours could have been paid to snatch the girl to extort money from her stepfather. So far no one has claimed responsibility for taking Eiman, who was seized by four unidentified gunmen at about 9pm on Wednesday. Mrs Grant said they took her daughter after she was unable to meet their demand for 100,000 pesos (\u00a31,300). The officer said: 'We are still looking for the girl while checking previous intelligence data. Nothing has been ruled out.' The data include reports that the kidnapping, which seemed extremely random even by Basilan standards - where such actions are quite common - might have been an inside job. Colonel Saulito Aromin, the commander of the 103rd Army Brigade, was quoted by the Philippine Daily Inquirer yesterday as saying that neighbours of the victim said that the girl's mother, who is a Filipina, did not appear to be worried about her daughter's kidnapping. 'She even went on a shopping spree yesterday,' Aromin reportedly said. Grant, 50, who is at home in Inverness, dismissed the claims as 'total garbage' and 'ridiculous'.

      "body": "<p><strong> Sigmar Polke:</strong> <strong> Music of Unclear Origin</strong> Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, 18 March <br><strong> Sigmar Polke</strong> Anthony d'Offay Gallery, 24 February </p> <p> Sigmar Polke, the artful dodger, is having two separate shows in Britain: his first in London for more than 10 years and his very first in Scotland. It feels right that he should be in both places at once - this slippery, shape-shifting teaser, prolific as any chatterbox and fantastically inconsistent. No thought comes into Polke's head, it seems, without passing at equal speed to a sheet of paper. Which is why the 400 works distributed between these shows represent no more than a smattering of his projectile output. </p> <p>In London, Polke comes hot on the heels of Anselm Kiefer at the d'Offay Gallery. It's a hard contrast, between these two grandees of German painting: Kiefer the solemn patriarch, with his hard-won, melancholy jeremiads; and Polke, who buzzes like a restless gadfly beside him. But there was a time when they were equally absorbed by Germany's post-war legacy - in Polke's case, roughly the Sixties and early Seventies, when most of the drawings in this show were made. </p> <p>Doodles in ballpoint and pencil, covering screeds of lined schoolbook paper, these little jabs and skitters are mainly concerned with consumer society. According to one of Polke's titles, 'every German owns 10,000 things' - and here they are, ineptly transcribed from magazines: cakes, slacks, cans, cars, white goods for the happy Hausfrau and those endless strings of German sausages that Polke shoves into German mouths. </p> <p>He liked to deface ads - bulging biceps on a lingerie model, cartoon bodies, cartoon guns and captions. He liked to be infantile, coarse and quick, his drawings mass-produced but never slick as the commerce he parodied. His first 'Capitalist Realism' show was held in a department store, Polke posing in the window as an awkward mannequin. </p> <p>Above all - and this was where the theorists circled greedily - he treated art itself as an emporium of styles. He'd do, or redo, Picabia, layering the images one above the other. He'd do sloppy Abstract Expressionism, minus the resonant grandeur, and American Pop without the zip or clarity. You can still see Rauschenberg and Rosenquist in the huge new paintings, with their collaged styles and colliding images, also on show at the d'Offay Gallery. What you can't see any more - if you ever really could - is Polke the daredevil satirist. </p> <p>It's as if he sought to neutralise rather than send up the past. Picasso reprised in felt pen looks muffled, not mocked. Ab-Ex redone in washy white ink - the artist once signed himself Polek - looks more like spilt milk than Pollock tackled or parried. Why do him if you aren't going to do for him, as it were? </p> <p>One answer may be that Polke just enjoys putting on the style. Certainly, in these big paintings, he sends the ink meandering about the page with a relish that becomes infectious. Here and there, he also uses a wondrous substance called interference paint, which reflects back a mineral iridescence. As you move about the room, the surfaces glint with ever-changing light. </p> <p>Polke's mainstay, in the Sixties as now, was the Benday dot he pilfered from Roy Lichtenstein. Since Polke clearly believes that intellectual property is theft, you could hardly call these dots his signature. But they are the most consistent feature of his painting, effortfully done by hand using the round end of a pencil eraser. Robocop, registered as a mass of newsprint dots, emerges from a haze of interference. A knight in shining dots stands amid the fog of war - but I'm falling into Polke's trap: there is no fog, no metaphor, no subtext at all, only a splash of Ab-Ex paint. </p> <p>You can - and theorists always do - take Polke far too seriously. He was born in former Silesia and I like to think he has an East European sense of humour. Take a title from his Edinburgh show: 'Officials in the former East Germany can be dismissed if they falsely deny Stasi activities.' That little paradox, in which the official is damned either way, would have amused the Good Soldier Schweik. But there's a touch of Glen Baxter in these captions too: '\"There's always a pecking order,\" said Dagmar, straightening the butter knife.' </p> <p>Polke's titles are generally random, a bit of Dada thrown in to amuse. The Scottish show is amusing, though also bemusing - a series of poster-sized paintings from 1996 intended as 'cosmic tasters' of Polke's career, whatever that means. They are spacey in both senses: some clearly the result of tripping on acid colours (Polke has quit the drugs); others apparently representing marvellous interplanetary movements, sweeps of bright interference in the outer darkness. </p> <p>As figurative images, these paintings hold their own, no matter how off-hand or whimsical. There goes Baron M\u00fcnchhausen, flying through a sky of Polke dots; here's Nixon in a few frowning cedillas. Who could resist the Krazy Kat with his fiddle, so frenzied with the bow and gut that he's vibrating into multiple kittens? Or the purple poacher, an eighteenth-century figure sloping by with his gun, beneath a flicker of moonlit lightning? </p> <p>None of it adds up to more than a weird fantasia - and sometimes you find yourself just counting the styles or layers, the way he inks a cartoon crowd behind a ghostly wash or disrupts a Victorian vignette with a jet of day-glo orange. But here and there, all this hyperactivity resolves into a single, imperishable image - as, for example, the group of 1940s travellers with their bursting suitcases, stumbling through a blind-storm of tumultuous paint. Wartime refugees, the dots of which they are composed seem to disintegrate before your very eyes. It's as if some dire transmission failure had occurred in the final bid to beam them up, to rescue them from history.</p>",

      "body": "<p>See the words 'award-winning' attached to the word 'building' in a news report and you just know what's coming next. It's the set-up for yet another tale of architectural disaster. And last week brought two particularly juicy examples of the genre. In Peckham, south-east London, it was discovered that it takes four days to change the light bulbs in Will Alsop's award-winning library. It had to close its doors to the public while engineers built special platforms around the bookshelves to allow them to get at the 300 lights in the high ceilings.</p> <p>It was then reported that Frank Gehry's spectacularly popular Guggenheim museum in Bilbao was suffering from a nasty rash that has turned large areas of its famous exterior from shiny silver to dull brown. One American newspaper claimed that just three years after it opened the Guggenheim has started to resemble the 'rusting hull of an abandoned barge'. And nobody is agreed on how to solve the problem. 'The areas involved are gigantic, curved and very difficult to reach,' said a spokesman for the museum.</p> <p>Actually, the Guggenheim isn't rusting. Its spectacular exterior is made of titanium, and titanium doesn't rust, even in the most challenging environments. According to the manufacturers, what has happened is that the oxide film which coats the titanium has started to thicken and turn an unsightly brown. There is no structural problem; it's just that it doesn't look very good. The trouble started when chemicals were spilled over the surface of the titanium during construction. They reacted with pollutants in the air, fused with the oxide film and rapidly began to spread.</p> <p>According to Gehry, the problem was that the building wasn't cleaned immediately after it was finished. 'It's frustrating. All they had to do was clean it. We begged them to do so. But now it's embedded and the trick is to get it off without changing the character of the metal.'</p> <p>He is worried that the roof will start to look like a patchwork. One plan to avoid this is to apply a chemical cleaning foam to the whole building which would require abseilers equipped with ghostbuster-style back-packs. Gehry calls it 'a tempest in a teapot'.</p> <p>And, of course, he is right. The Guggenheim has not been hit by a structural failure, it's just got a bad case of red-wine stain on the carpet. If this had happened to an industrial shed on the business park on the edge of the city, not the most famous new museum in the world, the news that its skin was turning brown would hardly have attracted worldwide attention.</p> <p>But it is precisely because Gehry's design for the Guggenheim looks so extraordinary, so counter-intuitive to our ideas of structural logic, that there has been such a wave of schadenfreude about its difficulties. Rust, brown-oxide stains or whatever, spreading all over such a landmark serves to confirm prejudices in the most delicious way. Ahah, so it really wasn't possible after all.</p> <p>The bigger they come, the harder they fall. The more praise lavished on a building, the more prizes they pick up, the more irresistible are the tales of leaking roofs, spontaneously self-destructing glass and structural collapse.</p> <p>There are plenty to choose from. Just about all of Britain's better-known contemporary architects have had to deal with the occasional embarrassment. James Stirling's history faculty library at Cambridge experienced so many problems with its greenhouse roof that the university senate narrowly defeated a vote to demolish it, deciding instead to rebuild it.</p> <p>But this was really more an argument about the politics of Stirling's architecture than about practical issues. The militant fogey tendency in the university saw it as an aggressive modernist intrusion and wanted to get rid of it, even if the cost of a replacement would be more than repairing it. Norman Foster's Sainsbury Centre in Norwich had to have every single aluminium cladding panel removed because of a manufacturing defect. They were replaced with an alternative design using flat white panels.</p> <p>There have also been problems with the glass walls at his airport in Hong Kong, to say nothing of the celebrated case of the wobbly bridge, though Arup, the engineers, now say they know how to fix the problem. Nick Grimshaw's Waterloo Eurostar station still hasn't resolved the danger of glass threatening to detach itself from the roof.</p> <p>Richard Rogers had to deal with the difficulties at the Lloyd's building, and in Paris, the Pompidou Centre had to close for a year for a costly makeover of the birdshit-encrusted exoskeleton structure. The problem there was the very success of the building. The Pompidou attracted so many more visitors than it was designed for that it literally began to wear out.</p> <p>When things go wrong, architects' high profile tends to make them the immediate targets for blame. But it's not the architect who physically builds a structure. That is the contractor's job, and if he doesn't do what is specified by the architect, then any defects are his fault, though lawyers get rich trying to prove that this isn't the case. More and more architecture relies on components manufactured in factories and bought off the shelf. And when they don't perform in the way that the manufacturers say they will, it is their responsibility to put it right.</p> <p>But attacking architects as arrogant incompetents is as much to do with cultural prejudices as it is based on objective realities. When buildings leak or rust, it offers people who don't like contemporary architecture the same kind of weapon presented by the charges of plagiarism levelled at the Turner Prize short list last year. It's taken as positive proof that not only are contemporary architects incapable of designing buildings that are anything but a blot on the landscape, but they are conmen who can't even keep the rain out.</p> <p>The weakness with the argument is that embarrassing building failures are not a new phenomenon, and nor are they limited to cutting-edge modern architecture. Think, for example, of the English cathedral builders who, in their constant efforts to out-do each other, were forever building higher and higher spires and seeing them collapse. Chichester, for example, saw its spire blow down in 1850; it had to be rebuilt.</p> <p>Look at Edwin Lutyens, the last great exponent of what might be called traditional English architecture in the twentieth century. So badly did his towers at Castle Drogo leak that the first step in the National Trust's restoration campaign was demolition.</p> <p>Florence's architects were so head in the clouds about practicalities that they started a cathedral that would have the largest dome in Italy without having the faintest idea of how they would be able to finish it. In Venice, the great Sansovino, architect to the republic, was threatened with jail following difficulties with the library he built in St Mark's Square.</p> <p>Building is rarely an exact science. And until a project is actually finished it is hard to predict how materials will behave. But it is perfectly true that there is a predisposition to experiment and innovate in architecture. Architects do enjoy pushing things to the limit, but then, if they are going to make materials do more for less, then they really can't do anything else.</p> <p>Relying on so-called traditional materials is no answer. Look at how many supposedly traditional brick cavity walls have leaked, how many traditional timber floors have developed dry rot. All the same, the Guggenheim's problems haven't done titanium's image much good. Gehry told the New York Times that he wasn't planning to use it for his project for a giant new Guggenheim in Manhattan. 'I don't think we will have the money, so don't worry about it.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, Building Design Partnership, the architects of Glasgow's science centre due to open at Easter, Britain's only titanium-skinned building, has hurried to reassure its clients that there is no danger of their building turning brown too.</p> <p>'We are using a higher grade of titanium,' says partner Colin Allan. 'It isn't going to happen.'</p>",

'It's frustrating. All they had to do was clean it. We begged them to do so. But now it's embedded and the trick is to get it off without changing the character of the metal.' He is worried that the roof will start to look like a patchwork. One plan to avoid this is to apply a chemical cleaning foam to the whole building which would require abseilers equipped with ghostbuster-style back-packs. Gehry calls it 'a tempest in a teapot'. And, of course, he is right. The Guggenheim has not been hit by a structural failure, it's just got a bad case of red-wine stain on the carpet. If this had happened to an industrial shed on the business park on the edge of the city, not the most famous new museum in the world, the news that its skin was turning brown would hardly have attracted worldwide attention. But it is precisely because Gehry's design for the Guggenheim looks so extraordinary, so counter-intuitive to our ideas of structural logic, that there has been such a wave of schadenfreude about its difficulties. Rust, brown-oxide stains or whatever, spreading all over such a landmark serves to confirm prejudices in the most delicious way. Ahah, so it really wasn't possible after all. The bigger they come, the harder they fall. The more praise lavished on a building, the more prizes they pick up, the more irresistible are the tales of leaking roofs, spontaneously self-destructing glass and structural collapse. There are plenty to choose from. Just about all of Britain's better-known contemporary architects have had to deal with the occasional embarrassment. James Stirling's history faculty library at Cambridge experienced so many problems with its greenhouse roof that the university senate narrowly defeated a vote to demolish it, deciding instead to rebuild it. But this was really more an argument about the politics of Stirling's architecture than about practical issues. The militant fogey tendency in the university saw it as an aggressive modernist intrusion and wanted to get rid of it, even if the cost of a replacement would be more than repairing it. Norman Foster's Sainsbury Centre in Norwich had to have every single aluminium cladding panel removed because of a manufacturing defect. They were replaced with an alternative design using flat white panels. There have also been problems with the glass walls at his airport in Hong Kong, to say nothing of the celebrated case of the wobbly bridge, though Arup, the engineers, now say they know how to fix the problem. Nick Grimshaw's Waterloo Eurostar station still hasn't resolved the danger of glass threatening to detach itself from the roof. Richard Rogers had to deal with the difficulties at the Lloyd's building, and in Paris, the Pompidou Centre had to close for a year for a costly makeover of the birdshit-encrusted exoskeleton structure. The problem there was the very success of the building. The Pompidou attracted so many more visitors than it was designed for that it literally began to wear out. When things go wrong, architects' high profile tends to make them the immediate targets for blame. But it's not the architect who physically builds a structure. That is the contractor's job, and if he doesn't do what is specified by the architect, then any defects are his fault, though lawyers get rich trying to prove that this isn't the case. More and more architecture relies on components manufactured in factories and bought off the shelf. And when they don't perform in the way that the manufacturers say they will, it is their responsibility to put it right. But attacking architects as arrogant incompetents is as much to do with cultural prejudices as it is based on objective realities. When buildings leak or rust, it offers people who don't like contemporary architecture the same kind of weapon presented by the charges of plagiarism levelled at the Turner Prize short list last year. It's taken as positive proof that not only are contemporary architects incapable of designing buildings that are anything but a blot on the landscape, but they are conmen who can't even keep the rain out. The weakness with the argument is that embarrassing building failures are not a new phenomenon, and nor are they limited to cutting-edge modern architecture. Think, for example, of the English cathedral builders who, in their constant efforts to out-do each other, were forever building higher and higher spires and seeing them collapse. Chichester, for example, saw its spire blow down in 1850; it had to be rebuilt. Look at Edwin Lutyens, the last great exponent of what might be called traditional English architecture in the twentieth century. So badly did his towers at Castle Drogo leak that the first step in the National Trust's restoration campaign was demolition. Florence's architects were so head in the clouds about practicalities that they started a cathedral that would have the largest dome in Italy without having the faintest idea of how they would be able to finish it. In Venice, the great Sansovino, architect to the republic, was threatened with jail following difficulties with the library he built in St Mark's Square. Building is rarely an exact science. And until a project is actually finished it is hard to predict how materials will behave. But it is perfectly true that there is a predisposition to experiment and innovate in architecture. Architects do enjoy pushing things to the limit, but then, if they are going to make materials do more for less, then they really can't do anything else. Relying on so-called traditional materials is no answer. Look at how many supposedly traditional brick cavity walls have leaked, how many traditional timber floors have developed dry rot. All the same, the Guggenheim's problems haven't done titanium's image much good. Gehry told the New York Times that he wasn't planning to use it for his project for a giant new Guggenheim in Manhattan. 'I don't think we will have the money, so don't worry about it.' Meanwhile, Building Design Partnership, the architects of Glasgow's science centre due to open at Easter, Britain's only titanium-skinned building, has hurried to reassure its clients that there is no danger of their building turning brown too. 'We are using a higher grade of titanium,' says partner Colin Allan. 'It isn't going to happen.'",

Last week, Stephen Pollard, a departing leader writer from the Express, sent a cleverly coded message to the same Richard Desmond. In his final article for the paper, the first letter of each sentence spelled out 'Fuck You Desmond'. Pollard presumably thought he was quite safe, since he had a nice new job at the Times already lined up. The shocking thing is that the Times considered the offence so great that they have refused to take him on. No matter how many times you might think it, telling your boss to fuck off is still something that is better kept in your head. </p> <p>'The context of talk is crucial,' confirms Dr Lia Litosseliti, senior lecturer in linguistics at Nottingham Trent University. 'As we grow up we develop a highly sophisticated sense of what kind of language it is appropriate to use with different groups of people. The frequency of swearing and the swear words we use when we're relaxing with close friends (especially close friends of the same sex) will be quite different from those we use in a mixed-sex meeting at work.' </p> <p>What makes it tricky is that the goal posts continue to skip around. 'Back in the early Eighties the culture was different', remembers Dr David Pryce, a university historian. 'It was all about pushing back boundaries, reclaiming taboos, cleaning up language by using dirty words. Lots of my colleagues said 'fuck' as a way of showing that they weren't imprisoned by inherited culture.' These days, he says, it's different. 'We're in a kind of post-fuck consensus. The word really has no power to shock any more and so, paradoxically, there's no need to use it. These days, if I hear a colleague saying fuck at a meeting or in front of a student it just seems bad-mannered'. </p> <p>But even if you've got work more or less linguistically sorted, dating and mating still represents a huge muddy field of potential embarrassment. 'When a man and woman meet in a social setting, they're making unconscious yet finely judged decisions about what level of sexually explicit language to use with each other,' reports psychologist and body language expert Susan Quilliam. </p> <p>A woman, apparently, will never say 'fuck' first. However, the moment a man has said it, she'll bat it back to him quickly as a way of letting him know that she is far from being offended.' </p> <p>'Fuck' is a particularly handy word in dating situations, says Quilliam, because its literal meaning is never trailing very far behind its metaphoric one. 'A couple who don't know each other very well might, after a couple of drinks, start comparing notes about their respective fucking awful bosses. In an indirect way they may be signalling that they are interested in each other as sexual partners. And, of course, if the attraction isn't mutual, the useful thing is that neither person feels they've lost face. It's easy to withdraw gracefully.' </p> <p>Anecdotal reports about the word's qualities as an aphrodisiac abound. 'I don't use it that much as a swear word, but I'm very fond of its literal use,' says Julia Brown, 37. 'I first decided to sleep with my husband when I heard him say of someone else that what they wanted was a really good fuck.' </p> <p>Confusing, certainly, in an age of post-political correctness.

'I always think it's weird that I grew up in the Seventies with my parents saying \"sodding\" and \"bugger\" quite happily, yet freaking out about \"fuck\",' says Julia Brown. 'Sometimes I think I'd like to ask them whether they think anal intercourse is less rude than the vaginal variety, but I'm just not sure it would go down very well.' </p> <p>And, for those who worry about these things, 'fuck' is also conveniently free of any blasphemous intent.

The trend means women are beginning to claim their own identities. In future, it will be that much easier to trace their life stories. And with less possibility of adopting a new name halfway through life, a new obsession is heading our way. Storyville , BBC2, 11.20; The Dave Gorman Collection , BBC Choice, 23 January",

In the back of the auditorium a tremulous voice piped up. 'Excuse me Professor, but h-how long did you say it would be?' Professor Bignumska calmly replied, 'About a billion years.' A sigh of relief was heard. \"Whew! For a minute there, I thought you said a million years.\"'</p> <p>Douglas Hofstadter, Scientific American, May 1982</p> <p>Mary Poppins was the first film I ever saw. I was six years, four months old - let's measure it precisely. I remember trotting as fast as I could beside my father along Whitehall, past the Treasury and the other palaces of national calculation, to the Haymarket. And I remember being blown away by the experience, the songs of Julie Andrews and the idea that life should be a little more magical than it was.</p> <p>Within weeks I knew most of the lyrics by heart, though I barely understood the words. Maybe, in retrospect, I was also a little influenced by Mary Poppins's ridicule of George Banks and his fascination for the kind of order brought by numbers. 'They must feel the thrill of totting up a balance book,' she sings to poor deluded George about his children: '... A thousand cyphers neatly in a row. When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up, their little cup of joy should overflow.'</p> <p>The irony is lost on him - as it was on me. And though Hollywood is still busily promoting the idea of magic, you would never catch it now making fun of profits or ridiculing the importance of calculation - still less the idea of cyphers neatly in a row. I came away from the cinema determined to make sure I flung my tuppence away on a little old bird woman, rather than marvelling at the strange alchemy of compound interest if I put it in the bank. Yet here I am, 35 years later, with my pension and life insurance, living in a world overwhelmed by numbers and calculation.</p> <p>It's the same for nearly all of us. There are personal calculations to be made each day, about investments, journey times, bank machines and credit cards. There are professional figures at work, in the form of targets, statistics, workforce percentages and profit-fore casts. As consumers, we are counted and aggregated according to every purchase we make. Every time we are exposed to the media, there is a positive flood of statistics controlling and interpreting the world, developing each truth, simplifying each problem.</p> <p>We take our collective pulse 24 hours a day with the use of statistics. We understand life that way, though some how the more figures we use, the more the great truths seem to slip through our fingers. Despite all that numerical control, we feel as ignorant of the answers to the big questions as ever.</p> <p>If you are to be 'calculating', people could mean one of two things about you - both related and equally repellent. It could mean you are constantly weighing up what is best for you in any situation. This is not a compliment. It implies something cold, fish-like and self-interested. But it could also mean you are someone who counts too much, someone who measures things but can't see the reality behind them.</p> <p>There is something equally clinical about that, but in a disinterested rather than self-interested way. And it can send a shiver down the spine when you come across extreme examples. Like the eighteenth-century prodigy Jedediah Buxton in his first trip to the theatre to see a performance of Richard III. Asked whether he'd enjoyed it, all he could say was that there were 5,202 steps during the dances and 12,445 words spoken by the actors. Nothing about what the words said, about the winter of our discontent made glorious summer; nothing about the evil hunchback king.</p> <p>Today, Buxton would probably be described as autistic. It is particularly horrifying to hear that his numbers turned out to be exactly right.</p> <p>The story is funny now as then, but it is also faintly disturbing. Buxton is in some ways a fearsome symbol of the modern age, in which we count everything but see the significance of nothing. There is something inhuman, not so much about his ability to count, but his failure to be moved. We shiver at anybody with no emotions - as if they were amoral, like Dr Strangelove.</p> <p>Even so, we encounter such 'calculating' man-machines almost every day: the academic who refuses to pass judgment on any problem, however urgent, because there hasn't been enough research; the politician who is so obsessed with opinion polls that he can no longer trust his gut instincts; the social scientist who has laboriously proved with the use of statistics something that anybody else with an ounce of common sense knew already - that the death of a parent can scar a child for life, or that alcoholics have an unusually high depression rate. It's 'official', they say. Like the University of Michigan study which revealed that children who don't exercise and eat junk food tend to be fatter. Or the recent research which showed that areas of high unemployment tend to have fewer jobs.</p> <p>Ratcheting up the calculations has often been done for excellent humanitarian reasons, driven by impeccably radical reformers. Maybe they wanted to prove the existence of great inequality or disease, like Edwin Chadwick. Maybe they wanted to find a way of aggregating the national accounts to defeat Hitler, like John Maynard Keynes. Or maybe they wanted to force politicians to worry about people's happiness, like Jeremy Bentham. These are people who - for the best of motives - brought the flood of numbers and calculations into the non-scientific parts of our lives.</p> <p>It still is a way of improving the world. Are your schools not performing as well as they should? Then measure their results. Are you worried about the performance of a council, a company, a hospital? Send in the auditors. You don't trust the professionals? Summarise their decisions in number form. It is the modern way. Numbers - like money - drive out the mysterious power of elites, the clubbable atmosphere of the professions, the patronising attitudes of those thick-set people with glasses and firm handshakes who used to lord it over our lives. Numbers give us back control. But the numbers have proliferated, so that it's sometimes hard to breathe - still less tell the difference between one statistic and another. It is difficult enough to remember your car registration number, PIN, home, work and mobile phone numbers all at the same time. It's almost enough to make you coldly calculating.</p> <p>The problem is if you don't count what's really important, it gets ignored. There are only so many resources, so doctors must compare the quality of life of a 70-year-old with heart-failure against a suicidal teenager with a long history of depression. Planners have to compare the pleasure and disruption brought by a new 18-screen cinema with the contentment of keeping it as a park. Investors have to compare a notoriously polluting oil company with a dodgy record in human rights with a tremendously successful internet company with three employees and no profits.</p> <p>They measure, measure, measure, knowing that what they measure is alive and will not keep still, and suspecting that maybe - however much they count - they will not capture the essence of the question they are asking. Things have to keep static if you're going to count them: that's probably why the first statisticians were known as 'statists'. But real life isn't still.</p> <p>We need answers, but we also know that what is most important to our lives simply can't be pinned down like a still-life. What we can't do is leave things as they are - all of those numbers are making us misunderstand things. And every time a new set of statistics comes out, I can't help feeling some of the richness and mystery of life gets extinguished. Just as individual stories of passion and betrayal get hidden by the marriage statistics, or the whole meaning of the Holocaust gets lost in the number 6,000,000. There is a sort of deadening effect, a distancing from human emotion and reality. Barely discernible, but just enough for it to matter. Our obsession with numbers creates a number of paradoxes.</p> <p><b>Counting paradox 1: You can count people, but you can't count individuals.</b></p> <p>The definition 'Average Man' belongs to the Industrial Revolution and the twentieth-century world of mass-production and is now a deeply unfashionable term. We can see more clearly today how difficult it is to categorise the widely different individuals who make up the human race. But in the hands of a bureaucratic state, people who don't conform to the norm still get hounded and imprisoned. Or social workers visit them and remove their children. And after all that, when you actually get to know Mr Average, you find he has a bizarre taste in underwear and a hidden collection of Abba records. He wasn't average at all.</p> <p><b> Counting paradox 2: If you count the wrong thing, you go backwards </b> .</p> <p>Because it is so hard to measure what is really important, governments and institutions try to pin down something else. They have to. But the consequences of pinning down the wrong thing can be severe.</p> <p>Take school league tables. The idea of forcing schools to compete with each other by measuring the progress of children at three comparable moments of their lives, was intended to raise standards. They probably have done in a narrow way. The trouble was that schools concentrated on the test results to improve their position on the tables. That meant excluding pupils who may drag down the results, concentrating on the D grade pupils - the only ones who could make a difference in exam result league tables - to the detriment of the others. If you choose the wrong measure, you sometimes get the opposite of what you wanted.</p> <p><b> Counting paradox 3: Numbers replace trust, but make measuring even more untrustworthy.</b></p> <p>When farmers and merchants didn't trust each other to provide the right amount of wheat, they could use the standard local barrel stuck to the wall of the town hall, which would measure the agreed local bushel. When we don't trust our corporations, politicians or professionals now, we send in the auditors - and we break down people's jobs into measureable units so that we can see what they are doing and check it. If doctors hide behind their professional masks, then we measure the number of deaths per number of patients, their treatment record and their success rate, and hold them accountable. .</p> <p>So here's the paradox. Numbers are democratic. We use them to peer into the mysterious worlds of professionals, to take back some kind of control. Yet in another sense they are not democratic at all. Politicians like to pretend that numbers take the decisions out of their hands. 'Listen to the scientists,' they say about BSE or genetically modified food. There has been, in other words, a shift of power from one kind of professional to another, in the name of democracy - from teachers and doctors to accountants, auditors and number-crunchers. And as we all trust the companies and institutions less, we trust the auditors less too.</p> <p><b> Counting paradox 4: The more we count, the less we understand.</b></p> <p>Numbers allow experts to 'speak one and the same language, even if they use different mother tongues,' said Karl Popper. This is an international language based on centrally imposed definitions. It's a kind of modern imperialism, with no respect for local understanding. Can we really believe the European Union was getting accurate comparisons in its survey asking 60,000 people if they 'could make ends meet'? As if a German, a Greek and a Briton would all understand the same by that. When Pepsi had its slogan 'Come alive with the Pepsi generation' translated into Chinese, it was understood as 'Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave'. Microscopic differences in definition create big effects.</p> <p><b> Counting paradox 5: The more we count, the less we can compare the figures.</b></p> <p>In 1978 the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, James Anderton, made a challenging speech about crime figures for England and Wales. There had been 77,934 recorded crimes in 1900, he said. In 1976, there were 2,135,713. The country was horrified.</p> <p>Every generation believes crime is getting worse. In the mid-nineteenth century Friedrich Engels calculated that crime had risen more than seven times since the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Seventy years later there was the sudden 90 per cent rise in bag-snatching between the wars, mainly because police statistics stopped reporting such thefts as 'lost property'.</p> <p>The same happened in the 1970s, when police stopped distinguishing between major damage and minor damage (defined as less than \u00a320) and vandalism figures doubled in a year - just before Anderton unveiled his statistics.</p> <p><b> Counting paradox 6: Measurements have a monstrous life of their own.</b></p> <p>Stalin announced his first Soviet five-year plan in 1928, an enormous undertaking planned to increase gross industrial output by 235.9 per cent and labour productivity by 110 per cent. But these figureswere completely spurious. The fake precision was to lend a pseudo-scientific air to the whole enterprise. The actual effect of the plan was to reduce real per capita income by half, and starve millions on what Stalin referred to as the 'agricultural front'. Even so, he declared the first five-year plan a success 12 months early in 1932, and the second one started right away.</p> <p>The figures were widely believed, even in the West. But not only were nearly all of them falsified, they carried with them a terrible authoritarianism to try to force them to be true. Which is why one in eight of the Soviet population was shot or sent to a labour camp. Figures are frightening sometimes.</p> <p><b> Counting paradox 7: When you count things, they get worse.</b></p> <p>In quantum physics, the mere presence of an observer in sub-atomic particle experiments can change the results. In anthropology, researchers have to report on their own cultural reactions as a way of offsetting the same effect. And once you start looking at numbers you keep falling over a strange phenomenon, which is that the official statistics tend to get worse when society is worried about something.</p> <p>Why, for example, did illegitimacy figures shoot up only after the war babies panic in 1915? At the time of the panic, the number of illegitimate births was astonishingly low - and the number of marriages strangely high. Why was the number of homes unfit for human habitation in the UK in 1967 (after the TV film Cathy Come Home ) almost twice the figure for 1956 - despite more than a decade of intensive demolition and rebuilding?</p> <p>The death of Stephen Lawrence led to widespread concern about race attacks in London. But after the public inquiry on the subject in 1998, Metropolitan Police figures of race attacks leapt from 1,149 to 7,790 in one year.</p> <p>It's difficult to know quite why the figures go up. Sometimes the definitions change to reflect greater public concern. Sometimes people just report more instances of it because it is in the forefront of their minds. Sometimes, maybe, what we fear the most comes to pass.</p> <p><b> Counting paradox 8: The more sophisticated you are, the less you can measure.</b></p> <p>It sounds nonsense, but it's true: for politicians who try to measure the elusive source of 'feelgood' in their populations, for business leaders who recognise that the key to success is realising that their assets are intangible qualities which are extremely hard to measure - like knowledge, information or reputation.</p> <p>Microsoft is an extreme example. Its balance sheet lists assets that amount to only about six per cent of what the company is worth. 'In other words,' says the futurist Charles Leadbetter, '94 per cent of the value of this most dynamic and powerful company in the new digital economy is in intangible assets that accountants cannot measure.'</p> <p>We have reached a point where measuring things doesn't work any more. When you're in politics or business and you need to measure the unmeasurable in order to make things happen - and your career and our lives may depend on you being able to do so - then you have crisis. It is a counting crisis, born out of using numbers to distil the sheer complexity of life into something manageable. The closer you get to measuring what's really important, the more it escapes you. Because number-crunching brings a kind of blindness with it. When we measure life, we reduce it.</p> <p><b>Numbers, percentages, facts and stats:how much can you absorb?</b></p> <p><b> 500 </b> Number of years that 'disposable' nappies take to decompose in rubbish tips</p> <p><b> 3.7 </b> Number in millions of Americans who claim to have been abducted by aliens</p> <p><b> 18 </b> Average number of seconds US patients are allowed to speak before being interrupted by their doctors</p> <p><b> 400 </b> Number of millions of dollars spent by Americans every year breaking into broken automatic car locks</p> <p><b> 11 </b> Average number of days spent by Britons in traffic jams every year</p> <p><b>8 </b>Number of months the average American spends going through junk mail in a lifetime</p> <p><b> 80 </b> Percentage of cars on Albanian roads believed to have been stolen elsewhere in Europe (1997)</p> <p><b> 160,000</b> Number of times every year that hackers infiltrate the Pentagon's computer system</p> <p><b> 120</b> Number of times in millions people around the world have sex every day.</p> <p><b> 93 </b> Percentage of teenage girls who say that store-hopping is their favourite activity</p> <p><b> 58</b> Percentage of British males who believe in aliens</p> <p><b> $24.45 </b> Cost of an online marriage on internetmarriage.com</p> <p><b> $8.15</b> Cost of an online divorce</p> <p><b> 135,000</b> Number of guns brought to school each day in the US</p> <p><b> 39 </b> Number of people in the UK visiting accident and emergency departments after accidents involving tea-cosies (1997)</p> <p><b> 28 </b> Percentage of medical columns in Canadian newspapers judged to be giving 'potentially life-threatening' advice</p> <p><b> 221,662 </b> Number of food shops in Britain (1950)</p> <p><b> 36,931 </b> Number of food shops in Britain (1997)</p> <p><b> 10 </b> Average number of seconds gallery visitors spent in front of each painting in 1987</p> <p><b> 3 </b>Average number of seconds gallery visitors spent in front of each painting in 1997</p> <p><b> 40 </b> Per cent by which the death rate dropped during a month-long doctors' strike in Israel in 1973</p> <p><b> 215 </b> Average number of minutes people spend watching TV in the UK every day</p> <p><b> 1</b> Number of million hours a year that UK parents spend driving children to school</p> <p><b> 30 </b> Percentage of people from India who have not heard of the USA</p> <p><b> 45 </b> Average number of hours British people spend on hold on the phone every year</p> <p>Source: The Tyranny of Numbers by David Boyle</p> <p>This is an extract from The Tyranny of Numbers by David Boyle (HarperCollins, \u00a314.99).

When Pepsi had its slogan 'Come alive with the Pepsi generation' translated into Chinese, it was understood as 'Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave'. Microscopic differences in definition create big effects. Counting paradox 5: The more we count, the less we can compare the figures. In 1978 the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, James Anderton, made a challenging speech about crime figures for England and Wales. There had been 77,934 recorded crimes in 1900, he said. In 1976, there were 2,135,713. The country was horrified. Every generation believes crime is getting worse. In the mid-nineteenth century Friedrich Engels calculated that crime had risen more than seven times since the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Seventy years later there was the sudden 90 per cent rise in bag-snatching between the wars, mainly because police statistics stopped reporting such thefts as 'lost property'. The same happened in the 1970s, when police stopped distinguishing between major damage and minor damage (defined as less than \u00a320) and vandalism figures doubled in a year - just before Anderton unveiled his statistics. Counting paradox 6: Measurements have a monstrous life of their own. Stalin announced his first Soviet five-year plan in 1928, an enormous undertaking planned to increase gross industrial output by 235.9 per cent and labour productivity by 110 per cent. But these figureswere completely spurious. The fake precision was to lend a pseudo-scientific air to the whole enterprise. The actual effect of the plan was to reduce real per capita income by half, and starve millions on what Stalin referred to as the 'agricultural front'. Even so, he declared the first five-year plan a success 12 months early in 1932, and the second one started right away. The figures were widely believed, even in the West. But not only were nearly all of them falsified, they carried with them a terrible authoritarianism to try to force them to be true. Which is why one in eight of the Soviet population was shot or sent to a labour camp. Figures are frightening sometimes. Counting paradox 7: When you count things, they get worse. In quantum physics, the mere presence of an observer in sub-atomic particle experiments can change the results. In anthropology, researchers have to report on their own cultural reactions as a way of offsetting the same effect. And once you start looking at numbers you keep falling over a strange phenomenon, which is that the official statistics tend to get worse when society is worried about something. Why, for example, did illegitimacy figures shoot up only after the war babies panic in 1915? At the time of the panic, the number of illegitimate births was astonishingly low - and the number of marriages strangely high. Why was the number of homes unfit for human habitation in the UK in 1967 (after the TV film Cathy Come Home ) almost twice the figure for 1956 - despite more than a decade of intensive demolition and rebuilding? The death of Stephen Lawrence led to widespread concern about race attacks in London. But after the public inquiry on the subject in 1998, Metropolitan Police figures of race attacks leapt from 1,149 to 7,790 in one year. It's difficult to know quite why the figures go up. Sometimes the definitions change to reflect greater public concern. Sometimes people just report more instances of it because it is in the forefront of their minds. Sometimes, maybe, what we fear the most comes to pass. Counting paradox 8: The more sophisticated you are, the less you can measure. It sounds nonsense, but it's true: for politicians who try to measure the elusive source of 'feelgood' in their populations, for business leaders who recognise that the key to success is realising that their assets are intangible qualities which are extremely hard to measure - like knowledge, information or reputation. Microsoft is an extreme example. Its balance sheet lists assets that amount to only about six per cent of what the company is worth. 'In other words,' says the futurist Charles Leadbetter, '94 per cent of the value of this most dynamic and powerful company in the new digital economy is in intangible assets that accountants cannot measure.' We have reached a point where measuring things doesn't work any more. When you're in politics or business and you need to measure the unmeasurable in order to make things happen - and your career and our lives may depend on you being able to do so - then you have crisis. It is a counting crisis, born out of using numbers to distil the sheer complexity of life into something manageable. The closer you get to measuring what's really important, the more it escapes you. Because number-crunching brings a kind of blindness with it. When we measure life, we reduce it. Numbers, percentages, facts and stats:how much can you absorb? 500 Number of years that 'disposable' nappies take to decompose in rubbish tips 3.7 Number in millions of Americans who claim to have been abducted by aliens 18 Average number of seconds US patients are allowed to speak before being interrupted by their doctors 400 Number of millions of dollars spent by Americans every year breaking into broken automatic car locks 11 Average number of days spent by Britons in traffic jams every year 8 Number of months the average American spends going through junk mail in a lifetime 80 Percentage of cars on Albanian roads believed to have been stolen elsewhere in Europe (1997) 160,000 Number of times every year that hackers infiltrate the Pentagon's computer system 120 Number of times in millions people around the world have sex every day. 93 Percentage of teenage girls who say that store-hopping is their favourite activity 58 Percentage of British males who believe in aliens $24.45 Cost of an online marriage on internetmarriage.com $8.15 Cost of an online divorce 135,000 Number of guns brought to school each day in the US 39 Number of people in the UK visiting accident and emergency departments after accidents involving tea-cosies (1997) 28 Percentage of medical columns in Canadian newspapers judged to be giving 'potentially life-threatening' advice 221,662 Number of food shops in Britain (1950) 36,931 Number of food shops in Britain (1997) 10 Average number of seconds gallery visitors spent in front of each painting in 1987 3 Average number of seconds gallery visitors spent in front of each painting in 1997 40 Per cent by which the death rate dropped during a month-long doctors' strike in Israel in 1973 215 Average number of minutes people spend watching TV in the UK every day 1 Number of million hours a year that UK parents spend driving children to school 30 Percentage of people from India who have not heard of the USA 45 Average number of hours British people spend on hold on the phone every year Source: The Tyranny of Numbers by David Boyle This is an extract from The Tyranny of Numbers by David Boyle (HarperCollins, \u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>In the beginning, there was Microsoft, or at least it seems so, for this is the company whose short history is part of the memory of a generation and which has done more than any other since Henry Ford to shape the relationship between man and machine. </p> <p>Depending on your perspective, Microsoft is a post-industrial anti-Christ or the spark that ignited the engine of the American information economy. It says everything about man's ability to innovate and offers every reason to examine the creeping threat of globalism, multinational power and the basis of anti-trust legislation in the twenty-first century. </p> <p>Like AT&amp;T before it - under threat of dismemberment and constantly scrutinised by the courts - Microsoft has seen its stock price drop by 60 per cent in the past 12 months. </p> <p>Its leadership of the industry is under assault from new directions and by new technologies, and it is no longer so able to use its considerable financial and marketing muscle to the disadvantage of rival companies. This giant among software predators will have to be very smart and very fast to survive in the constantly connected world of multiple device types that will be tomorrow's wired generation. </p> <p>From modest beginnings, the company owes its success to the shrewd purchase of the Q-DOS Operating System from the Seattle Computer Company for the tiny sum of $50,000. This was swiftly turned into MS-DOS and licensed to IBM - and history was made. Ironically, Q-DOS was Microsoft's second acquisition. The first was a technology licence for an equally obscure operating system named Unix, acquired from AT&amp;T in 1980. </p> <p>Over 20 years later, the Microsoft team is rather larger than the one that could once fit easily into a small room littered with discarded pizza boxes and Coca-Cola cans. In the past 12 months the company, which boasts retained profits larger than the gross national product of many small nations, has been busier than ever; according to one report from Client Server News (CSN), it has made a total of '41 acknowledged acquisitions, investments and joint ventures'. </p> <p>Most of these investments, totalling around $3 billion, have given Microsoft access to interesting new technologies or guarantees that the recipient of Microsoft largesse will continue to use the Windows platform in preference to any other. </p> <p>The many interesting investments and acquisitions in 2000 included: MongoMusic, DriveOff.Com Digital Anvil, Corio and Corel. However, Microsoft ended the year with the second- largest purchase in its history, offering $1.1bn in stock for accounting software company Great Plains Software. </p> <p>The deal, which is aimed squarely at rival giant Oracle's expanding applications software ambitions, will undoubtedly alter the enterprise software landscape as Microsoft seeks to assemble a line of financial and business software services, designed for web-based delivery through its bCentral portal. </p> <p>Microsoft's decision to expand into the application software business comes at a time when this market appears to be showing promise. Great Plains' closest rival is Sage Software, and the acquisition will allow Microsoft to integrate its forthcoming .Net platform with Great Plains' business management suite, placing it well to offer small business applications through the emerging Applications Service Provider (ASP) route to market. </p> <p>Microsoft's largest acquisition was its $1.5bn purchase of Visio in September 1999 for stock. At the time, Microsoft's shares were trading at $95. Since then, of course, the value of the stock Visio received has fallen quite dramatically, to $655m. Great Plains is taking the same risk, but it is arguably joining Microsoft's large extended family at a low point in the stock value and is betting on an improvement in Microsoft's fortunes. </p> <p>To understand why Microsoft is embarking on a course of retail therapy, one should understand that the company's business currently consists of three core product areas: desktop operating systems, desktop applications, and server software. For the future, Microsoft's real ambitions lie in internet-driven services and applications, what it calls its .Net strategy. December's surprise profit warning confronted the company with the threat of declining personal computer sales and a slowdown in corporate IT expenditure, both coming at a vulnerable period in the company's history. </p> <p>A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter annual survey of IT spending at the thousand largest US companies, revealed that approximately 16 per cent planned to spend less on IT this year, and that 12 per cent had already reduced their spending. A further 14 per cent plan to adjust their spending depending on macro-economic conditions, waiting for the second half of the year to spend the larger part of their budget. </p> <p>As computer hardware prices fall, Microsoft has been accelerating its efforts to squeeze vastly more revenue out of every single PC sold. However, the evidence of the past 12 months suggests that this strategy is no longer working and that the Microsoft train is in danger of coming off the tracks. </p> <p>With its historical revenue model under pressure, Microsoft's new consumer and 'Software as a Service' model, the precursor of a more ambitious next-generation internet applications delivery strategy, is failing to shows signs of growing fast enough to balance its transition from a pure product to a services company. </p> <p>Microsoft's .Net strategy concerns itself with the next phase of the internet - moving away from simple web pages towards the concept of 'web services' or, in layman's terms, making the internet a two-way any time, anywhere, interactive and more integrated environment. </p> <p>In his visionary role as chief software architect, Bill Gates views the internet of today as relatively unsophisticated and unintelligent. In much the same way as Microsoft, through the arrival of its Windows Operating System, added a veneer of user-friendliness and intelligence to the PC, it now plans to build - and indeed own - a new framework of services, one that will sit on top of the internet and invisibly manage the increasingly virtual world that will surround every facet of our lives. </p> <p>The Microsoft Network (MSN) remains an important component of the company's overall strategy. While .Net remains either an inspired strategy or a clever exercise in smoke and mirrors, Microsoft still has ambitious plans for the MSN. </p> <p>Still a rather poor second, in subscriber terms, to America On-line, MSN is growing as a global business-to-business and business-to- consumer exchange, one capable of linking the services of Microsoft's many partners in a compelling collection of 'pay per view' style services. Rather like a Sunday boot sale, Microsoft owns a large playing field and is inviting its partners from across the commercial spectrum to set up shop inside MSN's global shopping mall. </p> <p>The breadth of Microsoft's ambition is so vast that grasping the bigger picture is as much a challenge to governments as it is to financial analysts. The past 18 months have seen extraordinary focus on the company's anti-competitive behaviour and its struggle to maintain its Operating Systems monopoly. </p> <p>But while the audience's attention has been on the court drama, Microsoft has been busy buying the twentyfirst century's technology high ground, consolidating its position on any and perhaps every potentially useful technology and platform that takes its interest - and this includes games, digital music, mobile telephony, publishing, television, cable services, software and much more. </p> <p>Microsoft is attempting to find the perfect wave to ride into the next decade but its greatest worry is the state of its surfboard. The all encompassing .Net strategy is not yet completely seaworthy, and this century's next great technology wave could just as easily swamp the company's ambitions as carry it to the same position of dominance it enjoyed in the last century. </p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:smoores@researchgroup.co.uk\">smoores@researchgroup.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/microsoft/Story/0,2763,420558,00.html\">First extract from Ken Auletta's book</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4112240,00.html\">January 4 2001 Microsoft faces $5bn discrimination claim</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097411,00.html\">November 28 2000 Microsoft says trial infected with error</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4027069,00.html\">June 8 2000 What once was unthinkable is now a court order'</a><br></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/freedomtoinnovate/\"> News of the lawsuit from Microsoft.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www0.mercurycenter.com/business/microsoft/trial/\"> The San Jose Mercury's trial special</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/\"> The US Department of Justice</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/pdf/news/microsoft/ms-conclusions.pdf\"> Judge Jackson's final decision</a></p>",

The Microsoft Network (MSN) remains an important component of the company's overall strategy. While .Net remains either an inspired strategy or a clever exercise in smoke and mirrors, Microsoft still has ambitious plans for the MSN. Still a rather poor second, in subscriber terms, to America On-line, MSN is growing as a global business-to-business and business-to- consumer exchange, one capable of linking the services of Microsoft's many partners in a compelling collection of 'pay per view' style services. Rather like a Sunday boot sale, Microsoft owns a large playing field and is inviting its partners from across the commercial spectrum to set up shop inside MSN's global shopping mall. The breadth of Microsoft's ambition is so vast that grasping the bigger picture is as much a challenge to governments as it is to financial analysts. The past 18 months have seen extraordinary focus on the company's anti-competitive behaviour and its struggle to maintain its Operating Systems monopoly. But while the audience's attention has been on the court drama, Microsoft has been busy buying the twentyfirst century's technology high ground, consolidating its position on any and perhaps every potentially useful technology and platform that takes its interest - and this includes games, digital music, mobile telephony, publishing, television, cable services, software and much more. Microsoft is attempting to find the perfect wave to ride into the next decade but its greatest worry is the state of its surfboard. The all encompassing .Net strategy is not yet completely seaworthy, and this century's next great technology wave could just as easily swamp the company's ambitions as carry it to the same position of dominance it enjoyed in the last century. smoores@researchgroup.co.uk Related stories First extract from Ken Auletta's book January 4 2001 Microsoft faces $5bn discrimination claim November 28 2000 Microsoft says trial infected with error June 8 2000 What once was unthinkable is now a court order' Useful links News of the lawsuit from Microsoft.com The San Jose Mercury's trial special The US Department of Justice Judge Jackson's final decision",

EMI chairman Eric Nicoli must have been longing to return to the good old boring days when he was running United Biscuits. </p> <p>A year on and EMI could be jilted again. Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate that started life printing hymns 170 years ago and now owns or has stakes in companies as diverse as publisher Random House, Pearson Television and online bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble.com, wants to merge its privately owned music division with EMI, creating the world's largest music company. </p> <p>EMI's turnover for the last financial year was nearly \u00a32.4 billion, while BMG notched up nearly \u00a33bn. BMG employs more than 11,000 people; EMI a few hundred fewer. The marriage would create a stable of artists reading like a Who's Who in the music business. BMG brings the likes of Annie Lennox, R Kelly and Barry White to the party. EMI boasts the Beatles, Radiohead and Robbie Williams. EMI is the world's largest music publisher. BMG is the number one distributor of singles in the US. The statistics go on and on. </p> <p>But, because of this potential embarrassment of riches, some fear EMI's chances of getting hitched at the second attempt are remote. Just as euro officials poured cold water on the Warner deal, so they will reject the \u00a310bn merger with BMG, runs the argument. This would be a major setback for EMI, despite its recent protestations that it would be perfectly happy going it alone. </p> <p>'It makes sense for EMI. It can't go anywhere else but a merger. The industry's very cyclical and it's difficult for quoted companies to constantly meet shareholders' expectations. Look at what happened with Virgin. It was a publicly quoted company and then Richard Branson took it private, saying that music and the stock market don't mix,' said Steve Redmond, publisher of Music Week, the UK trade bible. </p> <p>The deal might represent the Great Leap Forward long awaited by EMI's shareholders, but at first glance it seems they are going to be disappointed again. Three months after talks between the two companies started questions are being asked about why it is taking so long for both sides to agree a deal that will placate objectors in the Commission. </p> <p>Insiders, however, say it is still early days. Warner Music and EMI had been talking for nearly four months before news of their romance leaked. The courtship lasted nine months longer. However, Bertelsmann chief executive Rolf Schmidt-Holtz has said he believes a deal can be reached by the end of this month. </p> <p>The negotiations will be protracted. Only the naive believe the eurocrats will allow the two firms to merge with no strings attached, given the red light the Warner deal received. So the task for BMG and EMI is to soothe Commission officials' anti-trust concerns by suggesting a divestment programme to stimulate competition without ruining the logic behind the merger. Much will hinge on what the two firms can do to alleviate concerns in Germany, a market dominated by BMG. </p> <p>There has been talk of EMI selling off the high-profile Virgin label. But a total sell-off seems unthinkable. 'It's hard to see how something so integral to EMI could be easily dispensed with,' one industry source said. </p> <p>Instead, partial divestments on a country-by-country basis look likely. 'They could get their market levels down below key thresholds. They'll be able to identify parts of their catalogues and individual labels which they can divest,' said David Stockley, chief executive officer of DX3, the online music distribution company, and former president of EMI International sector. </p> <p>It is suggested that one of the few remaining major independent labels will snap up any disposals, turning itself into a global player. But only one independent company has the financial firepower to pull off such acquisitions - Zomba, the privately owned label based in New York. It has grown fat building a stable of teenage stars, notably Britney Spears, The Backstreet Boys and N-Sync. </p> <p>Whatever the eventual plan, the chances are the Bertelsmann board won't suffer the seismic shock inflicted on Warner's executives when their merger with EMI crashed. 'They were completely taken aback by the EC's reaction. They didn't have the contacts,' Redmond said. Bertelsmann is understood to have held informal talks with officials to gauge opinion, although sources stress the discussions are at a very early stage. </p> <p>Those familiar with the way the Commission thinks believe EMI may yet get its groove back. 'There's a chance the Commission might consider a different view from the one it took with the Warner deal the second time around. For a company to be rejected twice could seem harsh and the Commission might now be more enthusiastic,' one Commission source said. </p> <p>Politics, too, could play a part, Redmond said. 'This time around it's about two European companies rather than an American company taking over a European one.' </p> <p>Much hinges on the issue of 'collective dominance' - whereby several large firms are seen to be dominating a market. It is a new theory in competition circles and, apparently, one not uniformly accepted in Brussels. 'I don't think the Commission wants to be seen as being dogmatic about collective dominance. It doesn't want people to think that if it spikes one deal it will spike them all,' the Commission source said. </p> <p>If the deal goes ahead music purists will raise concerns about the industry being increasingly the domain of big business. But Redmond is sanguine about the future. 'It will be quite healthy for the music industry. There will be lots of redundancies and talented executives will set up their own labels. It will lead to a blossoming of the independent sector.' An optimistic argument, but one that not even Bertelsmann would have the audacity to raise with the Commission. </p> <p>As Bridget might have said 'Blurry hell. Why life so difficult?'

      "body": "<p> 'You should not do a rebrand just to get your share price up,' says Tom Blackett, deputy chairman of Interbrand. </p> <p>It would indeed be hard for anyone to make a financial case for adopting a snazzy new name. British Steel has hardly set the world singing since it became Corus; and Bright Station is even duller than it was as Dialog or, before that, Maid. Uniq may be shorter than Unigate but its performance since the name change has not exactly been snappy. </p> <p>Indeed, of the two dozen or so recent name changes, The Observer could think of only three - Zeneca, Centrica and Spirent - that could be described as financial successes. </p> <p>Of course, the marketing men have a rational explanation: the rebranding was not done properly. 'The problem is you need a clear idea of what you want to be,' said John Williamson, a partner at Wolff Olins, creator of Orange and Go, then British Airways budget airline. </p> <p>If you do not you will probably end up with a Greco-Roman name (think Invensys, Corus, Elementis - or any of the new names dreamt up over the past decade) that does not mean anything. And, Williamson warns: 'If you have a meaningless name, people will think your business is meaningless.' </p> <p>Small wonder, then, that the Post Office was trying so hard to convince us that Consignia, the new name it unveiled last week, is not just another bastardisation of a perfectly good Latin word. 'Our new name and identity is a daily reminder of what is at the heart of our organisation. At its most basic level, it describes the full scope of what we can do, in a way that \"The Post Office\" cannot,' trumpets the press release. </p> <p>'The root of our new name is what makes our organisation special. To consign means \"to entrust to the care of\", which is exactly what every customer does when they post a letter, organise a delivery or visit a Post Office branch.' </p> <p>The Post Office wants a new name to help it go out and conquer the world. While we Brits readily believe that our Royal Mail is the only Post Office, foreigners who have their own variations - Deutsche Post, the US Post Office and so on - may find it harder to swallow.

      "bodyText": "'You should not do a rebrand just to get your share price up,' says Tom Blackett, deputy chairman of Interbrand. It would indeed be hard for anyone to make a financial case for adopting a snazzy new name. British Steel has hardly set the world singing since it became Corus; and Bright Station is even duller than it was as Dialog or, before that, Maid. Uniq may be shorter than Unigate but its performance since the name change has not exactly been snappy. Indeed, of the two dozen or so recent name changes, The Observer could think of only three - Zeneca, Centrica and Spirent - that could be described as financial successes. Of course, the marketing men have a rational explanation: the rebranding was not done properly. 'The problem is you need a clear idea of what you want to be,' said John Williamson, a partner at Wolff Olins, creator of Orange and Go, then British Airways budget airline. If you do not you will probably end up with a Greco-Roman name (think Invensys, Corus, Elementis - or any of the new names dreamt up over the past decade) that does not mean anything. And, Williamson warns: 'If you have a meaningless name, people will think your business is meaningless.' Small wonder, then, that the Post Office was trying so hard to convince us that Consignia, the new name it unveiled last week, is not just another bastardisation of a perfectly good Latin word. 'Our new name and identity is a daily reminder of what is at the heart of our organisation. At its most basic level, it describes the full scope of what we can do, in a way that \"The Post Office\" cannot,' trumpets the press release. 'The root of our new name is what makes our organisation special. To consign means \"to entrust to the care of\", which is exactly what every customer does when they post a letter, organise a delivery or visit a Post Office branch.' The Post Office wants a new name to help it go out and conquer the world. While we Brits readily believe that our Royal Mail is the only Post Office, foreigners who have their own variations - Deutsche Post, the US Post Office and so on - may find it harder to swallow. When the Post Office converts to a plc in April, this will add impetus to its international ambitions, making a change of moniker essential. This also makes the Post Office the latest in a long line of British institutions to play down their roots.

The trading statements being issued by retailers shows the usual mixture of good and bad, disappointments and unexpectedly good sales. But underlining them all is one hard fact of life on British high streets: making money from shoppers is becoming harder. </p> <p>Look around your high street and the reason will be obvious: there are far too many places to spend your money. The failure of British retailers to make a go of business anywhere else in the world caused a greater space race than anything the Americans and the Russians ever engaged in. The only ones who are guaranteed to make money are those with a truly novel offering and lots of room for expansion. But - as Matalan's precipitate fall from grace on disappointing sales figures shows - even that cannot last forever. </p> <p>Elsewhere, it is all a matter of the hard grind of paring back costs, having sharper elbows than the competition, giving the customers what they want - and making sure the City does not expect too much. Thus Next's 6 per cent increase in sales, excluding the impact of new openings, would thrill the likes of M&amp;S or Arcadia but it failed to meet Next's high standards. </p> <p>Likewise, the 5 per cent decline in home shopping sales at Great Universal Stores' home shopping business was exactly in line with its past performance. The City, however, had hoped for better - and was concerned that its Experian information services business in the US was not recovering more rapidly. This destroyed the recent recovery in its share price. </p> <p>Selfridges managed to win accolades despite using the railways as an excuse for a slightly disappointing 1 per cent increase in like-for-like sales at its flagship London store. What got the City excited was the performance in Manchester, where sales rose 22 per cent over Christmas. If it can achieve such success, what potential there is for expansion around the rest of the country. </p> <p>But the biggest fall from grace came from Matalan, whose spectacularly successful value retailing formula has made it the stock market darling. Most other retailers would die for the 13.4 per cent rise in sales, excluding new openings, in the last 19 weeks. But that marked a sharp slowdown from the 22.1 per cent growth enjoyed last year - and a rating of 50 times this year's expected earnings makes no allowance for disappointments like that. </p> <p>Matalan remains the only real growth stock in British retailing. Despite its rapid expansion, it still has only a tiny 2.2 per cent of fashion retailing and it still has an aggressive opening programme. But the collapse in its shares - down 34 per cent on the day - does show that buying fashionable shares is far riskier than buying fashionable clothes. And once these stars come down to earth, it can be hard to get them rising again. </p> <p>Dixons can testify to that. Its shares have spent much of the last 18 months alternately soaring or sinking depending on the City's view of its holding in internet service provider Freeserve. Last month's sale of its stake to Wannadoo, the French equivalent - due to be completed next month - meant that it could once again focus on the trading revealed in the interim statement last week. It was not as bad as many had feared. Like-for-like sales rose by 4 per cent, although that was fuelled by Dixons, PC World and the international business. Currys continued to struggle, reporting a 2 per cent drop in sales. The group says refurbishments, adverts that hammer home the price message and greater promotions have got it back on track and like-for-like sales did grow over Christmas. </p> <p>There was also good news on margins. Dixons had warned that its gross margin - the difference between what it pays for a PC and what it charges us - would shrink, so the 1.3 per cent drop on last year was no surprise. It had also promised that cost-cutting - including things like managing its supply chain, reducing the number of faulty machines in the stores - would be enough to keep operating margins, ie what is left after paying staff and store costs, level. It lived up to that promise. </p> <p>The challenge now is to keep that momentum. Finance director Ian Livingston points out that Dixons has lived with falling prices for its entire 40-year history. That is not necessarily bad - falling prices mean that we are more likely to upgrade to the latest model of digital camera or wap phone. But it also means that management must be constantly on its toes, something that Dixons seems to achieve. </p> <p>So too does Next. Of course, the fact that more stock had to go into the January sale is disappointing but at least Next manages to hold off on its sales until after Christmas. It is also able to contain them to a few hectic days - stores were opening, to queues, as early as 6am on 27 December - before getting its spring ranges on to the shelves. Next estimates the cost will be no more than \u00a34 million, low enough to mean the shares remain a core holding. </p> <p>Two interesting statements have yet to appear. First up will be Boots, due on Tuesday. It has already warned that sales in its chemist chain will be hit by the decision to withdraw from 'leisure' ranges, such as gifts, which are strong at Christmas. Analysts are forecasting a drop of anything from 1 to 2.5 per cent in sales. Anything at the lower end of that forecast would be seen as good news. </p> <p>The statement we are all waiting for - from Marks &amp; Spencer - is unlikely to appear until 23 January, although there have been so many rumours about trading that M&amp;S would be forgiven for wanting to get the news out earlier. </p> <p>Certainly, reports of its Christmas trading have been awful and the stores do seem to contain a lot of unattractive stock. Most worrying, however, is that no matter how awful the rumours about M&amp;S's trading, the reality always seems to turn out even worse.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Forget Silicon Valley. There is one sector of British industry that boasts hi-tech clusters, garage start-ups, and energetic entrepreneurs with healthy tans. Its products feature in the opening scenes of James Bond films, and with 95 per cent of production exported, it may just represent the model for Britain's manufacturing industry of the future. </p> <p>In the production of luxury powerboats, the UK is a world-beater. The London International Boat Show, which finishes today, offered a peek at giant displays of motorboats produced by the likes of Sunseeker, Princess, Sealine and Fairline. Of course, only a fraction of the estimated 170,000 visitors to the Earls Court show will ever have a chance to purchase the sleek fibreglass cruisers that go by names such as Predator, Phantom and Targa. </p> <p>Though all the big four companies claim that 'anyone can buy a boat', the image of their customers as playboys, dotcom millionaires, and shady businessmen from Essex is difficult to escape. Immediately in front of Sunseeker's astonishing spaceship-like stand, featuring \u00a313 million worth of floating gin palaces, there's a 'champagne piazza' where you may discuss the design of your boat's custom-built interior. Images, Sunseeker's 'essential guide to the ultimate in lifestyle', carries features on Porsche cars, Bovet watches, Purdey guns, and how caviar should not be eaten with a metal spoon unless it is made of gold. This is no mass-market industry. </p> <p>But the immense success of the big four is down to far more than luxury branding and clever marketing. 'The British marine industry is one of the few remaining UK industries which can claim to lead the world,' says Howard Pridding of the British Marine Industries Federation, the builders' trade body. </p> <p>'Despite difficult trading conditions in Europe, 2000 was a successful year, particularly for the larger boatbuilders, many of which have generated record sales.' </p> <p>Derek Carter is managing director of Fairline, a powerboat builder based for 30 years in the Peterborough area, employing 920 people and with a turnover of \u00a380m. </p> <p>'The big four powerboaters, through a significant commitment to R&amp;D, have continued to compete against each other, driving on the development of a quality product,' he says. </p> <p>'Manufacturers concentrate on the boats' sea-keeping abilities and external flair, coupled with luxurious interiors - this sets British powerboaters apart from the competition.' </p> <p>The industry has four centres: the South Coast, particularly around Poole, the South-west, the Norfolk Broads and the Midlands. </p> <p>The BMIF, which also organises the Boat Show, issued the first-ever set of industry statistics last week. Its turnover totalled just under \u00a31.5 billion last year, an 11 per cent jump on 1999. More than 8,000 people are directly employed in boatbuilding, with a further 16,000 in related industries. </p> <p>Marine industries have enjoyed sustained growth for five years, except for a slight slowdown in 1998 when its exports were hit by the strength of the pound against European currencies. That phenomenon has not disap peared, but the industry has managed the situation. </p> <p>'Because of the exchange rate, the whole industry has turned to the USA,' says Frank Fish, managing director of Sealine, whose T47 was motorboat of the year in the show's British Nautical Awards. </p> <p>Their efforts paid off, and the US now accounts for a third of sales for the British boatbuilding industry. </p> <p>Sealine was founded by Fish in a garage next to a house in the non-seafaring town of Kidderminister, in the Midlands. Around 350 boats are now built each year, but, says Fish, the sales total is not a strong indicator of performance. The powerboat makers have climbed the value chain, selling higher- margin luxury goods to a niche market. The emphasis is on engine performance and exterior styling, but interior design is vital as a symbol of luxury. </p> <p>'When we first started a 25-footer was a big boat, and the toilet was a bucket and chuck-it,' says Fish. </p> <p>No longer. Demand for larger boats is driven by an ever stronger desire for such luxuries as en-suite bathrooms and more bedrooms. Inside, the interiors are lined with the type of leather used in Aston Martin cars, and equipped with the latest DVD surround-sound technology. </p> <p>Personalisation of the interior is the apotheosis of this pursuit of maritime motorboat luxury. One customer wanted an office built in his Sunseeker boat, another a recording studio. </p> <p>A Sunseeker was featured speeding away from MI6's London HQ on the Thames in the spectacular opening scenes to The World is Not Enough, the latest Bond film. </p> <p>Robert Braithwaite founded the Poole-based company in 1968, selling handbuilt 17-foot yachts. A year later his brother, John, joined as chief designer, and by 1971 turnover was \u00a3100,000 and the company employed 10 people. By July last year turnover was \u00a3104m, there were 1,050 employees. Their biggest boat is a 105ft super yacht, too big to display at the London show. Anyone dropping by the Boat Show hoping to pick up a Sunseeker is likely to be disappointed. Order books are full for the next two years. </p> <p>'We've driven the market, creating a vision and a dream, and wealth has grown too,' says Braithwaite, now chairman and managing director of Sunseeker. </p> <p>It has recently bought two new shipyards, and is investing \u00a325m over the next two years in research and development. </p> <p>'Being a private company we do what we do because we love it. We have grown by putting back into the company what we earn. We can sometimes take commercial risks that public companies cannot.' </p> <p>Flotation, it seems, is not an option. 'It's never occurred to us to take it public,' says Derek Carter, of Fairline. 'This is the way almost all the companies have evolved - the founding entrepreneurs are still in place.' </p> <p>But the ever-stronger demands for such luxury are foundering in the face of technical skills shortages. </p> <p>'Marine business is a people business. We're very heavily reliant on specific people skills - people who can plane a bit of wood, upholster, or wire a boat up with the right electronics,' says Fish. 'We're having to invest heavily in training people, but I'm a great believer in business contributing as well as government. Both need to come to the party to create jobs.' </p> <p>In many ways, boatbuilding should be a manufacturing industry of choice for the Government. It has successfully dealt with the strong pound through diversification and has climbed the value chain.

      "bodyText": "Forget Silicon Valley. There is one sector of British industry that boasts hi-tech clusters, garage start-ups, and energetic entrepreneurs with healthy tans. Its products feature in the opening scenes of James Bond films, and with 95 per cent of production exported, it may just represent the model for Britain's manufacturing industry of the future. In the production of luxury powerboats, the UK is a world-beater. The London International Boat Show, which finishes today, offered a peek at giant displays of motorboats produced by the likes of Sunseeker, Princess, Sealine and Fairline. Of course, only a fraction of the estimated 170,000 visitors to the Earls Court show will ever have a chance to purchase the sleek fibreglass cruisers that go by names such as Predator, Phantom and Targa. Though all the big four companies claim that 'anyone can buy a boat', the image of their customers as playboys, dotcom millionaires, and shady businessmen from Essex is difficult to escape. Immediately in front of Sunseeker's astonishing spaceship-like stand, featuring \u00a313 million worth of floating gin palaces, there's a 'champagne piazza' where you may discuss the design of your boat's custom-built interior. Images, Sunseeker's 'essential guide to the ultimate in lifestyle', carries features on Porsche cars, Bovet watches, Purdey guns, and how caviar should not be eaten with a metal spoon unless it is made of gold. This is no mass-market industry. But the immense success of the big four is down to far more than luxury branding and clever marketing. 'The British marine industry is one of the few remaining UK industries which can claim to lead the world,' says Howard Pridding of the British Marine Industries Federation, the builders' trade body. 'Despite difficult trading conditions in Europe, 2000 was a successful year, particularly for the larger boatbuilders, many of which have generated record sales.' Derek Carter is managing director of Fairline, a powerboat builder based for 30 years in the Peterborough area, employing 920 people and with a turnover of \u00a380m. 'The big four powerboaters, through a significant commitment to R&amp;D, have continued to compete against each other, driving on the development of a quality product,' he says. 'Manufacturers concentrate on the boats' sea-keeping abilities and external flair, coupled with luxurious interiors - this sets British powerboaters apart from the competition.' The industry has four centres: the South Coast, particularly around Poole, the South-west, the Norfolk Broads and the Midlands. The BMIF, which also organises the Boat Show, issued the first-ever set of industry statistics last week. Its turnover totalled just under \u00a31.5 billion last year, an 11 per cent jump on 1999. More than 8,000 people are directly employed in boatbuilding, with a further 16,000 in related industries. Marine industries have enjoyed sustained growth for five years, except for a slight slowdown in 1998 when its exports were hit by the strength of the pound against European currencies. That phenomenon has not disap peared, but the industry has managed the situation. 'Because of the exchange rate, the whole industry has turned to the USA,' says Frank Fish, managing director of Sealine, whose T47 was motorboat of the year in the show's British Nautical Awards. Their efforts paid off, and the US now accounts for a third of sales for the British boatbuilding industry. Sealine was founded by Fish in a garage next to a house in the non-seafaring town of Kidderminister, in the Midlands. Around 350 boats are now built each year, but, says Fish, the sales total is not a strong indicator of performance. The powerboat makers have climbed the value chain, selling higher- margin luxury goods to a niche market. The emphasis is on engine performance and exterior styling, but interior design is vital as a symbol of luxury. 'When we first started a 25-footer was a big boat, and the toilet was a bucket and chuck-it,' says Fish. No longer. Demand for larger boats is driven by an ever stronger desire for such luxuries as en-suite bathrooms and more bedrooms. Inside, the interiors are lined with the type of leather used in Aston Martin cars, and equipped with the latest DVD surround-sound technology. Personalisation of the interior is the apotheosis of this pursuit of maritime motorboat luxury. One customer wanted an office built in his Sunseeker boat, another a recording studio. A Sunseeker was featured speeding away from MI6's London HQ on the Thames in the spectacular opening scenes to The World is Not Enough, the latest Bond film. Robert Braithwaite founded the Poole-based company in 1968, selling handbuilt 17-foot yachts. A year later his brother, John, joined as chief designer, and by 1971 turnover was \u00a3100,000 and the company employed 10 people. By July last year turnover was \u00a3104m, there were 1,050 employees. Their biggest boat is a 105ft super yacht, too big to display at the London show. Anyone dropping by the Boat Show hoping to pick up a Sunseeker is likely to be disappointed. Order books are full for the next two years. 'We've driven the market, creating a vision and a dream, and wealth has grown too,' says Braithwaite, now chairman and managing director of Sunseeker. It has recently bought two new shipyards, and is investing \u00a325m over the next two years in research and development. 'Being a private company we do what we do because we love it. We have grown by putting back into the company what we earn. We can sometimes take commercial risks that public companies cannot.' Flotation, it seems, is not an option. 'It's never occurred to us to take it public,' says Derek Carter, of Fairline. 'This is the way almost all the companies have evolved - the founding entrepreneurs are still in place.' But the ever-stronger demands for such luxury are foundering in the face of technical skills shortages. 'Marine business is a people business. We're very heavily reliant on specific people skills - people who can plane a bit of wood, upholster, or wire a boat up with the right electronics,' says Fish. 'We're having to invest heavily in training people, but I'm a great believer in business contributing as well as government. Both need to come to the party to create jobs.' In many ways, boatbuilding should be a manufacturing industry of choice for the Government. It has successfully dealt with the strong pound through diversification and has climbed the value chain. The industry also knows the value of marketing. When the Boat Show first moved to the bigger Earls Court 2 venue, Sunseeker stunned rival exhibitors and spectators with an expensive display that has become standard for the big firms. Shows are a vital marketplace for the products. This makes the three-week-long logistical nightmare and the odd toppled telegraph pole from transporting 800 boats to congested west London worthwhile. But demand for space has rocketed, the BMIF already has 60 companies on a waiting list to exhibit smaller boats, and wishes to expand its coverage of canal narrowboats. The big four builders cannot display the pride of their respective fleets in such a confined space. So the London Boat Show is to move to eXcel, an exhibition centre by the Thames in Docklands for the January 2004 show, when those bigger yachts will be on display. And if you can save \u00a310,000 a week between now and then, you may be able to buy one.",

      "body": "<p>Zackie Achmat a 38-year-old black South African, is probably the world's most extraordinary drug smuggler. </p> <p>As far as anyone can tell, he's the only illegal importer of drugs who has ever voluntarily handed himself in, offered a video of himself clearing Customs and given over all receipts of his transactions to the authorities. </p> <p>Last October, Achmat, who has the Aids-related virus, HIV, flew to Thailand and bought 5,000 pills to treat people dying of Aids. He then flew back to South Africa and handed his drugs over to his country's government. </p> <p>The drug was Biozole, an anti-fungal treatment whose patent is owned by pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer. </p> <p>To buy a Pfizer pill over the counter in South Africa would cost about \u00a39. In Thailand, Achmat scored the same generic drug for 15p. </p> <p>In trade-law-speak, Achmat's 'parallel importation' of Biozole is a vivid symbol of a growing healthcare scandal of epic proportions. Aids is sweeping through Africa much like the Black Death plague that wiped out so much of medieval Europe. Eminent African doctors are now saying that HIV will do more harm to Africans than slavery did. </p> <p>Of the world's 34 million people infected with HIV, 25 million live in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet only 25,000 Africans (0.001 per cent of those infected) receive the drugs known as anti-retrovirals which prolong the lives of people with HIV and are freely available in the developed world. </p> <p>Last week, Achmat was badly ill. Speaking in a whisper from his home, he said: 'Hundreds of people are dying every day in our country because they can't get access to the right drugs. The only thing that is stopping them is the price. I think it's immoral that people are dying just because they're poor.' </p> <p>Controlling the distribution of HIV drugs are some of the world's most powerful pharmaceuticals companies which, combined, make profits running into tens of billions of pounds. </p> <p>But in a move that will make Achmat's 'crime' seem utterly insignificant, the might of the world's drug industry, including the UK's GlaxoSmithKline, will, on 5 March, take the South African Government to court over alleged violation of intellectual property rights - essentially, the same principle that got Achmat into trouble. </p> <p>The constitutional case, which has been rumbling since 1997, will be heard at the Pretoria High Court and could, if appeals are exercised, run for years. Whoever eventually loses will not face damages, but costs running into tens of millions of pounds. </p> <p>At the heart of the case is a law passed by former President Nelson Mandela giving his country the right to buy huge amounts of generic drugs and sell them cheaply in South Africa. In addition, South Africa could compulsorily license HIV drugs and manufacture them within its borders, undercutting the multinational pharmaceuticals companies. The threat of legal action has so far prevented South Africa acting on this right. </p> <p>Pharmaceuticals companies believe these measures represent a threat to their balance sheets although, at present, just 1 per cent of drug revenues come from the entire African continent. </p> <p>But money lost through cheap generic could, drug firms say, be ploughed into more research and development which may ultimately lead to a cure for HIV. </p> <p>Sanctioning cheap HIV drugs may also irritate hard- pressed health authorities in the western world, which spend up to 10 times more on their anti-retrovirals, and also alert the public as to the true - low - cost of medical drugs. </p> <p>Furthermore, argue the drugs firms, it is no good farming out cheap pills to countries that don't have robust health infrastructures. Drugs have to be monitored with scans and therapies. If that can't be done, drugs are useless. </p> <p>But African HIV campaigners argue that drug companies are putting their profits before the health of a whole region. </p> <p>For the South African government, eager to play a leading role in the global economy, court action is the last thing it wants. South Africa is a fully paid up member of the World Trade Organisation and signed the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) agreement, which forces national governments to respect the rights of patent holders. Within the South African government there are major tensions between the health and trade ministries. </p> <p>'This country has no intention of perpetrating a wholesale violation of intellectual property rights,' said Mark Heywood, head of the Aids Law Project at the University of Witwatersrand. 'It doesn't want to be seen as the Mugabe of the South. But the South African government has a duty to provide care for its citizens, and this is why they passed this law.' </p> <p>Even a leading pharmaceuticals analyst in the City last week said leading drug firms could afford to sanction cheap drugs tomorrow without it impacting on their balance sheets. </p> <p>Preferring to remain anonymous, he said: 'It does depend on the amount of usages and the amount given away. These programmes would be phased so that it didn't hit them that hard.' </p> <p>This court case, which has paralysed HIV healthcare in South Africa, highlights the problems of the entire continent. Many African countries rely on the generosity of overseas governments and pharmaceuticals companies to subsidise HIV drug prices. So far, that aid has been sparing. </p> <p>Throughout the Nineties, a series of high-level meetings with executives of leading pharmaceuticals companies and Western governments discussed dropping the prices of drugs. But the cost was deemed too high </p> <p>High-profile offers of cheap Aids treatment from Clinton's administration came with strings. </p> <p>A \u00a3700m offer of cheap drugs from the United States last year turned out to be export-import loans, at commercial interest rates, to buy American drugs at market prices. This offer, not surprisingly, was turned down. </p> <p>But progress is now discernible. Last May, five of the biggest drug companies agreed to begin talks with African nations to reduce the price of their drugs if countries agreed to health action plans drawn up by a leading business consultancy, McKinsey. </p> <p>So far agreements have been reached with Uganda and Senegal. Others are set to follow. But rumours suggest that drug companies have sanctioned an increase in drug production to save thousands, rather than millions, of lives. </p> <p>The British Government has done little to lobby for cheap drugs. Last November, Trade Minister Richard Caborn refused to sanction African nations circumventing Trips by citing 'national emergency' - which they are within their rights to do. </p> <p>'I don't believe that this or related measures such as parallel importing are the answer here,' Caborn wrote to Ben Jackson, director of London-based Action for Southern Africa (Actsa), last November. </p> <p>Clare Short, the Minister for International Development, has no substantial initiatives planned in this area. </p> <p>'Imagine witnessing devastating plague and sitting on a cure for fear of incurring shareholder revolt,' said Ben Jackson of Actsa. 'That essentially is the position of drug companies. Sure healthcare infrastructures have to be in place but it is not an either-or argument. These things can be done simultaneously.' </p> <p>Within a decade the number of people infected with HIV could reach more than 50 million, the equivalent of the population of France or the UK. </p> <p>With the South African court case scheduled to begin in less than two months, the calls for pharmaceutical companies to move faster on dropping the prices of HIV drugs to developing countries are sure to get louder. </p> <p><strong>How Brazil took on the drugs giants - and is winning</strong></p> <p> In the early Nineties, Brazil faced a serious Aids crisis. The South American country had the fourth-largest number of reported cases of the disease in the world, with about 2.5 per cent of Brazilians infected - in other words more than 3 million people. </p> <p>But their chances of surviving were increased by a government which undertook 'daring policies' that went against the orthodoxies of international trade. </p> <p>After years of military dictatorship and escalating foreign debt, the newly elected Brazilian democratic Government defined healthcare as a social right in 1988. </p> <p>Three years later, Brazilian ministers decided to circumvent international trade agreements. They bought and distributed huge amounts of anti-retroviral drugs. </p> <p>The desperate measure, which angered pharmaceuticals companies, paid off. Under pressure, the World Bank in 1994 sanctioned a \u00a3115 million loan to help pay for Brazil's medical drug bill. This was topped up in 1999 by a similar amount, making Brazil the second largest recipient of overseas HIV-focused loans after India. </p> <p>Brazil's government used the loan to guarantee free HIV drugs to all who needed them, to train health professionals, to manufacture drugs and to develop infrastructure for free distribution and monitoring. </p> <p>World Bank loans and Brazil's government policies have contributed to a 38 per cent drop in the number of Aids-related deaths there since 1994. Throughout Brazil, there has been a reduction in hospital admissions, lengths of stay and the incidence of opportunistic infections. </p> <p>These benefits come at a price. In 1999, government expenditure on access to treatment was \u00a3245m. </p> <p>But overall Brazil has actually saved \u00a3291m in three years through fewer/shorter hospital stays, welfare payments and the continued economic activity of those with HIV.</p>",

Haunting pictures are all-too-graphic testimony to the way Aids contaminates everything it touches. </p> <p>But the heartbreaking story of Nkosi Johnson, the 11-year-old Aids victim who captured the world's attention last week, tells only part of the story. </p> <p>It is banal but vital to understand that not only does Aids kill people; it also cripples their economies. A country's ability to afford expensive western drugs or, more importantly, the health and education systems crucial to combat the spread of the disease, is impaired. </p> <p>How significant an economic impact could the virus have?

      "bodyText": "The big drug companies are big on giving. The arts and sports worlds are grateful recipients of the pharmaceutical giants' largesse. And the big drug companies' websites are peppered with big examples of how they've sponsored a big new project in the Third World or helped out a health organisation here or a worthy pressure group there - big time. But the heavy-handed action that GlaxoSmithKline will take later this year in a South African court shows that such generosity has strictly defined limits. It has been a long road to the trial and few in the West will have followed it, but the outcome is seen as crucial by those working to combat the spread of Aids and HIV in South Africa and its neighbouring states. It boils down to the fact that the firm does not want the South African government to sanction the production of cheap drugs, a move initiated under the Mandela presidency in the face of a national emergency. The big drugs firms are scared that if they turn a blind eye to the wholesale production of cheap, generic drugs in South Africa it will set a dangerous precedent, which will be difficult to prevent spreading. It is easy to be emotive about Aids. Haunting pictures are all-too-graphic testimony to the way Aids contaminates everything it touches. But the heartbreaking story of Nkosi Johnson, the 11-year-old Aids victim who captured the world's attention last week, tells only part of the story. It is banal but vital to understand that not only does Aids kill people; it also cripples their economies. A country's ability to afford expensive western drugs or, more importantly, the health and education systems crucial to combat the spread of the disease, is impaired. How significant an economic impact could the virus have? Economists estimate that South African gross domestic product will decline by nearly 20 per cent by 2010 because of Aids. In certain parts of the economy, especially those dependent on highly mobile workforces - some of the most at-risk groups - the impact will be even more profound. And the obvious fact is that the poorer a nation becomes, the fewer resources it has to counter disease. It is a bitter but unsurprising fact to learn that although sub-Saharan Africa has two-thirds of the world's HIV infections and more than 80 per cent of Aids deaths, it accounts for a mere 3 per cent of global spending on Aids. Amidst all of this it is impossible, na\u00efve even, to ignore the fact that the big drug companies have fiduciary responsibilities.

Without the emphasis on profit, the system breaks down and the incentive to invest in the research and development of new drugs disappears. But this argument only holds so much water. Drug companies are not averse to trimming their profit margins dramatically in developing countries. GlaxoSmithKline says it would supply HIV treatments at 80 per cent discounts to prices in the West if, and it is a big 'if', developing countries were to have the correct health infrastructure in place. But it is difficult to establish adequate screening or fully equipped hospitals when a country's economy is collapsing as the virus spreads. And, of course, as it spreads it creates an ever more vicious circle as more people become infected and a greater strain is placed on limited resources. The UK Government is reluctant to get involved and Clare Short, the minister for International Development, has been largely silent on the matter. There will be more haunting photos of Nkosi and others in the coming months and years. But action to save Africa from dereliction is - tragically - unlikely.",

      "body": "<p>Donna Karan says she was following her heart, not her head, when she agreed last month to sell out to Bernard Arnault's flamboyantly acquisitive Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy luxury goods empire for a cool $450 million personal profit. Who would have thought the famous American fashion designer had such a head for business? </p> <p>The deal sent pulses racing on Wall Street. But disappointed investors in her publicly traded company, Donna Karan International Inc, will have to split what they say is a measly $195m between them - if this second part of the LVMH takeover gets the green light from her board. </p> <p>Karan and her husband Stephan Weiss have already sold Arnault the most valuable part of their fashion empire: the privately held Gabrielle Studio, which owns and licenses all the Donna Karan trademarks, from the upscale Donna Karan New York to the more mid-market DKNY labels. This personal royalty arrangement, while proof of the fashion designer's shrewd business acumen, has long caused disquiet on Wall Street, sucking most of the profit out of the public company while paying Karan and Weiss some $80m from 1996 to 1999. </p> <p>So it's not too much of a surprise that some shareholders are getting litigious. </p> <p>In a Delaware court, DKI shareholder Janet Allred has accused both Karan and Weiss of 'preferring their own interest to realise the maximum value on the sale of the trademarks', alleging that their private deal with LVMH had 'effectively thwarted' the company from being shopped around to other buyers to 'maximise shareholder value'. The plaintiff contends the $195m offer for the Wall Street quoted company, at $8.50 a share, is 'unfair' and 'inadequate', adding that some analysts and portfolio managers believe the company is worth between $14 and $15 a share. </p> <p>Karan went public at $24 in 1996, and the stock had fallen as low as $4 before she and Arnault announced the deal on 18 December. The price tag for LVMH is also less than a third of the company's annual revenue of $662m, and a significantly smaller multiple than European luxury fashion houses such as Fendi were getting last year. Despite the 74 per cent premium to the company's 15 December closing price, most shareholders will lose out. </p> <p>But since Karan and her Ducati motorcycle-riding husband own 22 per cent of the public company, they stand to pocket another $50m, bringing their total personal windfall to $500m. </p> <p>'It's the best of all possible worlds for Donna Karan: she gets all that cash, and gets to continue what she does best - designing clothes,' says Harvey Robinson, an apparel analyst with Chapman Company, a Baltimore-based investment bank. </p> <p>Karan would remain chief designer of a combined Gabrielle and DKI under the LVMH roof, and probably continue to profit as an investor - particularly as LVMH would be able to extract more value from the franchise by ending her controversial royalty arrangement. Karan is the only designer of a publicly traded design firm to retain ownership of her name and receive royalties based on net sales - DKI Inc pays Gabrielle 1.75 per cent of the first $250m, rising to 3.5 per cent of net sales over $1.5 billion. In 1999, DKI paid Karan $25m in a year it made just $10m in profit. </p> <p>'Donna Karan will no longer be able to skim from the top,' says veteran Wall Street apparel analyst Walter Loeb, 'and that's good news for LVMH, but it comes a little late for DKI investors.' </p> <p>Marc Ravitz, vice-president of Grace &amp; White, which in September owned 109,700 DKI shares, agrees. 'The value of the Donna Karan enterprise is far greater than what LVMH is paying,' he told the Wall Street Journal, adding that the LVMH cash bid at $8.50 represents 25 per cent of the Donna Karan total revenue. </p> <p>Richard Barone, chief executive of Maxus Investment Group, said there was 'more money offered on the Gabrielle Studios side and there should have been more on the public company side', adding that he would have been happy with $11 or $12. 'The public company is not worth anything without the other side; the real value is the two together, and Donna Karan holds all the cards.' </p> <p>So it was amid this investor grumbling - and the possibility of the Allred case expanding to a class action lawsuit - that the DKI Inc board, which last month hired investment banker Merrill Lynch, announced on Monday that it would entertain offers from rival bidders or the possibility of remaining independent. </p> <p>Some immediately speculated the move would spark a bidding war, bringing in LVMH's bitter business rivals, the Italian fashion house Gucci or the French retail giant Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR). Gucci and LVMH are still locked in legal combat over LVMH's failed bid in 1999. Most market watchers now believe it unlikely that the public company will attract any higher offers, with its most valuable assets already in the hands of LVMH. </p> <p>Other analysts cited concerns that the Donna Karan brand, more fashion than luxury oriented, could be hurt by the economic slowdown in the US. </p> <p>LVMH, which owns Dior, Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon, Krug, Veuve Cliquot, Fendi, Pucci, Louis Vuitton, Kenzo, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs, Celine, Thomas Pink, Chaumet and other luxury brands, does not believe its latest deal will be derailed. </p> <p>'The DK International statement is not a surprise and there's nothing in it that precludes us moving forward with the deal. It's a standard, run-of-the-mill statement consistent with the board's fiduciary duties to protect shareholder interests,' an LVMH spokesman said, adding that the litigation is 'without merit'. </p> <p>Karan is staying silent. But on the day of the deal, she said it was 'the right thing at the right time... I don't do deals with my head only. I did this deal with my heart.' </p> <p>She added: 'As the world's leading luxury group, LVMH has the expertise, resources, global scale and vision to help me realise the full potential of Donna Karan and DKNY as worldwide luxury lifestyle brands. I have always admired Bernard Arnault and the environment he has created for designers in supporting their creativity, emphasising their individuality, respecting their brands and providing the resources to develop global luxury businesses.' </p> <p>Perhaps she hasn't spoken lately to Alexander McQueen. LVMH's Arnault apparently drove the controversial McQueen to creative distraction - and into the arms of Gucci, which will now hold the controlling interest in a separate McQueen label. </p> <p>But Donna Karan is no McQueen. Karan is no doubt more to the elegantly commercial tastes of the French luxury impresario, but then again, some analysts wonder whether she still has the sort of exclusive cachet LVMH normally seeks - her wide array of lines and products are too readily available in mid-price department stores.</p>",

Credit Suisse First Boston estimates that the withdrawal of these leisure lines will have cut Boots' sales by 4 per cent, but thinks improvement in other areas will see the total down by 2.5 per cent. Boots will disclose profit figures for the period with full-year results at the end of May. Safeway is expected to show sales up by between 4 and 5 per cent, putting it behind Wm Morrison - which announced 5.5 per cent growth last week - but ahead of Sainsbury, which increased sales by only 0.7 per cent in the three months to December. Tesco, also reporting quarterly sales on Tuesday, is believed to have had a good Christmas. Analysts had been expecting Safeway's sales growth to slow as it reached the anniversary of its Best Deals Ever campaign, leafleting shoppers with a weekly list of special offers. But so far, sales are still growing strongly. Other retailers issuing trading statements this week include Kingfisher, where analysts expect sales growth to have slowed still further from previous quarters, and Arcadia - owner of chains Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins - which is expected to show some recovery. Last week, Matalan and GUS disappointed the City while Dixons and Selfridges produced better than expected results. This week's announcements will leave only Marks &amp; Spencer among major retailers to report Christmas figures. It is rumoured to have had a poor season although it is is also likely to claim that margins are improving.",

      "body": "<p>A man who heads the world's fifth largest steel producer is expected to have some steel in his backbone. But Sir Brian Moffat, chairman and acting chief executive of Anglo Dutch giant Corus, takes the hard-man reputation further than most. The quiet ascent of the Scottish accountant up the ranks of what was, until recently, British Steel, owes much to his uncompromising use of the industrial guillotine through three decades of turbulence. </p> <p>He himself once said: 'I don't smile much' - and those who know him describe him as 'cold', 'ruthless' and 'distant'. But compared with some previous heads of British Steel, such as Margaret Thatcher's favourite strike buster Ian MacGregor, he holds the respect of workers and union leaders alike. </p> <p>They may not like what he does - his best-known aphorism, if it can be called that, is 'I am interested in making money, not steel' - but at least they know what to expect. </p> <p>Lord Brookman, former general secretary of the ISTC union (formerly the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation), says: 'I have always respected him, although I would not say I have had regular meals with him. He's a shy man, and a hard man. He always found it difficult to look at me straight in the eye.' </p> <p>Recently Moffat, who retired as chief executive in 1999 but remained as chairman, has been a reluctant executioner, spilling the blood of his joint successors. </p> <p>He had to sack his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9, John Bryant, a veteran of 30 years in steel, along with Fokko Van Duyne, who had shared the role since the 1999 merger of British Steel with the Dutch company Hoogovens. </p> <p>Moffat made this a public display, saying: 'The board felt it was necessary to make more rapid progress and more decision-making.' In other words, as the Financial Times put it, he, like shareholders, could no longer accept 'pussyfooting' at the top of a company that had seen its shares drop 60 per cent in a year. </p> <p>The City had hoped the June 1999 merger would equip Corus to fight against the problems of sterling's exchange rate and low global steel prices, and allow rationalisation of plants to save costs. Unions were afraid of UK workers losing out to Dutch ones. </p> <p>The irony is that the merger talks began on 7 January 1999, the day after Moffat's sixtieth birthday, when he stepped down. Two years later he had to return to finish the job. </p> <p>For the 33,000 workers at Corus plants in the UK, even the pussyfooting was painful. Bryant and Van Duyne had introduced 4,500 job cuts, and more were expected. </p> <p>Moffat believed this was not enough, and made it clear that a further swathe of cuts - up to 5,000 - along with the closure of one or more plants could be expected. He is currently deciding where his axe will fall. </p> <p>This will be familiar territory. Moffat came to prominence in British Steel at the beginning of the 1980s, when he restructured the Port Talbot strip-steel works in the wake of a bitter three-month ISTC strike. </p> <p>Under Moffat, employment at Port Talbot dropped from 13,500 to 4,700. The pattern was repeated across British Steel. An organisation that in 1980 employed 142,000 workers had 52,000 by 1988, the year it was privatised. </p> <p>Lord Brookman, who was a union official in South Wales in 1980, recalls: 'It was a very difficult situation in 1980. There had just been a strike, and effectively Moffat was negotiating with a powerful union over what would be more than 50 per cent job losses at the plant. What he did at Port Talbot was followed across the company.' </p> <p>Moffat's reputation was forged against the backdrop of Thatcherism. His enjoyment of fishing, shooting and farming - he has a small holding in Monmouthshire - attest to Conservative instincts. </p> <p>His ability to force through so radical a programme was probably a result of British Steel's performance in the decade after he joined in 1968 from accountant Peat Marwick Mitchell. British Steel had been formed with the nationalisation of the 14 biggest UK steel producers the previous year. The Wilson government chose nationalisation instead of the painful restructuring proposed in the 1966 Benson report, which recommended focusing the disparate UK industry on five plants - Llanwern and Port Talbot in Wales, Scunthorpe, Lackenby and Ravenscraig in Scotland - along with reducing output by 9 million tons. </p> <p>Over the next decade the opposite strategy was pursued. First, British Steel heads Lord Melchett and Monty Finniston proposed production increases and modernisation through new plants. This was watered down by the Heath government, which still agreed to production increases taking output up to 38 million tons, while demanding wholesale or partial closure of some plants, including Corby, Shotton and Ebbw Vale. This was halted in 1974, when Wilson returned, but the oil crisis and world recession hammered the UK's expanding industry, and production targets were halved. By the mid 1970s the UK had the least productive steel industry in Europe. It was ripe for Thatcher, and for Moffat. </p> <p>Despite his hard-man image, Moffat keeps a low profile. He attracted a little City attention in 1993 when he added chairman to his title of chief executive after the retirement of his brasher predecessor, Sir Robert Scholey. </p> <p>He won City respect, first through his role in the British Steel privatisation, and then through raising productivity. Now South Wales works produce 6 million tons of steel with 6,300 workers while the Ijmuiden plant in Holland does the same with 8,000. The problem is that Dutch costs are still lower, and Ijmuiden has a wider range of products - a reflection on past investment decisions. </p> <p>According to Corus, the big problem for the UK plants is that demand from British manufacturers is falling, forcing them to export more, and exposing Corus to exchange-rate volatility. A further irony is that as Moffat plans his cull, the exchange rate is moving back in the UK's favour. </p> <p>Moffat's preference for a discreet public face has not prevented him from confrontation with unions and with government. In addition, he has launched blistering attacks on government measures such as the climate change levy, and criticised the Government's attitude to manufacturing industry. </p> <p>Moffat attempted to break down barriers between skilled craft workers and other production workers under the 'Teamwork' initiative in the 1990s. This continued the stream of redundancies but, Brookman remembers, Moffat was against making any compulsory. </p> <p>But while he has won guarded respect from unions and colleagues, there are those who feel he has done too little to ease the pain of the merger for UK workers while those in Holland have been relatively unscathed - a total of 680 are currently slated to lose their jobs. </p> <p>As one observer said: 'It looks rather like a takeover of British Steel by Hoogovens. If his forthcoming restructuring annihilates the UK, it will be selling the industry out.' </p> <p>Moffat has avoided that charge, even from his former adversaries. Until now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I set up a distribution-type Isa with CGU and expected to receive the first monthly income payment on 5 June. At the end of June, I noticed no payment had come through and that the money was reinvested rather than paid out. CGU agreed to put this right and said payments would start in September. I asked why I received no payment for August and, when CGU failed to explain, lodged a formal complaint. That was in October and I have heard nothing since. PB, Nottingham Financial institutions must complete complaints investigations within two months or tell you why not. CGU, now Norwich Union, says it did write within two months, and responded to your chasing, and cannot understand why neither letter arrived. Apparently you could not have received an August payment because, when the mistake was uncovered, you chose to keep the additional units that had already been added to the accumulation plan rather than take cash. You became eligible for payments from the distribution plans from the qualifying date, the twenty-eighth of the month. Income is paid a month later or, when in an Isa, on the fifth working day of the following month. The problem was sorted out in July, so the first payment came on 5 September. The additional units you kept were worth \u00a344.91 but, had you opted for cash, would have received \u00a348.59. Norwich Union is sending you a \u00a350 cheque, by recorded delivery, to cover the \u00a33.68 shortfall and compensate for inconvenience. Playing FTSE: How low did it go? In November 1999, I invested \u00a310,000 in a 12-month eurobond from Eurolife Assurance, yielding 9 per cent interest. The \u00a310,000 was guaranteed not to fall unless the FTSE-100 index fell by more than 10 per cent 'at any time' and was lower at the end of the year than the start. I did not think it had dropped by that much but Eurolife says it did, at 8.33 am on 17 April, so my investment is worth only \u00a39,747. It is difficult to find a public source detailing the actual lowest figure reached at any time. BW, Winchester Early on the morning of Monday 17 April, traders defensively marked prices down, expecting a bloodbath as Wall Street had fallen sharply the previous Friday. The crash never happened but, for about half an hour, the index showed prices 10.34 per cent down, so the clause kicked in. Eurolife says it was unfortunate that the index dipped so briefly and so narrowly, but the product has no flexibility. The FTSE 100 is recalculated every minute of the trading day and Eurolife's 'at any time' means at any moment of the day, not, as you might reasonably expect, the day's closing figure.

      "body": "<p>Many women may have whooped for joy on 1 December when the new 'pensions-sharing' rules allowed them to get part of their husband's pension fund on divorce. But the rules apply equally to both sexes - and younger generations of women may find that they are on the giving rather than receiving end of many divorce settlements. </p> <p>In fact, campaigners and lawyers are clear that the law should treat men and women equally. 'It's going to happen more often in the future that women are losing part of their pension fund,' says Sallie Quin, one of the founders of Fairshares, the group which campaigned for pension-sharing. 'It's perfectly right and fair that this should happen. As more and more women are earning more and choosing a career, the figures are going to even out. I can envisage a day when it's going to be 50/50.' </p> <p>The Divorce Corporation, a Sheffield-based company that values pension funds for divorce settlements, has seen the proportion of valuations of pension funds built up by women grow from 5 to 10 per cent in the five years since it started this work. 'This reflects the way females have started to get higher-salaried and pensionable jobs,' says spokesman Keith Popplewell. 'That started in earnest about 15 years ago.' </p> <p>The even higher earnings of the new female dotcom workers and other high-fliers could take another 10 years to filter through. 'A pension needs to have been growing for at least five to seven years before it becomes valuable enough for the divorce courts to take an interest in it.' </p> <p>But, of course, the hard-luck stories are also starting to come through. Mrs X's husband left her and their two children five years ago to start another relationship. She is now 'terrified to agree to divorce him in case he can get half my pension'. They lived together as a married couple for only six years. She hopes that any claim on her would be kept to this period - rather than the full 25 years in which she has been earning and paying into a pension. </p> <p>David Davidson, head of family law at solicitor Charles Russell, says it is 'early days yet' to see how judges will interpret the new laws on dividing pensions, but there is precedent for looking only at the period of cohabitation when dividing assets. </p> <p>Another strong argument for Mrs X seems to be the fact that she worked consistently to build up her pension while her husband was less committed: 'He has been sacked three times now from various jobs - for inefficiency and disciplinary reasons.' </p> <p>James Copson, family law partner at solicitor Withers, agrees: 'If a husband can be shown to have been feckless during a marriage, his claim ought to be proportionately reduced.' </p> <p>Mrs X is in the same position as many other mothers contemplating divorce. </p> <p>She has taken the lead in bringing up the two children, caring for one com pletely and sharing care of the second. Her husband pays maintenance for the first child. Copson says: 'In a divorce settlement, the primary carer piggy-backs on the children and will get more as a result.' </p> <p>Also in Mrs X's favour is the fact that, on their separation, she sold the marital home 'as I could not keep up the mortgage payments, and gave him half the proceeds'. So she has already been more than willing to make a fair settlement. </p> <p>No one really knows how the courts will interpret the new pension-sharing rules, nor the 'pensions-earmarking' rules that were introduced in 1996, allowing couples to split the future income from a pension rather than its current underlying assets. </p> <p>Only 1,000 couples are thought to have used the earmarking rules so far. They are relatively unattractive because the right to get the pension income dies when the original owner of the fund dies. </p> <p>Also confusing the picture is the White v White divorce settlement case last year. This case overturned tradition and held that settlements for wealthy divorcing couples should aim to distribute assets equally, rather than give the junior partner enough to live on and maintain his or her standard of living. Divorce lawyers and campaigners are wondering how much this ruling will now filter down to couples with fewer assets. 'White v White will have a big impact,' says Quin. 'And if your assets are only \u00a345,000 between the two of you, not \u00a34.5 million as in White v White, it's even more important that you split them 50/50.' </p> <p>When it comes to splitting pension assets, women should be aware of how pensions are valued. Members of money purchase pensions can argue that they need a slightly larger share than their husbands. This is because women live to 79 on average, while men live to just 74. </p> <p>It is thus more expensive for women to buy an annuity, the financial products that pay out a fixed sum per month to people after they retire. </p> <p>Popplewell of the Divorce Corporation says the room for manoeuvre is not huge. The most he would expect to see a woman successfully claim on these grounds would be 53 per cent of the pension valuation, leaving 47 per cent for the husband. </p> <p>If the wife is in a final salary scheme, where she is building up a right to a pension based on her salary at retirement, rather than an investment, the case will be different. </p> <p>She will not need to buy an annuity because she will get a pension when she retires, rather than a pot of money that needs to be converted to an annuity. The way the system now works, she may find that her husband is given a smaller portion of her pension than he really deserves. This is because the system for valuing final salary pension schemes is notoriously mean in its effect on the junior spouse. </p> <p>In pension circles, controversy has raged about the valuation of final salary pensions for divorce. In most cases, the pension will be valued to exclude the likelihood of future pay rises, promotions and enhancements to the pension scheme - a good system for high-flyers but bad for their ex-spouses. </p> <p>In the very long run, there may be greater equity among spouses over pensions through the new stakeholder pension, which comes on the market in April. Carers and other people out of paid employment can put up to \u00a33,600 a year into the stakeholder, claiming tax relief at the basic rate even if they are not working. </p> <p>Quin says: 'Any of us with any sense will in future say to our partners: \"I'll stay at home, but you can bang in \u00a33,600 for me each year into a stakeholder\".'</p>",

Senior Whitehall officials are deeply concerned about the quality and independence of reports produced by analysts - employed by large investment banks or broking houses - and how much the reports cost fund managers, who use them to make investment decisions. Fund managers say analysts are influenced by their corporate finance departments, which generate the majority of banks' income through fees on mergers and flotations of client companies.

Officials became alarmed before Christmas, when analysts covering the flotation of Orange were forced to have their reports vetted by the company in return for financial information.

Whitehall sources say Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore and of the Guardian Media Group (owner of The Observer ) who is heading the review, shares officials' concerns about independence. He is examining the cost of the analysts' research, which is paid for by fund managers in the commissions they hand to banks and brokers when they buy or sell shares in the market. A government source said: 'Paul Myners is looking at the issue of commissions. Commissions are volume-driven, and fund managers are paying ever-higher amounts for what is a declining value product.' However, Myners is said to believe it is up to fund managers to find alternative sources of independent advice - by building up their own research departments.

      "body": "<p>The feverish, rumour-fuelled world of internet bulletin boards has taken a sinister turn, sparking a police fraud squad inquiry. </p> <p>Last November someone posted on the bulletin board of venture capital fund 3i what looked like an official Stock Exchange announcement. It said that Mercury, the investment fund, had sold shares in Minmet, the quoted mining firm. This was important because Mercury's presence on Minmet's share register is a significant factor in persuading private investors to hold onto its shares. </p> <p>But the announcement was bogus.

      "bodyText": "The feverish, rumour-fuelled world of internet bulletin boards has taken a sinister turn, sparking a police fraud squad inquiry. Last November someone posted on the bulletin board of venture capital fund 3i what looked like an official Stock Exchange announcement. It said that Mercury, the investment fund, had sold shares in Minmet, the quoted mining firm. This was important because Mercury's presence on Minmet's share register is a significant factor in persuading private investors to hold onto its shares. But the announcement was bogus. It had been cut and pasted from an announcement by a totally unrelated company. Someone had removed the original name, Pilkington Tiles, and replaced it with Minmet. The prank, believe Minmet executives, may have destabilised its volatile share price, which last year rocketed on hopes that a discovery of gold in Brazil could see massive revenues in the future. This weekend, Kent fraud squad officers confirmed that they were investigating the case following complaints by Minmet, which has an office there and is quoted in Dublin. Minmet executives believe the perpetrator is part of a sophisticated 'deramping' syndicate out to sell short the company's shares in a bid to buy them at deflated prices.

When Jasmine, a blue burmese, got into a fight with another cat last year, her left eye became inflamed. Initially the vet diagnosed an infection, and when eye drops didn't work he operated to remove her third eyelid. But the problem continued. 'This time we saw a different vet, who had specialised in opthalmology. He spotted that Jasmine had an ulcer on her cornea,' says Maria, Jasmine's owner. </p> <p>Jasmine needed another operation to enable the eye to heal. In all, her treatment cost more than \u00a3800. 'Luckily Jasmine was insured for vet's fees. I had to pay an excess of about \u00a330 on four different occasions, but that was much better than having to fork out the full amount,' says Maria. </p> <p>The RSPCA considers pet insurance to be an integral part of responsible pet ownership. But how do you choose the right policy? Even basic policies differ dramatically in price, as the table shows. If your finances are tight, it is obviously better to buy the cheapest policy rather than none at all. Saga's pet insurance, which can be bought by owners aged 50 or more, is the cheapest for both dogs and cats, but cover for vet's fee is lim ited to \u00a32,000 per year. This may seem a lot, but a serious operation or treatment for a condition such as arthritis could exceed this amount. In addition, the excess for elderly pets - those aged 10 or more - rises to \u00a385 per claim. </p> <p>It is also worth checking the insurer's terms for chronic conditions. Statistics gathered by Pet Plan show that nearly 40 per cent of claims go beyond a 12-month period. But some policies, such as that offered by Dog Breeders Insurance, limit cover for a chronic condition to just one year. </p> <p>You should also check that the premium does not increase with a history of claims. The RSPCA's policy is priced cheaply to encourage owners to insure their pets for the first time, but if you make a claim, your premium will increase. </p> <p>Third-party liability is important for dog owners. This covers you for legal costs and compensation if your dog causes an accident or injures another person, and they sue for damages. It is not necessary for cats as they are considered wild animals legally and you cannot be held responsible for their behaviour. </p> <p>Finally check the terms for insuring your pet after a certain age.

After 30 years in an old, high-ceilinged house with a large garden, they have decided to trade down to something easier to manage. </p> <p>Pat says: 'We have bought a small flat down at the coast. We read a lot and walk a lot, which is why going to the coast is a nice extra dimension. The garden here is getting a bit much for us and it is surrounded by large sycamore trees which have a preservation order on them, so every autumn my poor husband has mountains of leaves to clear up.' </p> <p>They have just the state pension to live on, but in Whitley Bay their outgoings will be cheaper. They have no car but the flat is only two minutes from the Metro. </p> <p>Over the years, instead of saving, they have spent their money on the old house because it always required a lot of attention: 'We have only been able to do bits and pieces to it as we could afford it, because we never borrow money. We have added rewiring, new gutters, a new bathroom, and finally, about 10 years ago, we got round to central heating and new windows.' The Taylors feel they would never stop spending money on the house and it would always be a worry. </p> <p>The new flat will need decorating but nothing more: 'It has a lovely fitted kitchen and a nice bathroom, so we don't have anything to do.' </p> <p>Nor will they have any upkeep problems: 'A maintenance agreement covers all the outside work, garden and walls. We have to join the tenants' association and every year they reckon up. All the work is done, a balance sheet sent to you and it costs about \u00a3400 a year with limits on how much the bill can rise each year.' </p> <p>Pat and Thomas will have to adjust to having less space but are happy with their choice: 'After always living in old houses with high ceilings and large rooms, looking around at modern flats we were absolutely horrified. I couldn't believe the tiny modern bathrooms, but we have been lucky to find something that suits us.' </p> <p>They are selling the old mortgage-free house for \u00a385,000 and paying \u00a362,000 for the flat: 'After all the costs, we estimate we will have \u00a320,000 to invest to provide us with extra income and an emergency fund.' </p> <p>Their only other savings are \u00a31,000 in a Newcastle Build ing Society Isa and \u00a32,500 in Premium Bonds which produce winnings of \u00a3100-\u00a3150 a year. Their main concern is tax: 'We do not pay tax at all at the moment and we want to know how much leeway there is with the investments before we have to pay tax.'</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: James Dalby</strong></p> <p>With \u00a320,000 to invest, they are most unlikely to have a tax problem. In the current tax year they have over \u00a31,800 a year in unused personal tax allowances plus married couple's allowance for people over 65. This is not straightforward but, for the Taylors, effectively reduces any tax bill by up to \u00a3525.50. </p> <p>Not wanting to take risk limits their investment options to cash-based ones, but I would encourage them to consider taking a little risk with some of their money so that they can benefit from capital growth.

      "bodyText": "Pat and Thomas Taylor Ages 62 and 75 Live in Newcastle upon Tyne Occupations Retired Earn State pensions Mortgage None Debts None Investments Isa, Premium Bonds Pensions Receiving state pension Aims To invest proceeds from trading down house Pat and Thomas Taylor are moving to a small flat in Whitley Bay, two minutes away from the seafront. After 30 years in an old, high-ceilinged house with a large garden, they have decided to trade down to something easier to manage. Pat says: 'We have bought a small flat down at the coast. We read a lot and walk a lot, which is why going to the coast is a nice extra dimension. The garden here is getting a bit much for us and it is surrounded by large sycamore trees which have a preservation order on them, so every autumn my poor husband has mountains of leaves to clear up.' They have just the state pension to live on, but in Whitley Bay their outgoings will be cheaper. They have no car but the flat is only two minutes from the Metro. Over the years, instead of saving, they have spent their money on the old house because it always required a lot of attention: 'We have only been able to do bits and pieces to it as we could afford it, because we never borrow money. We have added rewiring, new gutters, a new bathroom, and finally, about 10 years ago, we got round to central heating and new windows.' The Taylors feel they would never stop spending money on the house and it would always be a worry. The new flat will need decorating but nothing more: 'It has a lovely fitted kitchen and a nice bathroom, so we don't have anything to do.' Nor will they have any upkeep problems: 'A maintenance agreement covers all the outside work, garden and walls. We have to join the tenants' association and every year they reckon up. All the work is done, a balance sheet sent to you and it costs about \u00a3400 a year with limits on how much the bill can rise each year.' Pat and Thomas will have to adjust to having less space but are happy with their choice: 'After always living in old houses with high ceilings and large rooms, looking around at modern flats we were absolutely horrified. I couldn't believe the tiny modern bathrooms, but we have been lucky to find something that suits us.' They are selling the old mortgage-free house for \u00a385,000 and paying \u00a362,000 for the flat: 'After all the costs, we estimate we will have \u00a320,000 to invest to provide us with extra income and an emergency fund.' Their only other savings are \u00a31,000 in a Newcastle Build ing Society Isa and \u00a32,500 in Premium Bonds which produce winnings of \u00a3100-\u00a3150 a year. Their main concern is tax: 'We do not pay tax at all at the moment and we want to know how much leeway there is with the investments before we have to pay tax.' Adviser 1: James Dalby With \u00a320,000 to invest, they are most unlikely to have a tax problem. In the current tax year they have over \u00a31,800 a year in unused personal tax allowances plus married couple's allowance for people over 65. This is not straightforward but, for the Taylors, effectively reduces any tax bill by up to \u00a3525.50. Not wanting to take risk limits their investment options to cash-based ones, but I would encourage them to consider taking a little risk with some of their money so that they can benefit from capital growth. Placing, say, \u00a35,000 in a with-profits bond is a good option. They can take an income of 5 per cent a year, still leaving some potential for capital growth. Compa nies to consider include Norwich Union, Scottish Equitable and Scottish Mutual. For an emergency fund, I suggest \u00a35,000 in the Scottish Widows Instant Access account at 6.25 per cent gross, or they could use mini cash Isas; Britannia building society offers one of the most competitive, with tax-free interest of 6.85 per cent. The balance of \u00a310,000 could earn monthly income, perhaps in the Capital One Bank 30 Day Saver account. The annual interest is currently 6.62 per cent. They should each complete a form R85, available from banks and building societies, so all interest is paid gross. James Dalby works for Bates Investment Services Adviser 2: Joanne Cox Mr and Mrs Taylor will not pay tax on the lump sum as it comes from the sale of their main residence, although, in future they may pay tax on any income from investments they buy with the money. Thomas's pension is \u00a34,960 a year and at 75 his personal allowance is \u00a36,050, so he could earn another \u00a31,090 a year before paying tax. Mrs Taylor can receive a further \u00a3786 before paying tax. They could each have \u00a33,000 in a cash Isa although, on the downside, few cash Isas pay out interest monthly. As Mr and Mrs Taylor are risk-averse, they could consider National Savings Income Bonds, which pay 5.95 per cent and, on \u00a320,000, earn \u00a31,190 a year, well within their combined allowance. They should invest proportionately to take advantage of their individual tax allowances; by investing no more than \u00a310,000 in Mrs Taylor's name they will both keep within their allowances. The disadvantage of National Savings is that there is no capital growth and, while they may not be looking for that as such, without it their money loses purchasing power. An investment which could satisfy both the income and growth need would be a with-profits bond. These are not risk-free but the Taylors would have no extra tax to pay.

      "body": "<p>Parents who pay their nannies cash in hand could be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to\u00a35,000 following a change in in the law. </p> <p>No one knows quite how many nannies there are in the UK, because so many are paid in this way. Most nannies negotiate their salaries in net terms, preferring to leave the payment of any tax and National Insurance to their employers, the parents - and they have often failed to pay some or all of the income tax due to the Inland Revenue. </p> <p>But from 1 January, paying an employee cash without handing over the proper tax to the Inland Revenue became a criminal offence. </p> <p>The most common way to pay tax on behalf of a nanny has been through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). This has proved expensive for parents, who receive no tax benefits or reliefs - any payment comes out of the employer's taxed income. A nanny earning \u00a3225.80 net a week, \u00a311,742 a year, will incur \u00a32,153 income tax and \u00a31,105 employee's National Insurance, making a total \u00a315,000 a year. In addition the parent has to pay a further \u00a31,297 of employer's NI, making the total cost \u00a316,297. The table shows how this works. </p> <p>Now, however, there is an alternative and legal way of making the payment - and saving money. </p> <p>This may be the time to set your nanny up in her own private limited company. The Revenue has been attacking most 'personal service companies' - companies owned by one person and supplying all their services to one customer. But the law that does this also makes it clear that if the company supplies services to someone who is not in business, such companies are quite legitimate. Parents are not in business as parents, so a nanny can be a one-person personal service company. </p> <p>In addition, last October it was also made clear that minimum pay legislation does not apply to directors of their own companies who have no contract of employment. This means a nanny who has her own company is free to set her own pay rate. This is very important in this alternative payment plan. </p> <p>So how does it work? First you have to set up a company. As you will have to use an accountant to work this scheme, you may as well buy the company from your firm of accountants. This and all accountancy fees should cost no more than about \u00a31,200 a year. Your nanny has to own this company and be a director, but one of the parent employers should be company secretary. </p> <p>They can then take responsibility for the administration. (You have to be realistic here: your nanny may not be too keen on this part of the job.) </p> <p>Once the company is set up, it bills the parents for the nanny's services. The amount billed should be just enough to cover all its costs. Using the same example as before, this total is \u00a313,767. If you want to keep admin to a minimum, levy bills quarterly in advance. This would make each bill \u00a33,441.75. State on the invoice that fees are not refundable. It is critical that paperwork such as invoices is done. If it is not, this scheme could be challenged as a sham, which it is not when done properly. </p> <p>Your nanny's salary will now comprise two parts - salary and a dividend, both paid by the company. The salary should be just enough to make sure your nanny has an NI credit. If she is paid \u00a383.50 a week, she'll pay no tax on the salary and NIof just 75p. There is no employer's NI. The net pay is \u00a382.75. The annual cost is \u00a34,342. She now needs another \u00a3142.25 per week, or say \u00a37,400 a year. This can be paid as a dividend. </p> <p>Companies that make less than \u00a310,000 of profit a year pay 10 per cent corporation tax. A dividend has a 10 per cent tax credit attached to it and a basic-rate taxpayer (which the nanny will be) pays no additional tax on receipt of a dividend. So, the company has to have profits after 10 per cent tax of \u00a37,400, which means pre-tax profit is about \u00a38,225. This is used to pay the dividend and the nanny pays no tax at all on it. </p> <p>Now the company has three costs: the profits to pay the dividends, the salary and the cost of running it. These amount to \u00a38,225, \u00a34,342 and \u00a31,200 respectively or a total of \u00a313,767. Paying the same nanny under PAYE costs \u00a316,297, so the saving could be \u00a32,530, after costs. This is summarised in the table above. </p> <p>You will need some help with this. Bills have to be raised, dividends have to be paid and recorded properly, and the company will have to prepare and file accounts. So you should consult an accountant. But the scheme is legal and cost-effective at a time when there will be a clampdown on 'cash in hand' nannies. It has to be worth considering.</p>",

Now, however, there is an alternative and legal way of making the payment - and saving money. This may be the time to set your nanny up in her own private limited company. The Revenue has been attacking most 'personal service companies' - companies owned by one person and supplying all their services to one customer. But the law that does this also makes it clear that if the company supplies services to someone who is not in business, such companies are quite legitimate. Parents are not in business as parents, so a nanny can be a one-person personal service company. In addition, last October it was also made clear that minimum pay legislation does not apply to directors of their own companies who have no contract of employment. This means a nanny who has her own company is free to set her own pay rate. This is very important in this alternative payment plan. So how does it work? First you have to set up a company. As you will have to use an accountant to work this scheme, you may as well buy the company from your firm of accountants. This and all accountancy fees should cost no more than about \u00a31,200 a year. Your nanny has to own this company and be a director, but one of the parent employers should be company secretary. They can then take responsibility for the administration. (You have to be realistic here: your nanny may not be too keen on this part of the job.) Once the company is set up, it bills the parents for the nanny's services. The amount billed should be just enough to cover all its costs. Using the same example as before, this total is \u00a313,767. If you want to keep admin to a minimum, levy bills quarterly in advance. This would make each bill \u00a33,441.75. State on the invoice that fees are not refundable. It is critical that paperwork such as invoices is done. If it is not, this scheme could be challenged as a sham, which it is not when done properly. Your nanny's salary will now comprise two parts - salary and a dividend, both paid by the company. The salary should be just enough to make sure your nanny has an NI credit. If she is paid \u00a383.50 a week, she'll pay no tax on the salary and NIof just 75p. There is no employer's NI. The net pay is \u00a382.75. The annual cost is \u00a34,342. She now needs another \u00a3142.25 per week, or say \u00a37,400 a year. This can be paid as a dividend. Companies that make less than \u00a310,000 of profit a year pay 10 per cent corporation tax. A dividend has a 10 per cent tax credit attached to it and a basic-rate taxpayer (which the nanny will be) pays no additional tax on receipt of a dividend. So, the company has to have profits after 10 per cent tax of \u00a37,400, which means pre-tax profit is about \u00a38,225. This is used to pay the dividend and the nanny pays no tax at all on it. Now the company has three costs: the profits to pay the dividends, the salary and the cost of running it. These amount to \u00a38,225, \u00a34,342 and \u00a31,200 respectively or a total of \u00a313,767. Paying the same nanny under PAYE costs \u00a316,297, so the saving could be \u00a32,530, after costs. This is summarised in the table above. You will need some help with this. Bills have to be raised, dividends have to be paid and recorded properly, and the company will have to prepare and file accounts. So you should consult an accountant. But the scheme is legal and cost-effective at a time when there will be a clampdown on 'cash in hand' nannies. It has to be worth considering.",

No one can do more than guess at how many lives worldwide will be claimed in the end. The only thing we can know with any certainty is that the legacy will be here for decades to come.'",

Time and again when managers are asked what causes them most grief, they reply that it is the most basic things of all: 'People' and 'change'. </p> <p>But here's a puzzle. Human beings are social animals. We are brilliantly equipped for appraising, interpreting and communicating with others. We are also wonderfully adaptable. We change and grow all our lives. We change homes, partners and governments. We swap fashions at the drop of a hat or hemline. But if that's the case - if people are naturally good at change and communicating - how come companies make such a hash of it? </p> <p>According to Nigel Nicholson, professor of organisational behaviour at London Business School, the answer (as to a number of other management paradoxes) is to be found in the emerging discipline of evolutionary psychology. Basically, EP marries the framework of Darwinism with modern theories of genetics and neuropsychology to propose that psychology as well as physique is the product of evolutionary winnowing. </p> <p>Applied to business, as Nicholson does in his book Managing The Human Animal (Texere, \u00a318.99), EP suggests that most organisational practice runs directly against the grain of human program ming. Much of our behaviour is hardwired for the successful hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our prehistoric ancestors; and this 45,000-year-old psyche - putting emotion before rational analysis, vision before the other senses, narrative before more dispassionate forms of analysis - is understandably alienated among the chart boxes and serried hierarchies of the large modern organisation. 'You can take the manager out of the Stone Age, but not the Stone Age out of the manager,' as Nicholson puts it. </p> <p>Precisely because we are so adaptable, humans can seemingly put up with an awful lot. The changes that have led people from the outback to the urban jungles of New York or London, from small groups of hunter-gatherers to the teeming bureaucracy, have brought vast benefits in terms of productivity and the ability to support ever larger populations. </p> <p>But there's a cost. 'The further we get from our origins, the more the propensity for disorder grows,' says Nicholson. In society, that surfaces as social conflict, crime, mental illness and alienation. Business has its own version of these dysfunctions: the suppression of emotion and stress, disempowerment and alienation, low trust, management by fear, discrimination (the tyrannies of, respectively, rationality, bureaucracy, politics, dominance and tribalism). </p> <p>No wonder introducing change fails, or for that matter teams work fitfully if at all, or most decisions are just plain bad. Organisations take things that people do naturally - change, work together, make joint decisions - and make them do them unnaturally. </p> <p>One of the chief culprits here is rationality. Paradoxically, as an explanation and model of human behaviour, rationality is a fantasy. Despite the much-made comparisons with the computer, the brain isn't naturally equipped for it, being much more at home with fuzzy nonlinear approximations and intuitions than computational tasks such as statistical analysis or even simple arithmetic. </p> <p>This doesn't mean that rational systems are impossible or unnecessary. On the contrary, they are all the more essential to correct human biases and manage manmade complexities that are beyond the power of the brain to control. They are what makes the trains run on time (if you see what I mean) or prevent nuclear power stations from melting down (likewise). </p> <p>What is harmful, says Nicholson, is the dualism (mind/body, reason/emotion, nature/nurture, humanity/ natural world) which makes humans believe that rationality untainted by emotion is the norm; that reason is undisputed king, instead of an equal partner in a human dialectic. </p> <p>The evolutionary psychology view of the world is controversial. It suggests that leaders may be born rather than made, that organisational gossip and politics are universal, and that gender differences make the male-constructed world of business inherently hostile for women. </p> <p>It is hard, admits Nicholson, for some groups to accept such conclusions. They are bad news, he says cheerfully, for consultants and other unreconstructed dualists, whose fundamental assumption is that nature is subservient to nurture (to put it crudely, any change can be accomplished by enough brainwashing). </p> <p>Bright young MBAs at the start of their careers, he notes, are particularly resistant to the notion of constraints to their wide-ranging ambitions, while CEOs and senior managers firmly reject the EP interpretation of executive pay as aggressive display, of hierarchies as a reflection of male preoccupation with status, and of many acquisitions as ego- and empire-building as much as rational strategy. </p> <p>Yet Nicholson is adamant that EP is the very opposite of a counsel of resignation or despair. For a start, the ideal organisation in EP terms (no surprises here) is exactly the one that most people would like to work in: small units, with a flexible hierarchy and leadership; working largely in team projects but recognising the individual; diverse, with high trust and high involvement; self-critical. Better, these attributes correspond quite closely to those of the 'high-performance workplace', which is emerging from the research as consis tently more productive, creative and profitable than less human-centred versions. Nicholson's favourite company is Semco, a Brazilian firm that has torn up the management handbooks and whose direction is almost entirely dependent on the motivation and ingenuity of employees. </p> <p>At a less exalted level, the new Darwinism offers a check against corporate decision-making. 'The history of post-agrarian civilisation has been largely a story of humans reacting with limited insight to changes they wittingly or unwittingly engineered,' Nicholson writes. 'We continue to be outpaced by our own inventions.' The antidote: manage the human animal. Deliberately use systems to support rational inadequacies. Build community. 'Know thyself,' says Nicholson.
