Two days don't make a long-term trend, but it's certainly a more positive than a negative sign.\" Markets were also cheered yesterday by more encouraging news from Argentina, where there were signs that the country's newly-appointed economic strong-man, Domingo Cavallo, will be successful in pushing through a package of spending cuts. In London, the FTSE 100 Index closed up 174.3 points at 5576.6 while the Techmark, the City's index of leading technology shares put on more than 3% on the day to close just below the 2000 level. The West's leading economic think tank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said yesterday that technology shares in the European Union should not be ranked as lowly as their post-bubble counterparts in the US. \"Since Europe has seen much less of a mark-up of stock prices - especially hi-tech stock - in the 1990s than the US, and the medium-term outlook for the EU countries looks healthier, there is no fundamental reason why technology media and telecommunications prices in Europe should drop in unison with the US ones.\" Mr Greenspan will today make his first public appearance since the Fed's decision last Tuesday to cut US interest rates by only 50 basis points unnerved global markets, which were hoping for a bigger reduction. Last night, there was still widespread caution about how solid yesterday's rally would prove. \"I think it could just be a short-term rally in a bear market,\" said Thierry Rojat of Weavering Capital's Montblanc hedge fund. He expected a rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday. If not then, at the next meeting.",

      "body": "<p> Recitals of operatic chunks with piano accompaniment are precarious exercises at best. Orchestral effects lose their clout when transcribed for the keyboard; there is the constant threat that the musical impact will be undermined. Things came dangerously close to it on this occasion, with pianist Semyon Skigin battling to convey the orchestral impetus of Verdi, Tchaikovsky and Puccini while Russian stars Galina Gorchakova and Sergei Leiferkus strutted their formidable stuff. </p> <p>The effort and difficulty were more than once apparent. The string tremolandos and the baleful, buzzing woodwind that introduce Verdi's Macbeth and Iago respectively sounded like the accompaniment to a tacky melodrama. The muted yet disturbing interplay of woodwind, brass and harp that tracks Tchaikovsky's Tatiana as she writes her catastrophic letter to Eugene Onegin makes for monochrome pianism, however sensitive Skigin's playing. </p> <p>The power of this recital lay ultimately in the thrill of the voices - two of the greatest in the world today - and in the dramatic cut and thrust between them. Gorchakova's appearances have been few of late. She has sung both Tatiana and Tosca at Covent Garden, but we haven't heard her Verdi live at all. This is a shame, for here she proved a breathtaking interpreter of his music. There's a voluptuous opulence in her voice, a sumptuous warmth in the upper registers, a whiff of mezzo darkness down below. </p> <p>She unfurled the long lines of Leonora's final aria from La Forza del Destino with rapturous ease. She joined Leiferkus for the Act Three duet from Il Trovatore, where her coloratura flowed with heady abandon. There is no one else around to equal Gorchakova in this music - you have to go back 20 or 30 years, to Leontyne Price and Renata Tebaldi, to hear anything comparable. </p> <p>It was in Verdi, too, that Leiferkus proved most revelatory. His Iago is already familiar, but he reminded us of it again, leaning against the piano with a malign smile playing across his face as he intoned his blasphemous creed. He also gave us Macbeth's final soliloquy, capturing the world-weariness, terrible solitude and moral obloquy resulting from his own infamy. </p> <p>A handful of Russian songs kicked the programme off, with Leiferkus particularly fine in Rachmaninov's Fate - snide, menacing, edging towards sneering malevolence. </p> <p>To close, they gave us extracts from Onegin - an aria each, then the final duet. For the latter, the Barbican platform was transformed into a theatre, as music stands were pushed aside and the pair of them acted their socks off. At the end, as Tatiana finally dismisses the man who has emotionally destroyed her, Gorchakova slipped from Leiferkus's insistent grasp and fled off-stage to the artist's room, all the while holding a rock-steady top B. It's hard to beat either of them in Onegin, and this was a performance to leave you in tatters. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Recitals of operatic chunks with piano accompaniment are precarious exercises at best. Orchestral effects lose their clout when transcribed for the keyboard; there is the constant threat that the musical impact will be undermined. Things came dangerously close to it on this occasion, with pianist Semyon Skigin battling to convey the orchestral impetus of Verdi, Tchaikovsky and Puccini while Russian stars Galina Gorchakova and Sergei Leiferkus strutted their formidable stuff. The effort and difficulty were more than once apparent. The string tremolandos and the baleful, buzzing woodwind that introduce Verdi's Macbeth and Iago respectively sounded like the accompaniment to a tacky melodrama. The muted yet disturbing interplay of woodwind, brass and harp that tracks Tchaikovsky's Tatiana as she writes her catastrophic letter to Eugene Onegin makes for monochrome pianism, however sensitive Skigin's playing. The power of this recital lay ultimately in the thrill of the voices - two of the greatest in the world today - and in the dramatic cut and thrust between them. Gorchakova's appearances have been few of late. She has sung both Tatiana and Tosca at Covent Garden, but we haven't heard her Verdi live at all. This is a shame, for here she proved a breathtaking interpreter of his music. There's a voluptuous opulence in her voice, a sumptuous warmth in the upper registers, a whiff of mezzo darkness down below. She unfurled the long lines of Leonora's final aria from La Forza del Destino with rapturous ease. She joined Leiferkus for the Act Three duet from Il Trovatore, where her coloratura flowed with heady abandon. There is no one else around to equal Gorchakova in this music - you have to go back 20 or 30 years, to Leontyne Price and Renata Tebaldi, to hear anything comparable. It was in Verdi, too, that Leiferkus proved most revelatory. His Iago is already familiar, but he reminded us of it again, leaning against the piano with a malign smile playing across his face as he intoned his blasphemous creed. He also gave us Macbeth's final soliloquy, capturing the world-weariness, terrible solitude and moral obloquy resulting from his own infamy. A handful of Russian songs kicked the programme off, with Leiferkus particularly fine in Rachmaninov's Fate - snide, menacing, edging towards sneering malevolence. To close, they gave us extracts from Onegin - an aria each, then the final duet. For the latter, the Barbican platform was transformed into a theatre, as music stands were pushed aside and the pair of them acted their socks off. At the end, as Tatiana finally dismisses the man who has emotionally destroyed her, Gorchakova slipped from Leiferkus's insistent grasp and fled off-stage to the artist's room, all the while holding a rock-steady top B. It's hard to beat either of them in Onegin, and this was a performance to leave you in tatters.",

      "body": "<p>\"We need to tame deflation and make it benign. To do so we need not just different policies but a different economic philosophy.\" The Japanese banker who told me this a week ago in Kyoto was not speaking only of Japan. Unlike most western observers, he understood that the world is returning to a condition it has not known since the late 19th century, when globalisation first got under way. Deflation is built into the global economy that has emerged in the wake of the cold war. The question is whether we can prevent it from spiralling out of control. </p> <p>While the stock market continued to defy gravity few people took seriously the idea that we may be returning to a world of steadily falling prices. Deflation might be entrenched in Japan, but there was no reason to think that it could spread. The vast destruction of wealth we have seen in stock markets over the past few weeks has shattered that complacent consensus. As in Japan, the risk is that a further collapse in the stock market will rebound on the real economy and reinforce the deflationary forces that go with globalisation. </p> <p>Until only a few months ago, the suggestion that the long boom on Wall Street would end in a Japanese-style crash was treated with derision. With few exceptions, western commentators insisted that it rested on sound economic fundamentals. A surprisingly large number gave credence to the idea that the US had entered a \"new era\" of crisis-free growth. This was, of course, sheer tosh. No doubt it owed something to gains in productivity from restructuring and new technologies, but America's millennial boom was essentially a classic speculative bubble, fuelled by loose credit and stoked up by vast inflows of foreign capital. </p> <p>As in the bubbles of the past, investors were assured that \"This time it is different\". The investment bankers who proclaimed an American economic miracle were fond of quoting Joseph Schumpeter's description of capitalism as an economic system driven by creative destruction. But in the euphoria produced by rocketing stock prices the destructive side of capitalism identified by the great Austrian economist (the decimation of obsolete industries and the recurrent booms and busts in financial markets) was rarely mentioned. Many Americans came to believe that crashes happen only in history books. </p> <p>As in the 1920s, the belief that the US had arrived on a plateau of permanent prosperity became the basis on which they planned their economic future. Placing their faith in the capital gains they had made in the stock market, they stopped putting money aside for retirement and borrowed as if there were no tomorrow. As could have been predicted, the sunlit upland proved to be a narrow and dangerous crevasse. </p> <p>Many of the capital gains on which Americans were relying for their security in retirement have now gone up in smoke. Any figure is bound to be imprecise, but the worldwide loss of wealth resulting from the decline in stock markets is estimated to be already five or six times as large as that suffered in the mini-crash of 1987. The danger to the global economy posed by this loss of wealth is significant. In order to avoid poverty in old age, millions of Americans will have to start saving again - and saving hard. If history is any guide, they cannot rely on being baled out by the markets. In 1949, the Dow Jones Index stood at less than half its top in 1929. In 1982, when the last great bull market in American stocks began, the index was still more than 20% lower than its peak in 1966 - 16 years earlier. Contrary to the claims of brokers and financial advisers, equities are risky even when they are held long-term. After a meltdown of the sort we are seeing, it can take decades for investors to recoup their losses. Many will find their standard of living reduced permanently. </p> <p> The danger that economic activity will contract throughout the world as Americans curtail their spending is well understood among bankers and policy makers. The deflationary impact of globalisation is less widely comprehended. But the fact is that virtually every aspect of that complex process works to drive prices down. The internet has brought about a huge transfer of value from producers to consumers. By comparison with the past, information is now virtually cost-free. An enormous variety of services can now be accessed directly, without the need for expensive intermediaries. With new technologies, production can be sliced into segments and sited in places all over the world. At the same time, the collapse of communism and the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America have injected billions of new workers into world markets. </p> <p>Taken together, these developments have catapulted us back in time. The world economy at the start of the 21st century bears a striking resemblance to the last quarter of the 19th century, when underwater telegraph cables started to link up markets around the world. Then, as now, new technologies and global free trade exerted a powerful downwards effect on price levels, with some parts of the world languishing in prolonged depression. </p> <p>The risk we face at present is that a further slide on Wall Street will tip the world economy into outright deflation. We can be sure that Alan Greenspan will do all he can at the US Federal Reserve Bank to prevent such a disaster. Interest rates will be cut aggressively in an effort to boost confidence. </p> <p>But the Japanese example is not reassuring. Zero interest rates there have failed to lift the country out of 1930s-style deflation. The economy is still contracting, and the stock market has retreated to a level last seen more than 15 years ago. It can be argued that the bubble economy was more extreme in Japan than in the United States, and the response of the Japanese authorities slow and indecisive. But the real lesson to be learnt from Japan is that once deflation is embedded in the economy it is fiendishly difficult to control. Japanese policy-makers have found that lowering interest rates in these circumstances is - as Keynes famously put it - \"pushing on a string\". That is why, partly in response to western advice, they are beginning to accept that the only way out may be to print money. </p> <p>As the Japanese banker observed, we need a new economic philosophy. But I'm not holding my breath. Perhaps aggressive American interest rate cuts will prevent further market slides and consequent recession in the US and throughout the world. If not, western governments and central banks are likely to follow the course they are urging on the Japanese. In that case, we may avoid late 19th-century deflation only to find ourselves back in the inflation ridden world of the 1970s. </p> <p>\u0095 John Gray is professor of European thought at the LSE. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" j.gray@lse.ac.uk\">j.gray@lse.ac.uk</a></p>",

But only just. Belgium's last-gasp draw condemned the Scots to their most dramatic emotional collapse in years. After 30 minutes, Scotland were 2-0 ahead and one man up following Eric Deflandre's 28th-minute sending-off for handball. </p> <p>Everything was going Scotland's <strong> </strong> way. On the hour, elation was turning into edginess following Marc Wilmots's 58th-minute header to make it 2-1. By full-time, the substitute Daniel van Buyten's header from a cross from a fellow substitute, Sven Vermant, felt like a knife in the heart. </p> <p>\"We are walking away with a draw feeling like it was a defeat,\" said the Scotland coach Craig Brown, who had seen Billy Dodds re-direct a low cross from Craig Burley to put Scotland ahead after only 70 seconds and then double the advantage when Deflandre handled a Colin Hendry header, an indiscretion that led to a red card and a penalty rammed high into the net. </p> <p>Scotland at least can make amends sooner rather than later, with San Marino visiting Glasgow on Wednesday. For the moment they must rue the missed opportunity to go top and take a three-point lead over the Belgians. As it is, Robert Waseige's Red Devils maintain a massively superior goal difference. </p> <p>Yet Brown said: \"In a month's time, when we are three points clear [assuming a win over San Marino] and Belgium have to go to Croatia, it won't feel so bad. Had we won, I would have been saying, unusually, 'we are on our way'. </p> <p>\"We've got a lot to do now. But that's the Scottish way. But the Scottish way usually ends up with us getting there in the end.\" </p> <p>There were two key moments that came within inches of delivering the three points for Scotland. In the 57th minute, Dominic Matteo continued a beautifully flowing Scottish move with a pass that bisected two defenders and gave Barry Ferguson a gilt-edged chance to make it 3-0. But the midfielder's shot was too close to Geert de Vlieger, his miss compounded by Wilmots's goal at the other end a minute later. And in the 73rd minute, Didier Dheedene restored his reputation with a brave, saving tackle on the surging Burley. </p> <p>The added disappointment of Saturday was that it came off the back of three good results, all away. Scotland's form on the road has been far superior to that at the recently revamped Hampden Park and leads Brown to believe his side are capable of winning in Brussels. He also thinks Belgium may become complacent on the back of their unlikely draw<sub> </sub>- a notion that, frankly, seems preposterous. </p> <p>As for the Belgians on Saturday, Brown likened Wilmots, who got on to the end of Bob Peeters's cross, to Celtic's Swedish striker Henrik Larsson. \"He is always a problem with the way he arrives late and powers in headers. You know what he is going to do but, like Larsson, stopping him is another thing.\" </p> <p>Whereas Scotland's opening goal revealed weakness down the Belgian left, Belgium's two goals each found the Scottish defence guilty of standing off their man. Still, David Weir, on the left side of the Scottish defensive trio, had an outstanding match. Celebrating his 25th cap, as was the midfielder Paul Lambert, the Everton defender covered and read the game expertly. </p> <p>Colin Hendry looked awkward on that Peeters cross but the captain otherwise gave a reasonably commendable performance, especially in the first half. </p> <p>Hendry is passionate about his country and could not have had a more auspicious occasion for his 50th cap. But this morning he will still be some way this side of downcast.</p>",

For the moment they must rue the missed opportunity to go top and take a three-point lead over the Belgians. As it is, Robert Waseige's Red Devils maintain a massively superior goal difference. Yet Brown said: \"In a month's time, when we are three points clear [assuming a win over San Marino] and Belgium have to go to Croatia, it won't feel so bad. Had we won, I would have been saying, unusually, 'we are on our way'. \"We've got a lot to do now. But that's the Scottish way. But the Scottish way usually ends up with us getting there in the end.\" There were two key moments that came within inches of delivering the three points for Scotland. In the 57th minute, Dominic Matteo continued a beautifully flowing Scottish move with a pass that bisected two defenders and gave Barry Ferguson a gilt-edged chance to make it 3-0. But the midfielder's shot was too close to Geert de Vlieger, his miss compounded by Wilmots's goal at the other end a minute later. And in the 73rd minute, Didier Dheedene restored his reputation with a brave, saving tackle on the surging Burley. The added disappointment of Saturday was that it came off the back of three good results, all away. Scotland's form on the road has been far superior to that at the recently revamped Hampden Park and leads Brown to believe his side are capable of winning in Brussels. He also thinks Belgium may become complacent on the back of their unlikely draw - a notion that, frankly, seems preposterous. As for the Belgians on Saturday, Brown likened Wilmots, who got on to the end of Bob Peeters's cross, to Celtic's Swedish striker Henrik Larsson. \"He is always a problem with the way he arrives late and powers in headers. You know what he is going to do but, like Larsson, stopping him is another thing.\" Whereas Scotland's opening goal revealed weakness down the Belgian left, Belgium's two goals each found the Scottish defence guilty of standing off their man. Still, David Weir, on the left side of the Scottish defensive trio, had an outstanding match. Celebrating his 25th cap, as was the midfielder Paul Lambert, the Everton defender covered and read the game expertly. Colin Hendry looked awkward on that Peeters cross but the captain otherwise gave a reasonably commendable performance, especially in the first half. Hendry is passionate about his country and could not have had a more auspicious occasion for his 50th cap. But this morning he will still be some way this side of downcast.",

At the heart of England's best moments, playing a part in Owen's equaliser and scoring the winner.

Your country needs you. </p> <p> <strong> Mark: 7</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Steve McManaman</strong> </p> <p> Unfortunate to be subsituted after a bright start to the second half during which he beat his marker several times and set up the winner with a surging run.

A few nice touches and a good early shot but was largely unimpressive. </p> <p> <strong> Training tip:</strong> Look for barn door and a football in Tirana. Practise until perfect. </p> <p> <strong> Mark: 5</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Emile Heskey</strong> </p> <p> Again used by Eriksson in a wide role when he came on for McManaman. Showed his pace and strength with run which earned a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area but had too little time to impose himself. </p> <p> <strong> Training tip:</strong> Replay video of Cole's missed opportunities in front of Eriksson and hope for starting place on Wednesday. </p> <p> <strong> Mark: 6</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Robbie Fowler</strong> </p> <p> Given a warm welcome by the Anfield crowd and showed his instinct for goalscoring by getting himself into a fine position in the eight minutes he had as a replacement for Cole. Put through by Gerrard, his shot was well saved by Antti Niemi. </p> <p> <strong> Training tip:</strong> Slip something into the tea of Owen, Cole and Heskey. Unlikely to start on Wednesday otherwise. </p> <p> <strong> Mark: 6</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Nicky Butt</strong> </p> <p> Thrown on for final few minutes and barely had a touch.</p>",

Caught out when Finland scored and lost Johansson shortly after but made crucial late header. Training tip: Concentration. Twice caught out. Mark: 6 Chris Powell Far less convincing than against Spain, particularly early on. Nerves settled as England improved and he made one dangerous break forward. Training tip: Positioning. Stood off his man too much in the first half. Mark: 6 David Beckham So much for Beckham's demise. At the heart of England's best moments, playing a part in Owen's equaliser and scoring the winner. Managed four other shots, offered some dangerous crosses and drifted off the flank to good effect. Training tip: More of the same please, cap'n. Mark: 8 Paul Scholes Busy, aggressive and tidy, barely misplacing a pass, but only occasionally made the thrusts forward which make him so dangerous. Showed his threat around the penalty area by laying on Beckham's goal and setting up Andy Cole. Training tip: Adventure. Get forward and drop a few more hand grenades, as Kevin Keegan would say. Mark: 7 Steven Gerrard Highly impressive after the interval, winning challenges, making interceptions and playing punchy passes. Not bad for a man who woke up feeling stiff and thought he wouldn't play. Will be missed in Albania. Training tip: Sort out that back problem. Your country needs you. Mark: 7 Steve McManaman Unfortunate to be subsituted after a bright start to the second half during which he beat his marker several times and set up the winner with a surging run. Eager but less effective before the interval. Training tip: Work on left-foot crosses. Mark: 7 Michael Owen By his own admission not his best performance but confirmed his knack of scoring vital goals for England. Also hit the bar with a header and worked tirelessly in his deeper role until taken off in the final minute. Training tip: First touch - undoubtedly improving but let him down on occasion. Mark: 7 Andy Cole Left all wondering if he will ever score for England after wasting a perfect chance in front of the Kop. A few nice touches and a good early shot but was largely unimpressive. Training tip: Look for barn door and a football in Tirana. Practise until perfect. Mark: 5 Emile Heskey Again used by Eriksson in a wide role when he came on for McManaman. Showed his pace and strength with run which earned a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area but had too little time to impose himself. Training tip: Replay video of Cole's missed opportunities in front of Eriksson and hope for starting place on Wednesday. Mark: 6 Robbie Fowler Given a warm welcome by the Anfield crowd and showed his instinct for goalscoring by getting himself into a fine position in the eight minutes he had as a replacement for Cole. Put through by Gerrard, his shot was well saved by Antti Niemi. Training tip: Slip something into the tea of Owen, Cole and Heskey. Unlikely to start on Wednesday otherwise. Mark: 6 Nicky Butt Thrown on for final few minutes and barely had a touch.",

So goes the Gemmill - a celebratory jig choreographed to commemorate the greatest Scottish goal that ever was, scored by Archie Gemmill during the 1978 World Cup match between Scotland and Holland in Argentina. Choreographer Andy Howitt has created a dance copying Gemill's nifty footwork round the Dutch defence, the graceful chip into the net, and the player's exuberant celebration. It is designed to attract more boys to modern dance and will be performed this summer at a \"dance the goal\" event at Hampden Park in Glasgow, part of a celebration of football's finest moments. Howitt, artistic director of the Scottish Youth Dance company, told a Sunday newspaper that he had already shown the dance to children and they had been very enthusiastic. \"This goal is helping get hundreds and hundreds of young men who would never think of dance and movement,\" he said. \"It's a vehicle.\" Howitt, who gave up his own ambition to be a professional footballer in favour of dance, said the goal has a very personal link.

Superficially attractive as a method of recycling waste food, it is a practice that should be abolished as quickly as possible. There has long been official nervousness about pigswill as a feeding method. The greatest potential for infecting or carrying disease is in waste meat. The most dreaded viruses in the pig industry, classical swine fever and foot and mouth can both survive for long periods in meat - only the heat of proper cooking or boiling can kill it. Many farmers have abandoned using it already because of the risks, and only 80,000 pigs (1.4% of the UK pig population) now eat swill. In some countries in Europe use of pigswill has been banned already but the practice has remained legal in the UK because the Ministry of Agriculture believed that they could regulate it properly. Swill has to be boiled for an hour and each of the premises that use it is licensed and inspected to make sure there is proper compliance. However, the system has clearly failed with such disastrous consequences that they were unimaginable only five weeks ago - since then nearly 600,000 animals have been condemned. Despite this, the practice of feeding swill continues and is still being allowed. Although banning it is under consideration, no decision has yet been reached. The reason swill is so dangerous is due to the current pattern of trade in food. In the past, food used as swill was locally produced and recycled.

It is a busy time, but also quiet in the sense that the farm has few visitors now and no deliveries.

      "bodyText": "ITV has come under fire from the ITC for a second year running over the quality of its factual programming. And Channel 5 has been condemned once again for some of its late-night erotica which was branded unsuitable for anything other than a \"non-specialist or non-adult channel\". In its annual performance review, the TV regulator said ITV \"showed little evidence of improvement\" following some damning criticisms made in the Annual Report for 1999. The remarks are a sign that the regulatory body wishes to play hardball in the run-up to a government overhaul of the communications regulation infrastructure. Last year's report chided ITV for \"a narrowing range of subject matter in factual and a homogeneity in treatment, calling for greater distinctions between the different factual genres\". \"2000 provided little evidence of improvement,\" said the ITC in a carefully worded report. It said the main daytime shows, Trisha, This Morning, and Live Talk, \"shared similar editorial interests\". And it was unhappy that the number of Real Lives documentaries had been reduced from 12 in 1999 to just seven in 2000. ITV also received a slapped wrist over its approach to international coverage. Tonight with Trevor McDonald was praised for its domestic news coverage and for \"becoming well-established and familiar to viewers, with the potential to provide its regular mainstream audience with more strong and original popular journalism\". However, the ITC noted it \"was much lighter on international affairs and some major foreign events were not covered such as the Israeli/Palestine conflict\". The remarks echo claims made last year that Tonight with Trevor McDonald \"relies too heavily on celebrity interviews and lightweight social affairs issues\". And the ITC noted that only two documentaries - Paying the Price - the Killing of the Children of Iraq and Jonathan Dimbleby's Kosovo Journey - had been \"ITV's only substantial documentary treatments of current international issue\". Other single-issue documentary programmes were singled out for praise such as Christie's Story, about the treatment of a clinically obese woman. However, the ITC complained that too often the topics in these one-off documentaries were restricted to those similar to the main peaktime series - 'misbehaviour' of one kind or another, crime being a central preoccupation. \"ITV has proved it can deliver memorable documentary material and more landmarks in this genre would be welcome.\" ITV also came under fire over This Morning, with the ITC noting that its \"educational\" slots were \"overly preoccupied with leisure\". The ITC's annual report and accounts, with its annual performance review, comes on the eve of a major regulatory overhaul. The ITC has been criticised in the past for failing to stand up to ITV over a perceived decline in quantity and quality of factual programming. ITV has come under fire in the past two years for its decision to axe critically acclaimed current affairs programmes such as World in Action and First Tuesday. However, the network was praised for its continuing drama successes. \"The ability of ITV to satisfy audience appetites for popular quality drama on a consistent basis is one of its greatest strengths,\" the ITC said. And ITV bosses were complimented for their \"willingness to innovate\" in comedy with Barrymore's Bob Martin. Channel 5, which was notoriously branded Channel Filth by the Daily Mail last summer, came under attack for its X Certificate adult sex films. Channel 4 has been given fulsome praise for its programming but it was warned to keep separate accounts for any new services on the internet and in digital TV to ensure levels of investment in the station are sustained.

Dick van Steenis said he has pinpointed a corridor of sickness between the giant BP Amoco refinery at Grangemouth and the Kilroot power station in Ulster. Following his own investigations, he believes the effect of pollution from the two plants could be \"devastating\" within a 44-mile radius. Representatives for both plants say they have a clean track record when it comes to pollution and comply with legislation on emissions. Dr van Steenis, who has advised the House of Lords select committee on pollution, said he had mapped the pattern of emissions from the two plants which, he said, carry dangerous chemical particles across a wide area. \"If you look at a map of the patterns followed by plumes from these places it becomes abundantly clear that there's a problem,\" he said. \"The two plants could be responsible for the bulk of cancer cases in the areas they pollute. Cancer patterns can be di rectly linked to these plants and the line you can draw between them. \"Where the pollution grounds you are always going to have death and illness and in this case that means most of central Scotland.\" Dr van Steenis said poor diet and lifestyle were not enough to account for Scotland's appalling record of ill health and the plant emissions might explain health anomalies like a higher than normal incidence of prostate cancer in East Lothian and Glasgow's poor mortality rate.

The opening effort was halted abruptly after a minute on Saturday, when a clash brought Cambridge to a standstill as Oxford were being warned by the race's umpire, Rupert Obholzer. His decision to stop the race was an astute one. </p> <p>The rerun was a similarly tough, scrappy tussle, in which the light blues clawed back Oxford's slight advantage and locked the door as the crews passed under Hammersmith bridge. In the words of Harry Mahon, Cambridge's finishing coach, it was \"a winning row rather than a picture-book performance\". </p> <p>Earlier, Cambridge had won the toss and, perhaps surprisingly, chosen the Surrey station in full conditions where a short-cut on the Middlesex station might have been more advantageous. </p> <p>Obholzer warned the Cambridge cox Christian Cormack twice as clashing began at the start of the race. However, he then observed Oxford moving further towards Cambridge than they should have under the agreement made with both coxes to steer off the traditional \"centre of the tide\", even in these flood conditions that rendered the tide practically absent. </p> <p>Obholzer, who rowed for Oxford in 1990-91, said: \"As the words escaped my mouth, I noticed the Cambridge bow-man losing his blade. Oxford got a significant advantage out of that.\" </p> <p>The umpire raised his red flag and stopped the race. His options then were to allow Cambridge to sort themselves out and race to the end, to disqualify Oxford there and then, or to restart the race with the crews level. </p> <p>The first option risked an appeal from Cambridge, which would have resulted in Oxford being disqualified anyway. Nor did Obholzer want to disqualify a crew so early in the race, and thus become the first umpire in the race's history to order a disqualification. </p> <p>There was another clash soon after the second start, Cambridge receiving two warnings and Oxford four before the mile post was reached. Oxford again led by a couple of seats, but approaching Harrods Depository, Cambridge made a big push and took a half length lead with the prospect of the long Surrey bend in their favour. The stroke Tim Wooge suddenly found his stride while Oxford crouched over their oars, seemingly tight with tension. </p> <p>Cormack squeezed another half length by deft steering coming out of Hammersmith bridge. Oxford's cox Jeremy Moncrieff crossed to the inside of the bend, and Cormack countered with a move that put Oxford in Cambridge's wash. This went on for some time, with Oxford grimly and untidily hanging on and refusing to allow the light blues to lower their rating. </p> <p>From Chiswick there was no tide at all from which to take advantage, and both crews hugged the Middlesex bank past Dukes Meadows. They ventured out to pass through the centre arch of Barnes bridge, only to return to the side for the finish. Cambridge had more than three lengths' lead at the Meadows but the dark blues pulled it back to just over two at the finish, where Cambridge joyfully celebrated their recovery of the trophy lost last year. </p> <p>Sean Bowden, the Oxford coach, thought the umpire's decision to restart the crews level and nullify his team's early advantage was harsh, but he was full of praise for the way Cambridge rowed. </p> <p>Cambridge's chief coach Robin Williams paid tribute to \"a race full of drama and fight. That's what match racing is about - taking blows, giving blows, it was astonishing. Rupert Obholzer made a very quick decision to raise his flag and restart it. We had dropped out a length which we didn't deserve in that clash.\" </p> <p>Cormack also praised the umpire. \"Rupert had the most difficult job out there and I think he did exactly the right thing. I don't think a disqualification at that point would have helped anyone.\" The score since 1829 is now Cambridge 77, Oxford 69, with one dead heat. </p> <p> <strong> Boat Race times</strong> (Cambridge first, from restart)<strong> :</strong> Mile post: 2min43.20sec, 2.43; Hammersmith Bridge: 6.04, 6.06; Chiswick Steps: 10.17, 10.23.

Sean Bowden, the Oxford coach, thought the umpire's decision to restart the crews level and nullify his team's early advantage was harsh, but he was full of praise for the way Cambridge rowed. Cambridge's chief coach Robin Williams paid tribute to \"a race full of drama and fight. That's what match racing is about - taking blows, giving blows, it was astonishing. Rupert Obholzer made a very quick decision to raise his flag and restart it. We had dropped out a length which we didn't deserve in that clash.\" Cormack also praised the umpire. \"Rupert had the most difficult job out there and I think he did exactly the right thing. I don't think a disqualification at that point would have helped anyone.\" The score since 1829 is now Cambridge 77, Oxford 69, with one dead heat. Boat Race times (Cambridge first, from restart) : Mile post: 2min43.20sec, 2.43; Hammersmith Bridge: 6.04, 6.06; Chiswick Steps: 10.17, 10.23. Barnes Bridge: 14.26, 14.33. Finish: 17.44, 17.51; margin 2 lengths.",

      "bodyText": "Conservative plans to allow youngsters who fall behind in the \"basics\" of English and mathematics to skip other subjects in order to catch up were yesterday given a cool response by headteachers. In a speech in which he fleshed out the education policies to feature in the Tories' election manifesto, party leader William Hague accused Labour of treating teachers like \"recalcitrant incompetents\" and said it was time to stop the \"bullying\" they had suffered under Labour. As well as setting out details of how schools could simplify use of the national curriculum, Mr Hague reiterated Tory plans to allow every state school to become a \"free school\", receiving its funding direct from government and deciding how to spend it. Mr Hague told the annual conference of the Secondary Heads Association (SHA) in Newport, south Wales, it was wrong to force the youngsters to do the rest of the national curriculum while they were struggling with the basics. Mr Hague said: \"It is crazy ... that pupils who are struggling to read, write and add up are forced by the national curriculum to move on to other lessons, when the teachers who know them best think that it would be most useful to consolidate their literacy. \"That is why we would allow schools to exempt children who have not yet reached basic standards of literacy and numeracy from other requirements of the national curriculum, at least until they have caught up.\" He said it was extraordinary that a government which had put education at the top of its priorities should have helped to create the worst teacher shortages and recruitment in recent memory. John Dunford, general secretary of the SHA, criticised Mr Hague's proposed curricu lum cuts for lower achievers. He said: \"I think that is a misunderstanding of the nature of secondary education. I would not want them to be denied the richness and breadth of all the national curriculum subjects, particularly up to the age of 14.\" Other delegates at the conference agreed that it was important that youngsters were given variety, rather than being force-fed a limited range of subjects. Education secretary David Blunkett attacked Mr Hague's \"half-baked, ill-considered proposals\", saying they would leave another generation of youngsters on the scrapheap. \u0095 Seven out of 10 students in the first year of sixth form are taking four AS levels and 55% are taking new key skills qualifications, according to a survey by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service.

      "bodyText": "Channel 5 was slapped down again by the ITC in its annual performance review for breaching its programme code with \"unsuitable\" adult programmes. And the channel was warned that the rise of programme code breaches must not continue. Channel 5 received five interventions from the ITC in respect of three programmes, a rise of two on last year. The ITC warned that \"Channel 5 must take care that this upward trend does not continue\". The regulator singled out the late night series X Certificate, which was judged to have included inappropriate images from \"pornographic\" films. Dark Knight, Family Confidential and Movie Chart Show, were among shows deemed unsuitable for screening before the watershed. However, the ITC noted that Naked Jungle in particular had provoked more \"press comment\" than actual programme complaints. It also observed that Channel 5 had addressed the watchdog's concerns about a concentration of adult programming in the late evening after consultation with the regulator during the year. But the ITC added that it was still not entirely happy with the broadcaster's factual programming. \"A return to too much late night 'adult' programming was arrested but factual programming at times concentrated unduly on human interest, disasters and dysfunctional behaviour,\" it said. The ITC noted an example of \"undue prominence\" of Holsten Pils in an edition of a drama, Headless, in which very clear branding was visible. A spokesman said: \"These news themes dominate the agenda of national newspapers and it seems odd that we are criticised for reflecting this. \"In terms of adult programming, the ITC is referring to a small period in the channel's history.

      "bodyText": "ITV is losing its grip on the terrestrial TV market because of the growth in multi-channel television. The network's total share of the audience, including digital homes, fell from 31.2% in 1999 to 29.3% last year. Peaktime share also fell from 36.9% to 35.3% after a poor performance in the first half of the year, although an increase in popular programming spurred a recovery in the autumn. But the stand-out statistic was ITV's audience share in digital homes, which was 19% - a stark contrast to its overall audience. The digital figure underlines the importance of ITV's recent deal with Luxembourg-based Societe Europenne des Satellites. SES will broadcast ITV's programmes on a digital satellite platform, immediately boosting the digital reach and potential audience. Because ITV is not available on the digital platform outside ONdigital, viewers had been loath to switch from Sky Movies or the Discovery Channel to ITV on analogue. A low digital viewing figure has also worried advertisers, coming at a time when the network is experiencing an outright recession in advertising revenue.

      "bodyText": "Music journalist and broadcaster Stuart Maconie and Jim Shelley, the former Guardian Guide critic are believed to be in the frame to replace Charlie Catchpole as the Mirror's TV critic. Mr Catchpole, one of Fleet Street's most respected TV columnists, has defected to the Daily Express and Mirror bosses have reportedly moved fast to find a replacement. Mr Maconie, a former NME journalist, came to public acclaim when he co-presented a Radio 1 comedy programme with Andrew Collins. He has become ubiquitous on modern music television as a pundit, with regular appearances on youth and lifestyle programming, and writes a column in the Times. Mr Shelley, who created the Tapehead column in the Guardian Guide, now works as a freelance writer for a variety of newspapers and magazines, including the Mirror, the Mail on Sunday and James Brown's Hotdog. He writes soaphead once a month for the Guardian's guide. It is believed both have been approached on an informal basis about the role, a key one on the Mirror. But it is thought unlikely the new recruit will command the sort of wage that Mr Catchpole, a Fleet Street stalwart and former News of the World journalist, enjoyed. Mirror insiders say the post, which is a key role on the paper, is likely to be filled in the next two weeks. Related story Mar 19: Catchpole quits Mirror for Express",

      "body": "<p><strong>WE SUPPOSE WE HAVE TO MENTION ENGLAND</strong></p> <p>What a successful weekend for England it was. As everyone expected, Sven-Goran Eriksson's team thrashed minnows Finland out of sight by two goals to one. Not only that, they broke the wrist of the opposition's best player into the bargain (Jari Litmanen is out for six weeks and will miss Liverpool's big games against Manchester United, Barcelona, Wycombe and, er, Everton). Well done lads! In fact, with the team purring louder than a kitten tucking into a big plate of Sheba directly after indulging in a spot of frottage, moves are being made to tie down Sven's backroom staff to ensure continued success.</p> <p>Shoo-ins are Tord Grip (best mate), Ray Clemence (nothing better to do) and Dave Sexton (he won the FA Cup once over 30 years ago so he must know something). That leaves Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren. Taylor is likely to continue, because he's the big man at Leicester and can do what the hell he likes. But McClaren has a chippy Scotsman calling the shots at his club and, as the FA's agreement with United for his services runs out after the Albania game on Wednesday, needs his acquiescence if he is to continue in his role. Adam Crozier will meet Manchester United's Peter Kenyon at the end of the week to bag his man for the games against Mexico, Greece, Germany and Albania. And Greece.</p> <p>Meanwhile, visitors to Albania will be forced to walk on wet carpet when they turn up for the World Cup qualifier. Initially, the Fiver thought this was the \"backward\" country's zany way of getting its own back for being patronised by people who haven't even been there whining on about the state of their economy. But, in fact, it's all to do with preventing the spread of foot and mouth instead. \"They will all walk on disinfecting carpets and they will be searched for food,\" ministry spokesman Artur Galanxhi said. \"They will not be allowed to take any food into Albania.\" That should give certain tabloid journalists an excuse to work some thinly veiled racism into their \"articles\", if nothing else.</p> <p><strong>BIG CUP BUSINESS AS USUAL</strong></p> <p>Beep! Beep! Everybody loves a free ride, which is why the Fiver is hot-wheeling it around town in a car which isn't, strictly speaking, our own. Why, what nasty scoundrels we are! But are we any worse than those cruel journalists who erroneously suggested that Leeds could be given a bye to the semi-finals of Big Cup? Of course not. And we'll mow down any sucker that says otherwise.</p> <p>All too predictably, today came news that Deportivo La Coruna will not be kicked out of this season's competition - even if Emerson, Helder, Jacques Songo'o and Aldo Pedro Duscher are found guilty of passport irregularities. \"If the investigation in Spain finds the players are ineligible then they will have to be removed from Deportivo's squad,\" thundered Uefa's Mike Lee, briefly raising Leeds' hopes of a bye into the semi-finals. And then, like a classy lap-dancer (yes, there is such a thing), he quickly deflated their expectations. \"But there is no question of Deportivo being thrown out of the competition. The weekend news reports were simply inaccurate.\"</p> <p>Uefa's decision means that Leeds's key stage-four (OK, quarter-final) Big Cup appointment with Deportivo will go ahead next Wednesday, much to the complete non-surprise of chairman Pious Peter Ridsdale. Today he attacked the weekend reports as \"nonsense\" before adding: \"We want to get through to the semi-finals by winning against Deportivo. We're all geared up for the game now and we are preparing for the tie in the normal manner.\" Which the Fiver takes to mean a week of hard and rigorous training - and not a Mule and Bacardi Breezer-fuelled trip to the Majestyk.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I think one for Andy would be enough to set him on his way and I'm sure the whole country hopes he gets it.

Best, who was to have provided commentary for the BBC on Northern Ireland's World Cup game against the Czech Republic but pulled out citing continued ill health, was later spotted on \"a triple bender\" in pubs in Ballyhalbert and Donaghadee on the (drunk)Ards peninsula. Some reports even suggested that Best, the best player you never saw who wasn't Robin Friday, was even prepared to face death rather than give up the ale.</p> <p>But luckily, it seems these reports are a touch sensational. George has indeed been out on a massive session, but there is more optimistic news. \"George is not a stupid man. He will stop drinking.

His wife Alex is presently nursing George's sore head, but she did take time out to publicly beg him to cease. \"He realises now he cannot go on like this,\" she announced outside the family home in Portavogie, Co Down. \"He knows people are desperately worried and I just hope he is going to stop,\" Alex continued, before explaining that her errant hubby is feeling a lot better today: \"He had an early night, but is still in bed.\" Presumably lying on a half-eaten kebab.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Trevor Francis, Graeme Souness, Glenn Hoddle, Ruud Gullit and Alan Curbishley are the five names on the shortlist to replace George Graham at Tottenham, according to the London Evening Standard.</p> <p>Arsenal are ready to make a \u00a32m summer move for French goalkeeper Ulrich Rame, who plays for Bordeaux.</p> <p>Stefan Effenberg has admitted he fancies a move to England when his contract with Bayern Munich runs out in 2002. \"Playing in England is always in my thoughts,\" he said. \"The club must be in London.

      "body": "<p>The Conservative leader William Hague has sanctioned a party political broadcast depicting a group of eastern European immigrants attempting to enter Britain.</p> <p>The broadcast, which is being filmed in secret this week, calls for an unspecified number of \"eastern European\" speaking actors, aged between 25 and 70.</p> <p>Leaked papers from Conservative central office, seen by Guardian Unlimited, also demand a more British-sounding cast to play roles representing target Tory voters.</p> <p>They include a male sales rep in his 30s who drives a car, three elderly people and a \"warm and friendly\" female nurse in her 20s.</p> <p>Intriguingly, the script also calls for a male fruit vendor in his 30s, possibly based on a real-life model - Steve Thoburn, the Sunderland grocer who was adopted by the Tories as a cause celebre over his refusal to sell fruit and veg in metric measures.</p> <p>The filming requires a \"French-looking\" barman, suggesting that the plot of the party political broadcast will start on the continent before following the \"eastern European\" speakers to Britain.</p> <p>The party political broadcast is all the more remarkable since it is only two weeks since William Hague, along with the other leaders of the main political parties, signed a pledge promising not to use \"the race card\" during the election campaign.</p> <p>The pledge card, organised by the Commission for Racial Equality, committed the parties to discipline any activist or candidate who acts in a way \"likely to stir up racial prejudice.\" It was signed by the PM, Charles Kennedy, William Hague and the leaders of the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru.</p> <p>That pledge appears now to be under pressure from the very first election broadcast by the Conservatives.</p> <p>Conservative MP Ian Taylor said today that he hoped his party was not going to \"repeat the error of Harrogate\", where William Hague warned the Tory spring conference that Britain under a second Labour government would become a \"foreign land\".</p> <p>\"Mingling asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and hostility to the EU is standing on the wrong of the dividing line in the sand. If the Tory party wants to get re-elected we must realise the UK's problems are not the fault of asylum seekers.\"</p> <p>The leaked documents also reveal that all actors must consent in advance to appearing in an advertisement for the Conservative party. It states \"Please check that all suggestions are happy to play a character in a PPB for the Conservative party prior to suggesting them.\"</p> <p>Actors will be paid a flat fee of \u00a31,000 for a day's filming.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative leader William Hague has sanctioned a party political broadcast depicting a group of eastern European immigrants attempting to enter Britain. The broadcast, which is being filmed in secret this week, calls for an unspecified number of \"eastern European\" speaking actors, aged between 25 and 70. Leaked papers from Conservative central office, seen by Guardian Unlimited, also demand a more British-sounding cast to play roles representing target Tory voters. They include a male sales rep in his 30s who drives a car, three elderly people and a \"warm and friendly\" female nurse in her 20s. Intriguingly, the script also calls for a male fruit vendor in his 30s, possibly based on a real-life model - Steve Thoburn, the Sunderland grocer who was adopted by the Tories as a cause celebre over his refusal to sell fruit and veg in metric measures. The filming requires a \"French-looking\" barman, suggesting that the plot of the party political broadcast will start on the continent before following the \"eastern European\" speakers to Britain. The party political broadcast is all the more remarkable since it is only two weeks since William Hague, along with the other leaders of the main political parties, signed a pledge promising not to use \"the race card\" during the election campaign. The pledge card, organised by the Commission for Racial Equality, committed the parties to discipline any activist or candidate who acts in a way \"likely to stir up racial prejudice.\" It was signed by the PM, Charles Kennedy, William Hague and the leaders of the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru. That pledge appears now to be under pressure from the very first election broadcast by the Conservatives. Conservative MP Ian Taylor said today that he hoped his party was not going to \"repeat the error of Harrogate\", where William Hague warned the Tory spring conference that Britain under a second Labour government would become a \"foreign land\". \"Mingling asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and hostility to the EU is standing on the wrong of the dividing line in the sand. If the Tory party wants to get re-elected we must realise the UK's problems are not the fault of asylum seekers.\" The leaked documents also reveal that all actors must consent in advance to appearing in an advertisement for the Conservative party. It states \"Please check that all suggestions are happy to play a character in a PPB for the Conservative party prior to suggesting them.\" Actors will be paid a flat fee of \u00a31,000 for a day's filming. Each character is apparently only needed for one day's work, although actual shooting will last from March 26 to April 1. The major parties are allowed five broadcasts during the election campaign of five minutes each. Labour MP Fraser Kemp said: \"We need to know whether this election broadcast has been agreed by Michael Ancram, the party chairman, and in particular whether Andrew Lansley has been involved in its planning.\" Andrew Lansley, now the shadow cabinet office minister, wrote a piece for the Observer newspaper in 1995, which said: \"Immigration, an issue which we raised successfully in 1992 and again in the 1994 Euro-elections campaign, played particularly well in the tabloids and has more potential to hurt.

      "bodyText": "Misleading advertising is on the increase and the government is one of the biggest culprits, according to the Independent Television Commission's 2000 performance review. The ITC said over the course of last year there had been a marked rise in the number of adverts it considered to be misleading. And one of the worst offenders was a nursing recruitment advert put out by the government. The commercial, which claimed the average nurse earned \u00a320,000 a year, attracted 155 complaints, almost all of them from nurses. The ITC found the claim gave a misleading impression of nurses' salaries, with a substantial proportion of nurses earning considerably less than \u00a320,000. But the ITC upheld complaints about just four of the 10 most-criticised commercials. The commercial that attracted the most complaints was an advert for the energy drink Red Devil, in which footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones was shown luring a robin to its death. The ITC cleared the advert in spite of complaints from 390 viewers, who said it was in bad taste and encouraged cruelty to animals. The haka, the dance made famous by the New Zealand All Blacks national rugby team, was the focus of 116 complaints from viewers after it was parodied in an advertisement for the alcoholic drink Reef. The ITC upheld the complaints on the grounds the commercial could cause offence to Maoris because it associated the tribal dance with alcohol and showed it being performed by women, which goes against the Maori tradition. The total number of complaints upheld rose to 154 from 113 in 1999. The ITC said this was due mainly to the increase in misleading advertising, with 94 advertisers being censured for this reason.",

      "body": "<p>Jan Harlan thinks he must have had about 50,000 phone calls from Stanley Kubrick in a quarter-century as his executive producer. The director could be demanding, even difficult. But if the experience left him scarred, it doesn't show. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" Harlan says with a smile. \"He could be a bit of a dictator. But then he was also a genius. That surely means he had every right to be on occasion. And you could argue with him. It was sometimes like a ping-pong match. He generally won, as the better player usually does. But not always. And he was a surprisingly good loser. To me and to many others, he was a very warm and decent friend.\" Though Harlan doesn't mention the fact, Kubrick was a little more than that: for over 40 years they were brothers-in-law. </p> <p>Which is one reason Harlan was more furious than Kubrick when rumours went around about the film-maker's \"secretive\", \"hostile\" nature. Especially the one that had him taking potshots at inquisitive tourists wandering in his patch, then bribing them not to tell anyone. </p> <p>He isn't happy about the way the British press treated Kubrick over the last 10 years or so of his life - a kind of resentful hostility that sometimes pitched into outright aggression. But he admits that Kubrick may have brought it on himself by not dealing with the press at all. And he positively hated being asked why he chose his subjects or what his films were really about. \"For him it was like asking why he loved his wife.\" (The wife, by the way, is Harlan's sister Christiane, whom Kubrick married in 1957.) </p> <p>Harlan, who became Kubrick's executive producer on the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, has now made a three-part documentary called Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures. He rather agrees with Jack Nicholson, one of the many stars and movie-makers who pay Kubrick tribute in the film. \"He was the man. And I'm inclined to think that underrates him.\" He is anxious that his film should not be seen as a hagiography, although one of the few critical remarks is Woody Allen's statement that he was utterly baffled by 2001: A Space Odyssey the first time he saw it. </p> <p>Introducing a new 70mm copy of the film in London earlier this week, Harlan tried to help out. \"On a bad day Kubrick wouldn't answer the question. But on a good day I think he might have said the film was made by an ignoramus about the unknowable. He might have said - if he didn't think it was too pompous - that he wanted to take the audience into a place that he actually couldn't imagine himself all that well. He was really a self-taught and very learned man and he guessed that, even then, he knew very little. He wasn't at all religious but he had a very strong sense that there were mysteries, within and outside our world, that he could never begin to solve.\" </p> <p>This was Kubrick's modesty. His conceit was an obsessive desire to solve the mystery of making films, which was why he frequently took so long to shoot them. But though he often went wildly beyond schedule, notably with Eyes Wide Shut, he seldom went badly over budget. That was why Warner trusted him. They knew he would in the end provide something exceptional and that he would never abuse them financially. </p> <p>Actors felt the same way. He had the complete support of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman on Eyes Wide Shut. They never once complained, despite the length of the shoot. \"You see,\" Harlan says, \"actors invariably liked him, and I think he liked them. He gave them room to improvise and think their own thoughts about the part. OK, it's tiring doing 25 takes, but the point is that he was trusted.\" </p> <p>He hated bad films, but his enthusiasms could be boundless. He loved Tarkovsky's Solaris, a kind of metaphysical relation to 2001, but also the totally different films of the Spanish director Carlos Saura, particularly Blood Wedding, which he sat through again and again. </p> <p>His favourites included Heimat, Edgar Reitz's vast 15-hour film about the inhabitants of a remote German village, and Kieslowski's 10-part Decalogue. He was even persuaded to write the foreword to a book about the Polish director. The point is, Harlan says, he seldom stood as a judge on others, just on himself. </p> <p>What about those 50,000 telephone calls? \"Well, he was certainly no pushover. On the other hand, it's good to work for someone who actually wants to get things absolutely right. He'd often give you a whole list of questions and, if you couldn't answer one of them, he'd go on at you till you did. But you couldn't resent it, because you knew he should have asked them. He was the boss, and I was there to help him. If that sounds boring, I must say I had an amazingly good time working for him.\" </p> <p>German-born Harlan started working with the American Kubrick in 1969, despite having no knowledge of the film business.

      "bodyText": "Jan Harlan thinks he must have had about 50,000 phone calls from Stanley Kubrick in a quarter-century as his executive producer. The director could be demanding, even difficult. But if the experience left him scarred, it doesn't show. \"Yes,\" Harlan says with a smile. \"He could be a bit of a dictator. But then he was also a genius. That surely means he had every right to be on occasion. And you could argue with him. It was sometimes like a ping-pong match. He generally won, as the better player usually does. But not always. And he was a surprisingly good loser. To me and to many others, he was a very warm and decent friend.\" Though Harlan doesn't mention the fact, Kubrick was a little more than that: for over 40 years they were brothers-in-law. Which is one reason Harlan was more furious than Kubrick when rumours went around about the film-maker's \"secretive\", \"hostile\" nature. Especially the one that had him taking potshots at inquisitive tourists wandering in his patch, then bribing them not to tell anyone. He isn't happy about the way the British press treated Kubrick over the last 10 years or so of his life - a kind of resentful hostility that sometimes pitched into outright aggression. But he admits that Kubrick may have brought it on himself by not dealing with the press at all. And he positively hated being asked why he chose his subjects or what his films were really about. \"For him it was like asking why he loved his wife.\" (The wife, by the way, is Harlan's sister Christiane, whom Kubrick married in 1957.) Harlan, who became Kubrick's executive producer on the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, has now made a three-part documentary called Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures. He rather agrees with Jack Nicholson, one of the many stars and movie-makers who pay Kubrick tribute in the film. \"He was the man. And I'm inclined to think that underrates him.\" He is anxious that his film should not be seen as a hagiography, although one of the few critical remarks is Woody Allen's statement that he was utterly baffled by 2001: A Space Odyssey the first time he saw it. Introducing a new 70mm copy of the film in London earlier this week, Harlan tried to help out. \"On a bad day Kubrick wouldn't answer the question. But on a good day I think he might have said the film was made by an ignoramus about the unknowable. He might have said - if he didn't think it was too pompous - that he wanted to take the audience into a place that he actually couldn't imagine himself all that well. He was really a self-taught and very learned man and he guessed that, even then, he knew very little. He wasn't at all religious but he had a very strong sense that there were mysteries, within and outside our world, that he could never begin to solve.\" This was Kubrick's modesty. His conceit was an obsessive desire to solve the mystery of making films, which was why he frequently took so long to shoot them. But though he often went wildly beyond schedule, notably with Eyes Wide Shut, he seldom went badly over budget. That was why Warner trusted him. They knew he would in the end provide something exceptional and that he would never abuse them financially. Actors felt the same way. He had the complete support of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman on Eyes Wide Shut. They never once complained, despite the length of the shoot. \"You see,\" Harlan says, \"actors invariably liked him, and I think he liked them. He gave them room to improvise and think their own thoughts about the part. OK, it's tiring doing 25 takes, but the point is that he was trusted.\" He hated bad films, but his enthusiasms could be boundless. He loved Tarkovsky's Solaris, a kind of metaphysical relation to 2001, but also the totally different films of the Spanish director Carlos Saura, particularly Blood Wedding, which he sat through again and again. His favourites included Heimat, Edgar Reitz's vast 15-hour film about the inhabitants of a remote German village, and Kieslowski's 10-part Decalogue. He was even persuaded to write the foreword to a book about the Polish director. The point is, Harlan says, he seldom stood as a judge on others, just on himself. What about those 50,000 telephone calls? \"Well, he was certainly no pushover. On the other hand, it's good to work for someone who actually wants to get things absolutely right. He'd often give you a whole list of questions and, if you couldn't answer one of them, he'd go on at you till you did. But you couldn't resent it, because you knew he should have asked them. He was the boss, and I was there to help him. If that sounds boring, I must say I had an amazingly good time working for him.\" German-born Harlan started working with the American Kubrick in 1969, despite having no knowledge of the film business. Kubrick invited him to join him in Romania, where he was scouting locations for Napoleon - a subject the director had researched for years. But the film was never made because no one wanted to risk another historical flop after Sergei Bondarchuk's 1970 epic Waterloo. Both then came to live in England. Harlan says Kubrick fell in love with the country and wasn't simply attempting to escape from the constraints of Hollywood. \"That's why he was so upset when the press seemed to turn against him.\" So what's Harlan going to do next? \"Well, people say I should make my own films, but they forget one thing. You have to be talented - and I don't think I am. Whatever they say, film-making can't be done by committee. There has to be an autocrat around, and if he or she is no good, the film won't be either.

As wagon loads of dead sheep were tipped into the first mass grave dug by the army, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said more needed to be done to contain the disease quickly. He was speaking just 10 miles from an airfield at Great Orton in Cumbria, where a total of 1,200 carcasses were being buried. The disease has now spread to the heart of the Lake District, where park managers fear it could wipe out both the dramatic landscape and the farming and tourism industries. There are now 613 cases of foot and mouth after six more were confirmed today, said the ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food (Maff). Mr Brown made the appeal for vets during his visit to Cumbria, where he was heckled by demonstrators as he arrived in Carlisle for a meeting with farmers and their leaders. He said: \"We have already disposed of more animals in this disease outbreak than in the 1967 outbreak. There has been an enormous amount of work done already. \"We have been discussing how we can get the time from reportage to slaughter on the farm improved. That is a question of resources, especially veterinary resources,\" he added. Calling on vets worldwide to help Britain resolve the crisis, Mr Brown said the priority was to speed up the disposal process. As part of this, Maff has also changed the rules on the valuation of animals. Waiting for a valuation has often held up the slaughter process but, from now on, farmers will be given the option of receiving payments at a standard flat rate instead. The government is also considering the use of vaccination, but Mr Brown said this policy would only be pursued if it was recommended by Jim Scudamore, the chief vet. The army was also today being used in Wales for the first time, in an effort to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease. 60 soldiers have been called in to stop infected sheep mixing with healthy animals on common land at Hay Bluff, near Hay-on-Wye, close to the English border. A Welsh assembly spokesman said: \"Soldiers are patrolling the area to keep infected sheep within infected areas and keep uninfected sheep out of the area.\" What's going on?

      "bodyText": "The BBC used a combination of 2,000-year-old Jewish skulls and ancient religious images to generate what it claims is the first \"true-to-life\" picture of Jesus Christ. The first pictures, reminiscent of a police e-fit, were released today as part of a promotional push for a major new BBC1 religious series, Son of God. The BBC hopes the computer-generated images will become a major talking point and that the series will finally bury criticism by church leaders last year that the corporation had marginalised serious religious discussion. \"The image of Jesus we have today dates back to sixth century religious portraits,\" said producer Jean Claude Bragard. \"We also looked at Jewish faces from the first century to come up with this, \" he added. The image is strikingly different to the traditional idea of Jesus with long hair and a beard. \"The reconstruction provides the closest image of what this remarkable man may have looked like, \" said the BBC. Son of God, a three-part series, begins this Sunday at 9pm. The primetime scheduling will delight the critics who last year branded as \"trite\" the corporation's coverage of religion. The series also looks at the evidence to support other stories relating to Jesus's life including the last supper and the betrayal by Judas. \"It's not the face of Jesus, but how he is likely to have looked given the scientific information we've got,\" said Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC1. \"That's what people from that area of the world looked like at that time.\" Mr Bragard said there was evidence to support the myth of Jesus sweating blood on the cross, for instance. \"There are over 100 reported cases of people under extreme pressure who know they're going to die, on their way to the gallows or the gas chamber, they're sweating blood, \" he added. \"We looked at the scientific and archaeological evidence for the stories in the Gospels.\" The series will also look at the virgin birth and the betrayal of Jesus by Judas. The series will also feature computer-generated reconstructions of how places Jesus visited, including Jerusalem, would have looked in his time. Ms Heggessey said she might consider looking at other bible figures, including Moses, Joseph and King Herod in the same way. Ms Heggessey said she was running so many new dramas because she was looking for two or three \"long running franchises\". \"We hope to find two or three that can become long running franchises like Silent Witness.

      "body": "<p>Two years ago Jeremy Killinray completed a certificate in housing at the University of Westminster. But he says that although he enjoyed the course it didn't help to equip him for work as a tenant participation officer at the Royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea.</p> <p>The course he attended was constructed around the three core elements of housing: regeneration, housing finance and the history and context of housing management. \"I really enjoyed it but it didn't help me do my job any better or any differently. Knowing about policy is not something I touch on in my daily work. It didn't teach you how to deal with people on a day-to-day basis,\" he said.</p> <p>His comments are the latest in a long line of criticisms levelled at training and qualifications for housing professionals over the last few years. The government's policy action team on housing management called for improvements in training and professional standards as one of its eight main recommendations, while ministers Hilary Armstrong and Nick Raynsford have both been vocal in expressing concerns.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in January, the publication of the government's strategy for neighbourhood renewal included a pledge to set up a new national centre for neighbourhood renewal which would \"improve the training of public sector professionals and practitioners working in disadvantaged neighbourhoods\". Implicit is the charge that what is currently on offer isn't good enough.</p> <p>In fact, although the Chartered Institute of Housing denies that its accredited courses and training programmes haven't been up to scratch in the past, it clearly has been listening to the need for change and is nearly at the end of a two-year review of its professional qualification. The review, which will be completed next month, is being accompanied by an overhaul of the occupational standards which form the nuts and bolts of the courses, and promises to fundamentally alter the nature of what it is to be a housing manager.</p> <p>The impetus behind the review is not merely the ongoing criticism of the courses, but the realisation that the profession is in the midst of a profound change. The main drivers for this, according to Tim Taylor, visiting lecturer in housing at the University of Westminster, are the shift towards neighbourhood management and joined-up working emphasised by the government, combined with an increasing business focus among many housing professionals. In fact, said Mr Taylor, \"The big issue in housing is to what extent a strict housing qualification is going to become irrelevant in the future as we get into new agendas.\"</p> <p>Paul Smith, of the National Training Organisation for Housing, the body in charge of occupational standards, explained: \"The main changes are related to joined-up government. It's got to the point where the housing qualification can't be looked at on its own. In the past the housing manager did just that, managed housing - dealt with tenants, collected rent and looked after repairs. Now the onus is much more on tenant involvement and consultation as well as an expectation to work across disciplines and think about the environment, health and education.\"</p> <p>Martin Winn, head of the institute's education department, says the review was kicked off by the government's social inclusion agenda, which brought with it the introduction of neighbourhood managers and a greater emphasis on community regeneration.</p> <p>\"It's about getting local agencies to work together with the housing department, from the police to local schools. For example, the housing department should work with the police if properties on an estate become the focus for local drug dealers,\" he said.</p> <p>As a result, the new professional qualification will introduce new core units for inter-agency working and community regeneration, and will focus far more on project management, networking and empathising and understanding where other agencies are coming from.</p> <p>Greater weight will also be given to business management skills - essential, Mr Winn said, for a profession where even local authorities have to adhere to a more business-orientated approach to housing, driven by the introduction of the best value regime. </p> <p>However, now the issue for many in the profession is whether these changes will be sufficient to safeguard the role of housing manager, as that of neighbourhood manager gains in importance. At the same time, other changes in the job, both at the higher and lower end of the scale, are chipping away at the role. \"The idea that there's a standard job of housing manager will disappear,\" Mr Smith said. </p> <p>For example, at the bottom end the more onerous administrative tasks - such as dealing with the reporting of repairs - have been automated or are being dealt with by call centres. Meanwhile, at a more senior level the shift towards a business focus is beginning to attract a different type of professional, and often one without a housing background but one who has taken the MBA route instead. </p> <p>Mr Smith believes that the growing emphasis on neighbourhood managers will in many cases replace the purely housing function, with the neighbourhood manager acting as a housing manager who can also undertake a variety of other roles related to the local environment. But rather than a threat, he believes this can be an opportunity for housing managers, and sees them as well placed to step into the more challenging and high-status job of neighbourhood manager. </p> <p>As the institute tussles with the uncertain future role of the housing manager, doubts also remain over whether the changes in the professional qualification will answer the long-standing criticism that the degrees simply do not train students for the day-to-day problems they will encounter on the ground.</p> <p>Although Mr Winn said the new courses will focus more on communication skills and customer care, Gerard Lemos, from housing research consultancy Lemos and Crane, fears the degrees will continue to fall down on the people front. For him, despite the changes, the emphasis remains on accumulating a body of knowledge which has little bearing on how the newly-qualified housing graduate deals with tenants in stressful situations.</p> <p>\"This is driven by high level policy concerns rather than the ground level practical worries of frontliners, and it won't deal with the current interpersonal aspects which have been badly neglected. It's not going to make an impact on the day-to-day practice of being a housing manager,\" he said.</p> <p>If, as Mr Lemos warned, the new degrees merely replace a focus on one group of policy areas with a look at another, graduates' criticisms that the courses have little bearing on the job appear here to stay.</p>",

The course he attended was constructed around the three core elements of housing: regeneration, housing finance and the history and context of housing management. \"I really enjoyed it but it didn't help me do my job any better or any differently. Knowing about policy is not something I touch on in my daily work. It didn't teach you how to deal with people on a day-to-day basis,\" he said. His comments are the latest in a long line of criticisms levelled at training and qualifications for housing professionals over the last few years. The government's policy action team on housing management called for improvements in training and professional standards as one of its eight main recommendations, while ministers Hilary Armstrong and Nick Raynsford have both been vocal in expressing concerns. Meanwhile, in January, the publication of the government's strategy for neighbourhood renewal included a pledge to set up a new national centre for neighbourhood renewal which would \"improve the training of public sector professionals and practitioners working in disadvantaged neighbourhoods\". Implicit is the charge that what is currently on offer isn't good enough. In fact, although the Chartered Institute of Housing denies that its accredited courses and training programmes haven't been up to scratch in the past, it clearly has been listening to the need for change and is nearly at the end of a two-year review of its professional qualification. The review, which will be completed next month, is being accompanied by an overhaul of the occupational standards which form the nuts and bolts of the courses, and promises to fundamentally alter the nature of what it is to be a housing manager. The impetus behind the review is not merely the ongoing criticism of the courses, but the realisation that the profession is in the midst of a profound change. The main drivers for this, according to Tim Taylor, visiting lecturer in housing at the University of Westminster, are the shift towards neighbourhood management and joined-up working emphasised by the government, combined with an increasing business focus among many housing professionals. In fact, said Mr Taylor, \"The big issue in housing is to what extent a strict housing qualification is going to become irrelevant in the future as we get into new agendas.\" Paul Smith, of the National Training Organisation for Housing, the body in charge of occupational standards, explained: \"The main changes are related to joined-up government. It's got to the point where the housing qualification can't be looked at on its own. In the past the housing manager did just that, managed housing - dealt with tenants, collected rent and looked after repairs. Now the onus is much more on tenant involvement and consultation as well as an expectation to work across disciplines and think about the environment, health and education.\" Martin Winn, head of the institute's education department, says the review was kicked off by the government's social inclusion agenda, which brought with it the introduction of neighbourhood managers and a greater emphasis on community regeneration. \"It's about getting local agencies to work together with the housing department, from the police to local schools. For example, the housing department should work with the police if properties on an estate become the focus for local drug dealers,\" he said. As a result, the new professional qualification will introduce new core units for inter-agency working and community regeneration, and will focus far more on project management, networking and empathising and understanding where other agencies are coming from. Greater weight will also be given to business management skills - essential, Mr Winn said, for a profession where even local authorities have to adhere to a more business-orientated approach to housing, driven by the introduction of the best value regime. However, now the issue for many in the profession is whether these changes will be sufficient to safeguard the role of housing manager, as that of neighbourhood manager gains in importance. At the same time, other changes in the job, both at the higher and lower end of the scale, are chipping away at the role. \"The idea that there's a standard job of housing manager will disappear,\" Mr Smith said. For example, at the bottom end the more onerous administrative tasks - such as dealing with the reporting of repairs - have been automated or are being dealt with by call centres. Meanwhile, at a more senior level the shift towards a business focus is beginning to attract a different type of professional, and often one without a housing background but one who has taken the MBA route instead. Mr Smith believes that the growing emphasis on neighbourhood managers will in many cases replace the purely housing function, with the neighbourhood manager acting as a housing manager who can also undertake a variety of other roles related to the local environment. But rather than a threat, he believes this can be an opportunity for housing managers, and sees them as well placed to step into the more challenging and high-status job of neighbourhood manager. As the institute tussles with the uncertain future role of the housing manager, doubts also remain over whether the changes in the professional qualification will answer the long-standing criticism that the degrees simply do not train students for the day-to-day problems they will encounter on the ground. Although Mr Winn said the new courses will focus more on communication skills and customer care, Gerard Lemos, from housing research consultancy Lemos and Crane, fears the degrees will continue to fall down on the people front. For him, despite the changes, the emphasis remains on accumulating a body of knowledge which has little bearing on how the newly-qualified housing graduate deals with tenants in stressful situations. \"This is driven by high level policy concerns rather than the ground level practical worries of frontliners, and it won't deal with the current interpersonal aspects which have been badly neglected. It's not going to make an impact on the day-to-day practice of being a housing manager,\" he said. If, as Mr Lemos warned, the new degrees merely replace a focus on one group of policy areas with a look at another, graduates' criticisms that the courses have little bearing on the job appear here to stay.",

The news follows last week's announcement that 145 editorial jobs will be lost. Mr Young is the second high-profile journalist on the Express Newspapers newsdesk to have held talks with the management about voluntary redundancy. Earlier this week it was revealed news editor Sean Rayment has also discussed \"fast track\" redundancy with the management. It is believed Mr Young will leave the Express in four weeks. Mr Young is effectively the only staff journalist working exclusively for the Sunday Express newsdesk. He was not available for comment. The Express's managing editor, Lindsay Cook, said she would not comment on the situations of individual staff members. Late last week it emerged that Mike Allen, the paper's long-time head of sport, is also to leave the paper.

After the gallons of ink that have been spilt over bullfighting, Spain's real passion has finally been recognised in Phil Ball's entertaining book, Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football - a lively combination of history, politics, analysis and anecdotes.</p> <p>Most of the stories hinge on \"morbo\", a word which defies easy translation. It's not exactly rivalry, it's more the stuff that fuels it - edge, perhaps. Or needle. The thing about morbo, says Ball, is that it never dies. Instead, it grows ever bigger - each encounter adds yet more morbo. Paul Gascoigne's flute playing in an Old Firm game is a good example of the phenomenon, suggests Ball - Spaniards immediately understood it as a classic act of morbo.</p> <p>For Ball, morbo is rooted in Spain's extensive regionalism; in the different cultures, politics and identities of the Iberian peninsula. The importance of local, regional, and national identity for Spain's football clubs goes far beyond anything in England - Athletic aren't just Bilbao's team, they're the Basque national side, while Barcelona represent the nation of Catalonia (although Real Sociedad and Espanyol fans would certainly have a thing or two to say about that). Real Madrid, meanwhile, are a powerful symbol of centralism, and of Spanish nationalism against the independence of the periphery.</p> <p>Real Madrid versus Barcelona is, of course, the classic case of morbo, invested with a political significance greater than any match in the world. The two clubs' experiences are intimately tied to Spain's twentieth-century history, and they emerged from the civil war and the Franco dictatorship - or so it seemed to many - with fundamentally opposed, totally irreconcilable identities: Madrid as the friends of fascism and the pet of the Franco r\u00e9gime; Bar\u00e7a as the embodiment of liberty and democracy.</p> <p>These \"identities\" are deeply flawed, of course, and Ball's chapters on Bar\u00e7a and Real come as a timely corrective to Jimmy Burns' book \"Bar\u00e7a: A People's Passion\". Impressively researched though Burns's book was, it accepted these characterisations at face value. Indeed, it might as well, says Ball (and he is right), have been called \"Bar\u00e7a good, Madrid bad\". </p> <p>Ball is more convincing. He highlights some of the ways in which Real Madrid's success was utilised by Franco, and those occasions when the r\u00e9gime did indeed interfere to tilt the balance in Real's favour. But he rejects that favourite Bar\u00e7a allegation that the success of Madrid was built solely upon coercion, and pokes fun at the cul\u00e9s' triumphalist self-perception. \"Bar\u00e7a fans labour under the touchingly innocent belief,\" he says, \"that everyone else in the world is happy to accept that their club is quite simply the bees' knees.\"</p> <p>The Big Two aren't the only ones more realistically re-evaluated. Ball also explains how Athletic Bilbao's exclusively Basque tradition has only been maintained at the expense of the other clubs in Euskadi, which can no longer pursue such a policy and are more than a little aggrieved by Bilbao's monopolisation of Basqueness. And anyway, reveals Ball, back in 1901 Bilbao's vice-captain was an Englishman called Alfredo (Alfred?) Mills. So much for a Basque-only history. </p> <p> As well as chapters on Bar\u00e7a, Real and the Basque Country, Ball visits Recreativo Huelva - the oldest club in Spain - and Seville, where the morbo between Betis and Sevilla hinges not on regional identity, but social class (something which is also true of Real, Atl\u00e9tico, and Rayo Vallecano in Madrid). There's also an entertaining summary of the external symbols of football identity in Spain, and a brief history of the national side. Many of the fault lines here also opened up along regional boundaries - not least under Javier Clemente, whose favouritism towards Basques particularly riled the centrist football paper Marca.</p> <p>Morbo is an excellent account of Spanish football - the opening chapter in particular is a superb introduction to the game. It's nicely written, entertaining and insightful, but sometimes you wish Ball would go that little bit further (especially during his brief trip to Seville, where you sense his own disappointment at not personally encountering the morbo that undoubtedly exists). There's disappointingly little on the current champions Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a and Champions League finalists Valencia, and it would also have been interesting to have included some other incidents of morbo. Like Asturias, for example: when Oviedo play in Gij\u00f3n, their fans travel in blue workman's helmets. Not because they're Village People fanatics, either - this curious attire is an unfortunate necessity as the riot-police march fans from the station to the ground, a mile or so way, under a shower of bricks, bottles and stones. </p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, Ball doesn't really do justice to one of the most striking indications of Real Madrid and Barcelona's centrality. \"In some areas Real Madrid are warmly welcomed\", he says (in others, it's Bar\u00e7a), but he doesn't take this observation quite far enough. Just about every football fan in Spain, however much they love their own club, has an in-built preference for one of the Big Two. This is one of the most interesting manifestations of the relationship in Spain between football, politics, identity and (attitudes towards) regionalism, but it remains peripheral to the book. Examining this would have further underlined the extraordinary morbo-quotient of the Bar\u00e7a-Real clash which, as Ball impressively demonstrates, has never been just a game.</p>",

It found that 47% of students had felt they had no choice but to practice unnecessary procedures on comatose or unconscious patients or had been in other clinical situations that made them uncomfortable. Some reported being left to close wounds when they didn't know how, or being asked to lead psychotherapy sessions alone when they didn't have proper training.

      "body": "<p>Carl Barrowclough was handed the chance to follow in his father's footsteps yesterday and made his mark within minutes. </p> <p>The 19-year-old son of the former Barnsley and Newcastle winger Stewart Barrowclough emerged for his debut from the bench on 71 minutes and, 120 seconds later, he found himself being saluted by the Oakwell faithful when his surging run into the penalty area won the Tykes a crucial penalty. </p> <p>With the game perfectly poised at 1-1, the tricky Barrowclough was felled by Marcus Browning and Neil Shipperley promptly obliged from 12 yards for his 13th goal of the season. </p> <p>It was an amazing introduction to first-team football for the Barnsley-born youngster whose dad made 219 appearances for Newcastle United in the 70s. </p> <p>In many ways, that huge turning point almost overshadowed the fact that the born-again Christian Bruce Dyer helped himself to another double to take his recent haul to seven goals in five games. </p> <p>Dyer, who is still stalling on the offer of a new contract at Oakwell, has been in devastating form since the arrival of manager Nigel Spackman. </p> <p>He scored his first on nine minutes, steering home Isaiah Rankin's right-wing cross, and sealed the victory seven minutes from time when he crept in on the blind side to volley home Lee Jones's delivery. </p> <p>\"The ball is in Bruce's court,\" Spackman said, \"and we hope that he is happy here and enjoying his football.\" </p> <p>Perhaps more importantly, Spackman reckons his side are now safe from any relegation fears. \"That's 50 points and it should be enough,\" he said. </p> <p>\"My main aim when I took over was to keep the club up, and now we have reached that total I believe we should stay up, but today's was not our best performance.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the scoreline flattered Barnsley, who were troubled throughout by the gallant Gills. All the same, it was the Yorkshire outfit's sixth win in seven games and that has to be a huge relief for Spackman. </p> <p>\"All credit to the players,\" he added. \"I think we have achieved that safety target quite quickly and everyone has worked very hard to get there. </p> <p>\"We still want to finish as high as possible, but we can relax a bit now and look to build a stronger squad for next season. </p> <p>\"I may even decide to hand a few more youngsters a chance in the first team.\" </p> <p>Marlon King's perfectly executed header from Browning's cross levelled matters on 23 minutes, but Kevin Miller was in sparkling form and pulled off three stunning saves. </p> <p>\"I thought we did enough to get something out of the game,\" admitted the Gills player-manager Andy Hessenthaler. \"But we didn't perform to our capabilities, which was disappointing. </p> <p>\"The game could have gone either way and I didn't think their second goal should have been a penalty. Both my players are saying they didn't touch the player. If the referee didn't give it who knows what might have happened? </p> <p>\"I don't think we are safe yet, but 50 points should be enough for us.\" </p> <p>Miller, who was a team- mate of Hessenthaler at Watford, denied Gillingham on a number of occasions. But his flying save from King after seven minutes was the pick of the bunch. </p> <p>Iffy Onuora's right-wing cross was met by King, whose powerful header had seemed destined for goal. Miller, however, had other ideas, and his reflex stop low to his left was outstanding.</p>",

The 19-year-old son of the former Barnsley and Newcastle winger Stewart Barrowclough emerged for his debut from the bench on 71 minutes and, 120 seconds later, he found himself being saluted by the Oakwell faithful when his surging run into the penalty area won the Tykes a crucial penalty. With the game perfectly poised at 1-1, the tricky Barrowclough was felled by Marcus Browning and Neil Shipperley promptly obliged from 12 yards for his 13th goal of the season. It was an amazing introduction to first-team football for the Barnsley-born youngster whose dad made 219 appearances for Newcastle United in the 70s. In many ways, that huge turning point almost overshadowed the fact that the born-again Christian Bruce Dyer helped himself to another double to take his recent haul to seven goals in five games. Dyer, who is still stalling on the offer of a new contract at Oakwell, has been in devastating form since the arrival of manager Nigel Spackman. He scored his first on nine minutes, steering home Isaiah Rankin's right-wing cross, and sealed the victory seven minutes from time when he crept in on the blind side to volley home Lee Jones's delivery. \"The ball is in Bruce's court,\" Spackman said, \"and we hope that he is happy here and enjoying his football.\" Perhaps more importantly, Spackman reckons his side are now safe from any relegation fears. \"That's 50 points and it should be enough,\" he said. \"My main aim when I took over was to keep the club up, and now we have reached that total I believe we should stay up, but today's was not our best performance.\" Indeed, the scoreline flattered Barnsley, who were troubled throughout by the gallant Gills. All the same, it was the Yorkshire outfit's sixth win in seven games and that has to be a huge relief for Spackman. \"All credit to the players,\" he added. \"I think we have achieved that safety target quite quickly and everyone has worked very hard to get there. \"We still want to finish as high as possible, but we can relax a bit now and look to build a stronger squad for next season. \"I may even decide to hand a few more youngsters a chance in the first team.\" Marlon King's perfectly executed header from Browning's cross levelled matters on 23 minutes, but Kevin Miller was in sparkling form and pulled off three stunning saves. \"I thought we did enough to get something out of the game,\" admitted the Gills player-manager Andy Hessenthaler. \"But we didn't perform to our capabilities, which was disappointing. \"The game could have gone either way and I didn't think their second goal should have been a penalty. Both my players are saying they didn't touch the player. If the referee didn't give it who knows what might have happened? \"I don't think we are safe yet, but 50 points should be enough for us.\" Miller, who was a team- mate of Hessenthaler at Watford, denied Gillingham on a number of occasions. But his flying save from King after seven minutes was the pick of the bunch. Iffy Onuora's right-wing cross was met by King, whose powerful header had seemed destined for goal. Miller, however, had other ideas, and his reflex stop low to his left was outstanding.",

The NHS avoided a repeat of last year's winter crisis partly because there was no serious outbreak of flu - thanks to a 40% increase in the number of people vaccinated. Good joint working between health and social care and the extension of NHS Direct also contributed towards effective management of demand.

But he laughed off the windfall, claiming it was a \"giveaway price\" for such a \"fabulous\" company.

Wapworld, a mobile portal in which his broadcasting company 10 Alps has a 4% stake, has closed its web and wireless internet phone services, as it struggles to find second round funding. Today's deal comes a month after Deckchair cut a quarter of its workforce as part of a \"streamlining\" process. Thirteen staff were axed from the IT department of the former Boomtown Rat's website. After today's deal, World Travel - which is valued at around the same amount as Deckchair - will add Deckchair's 250,000 users to its own 85,000. Deckchair's name will remain and will be launched in North America, Asia and Europe. Following the tie-up, World Travel will own 90% or more of Deckchair, which in addition to the travel website includes London travel agency Soho Travel and traveller information provider Kasbah.com. Deckchair's shareholders will pick up \u00a33.2m in World Travel shares and options, while the remaining \u00a36m will be a deferred payment based on Deckchair's performance over three years.

As I intimated last week, half time/full time betting is not usually the first thing I look for when I reach for my Racing Post on a Saturday morning.</p> <p>But, backing heavy favourites to be drawing at half time and winning at the final whistle does seem to have some merit, especially at 4/1. England/England at 4/7 is clearly no value, and when the game means so much to both teams, the underdog will often perform with dogged defence for long periods before they are breached. If I had to back England for this match, this is the market I would have looked at.</p> <p>A good bet by the Prince for sure (although this is the first time I've been able to say that!) and a nice payout.

You won, but that doesn't mean you had a value bet. Personally, I couldn't quite see the logic behind this choice. I would agree Cyprus are a tough proposition at home, but criticising the Irish defence was somewhat baffling. They have averaged conceding just a single goal per game during the last six outings, and this included tough trips to Portugal and Holland.</p> <p>The Cyprus rearguard is certainly creaky, but the question I would have needed to answer before betting on four or more goals in this game was just how many times can I expect the Irish strikers to prosper here.</p> <p>The supposed minnows of European football no longer lay down before teams from more recognised countries, and defeats by six and more goals are a rarity these days.

Now, I'm sure my colleague Patrick Murray told you of the pitfalls of doing multiple bets rather than singles.

Indeed for all of Oxford's goalscorers it was a case of first time ever for the club while in Manny Omoyimni, who due to Phil Gray's absence with Northern Ireland began only his second game since September, they had the game's outstanding player. </p> <p>The striker, unable to re member when he had scored previously - it was in December 1999 when on loan at Scunthorpe, where he fled after West Ham's League Cup eligibility row - made the opener with a neat cross for Robert Quinn, scored two from distance, had a third disallowed and gave Rotherham the complete runaround. </p> <p>\"Manny was superb,\" said Andy Scott, who got the fourth with a header. \"He showed today exactly what he can do. Sometimes when we lose a goal our heads drop but today when they scored, we kept fighting. </p> <p>\"I was given assurances when I came here that the [new] ground was going ahead, more players would be coming in and that things would be looking up. But when you see something like that [Kassam's remarks], you wonder whether you were being told the truth or not. But unless things go completely wrong, I'm happy to be here.\" </p> <p>Scott will be as interested as any in the upshot of tomorrow's local council meeting, where what Kassam described as \"the legal fights\" that have hindered progress at the half-finished Minchery Farm will be discussed. Although the Manor site has been sold, the club's owner has threatened to pull the builders off the new site and withdraw financial support unless he gets the all-clear for the \u00a315m project which includes his baby, a multi-screen cinema, by Wednesday. </p> <p>For Rotherham a win would have put them 10 points ahead of third-placed Reading and a long way towards a second straight promotion. Instead they were forced into playing catch-up but left themselves too much to do despite close-range goals from Mark Robins, Guy Branston and Alan Lee. </p> <p>\"Our back three have been our strength this season but today we were really vulnerable,\" said Moore. \"We've got a similar game next week, Swindon at home, and if we go out with the same attitude we're going to get turned over.\" </p> <p>Oxford next feature at Cambridge tomorrow and while they probably care little for avenging the Boat Race result, a win would delay the inevitable relegation and perhaps belatedly help focus minds in the council chamber.</p>",

Instead they were forced into playing catch-up but left themselves too much to do despite close-range goals from Mark Robins, Guy Branston and Alan Lee. \"Our back three have been our strength this season but today we were really vulnerable,\" said Moore. \"We've got a similar game next week, Swindon at home, and if we go out with the same attitude we're going to get turned over.\" Oxford next feature at Cambridge tomorrow and while they probably care little for avenging the Boat Race result, a win would delay the inevitable relegation and perhaps belatedly help focus minds in the council chamber.",

In the process, Syria's young president, Bashar al-Assad, has ingratiated himself with Washington.</p> <p>The 500-mile pipeline, which runs from the Kirkuk oilfields to the port of Banyas on Syria's Mediterranean coast, was built in 1953 but shut down in 1982 when Syria quarrelled with Iraq. Last November, after a warming of relations between Syria and Iraq, there were reports that the pipeline had reopened and was being used to smuggle around 150,000 barrels of oil a day out of Iraq.</p> <p>Under sanctions, oil exports from Iraq are illegal unless the revenue from sales is channelled through the UN's oil-for-food programme. Revenue from smuggled oil, on the other hand, goes directly to the Baghdad regime - \"to purchase their luxuries and not to the Iraqi people,\" as the British Foreign Office puts it.</p> <p>Syria and Iraq apparently thought they had found a loophole in the sanctions rules, because the plan was not to sell the Iraqi oil directly on the open market. Instead, Syria would buy the oil at half price ($10-$15 - \u00a37-\u00a310 - a barrel) and refine it for domestic use. This, in turn, would allow Syria to export an equivalent amount of its own oil at full price to the Mediterranean market.</p> <p>As a result, Iraq could claim that its arrangements with Syria were no different from those with two other neighbours - Jordan and Turkey - which are already allowed to receive Iraqi oil outside the oil-for-food programme.</p> <p>Western diplomats would have none of it. They argued that, although the oil supplies to Jordan and Turkey are technically illegal, the quantities involved are small and so nothing has been done to stop them.</p> <p>The Iraqi-Syrian ploy was a different matter because, if successful, it would have doubled the volume of Iraq's illegal oil exports at a stroke. In fact, neither Syria nor Iraq confirmed that the pipeline had reopened; they maintained that it was simply being tested.</p> <p>However, they were certainly not testing it with water, and, in the inimitable language of the Foreign Office, the quantities of oil involved were \"inconsistent with testing\".</p> <p>Oil industry sources believe that around 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) were passing through the pipeline. The giveaway was Syria's oil exports, which increased dramatically in December and continued to rise through January and February.</p> <p>According to Petroleum Argus, which monitors oil shipments around the world, loadings at Banyas during February included 340,000 bpd of Syrian light crude (50,000 up on last year) and 160,000 bpd of Suweidi crude (double the customary amount).</p> <p>Given that Syria produces only about 560,000 bpd of its own oil, this increase could only be accounted for by use of the Iraqi pipeline. Iraq, meanwhile, declared the ageing pipeline useless and said that a new one would have to be built.</p> <p>There are also claims that Iraq is delivering fuel oil by rail to a new 600-megawatt power station in Syria, east of Aleppo. Running the power station at full capacity would require about 30,000 tonnes of oil per week. The Foreign Office says that it is aware of the reports of rail deliveries from Iraq but cannot confirm them.</p> <p>At the end of February, Colin Powell met President Bashar in Damascus and challenged him about the pipeline. After the meeting, Mr Powell announced that the Syrians \"plan to bring the pipeline and what is going through the pipeline, and revenues generated in that pipeline to be under the same kind of control as other elements of the sanctions regime.\"</p> <p>Mr Powell said that Mr Bashar had repeated this undertaking three times but Syria made no public comment whatsoever. The consensus among observers was that if Mr Bashar had indeed made such a promise he probably had no intention of keeping it.</p> <p>The word \"plan\" in Colin Powell's statement hinted that Syria might wriggle out of implementation. What nobody (except perhaps Mr Powell) expected was that the pipeline would be shut down immediately. But that is what appears to have happened.</p> <p>Last Friday, Charlotte Bloom, who tracks Syrian oil for Petroleum Argus, said the provisional export figures for March show a sudden drop - back to last year's levels before the pipeline reopened.</p> <p>But could Syria simply be stockpiling the Iraqi oil? Ms Bloom thinks not. The Syrians do not have enough storage capacity, she says. The obvious conclusion is that someone has turned the taps off. The intriguing question is why.</p> <p>From the Syrian point of view it was a win-win situation. Reopening the pipeline was worth a try because, if nobody objected strongly, Syria would gain around $1.5m a day. That is a useful sum for a poor country, though not worth going to the wall over.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, there were objections, Syria could graciously agree to stop - and claim political rewards for doing so.</p> <p>President Bashar's handling of the affair has certainly moved Syria along the road to rehabilitation in the eyes of the west, and may help to earn it a rotating seat on the UN security council.</p> <p>On the economic side, Syria can also look forward to an expansion of its legitimate trade with Iraq once the new \"smart\" sanctions take effect. In the long run, this will probably be more valuable than any short-term gains from illicit use of the pipeline.</p> <p>All in all, the episode shows that Mr Bashar is a lot more astute than most people imagined he would be when he suddenly came to power following his father's death last June.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:brian.whitaker@theguardian.com\"> brian.whitaker@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,180403,00.html\">Iraq</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yemen/0,2759,193338,00.html\">Yemen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/The_Kurds/0,2759,192981,00.html\">The Kurds</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28brian+whitaker%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=brian+whitaker&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Brian Whitaker</a> <br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.petroleumargus.com/\" target=\"_new\">Petroleum Argus</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.un.org/Depts/oip/\" target=\"_new\">UN oil for food programme</a></p>",

But will they be as determined this time? Or will most regard William Hague, Ann Widdecombe and Co as less of a threat to be stopped than a joke to be ignored? Some in both Labour and Lib Dem ranks almost wish the Tories were punching stronger in the opinion polls: that way, at least fear of a Conservative comeback might persuade people to vote tactically. Otherwise, people might simply follow the old habits and vote along tribal lines - splitting the progressive camp and handing the Tories a bucketful of seats they should have lost.</p> <p>But a second obstacle has always been distrust between the parties on the ground. Even if an anti-Hague mood is there, it can't be exploited if Labour and Lib Dem fight each other. Tacitly they need to agree to stay out of each other's way, running a non-campaign in those seats where the other party could beat the Tory. That is why last week's agreement between Tony Blair and Charles Kennedy on proportional representation is to be welcomed. If the prime minister had bowed to the anti-reformers in his own cabinet - Gordon Brown, Jack Straw and John Prescott - then Mr Kennedy would have struggled to restrain the Lib Dem foot soldiers whose hostility to Labour, particularly in the northern cities, is deep. As it is, he now has enough of a deal to persuade his troops to maintain the cooperation which is surely their only path to success.</p> <p>Besides the tactical voting calculation, how will the Blair-Kennedy accord affect the wider cause of Westminster reform? PR advocates will be relieved that the issue has at least been spared the oblivion Mr Prescott and friends clearly wished for it. But there is not much else to celebrate. For all Labour has agreed to is a review in 2003 at the earliest - after the PR systems in Wales and Scotland have run for a full electoral cycle. Then there will be an assessment and only after that a referendum. As with the euro, Labour has built a double fence between now and any change: review, followed by plebiscite. That is quite a hurdle to leap.</p> <p>What's more, like the single currency, Labour's move delays not only the decision but any campaign. The only way to win a referendum on either the euro or PR is through a sustained campaign for hearts and minds. Such an effort would have to begin now. Instead, it will be delayed.

But it is to the best of Europe that Britain should look. </p> <p>Over the past 20 years America and Europe have grown prosperity at almost exactly the same rate (the US at 1.81%, the EU at 1.89%), but the US was about 20% ahead of the European average 20 years ago and is ahead by almost the same amount today. Almost all of this advantage stems from more hours worked not from greater efficiency. Some of those extra hours worked result from lower American unemployment - and Europe should learn from the US ability to create jobs for low-skill employees. But much of the difference stems from a different social trade-off between income and leisure. The purpose of economics is to understand such trade-offs and to help make them as efficiently as possible, not to deny their possibility. The best measure of efficiency is productivity per hour worked, and on that measure France, Germany and several other European countries perform as well as the US. </p> <p>That performance is achieved despite two fundamental US advantages - low population density and a large single market. Low population density makes possible looser planning rules, lower land prices and more expansive physical development, and that in turn has a pervasive effect on attainable productivity. It is far easier to achieve high productivity on greenfield sites connected by free-flowing roads than in brownfield sites linked by congested roads. </p> <p>Europe's higher population density imposes an economic cost which it can chose to accept either in lower productivity or in a degraded environment, but which it cannot avoid. America's homogeneous culture, single language and single currency make it possible for an American company to serve a market of 270m consumers with one advertising campaign, one set of sales literature, one accounting system, etc. Take the two advantages, and America ought, if other factors are equal, to achieve productivity significantly above European levels. </p> <p>Other factors, however, are not equal, for European countries tend to offset America's inherent advantages in two ways. First through high levels of capital investment both within private business and in public infrastructure. Both the US and leading European countries have much larger capital stock per employee than Britain, and Britain cannot match their productivity without increased investment. For all the fashionable talk of knowledge-based economies productivity growth depends on investing in machines which automate previously manual processes. But French and German capital stock per employee is above even US levels. </p> <p>Secondly continental countries tend on average to have better workforce skills. The US performs well in international comparisons of elite education, but along with Britain, suffers from a long tail of low educational attainment. Achieving these higher skills and higher investment entails costs. But it is the only route by which Europe can achieve comparative levels of productivity per hour worked. </p> <p>The high investment European model is the more relevant one for Britain. That does not deny attractive features of the American approach from which many European countries should learn and already are learning. Its more flexible labour market creates more jobs.

The most nervous of the arriving nominees appears to be best actress hopeful Juliette Binoche, resplendent in a retro 20s get-up, who greets each question with a hysterical giggle. Meanwhile Hollywood pros Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts cut calmer figures. An icily efficient Kate Hudson seems barely fazed by the occasion. She admits to having been given some advice by her mum, Goldie Hawn (herself a best supporting actress Oscar winner for 1969's Cactus Flower): \"To have fun, and just enjoy every moment of it.\" Chances are that she will. Hudson is the bookie's favourite to take the best supporting actress for her role in Almost Famous. </p> <p><strong>6.45pm:</strong> The Academy Awards deliver the night's first big surprise as <strong>Marcia Gay Harden</strong> beats off strongly fancied Kate Hudson to win the <strong>best supporting actress</strong> Oscar for her role in Pollock. Moments earlier Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon won what could prove the first of numerous awards when Tim Yip picked up the statuette for <strong>best art direction</strong>.</p> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> Russell Crowe presents the Oscar for <strong>best editing</strong> to Stephen Mirrione for Traffic. No sooner has the stage cleared than Ben Stiller hands the award for <strong>best animated short</strong> to the Mexican film <strong>I Want to Be</strong> and the <strong>best animated short</strong> Oscar to <strong>Father and Daughter</strong>.</p> <p><strong>7.15pm:</strong> Hollywood shores up its glamour credentials as first Penelope Cruz (dressed in black) and then Angelina Jolie (clad in white) step up to present awards. Britain's Janty Yates wins the Oscar for <strong>best costume design</strong> for her work on <strong>Gladiator</strong>. To nobody's great surprise, heavy favourite <strong>Benicio Del Toro</strong> is named best supporting actor for his role as a Mexican cop battling political corruption in Traffic. In the race for the most statuettes, Traffic now takes the lead with two nods. But the night is yet young.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm:</strong> Ten minutes can be a lifetime on Oscar night. <strong>Gladiator</strong> pulls back level with Traffic by taking its second award of the night for <strong>best sound</strong>. The true-ish second world war saga <strong>U-571</strong> picks up the cousin award for <strong>best sound editing</strong>.</p> <p><strong>7.35pm:</strong>Technician Peter Pau pushes his 45-second time limit to the wire in accepting his <strong>best cinematography</strong> gong for <strong>Crouching Tiger</strong>, which now sits in a three-way tie on two Oscars apiece with rivals Traffic and Gladiator. Pau's breathless speech wraps up with a last gasp thank you to \"Chinese people all over the world\".</p> <p><strong>7.50pm:</strong> Hollywood delves into its history to celebrate the achievements of legendary British cinematographer <strong>Jack Cardiff</strong> (Black Narcissus, The African Queen) by presenting him with an honorary Oscar. \"This has to be a dream,\" Cardiff told the assembled throng. \"There's an awesome air about it.\" Moments earlier a faintly deflated-looking Kate Hudson took the stage to give the Oscar for <strong>best make-up</strong> to <strong>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</strong>.</p> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> Gladiator edges ahead by taking its third Oscar of the night - a nod for <strong>best visual effects</strong>. Big Mama wins <strong>best documentary short</strong> while the acclaimed Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport wins for <strong>best documentary feature</strong>. Meantime, Steve Martin appears to be relaxing into his role as the event's host. \"The police have found a suspect in the plot to kidnap Russell Crowe,\" he announces with glee. \"Tom Hanks, you should be ashamed of yourself.\" Seated in the audience, Hanks play-acts the guilty man.</p> <p><strong>8.35pm:</strong> Anthony Hopkins presents the Irving Thalberg memorial award to \"one of the most fascinating producers of all time\", Italian-born <strong>Dino De Laurentiis</strong>, the mogul behind a string of productions that range from the sublime (La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, Blue Velvet) to the ridiculous (Conan the Barbarian, the remake of King Kong). \"I thank you, Tony,\" quips Dino. \"You are a fantastic guy... Let me dedicate this to the Italian film industry.\" Earlier, Crouching Tiger pulled level with Gladiator (three awards) as composer Tan Dun won <strong>best original score</strong>.</p> <p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> In what could be a highly significant decision, Crouching Tiger receives the <strong>best foreign language film</strong> Oscar. The award nudges Ang Lee's Taiwanese epic into the lead with four Oscars, but it could count against it in the long run. Having honoured Crouching Tiger as the best foreign language picture, has the Academy now cleared the way for Gladiator to take the crucial best film Oscar?</p> <p><strong>9.05pm:</strong> A dazed looking <strong>Russell Crowe</strong> staggers on stage to wild applause to take the <strong>best actor</strong> Oscar for his turn in Gladiator. \"Really folks, I owe this to one bloke and his name is Ridley Scott,\" says the actor. With Crowe's win, the momentum appears to be slowly swinging behind Scott's Roman saga. Minutes earlier, Bob Dylan materialised via satellite link-up from Australia to accept his Oscar for <strong>best original song</strong> (Things Have Changed, from Wonder Boys). \"God bless you all with peace, tranquility and goodwill,\" chirruped gravelly Bob.</p> <p><strong>9.25pm:</strong> In the night's most glittering non-surprise, Julia Roberts wins the <strong>best actress</strong> Oscar for Erin Brockovich. A hyperventilating Ms Roberts pays tribute to her fellow nominees and thanks all those involved with the film, paying particular tribute to director Steven Soderbergh. \"Turn that clock off, it's making me nervous,\" snaps Julia before breaking into wild laughter: \"I love it up here... I love the world! I'm so happy!\" Needless to say, her speech runs heavily over schedule. Needless to say, nobody seems to mind.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm:</strong> Losing nominee Tom Hanks hands the Oscar for <strong>best adapted screenplay</strong> to Stephen Gaghan for <strong>Traffic</strong>. The award for <strong>best original screenplay</strong> falls to Cameron Crowe for <strong>Almost Famous</strong>. \"I dedicate this to all musicians that inspire us,\" says Crowe.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm:</strong> In what may rank as the night's biggest surprise, <strong>Steven Soderbergh</strong> won the <strong>best director</strong> Oscar for Traffic, beating off joint favourites Ridley Scott and Ang Lee. Many insiders thought that Soderbergh's two best director nominations - the other one was for Erin Brockovich - would split the vote. In the event, he took the stage to the night's most prolonged and enthusiastic applause.</p> <p><strong>9.50pm:</strong> The Academy hands its biggest award to <strong>Gladiator</strong> as Ridley Scott's Roman actioner takes the Oscar for <strong>best picture</strong>. The movie's producers pay tribute to \"that gentleman genius\" Ridley Scott, who conspicuously failed to win the best director gong. \"I know what you're thinking,\" quips Steve Martin. \"Just when you're getting into it, it's over.\" And with that the 73rd Academy Awards ceremony draws to a close.

The last administration bobbed and weaved with Beijing, getting worked up about human rights then cooling down as the lure of commerce returned.

To the victor, his own empire.</p> <p>An overtly imperialist US? We aren't used to thinking in such terms, for how - in the rhetoric - can we fear this supposed freedom? The worries of the decade past have been of American isolationism, not expansionism. But Rumsfeld and Cheney are boxing that circle. The power they outline for the future is vast, but long-range.

He does not want arguments. We must understand who calls the shots - and if, along the way, we get windy about missile defence and want Moscow squared, then we can take a hike. Meanwhile, Putin gets the tough guy treatment.</p> <p>There is, frankly, an unpleasant swagger to all of this. It was not the Clinton style; that was earnest, detailed involvement - which sometimes bore fruit and sometimes failed, but always tried to consult and debate. This is issuing orders.</p> <p>Maybe it won't, in every respect, endure for long. Colin Powell's efforts to change Iraq sanctions or keep talking to North Korea reveal some countervailing wisdom whose time may eventually come. The need to keep Russia's nuclear rundown moving must exert its own pressures. The foundering of Clinton's economic miracle may soon deflate swagger.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mr Rumsfeld is telling us something that we - in Europe or in what we fondly call the special relationship - need to register. We are not the centre of this White House's universe. We have drifted towards bit parts on the peripheries. And what we do about it, in meek acquiescence or rediscovered independence, is down to us.

      "body": "<p>London Underground has deteriorated so much that safety is now a concern, Ken Livingstone's transport commissioner Bob Kiley told the Guardian yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Kiley, speaking after talks on the future of the system collapsed again, said: \"There comes a point with the physical deterioration and the level of management distraction where safety rears its head.</p> <p>\"It is getting as bad in a hurry as the New York City subway when I took it over and that was tipping into the abyss of unsafety.\"</p> <p>The failure of the government negotiators and Mr Kiley to reach a deal on the plans to part-privatise the tube leaves Tony Blair facing the prospect of a damaging judicial review in the run-up to a general election.</p> <p>Mr Kiley said that the talks broke down on Friday night when the government withdrew several concessions it had made over its public private partnership plan (PPP).</p> <p>Mr Kiley - brought in by Mr Livingstone, London's mayor, to turn around the Underground - said: \"The government is just not going to move. The problem is there has been no investment in it as far as living memory can recall and that has to change.</p> <p>\"They have a proposal but it is a dumb proposal and we are trying to get it back into the land of the sane.\"</p> <p>Under the PPP, private infrastructure companies have been bidding for contracts to renew and maintain the system while the running of the trains remains in the public sector. Mr Kiley has said that without unified management control, and in particular without full management control of maintenance, the PPP would not only be prohibitively expensive but dangerous, repeating the mistakes of rail privatisation which led to the Hatfield disaster.</p> <p>He told the Guardian that the government had withdrawn concessions which gave him power over appointments to the boards of the private contractors and influence over priorities in maintenance. He said that, contrary to the deputy prime minister, John Prescott's allegations, he had made no new demands in the last 10 days.</p> <p>\"I wish I could understand why they would have offered these things, if they were going to withdraw them, other than perhaps to keep us quiet,\" he said. He thought his team could wait only until tomorrow before turning to a judicial review.</p> <p>The cost of the delays also became apparent during the weekend. The private consortiums bidding for the PPP contracts have access to a government \"compensation fund\" to help meet the costs of bidding - and the Guardian has learned that the fund has now been increased to about \u00a340m.</p> <p>The Treasury insists that the risk associated with major capital investment projects must be transferred to the private sector. But during negotiations it conceded that public subsidy of an average of \u00a31bn a year will be needed over the next seven and a half years.</p> <p>Mr Kiley, although strongly opposed to the PPP finance plans, made concessions on those points. \"The Treasury had a dream at the beginning of this PPP having no exposure for the government. But of course it's mostly not private money,\" he said.</p> <p>Sources close to Mr Livingstone blamed the private bidders for putting the government under intense pressure over the concessions. Mr Kiley said he thought the bidders were frustrated but unlikely to walk away since that would make them ineligible for money from the compensation fund.</p> <p>Mr Prescott said on Breakfast with Frost yesterday that talks had broken down because Mr Kiley had made new demands and that he was waiting for a letter from Mr Kiley about the state of negotiations.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \"We have had nearly 100 meetings over the last six weeks, with very intensive negotiations, and he has bought some things to the table very late in the day that we cannot accommodate.\"</p>",

Mr Kiley, speaking after talks on the future of the system collapsed again, said: \"There comes a point with the physical deterioration and the level of management distraction where safety rears its head. \"It is getting as bad in a hurry as the New York City subway when I took it over and that was tipping into the abyss of unsafety.\" The failure of the government negotiators and Mr Kiley to reach a deal on the plans to part-privatise the tube leaves Tony Blair facing the prospect of a damaging judicial review in the run-up to a general election. Mr Kiley said that the talks broke down on Friday night when the government withdrew several concessions it had made over its public private partnership plan (PPP). Mr Kiley - brought in by Mr Livingstone, London's mayor, to turn around the Underground - said: \"The government is just not going to move. The problem is there has been no investment in it as far as living memory can recall and that has to change. \"They have a proposal but it is a dumb proposal and we are trying to get it back into the land of the sane.\" Under the PPP, private infrastructure companies have been bidding for contracts to renew and maintain the system while the running of the trains remains in the public sector. Mr Kiley has said that without unified management control, and in particular without full management control of maintenance, the PPP would not only be prohibitively expensive but dangerous, repeating the mistakes of rail privatisation which led to the Hatfield disaster. He told the Guardian that the government had withdrawn concessions which gave him power over appointments to the boards of the private contractors and influence over priorities in maintenance. He said that, contrary to the deputy prime minister, John Prescott's allegations, he had made no new demands in the last 10 days. \"I wish I could understand why they would have offered these things, if they were going to withdraw them, other than perhaps to keep us quiet,\" he said. He thought his team could wait only until tomorrow before turning to a judicial review. The cost of the delays also became apparent during the weekend. The private consortiums bidding for the PPP contracts have access to a government \"compensation fund\" to help meet the costs of bidding - and the Guardian has learned that the fund has now been increased to about \u00a340m. The Treasury insists that the risk associated with major capital investment projects must be transferred to the private sector. But during negotiations it conceded that public subsidy of an average of \u00a31bn a year will be needed over the next seven and a half years. Mr Kiley, although strongly opposed to the PPP finance plans, made concessions on those points. \"The Treasury had a dream at the beginning of this PPP having no exposure for the government. But of course it's mostly not private money,\" he said. Sources close to Mr Livingstone blamed the private bidders for putting the government under intense pressure over the concessions. Mr Kiley said he thought the bidders were frustrated but unlikely to walk away since that would make them ineligible for money from the compensation fund. Mr Prescott said on Breakfast with Frost yesterday that talks had broken down because Mr Kiley had made new demands and that he was waiting for a letter from Mr Kiley about the state of negotiations. A government spokesperson said: \"We have had nearly 100 meetings over the last six weeks, with very intensive negotiations, and he has bought some things to the table very late in the day that we cannot accommodate.\"",

      "body": "<p>Richard Taylor spent 23 years working at Kidderminster hospital in Hereford and Worcester. Now he paces its grounds pointing at buildings that are being gutted or mothballed.</p> <p>The hospital is being down-sized under NHS plans which promise to raise standards of care. But the plans have evoked fierce resistance from a diehard band of campaigners who call themselves Health Concern.</p> <p>Two years ago, Health Concern stopped the futile business of raising petitions and took to the ballot box.</p> <p>It was a last resort and it worked. They won seven seats in elections to Wyre Forest district council, which covers the towns of Kidderminster, Stourport-on-Severn and Bewdley.</p> <p>\"I'll never forget the feeling when the first result came up,\" Dr Taylor recalled. \"We suddenly realised that it was possible. That evening was absolutely electric.\"</p> <p>Last year they took another 11 council seats, making them the largest member of the ruling Rainbow Alliance, and reducing the Labour vote to less than 20%.</p> <p>Now Dr Taylor, 66, a retired consultant, is challenging Labour incumbent David Lock, who took Wyre Forest with a majority of nearly 7,000 in the 1997 landslide. Mr Lock is understandably anxious.</p> <p>The MP, a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor's department, whose wife practises as a GP locally, accuses Health Concern of distorting the facts to whip up alarm among the voters of Kidderminster.</p> <p>\"Local people are not taken in by campaigners who try to pretend they know more about the health service than doctors, nurses and the health authority,\" he insisted.</p> <p>Dr Taylor appeals to tradition, with all the patriarchal dignity of the old-style consultant.</p> <p>\"The hospital is woven into the fabric of Kidderminster life,\" he said. \"There has been a hospital here since 1920. It has been supported by the people all the way through - the [hospital's] League of Friends has raised between \u00a32.5m and \u00a33m in the last decade.\"</p> <p>Last September, Kidderminster's accident and emergency facilities were downgraded to a minor injuries unit. Its in-pa tient facilities were closed. This meant that any blue light emergency cases would have to travel 18 miles to Worcester royal infirmary.</p> <p>In February that decision had fatal consequences when a pensioner, John Jones, who lived five minutes from Kidderminster hospital, had a heart attack.</p> <p>The ambulance drove past Kidderminster's closed A&amp;E on a 50 minute journey to Worcester, where Mr Jones was pronounced dead after 20 minutes.</p> <p>The tragedy was grist to Health Concern's mill; a deeply emotive case which appeared to encapsulate the human cost of Kidderminster hospital's demise.</p> <p>But while the loss of services at Kidderminster has made for politics with instant appeal, not all the facts stack up on Dr Taylor's side.</p> <p>The hospital is being downsized for two reasons. The first is financial; in 1997, Worcestershire health authority was driven to reform all health services in the area to help resolve a multi-million pound deficit.</p> <p>The reforms turned on axeing in-patient services at Kidderminster in exchange for building a state-of-the-art hospital which will open in Worcester next April.</p> <p>The second reason was medical. Around 10 years ago, according to a consultant who worked there, junior doctors at Kidderminster were working well over 100 hours a week.</p> <p>After years of campaigning, moves to reduce junior doctors' hours were brought in. But that made providing cover at the small hospital increasingly difficult.</p> <p>Supporters of the changes say that providing the kind of intensive staffing levels needed for an accident and emergency department was rapidly becoming impossible.</p> <p>A bigger regional centre also offered patients a wider choice of specialists familiar with the latest techniques in each field.</p> <p>James Goodman, chairman of the Wyre Forest GPs' Association, said: \"We didn't necessarily fully support the changes at the start of the process. But after a lot of negotiation we had to agree that it was the only effective way forward. It finally came down to staffing; the need to have more specialists, and the increasing problem of junior doctors' hours.\"</p> <p>Turning the clock back now is impossible, he believes. The new Worcester facilities will be better and safer than the old Kidderminster hospital.</p> <p>The case of John Jones was a \"terrible tragedy\", he concedes. \"But these cases do happen. Even if Kidderminster had been open, the outcome might not have been different.\"</p> <p>For all the arguments against him, Dr Taylor's campaign has the powerful emotional appeal of the outsider.</p> <p>If elected, it will be a rare victory for a candidate without the backing of a big party machine, following in the footsteps of Martin Bell, who is at present Britain's only independent MP.</p> <p>\"I think we have started a revolt against the major party political system. If we achieve an MP we will send a signal to other areas to say that they can do something by having independent people running.\"</p> <p>And he has indeed sent a signal. In Dudley, where Unison is about to embark on its 12th strike against a PFI scheme to redevelop the town's hospitals, campaigners are also turning to the ballot box.</p> <p>Angela Thompson, a hospital catering worker and Unison branch secretary, threatens to dent Labour's majority by standing as a Socialist Alliance candidate against privatisation.</p> <p>Back in Wyre Forest, Clive Joyce, editor of the local paper, notes that complaints from readers about the NHS have mushroomed since Kidderminster's A&amp;E department closed.</p> <p>Letters have flooded in bemoaning long waits on trolleys in the outdated facilities of Worcester royal infirmary.</p> <p>This hospital's main buildings at Castle Street and Ronkswood in Worcester will also be replaced by the new PFI hospital, when it opens.</p> <p>\"They are not coping at Worcester,\" Mr Joyce said. \"In the health authority's defence, they have had to bring the plan forward.</p> <p>\"It was intended to down grade Kidderminster when the new Worcester hospital comes on-stream in 2002.</p> <p>\"But by announcing that Kidderminster was virtually going to be turned into a cottage hospital, that led to a crisis in staffing. New staff didn't want to come. Staff working there wanted to work elsewhere.\"</p> <p>And while the anger of the local paper's readers keeps the issue alive, Health Concern is poised to benefit.</p> <p>Mr Lock insists: \"The general election, whenever it comes, is not going to be a referendum on Kidderminster hospital.</p> <p>\"The voters need an MP who is going to represent them on benefits issues, on defence, on the whole wider issues of government.\"</p> <p>He may be over-confident; on the doorsteps of Wyre Forest, the complex arguments for change are difficult to deliver.</p> <p>\"Save our hospital\" is a much snappier sound-bite. It could be a close call.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Richard Taylor spent 23 years working at Kidderminster hospital in Hereford and Worcester. Now he paces its grounds pointing at buildings that are being gutted or mothballed. The hospital is being down-sized under NHS plans which promise to raise standards of care. But the plans have evoked fierce resistance from a diehard band of campaigners who call themselves Health Concern. Two years ago, Health Concern stopped the futile business of raising petitions and took to the ballot box. It was a last resort and it worked. They won seven seats in elections to Wyre Forest district council, which covers the towns of Kidderminster, Stourport-on-Severn and Bewdley. \"I'll never forget the feeling when the first result came up,\" Dr Taylor recalled. \"We suddenly realised that it was possible. That evening was absolutely electric.\" Last year they took another 11 council seats, making them the largest member of the ruling Rainbow Alliance, and reducing the Labour vote to less than 20%. Now Dr Taylor, 66, a retired consultant, is challenging Labour incumbent David Lock, who took Wyre Forest with a majority of nearly 7,000 in the 1997 landslide. Mr Lock is understandably anxious. The MP, a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor's department, whose wife practises as a GP locally, accuses Health Concern of distorting the facts to whip up alarm among the voters of Kidderminster. \"Local people are not taken in by campaigners who try to pretend they know more about the health service than doctors, nurses and the health authority,\" he insisted. Dr Taylor appeals to tradition, with all the patriarchal dignity of the old-style consultant. \"The hospital is woven into the fabric of Kidderminster life,\" he said. \"There has been a hospital here since 1920. It has been supported by the people all the way through - the [hospital's] League of Friends has raised between \u00a32.5m and \u00a33m in the last decade.\" Last September, Kidderminster's accident and emergency facilities were downgraded to a minor injuries unit. Its in-pa tient facilities were closed. This meant that any blue light emergency cases would have to travel 18 miles to Worcester royal infirmary. In February that decision had fatal consequences when a pensioner, John Jones, who lived five minutes from Kidderminster hospital, had a heart attack. The ambulance drove past Kidderminster's closed A&amp;E on a 50 minute journey to Worcester, where Mr Jones was pronounced dead after 20 minutes. The tragedy was grist to Health Concern's mill; a deeply emotive case which appeared to encapsulate the human cost of Kidderminster hospital's demise. But while the loss of services at Kidderminster has made for politics with instant appeal, not all the facts stack up on Dr Taylor's side. The hospital is being downsized for two reasons. The first is financial; in 1997, Worcestershire health authority was driven to reform all health services in the area to help resolve a multi-million pound deficit. The reforms turned on axeing in-patient services at Kidderminster in exchange for building a state-of-the-art hospital which will open in Worcester next April. The second reason was medical. Around 10 years ago, according to a consultant who worked there, junior doctors at Kidderminster were working well over 100 hours a week. After years of campaigning, moves to reduce junior doctors' hours were brought in. But that made providing cover at the small hospital increasingly difficult. Supporters of the changes say that providing the kind of intensive staffing levels needed for an accident and emergency department was rapidly becoming impossible. A bigger regional centre also offered patients a wider choice of specialists familiar with the latest techniques in each field. James Goodman, chairman of the Wyre Forest GPs' Association, said: \"We didn't necessarily fully support the changes at the start of the process. But after a lot of negotiation we had to agree that it was the only effective way forward. It finally came down to staffing; the need to have more specialists, and the increasing problem of junior doctors' hours.\" Turning the clock back now is impossible, he believes. The new Worcester facilities will be better and safer than the old Kidderminster hospital. The case of John Jones was a \"terrible tragedy\", he concedes. \"But these cases do happen. Even if Kidderminster had been open, the outcome might not have been different.\" For all the arguments against him, Dr Taylor's campaign has the powerful emotional appeal of the outsider. If elected, it will be a rare victory for a candidate without the backing of a big party machine, following in the footsteps of Martin Bell, who is at present Britain's only independent MP. \"I think we have started a revolt against the major party political system. If we achieve an MP we will send a signal to other areas to say that they can do something by having independent people running.\" And he has indeed sent a signal. In Dudley, where Unison is about to embark on its 12th strike against a PFI scheme to redevelop the town's hospitals, campaigners are also turning to the ballot box. Angela Thompson, a hospital catering worker and Unison branch secretary, threatens to dent Labour's majority by standing as a Socialist Alliance candidate against privatisation. Back in Wyre Forest, Clive Joyce, editor of the local paper, notes that complaints from readers about the NHS have mushroomed since Kidderminster's A&amp;E department closed. Letters have flooded in bemoaning long waits on trolleys in the outdated facilities of Worcester royal infirmary. This hospital's main buildings at Castle Street and Ronkswood in Worcester will also be replaced by the new PFI hospital, when it opens. \"They are not coping at Worcester,\" Mr Joyce said. \"In the health authority's defence, they have had to bring the plan forward. \"It was intended to down grade Kidderminster when the new Worcester hospital comes on-stream in 2002. \"But by announcing that Kidderminster was virtually going to be turned into a cottage hospital, that led to a crisis in staffing. New staff didn't want to come. Staff working there wanted to work elsewhere.\" And while the anger of the local paper's readers keeps the issue alive, Health Concern is poised to benefit. Mr Lock insists: \"The general election, whenever it comes, is not going to be a referendum on Kidderminster hospital. \"The voters need an MP who is going to represent them on benefits issues, on defence, on the whole wider issues of government.\" He may be over-confident; on the doorsteps of Wyre Forest, the complex arguments for change are difficult to deliver. \"Save our hospital\" is a much snappier sound-bite. It could be a close call.",

As the government's hunting bill moves to the committee stage in the upper house, peers are widely expected to oppose an outright ban in favour of a \"middle-way\" option, which would allow hunting to continue under licence. But a police chiefs' letter obtained by the Guardian reveals that the compromise - thought to be gaining the support of government - raises difficulties, particularly about who would enforce licensing. There will also be strong Lords support for a third option allowing hunting to be self-regulated. That proposal is backed by the Countryside Alliance, although the organisation is fighting an internal battle between hardliners, who oppose any change to the status quo, and those within the leadership who believe it may have to concede that statutory regulation is preferable to an outright ban. Lady Mallalieu, the Labour peer and alliance president, has written to pro-hunting peers expressing support for self-regulation, but conceding that she will abstain on - rather than oppose - the middle-way option. Alliance spokesman Simon Hart yesterday said the organisation backed self-regulation but \"we would be letting our members down if we didn't consider any political outcome of this process\". Tonight's votes, which are likely to be preceded by prolonged debate, come at a highly awkward time for the government as it attempts to convince the countryside that it understands the pressures caused by the foot and mouth epidemic. The hunting controversy, which has seen Tony Blair pledge to outlaw the pursuit and MPs repeatedly vote overwhelmingly for a ban, has been a central factor in claims by some in the countryside that the Labour government ignores rural interests. One of the considerations in favour of a May 3 election for the government is that the bill would then fall, with Labour promising another free Commons vote on the issue in its manifesto, while making clear that did not mean party support for a ban. Peers, like MPs, are given a free vote on hunting, but they do not split along party lines. Baroness Mallalieu and the broadcaster and fellow Labour peer, Lord Bragg, were among the most vociferous opponents of a ban during the bill's second-reading debate in the Lords this month. Peers will vote first this evening on the option of a ban on fox and stag hunting, which they are almost certain to reject. They are then expected to vote on the option of self-regulation, and finally on the middle-way compromise in which hunting would be supervised by a regulatory body of landowners, farmers and animal welfare groups. If the hardline self-regulation option is rejected, pro-hunting peers could choose to back licensed hunting, backed by the home secretary, Jack Straw, and towards which Mr Blair is inclining. Despite the compromise appeal of the middle way for the government, police chiefs are wary of confusion about their roles, and that of the new regulatory body. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) \"expressed concern about who would have responsibility for what\", in the letter obtained by the Guardian. The police chiefs warned that there was \"a lack of clear powers\" for the inspectors appointed by the regulatory body. The option \"only talks about 'arrangements' and gives no specific powers to those tasked with inspection, which may prove difficult\". Those who do not obtain a licence could be fined up to \u00a35,000 for illegal hunting. The association believed that police were being given \"no powers\" under this option to deal with this unlawful activity. \"We feel it needs to be made clear who will have responsibility for enforcing this part of the legislation,\" the letter said. Acpo wrote the letter in December after it was shown an early draft of the bill and was consulted about the options.",

      "body": "<p>British farming hanged itself on the expectation of plenty. One day, not long ago, I was in the Sainsbury's superstore on the Cromwell Road in London. Three of the company's top brass ushered me down the aisles, pointing here, gasping there, each of them in something of a swoon at the heavenliness on offer. \"People want to be interested,\" said Alison Austin, a technical adviser. \"You've just got to capture their imagination.\" We were standing by the sandwiches and the takeaway hot foods lined up in front of the whooshing doors.</p> <p>Alison swept her hand over the colourful bazaar of sandwich choices. \"This is a range called Be Good to Yourself,\" she said, \"with fresh, healthy fillings, and here we have the more gourmet range, Taste the Difference. We have a policy of using British produce where we can. With carrots, for example, we want to provide economic profitability to the farmer, using the short carrots for one line of produce, and the bigger ones for another.\"</p> <p>The Cromwell Road branch of Sainsbury's is what they call a \"flagship store\". It is not only a giant emporium; it is also grander than any other store in the chain, selling more champagne, fresh fish, organic meat and Special Selection food. Six varieties of caviar are available all year round.</p> <p>\"People are gaining more confidence in sushi,\" said Peter Morrison, manager, trading division. \"We have joined forces with very credible traders such as Yo! Sushi, and we aim to educate customers by bringing them here.\" Alison handed me a cup of liquid grass from Crussh, the fresh juice bar. There was something unusually potent about that afternoon - the thoughts in my head as I tilted the cup - and for a moment the whole supermarket seemed to spin around me. People wandered by. The place was a madhouse of bleeping barcodes. \"How do you like it?\" one of them asked. I gulped it down and focused my eyes. \"It tastes like an English field,\" I said.</p> <p>The store manager guided me to the cut flowers. \"We are the UK's largest flower sellers,\" he told me. \"The biggest year-on-year increase of any product in the store is in flowers.\" The bunches before me were a far cry from the sad carnations and petrol-station bouquets that now lie about the country as tributes to the suddenly dead. The ones he showed me had a very smart, sculptural appearance, and they sold for \u00a325 a pop. \"We have 40 kinds of apple,\" Alison said, \"and again, we take the crop, the smaller ones being more for the economy bags.\"</p> <p>\"Someone came in on Christmas Eve and asked for banana leaves,\" the keen young product manager over in fruit and vegetables told me, \"and you know something? We had them.\"</p> <p>You would have to say that Sainsbury's is amazing. It has everything - 50 kinds of tea, 400 kinds of bread, kosher chicken schnitzels, Cornish pilchards - and everywhere I turned that day there was some bamboozling elixir of the notion of plenty. Their own-brand products are made to high standards: the fresh meat, for example, is subject to much higher vigilance over date and provenance than any meat in Europe. \"Some things take a while,\" Peter Morrison said. \"You can put something out and it won't work. Then you have to think again, about how to market it, how to package it, where to place it, and six months later you'll try again and it might work.\"</p> <p>We stopped beside the yoghurts. \"Now this,\" he said, picking up a tub of Devon yoghurt, \"is made at a place called Stapleton Farm. We got wind of how good it was: a tiny operation, we went down there, we got some technical advisers involved, and now look, it's brilliant!\" I tasted some of the Stapleton yoghurt. It was much better than the liquid grass. \"It's about the rural business growing,\" Peter said. \"Real food is what people want. This couple in Devon\" - he gestured to the yoghurt pots - \"started from virtually nowhere. Of course, they were nervous at first about working with such a major retailer. But these people are the new kind of producer.\"</p> <p>Passing the condiments aisle I saw an old man standing in front of the Oxo cubes. He looked a bit shaky. His lips were moving and he had one of the foil-wrapped Oxo cubes in the palm of his hand. \"People go to Tuscany,\" Alison was saying, \"and they eat Parma ham and they come back here and they want it all the time. So we go out and find the best.\" <br><br>You are always alone with the oddness of modern consumption. Walking under the white lights of Sainsbury's, you find out just who you are. The reams of cartons, the pyramids of tins: there they stand on the miles of shelves, the story of how we live now. Cereal boxes look out at you with their breakfast-ready smiles, containing flakes of bran, handfuls of oats, which come from fields mentioned in the Domesday Book. <br><br>And here you are in the year 2001 - choosing. We went over to the aisle with the cooking oils and Alison did one of her long arm-flourishes: \"When I was a child,\" she said, \"my mother used a bottle of prescription olive oil to clean the salad bowl. Now look!\" A line of tank-green bottles stretched into the distance. \"Choice!' she said.</p> <p>Supermarket people like to use certain words. When you are with them in the fruit department, they all say \"fresh\" and \"juicy\" and \"variety\" and \"good farming practices\". (Or, as head office puts it, \"in 1992 Sainsbury developed a protocol for growing crops under Integrated Crop Management System principles. Following these principles can result in reduced usage of pesticides by combining more traditional aspects of agriculture and new technologies.\")<br> <br>In the meat department there is much talk of \"friendly\", \"animal well-being\", \"humane\", \"safe\", \"high standards\" and \"provenance\". The executives spent their time with me highlighting what they see as the strength of the partnerships with British farming which keep everyone happy. \"The consumer is what matters,\" said Alison, \"and we believe in strong, creative, ethical retailing.\"</p> <p>Down at the front of the store again I put one of the gourmet sandwiches on a table and opened it up. The bread was grainy. The lettuce was pale green and fresh. Pieces of chicken and strips of pepper were neatly set out on a thin layer of butter. The open sandwich was a tableau of unwritten biographies: grains and vegetables and meat were glistening there, uncontroversially, their stories of economic life and farming history and current disaster safely behind them.</p> <p>When I was a boy we had a painting above the phone table. It was the only real painting in the house, and it showed a wide field in the evening with a farm at the far end. The farmhouse had a light in one of the windows. The painting had been a wedding present, and my mother thought it was a bit dour and dirty-looking, so she did the frame up with some white gloss, which flaked over the years. I used to lie on the hall carpet and look at the picture of the farm for ages; the field was golden enough to run through and get lost in, and the brown daubs of farmhouse were enough to send me into a swoon of God-knows-what.<br><br> I suppose it was all part of a general childhood boredom, and it meant nothing, but it seemed very heightening at the time. The painting raised my feelings up on stilts, and made me imagine myself to be part of an older world, where people lived and worked in a state of sentimental peace. All rot, of course. But lovely rot. Sometimes I would come downstairs in the night and shine my torch on the painting.</p> <p>At one time it seemed as if all the farms around our way had been abandoned or pulled down to make room for housing. Past railway lines and beyond the diminishing fields we would find old, dilapidated Ayrshire farmhouses with rusted tractors and old wooden drinking troughs lying about in the yard, and we would play in them for half the summer. Cranberry Moss Farm, McLaughlin's Farm on Byrehill, Ashgrove Farm, the Old Mains - nowadays they are all buried under concrete, except for the farm at Toddhill, which became a home for the mentally handicapped. In my youth they had been like haunted houses. There were echoes in the barns.</p> <p>Those farms seemed as remote from the daily reality of our lives as the one in the wedding picture. We would never live there: computer factories and industrial cleaners would soon replace them as providers of jobs, and it was these new places, in our Ayrshire, that spoke of the lives we were supposed one day to live. We took it for granted - much too early, as it turned out - that farming was a thing of the past, a thing people did be fore they were sophisticated like us. We never considered the stuff on our plates; we thought the school milk came on a lorry from London. Never for a second did my friends and I think of ourselves as coming from a rural community; like all British suburban kids, we lived as dark, twinkling fallout from a big city, in our case Glasgow; and we thought carports and breezeblocks were part of the natural order.</p> <p>But, of course, there was plenty of agriculture. It surrounded us. The farms had just been pushed out a wee bit - and wee could seem larger than it was, at least for us, shocked by the whiteness of our new buildings into thinking a thatched roof was the height of exotic. Everything changed for me with the discovery of Robert Burns: those torn-up fields out there were his fields, those bulldozed farms as old as his words, both old and new to me then. Burns was ever a slave to the farming business: he is the patron saint of struggling farmers and poor soil. <br><br>But in actual fact, despite our thoughts and our recovery from our thoughts, in the early 70s British farming was in a pretty good state. JGS and Frances Donaldson's Farming in Britain Today, published around this time, just before Britain's entry into the Common Market, expressed the view that a beautiful balance had been struck.</p> <p>Today, agriculture is one of Britain's most efficient industries. It has a controlled growth of 3.5% a year, and in the last 10 years its labour productivity has increased at twice the rate for industry as a whole. It supplies approximately 50% of the nation's food. Travelling through England today with its trim hedges, arable and ley farming, highly capitalised and intensively used buildings, it is hard to imagine the broken-backed appearance of yesterday.</p> <p>\"Yesterday\" meant the 20s and 30s. But now, as I write, the situation of farming in this country is perhaps worse than it has ever been, and the countryside itself is dying. We are at a stage where it is difficult to imagine British farming surviving in any of its traditional forms; and for millions living on these islands, a long-term crisis has been turning into a terminal disaster.</p> <p>Three years ago, agriculture contributed \u00a36.9bn to the British economy, around 1% of the gross domestic product. It represented 5.3% of the value of UK exports. The figure for 1999 was \u00a31.8bn. The total area of agricultural land is 18.6 million hectares, 76% of the entire land surface. According to an agricultural census in June 1999, there has been a decrease of 5.3% in the area given over to crops, as a result of a decrease in cereals and an increase in set-aside. According to a recent report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff), the 1999 figures show a drop in the labour force of 3.6%, the largest decrease in a dozen years. \"These results,\" the report continues, \"are not unexpected given the financial pressures experienced by most sectors of the industry over the last few years.\"</p> <p>Farmers' income fell by over 60% between 1995 and 1999. Despite increases in production, earnings were lower in 1999 by \u00a3518m. The value of wheat fell by 6.5%, and barley by 5.4%. Pigs were \u00a399m down on 1998, and lambs \u00a3126m down; the value of poultry meat fell by \u00a3100m, or 7.4%; the value of milk fell by \u00a345m; and the value of eggs by 10%, or \u00a340m. A giant profit gap has opened up throughout the industry: rape seed, for example, which costs \u00a3200 a ton to produce, is selling for \u00a3170 per ton (including the government subsidy); a savoy cabbage, costing 13p to produce, is sold by the farmer for 11 pence, and by the supermarkets for 47p.</p> <p>Hill farmers earned less than \u00a38,000 a year on average in 1998-99 (and 60% of that came to them in subsidies), but late last year, when I first started talking to farmers, many were making nothing at all, and most were heavily in debt to the bank. A suicide helpline was set up and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concern at the increased number of suicides among hill farmers in particular. A spokesman for Maff said that agriculture was costing every British taxpayer \u00a34 a week. After Germany and France, the UK makes the largest annual contribution to the Common Agricultural Policy, and yet, even before the great rise in the strength of the pound, British farmers' production costs were higher than anywhere else in the EU, to a large extent because of the troubles of recent years.</p> <p>\"Everything is a nightmare,\" one farmer told me. \"There are costs everywhere, and even the subsidy is spent long before you receive it. We are all in hock to the banks - and they say we are overmanned, but we don't have anybody here, just us, and children maybe, and an absolute fucking nightmare from top to bottom.\" The strong pound, the payment of subsidy cheques in euros, the BSE crisis, swine fever, and now foot and mouth disease, together with overproduction in the rest of the world's markets - these are the reasons for the worsened situation. <br><br>But they are not the cause of the longer-term crisis in British farming: local overproduction is behind that, and it is behind the destruction of the countryside, too. For all the savage reductions of recent times, farming still employs too many and produces too much: even before the end of February, when diseased livestock burned on funeral pyres 130ft high, some farmers were killing their own livestock for want of a profit, or to save the fuel costs incurred in taking them to market.</p> <p>In Britain nowadays most farmers are given aid - a great deal of aid, but too little to save them - in order to produce food nobody wants to buy. The way livestock subsidies work - per animal - means that there is an incentive for farmers to increase flocks and herds rather than improve the marketing of what they have got. As things are, subsidies save some farmers, but they are a useless way to shore up an ailing industry, except perhaps in wartime.</p> <p>The evidence of what is wrong is out in the British land itself. Farming - more even than coal, more than ships, steel, or Posh and Becks - is at the centre of who British people think they are. It has a heady, long-standing, romantic and sworn place in the cultural imagination: the death of farming will not be an easy one in the green and pleasant land.</p> <p>Rain was running down Nelson's Column and Trafalgar Square was awash with visitors inspecting the lions. An American woman stepping into the National Gallery was worried about her camera lens. \"This British weather will be the end of us,\" she said, as her husband shook out the umbrellas. In the Sackler Room - Room 34 - children with identical haircuts sat down on the wooden floor; they stared at the British weather of long ago, spread in oils with palette knives, and they, too, asked why it was always so fuzzy and so cloudy. One group sat around Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway. The instructor encouraged them to express something about the atmosphere of the picture. \"Does it make you shiver?\" she said. \"It's like outside,\" one of the children replied. But most of them were interested in the hare running ahead of the train. \"Will it die?\" one of them asked. \"Where is it running to?\"</p> <p>The future. You feel the force of change in some of these weathery British pictures. Over the last few months I kept coming back to this room, and sitting here, further up from the Turners, looking at Constable's The Cornfield. We see an English country lane at harvest time where nothing is unusual, but everything is spectacular. Corn spills down an embankment, going to grass and ferns, going to pepper saxifrage or hog's fennel, dandelion and corn poppy, down to a stream. Giant trees reach up to the dark, gathering clouds. <br><br>At their foot, a small boy lies flat on his front drinking from the stream. He wears a red waistcoat and has a tear in the left leg of his trousers. A dog with a marked shadow looks up and past him with its pink tongue out. The sheep in front of the dog are making for a broken gate that opens on to the cornfield. A plough is stowed in a ditch; the farmer advances from the field; and in the distance, which stretches for miles, you see people already at work.</p> <p>The picture has philosophical currency: people will still say it is an important part of what is meant by the term \"British\" - or, at any rate, \"English\". This is the country delegates sing about at the party conferences, the one depicted in heritage brochures and on biscuit tins, the corner that lives in the sentiments of war poetry, an image at the heart of Britain's view of itself. <br><br>But here's the shock: it no longer exists. Everything in Constable's picture is a small ghost still haunting the national consciousness. The corn poppy has pretty much gone, and so have the workers. The days of children drinking from streams are over, too. And the livestock? We will come to that. Let me just say that a number of the farmers I spoke to in the winter of 2000 were poisoning their own fields. The Constable picture fades into a new world of intensive industrial farming and environmental blight.</p> <p>The Cornfield is said to show the path along which Constable walked from East Bergholt across the River Stour and the fields to his school at Dedham. Last October I made my way to Dedham. It was another wet day, and many of the trucks and lorries splashing up water on the M25 were heading to the coast to join a fuel blockade. On the radio a newscaster described what was happening: \"The situation for the modern British farmer has probably never been so dire, and a further rise in the price of fuel could kill many of them off.\"</p> <p>Before leaving I had rung a pig farmer, David Barker, whose farm is north of Stowmarket in Suffolk. Barker is 50 years old. His family has been farming pigs in Suffolk for four generations; they have lived and worked on the present farm since 1957. He owns 1,250 acres and 110 sows, which he breeds and sells at a finishing weight of 95 kilos. Among his crops are winter wheat, winter-sown barley, grass for seed production, some peas for canning, 120 acres of field beans, 30 acres of spring oats and 100 acres of set-aside.</p> <p>\"Five years ago I was selling wheat for \u00a3125 a ton, and now it's \u00a358.50,\" Barker said. \"I was selling pigs for \u00a390, and now they're down to \u00a365. And meanwhile all our costs have doubled: fuel, stock, fertiliser. There's hardly a farmer in East Anglia who's making a profit. The direct payments from Europe have declined also because they're paid out in euros.'</p> <p>\"What about swine fever?\" I asked, innocent of the epidemics to come.</p> <p>\"There are over 500 farms that haven't been able to move pigs since August,\" he said. \"Immediately, this becomes an agricultural nightmare. The pigs are breeding, the feed is extortionate, and you end up relying on things like the Welfare Disposal Scheme, where pigs are removed for next to nothing. Gordon Brown's bright idea: they give you \u00a350 for a pig that costs \u00a380 to produce.\"</p> <p>\"What can be done?\" The stormy weather was making his phone crackly.</p> <p>\"Well, this government has no interest in farming,\" he said. \"People in the countryside in England feel they are ignored and derided and, frankly, it appears that the government would be much happier just to import food. This is the worst agricultural crisis in dozens of years. We're not making any money anywhere. Take milk: the dairy farmer receives seven pence in subsidy for every pint; it takes between 10 and 12p to produce, and it costs 39p when it arrives at your door. A lot of farmers are giving up, and many of those who stay are turning to contract farming - increasing their land, making prairies, to make it pay.\"</p> <p>\"Is that the only way to reduce costs?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, that. Or by going to France.\"</p> <p>David Barker used the word \"nightmare\" at least a dozen times during my conversation with him. He told me about a friend of his, another Suffolk farmer, who, earlier in the swine fever debacle, had sold his 250 pigs into the disposal scheme, losing \u00a330 on each one. Barker himself was waiting for results of blood tests to see if his pigs had the fever. \"If it goes on much longer it will ruin me,\" he said.</p> <p>When I arrived at Nigel Rowe's farm near Dedham, only the weather was Constable-like. Out of his window the fields were bare and flat. \"European pig meat is cheaper to produce,\" he said, \"because we have higher standards and higher production costs. As soon as foreign bacon gets cheaper by more than 10p per kilo, the housewife swaps. That is the rule.\"</p> <p>I asked him if he felt British supermarkets had been good at supporting bacon produced in Essex or Suffolk. \"The supermarkets have been very clever at playing the different farming sectors off against each other,\" he said. \"The Danish model is very centralised - they are allowed to produce and market something called Danish Bacon. We are very regional over here, very dominated by the tradition of the local butcher. Supermarkets want the same produce to be available in Scotland as you get in Sussex. Only the Dutch and the Danish can do that, and some of these foreign producers are so powerful - the Danish producers of bacon are much bigger than Tesco.\"</p> <p>Nigel has 2,000 pigs. But he is not making money. As well as working the farm, he has a part-time job as caretaker at the local community centre. \"In the 70s we were all earning a comfortable living,\" he said, \"and when I was at primary school in the 60s, at least 30 of my schoolmates were connected with farming. Now, in my children's classes, there are three. I had 120 acres and I had to sell it recently to survive. I also had to sell the farm cottage my mother lived in, in order to stay here. That's what I was working on when you came - a little house for my mother.\"</p> <p>He looked out of the window at the flatness beyond. \"The arithmetic is simple,\" he said. \"When I started in this game it took five tons of grain to buy the year's supply of fuel for the tractor. Now it takes 500 tons. What do you think that means if your acreage is the same? The government seems hell-bent on the old green and pleasant land, but they won't get behind the people who keep it that way.\" Nigel sat in his living room wearing a rugby shirt and jeans speckled with paint from his mother's new house. \"They're not thinking straight,\" he said. \"Our product needs to be marketed - branded, with a flag, which is presently not allowed. It's all wrong. We have to import soya as a protein source for our pigs now because we can't use other animal meat or bone fat. But this country imports tons of Dutch and Danish meat fed on bone fat.\"</p> <p>As we walked out of the living room, I noticed there were no pictures on any of the walls. We went outside to the pigsties. The rain was pouring down, the mud thick and sloppy on the ground, and one of Nigel's pigs was burning in an incinerator. As we looked out I asked him what had happened to the land. \"The subsidies from the Common Agricultural Policy have got out of hand,\" he said, \"because they are linked to production rather than the environment. Did you know the rivers around here are polluted with fertiliser and crap? We're seeing a massive degradation of rural life in this country. Bakers and dairies have already gone, onions have gone, sugarbeet is gone, beef is pretty much gone, lambs are going.\"</p> <p>Before we went into the sty, he asked me if I was \"pig-clean\". \"I'm clean,\" I said, \"unless the fever can come through the phone.\" Hundreds of healthy-looking pink pigs scuttled around in the hay and the mud. He picked one up. \"Farming is passed down,\" he said, \"or it should be. A farm is built up for generation after generation, and when it starts to slip and go - you feel an absolute failure. That's what you feel.\"</p> <p>We went around the farm and Nigel explained how things work. The notebook was getting very wet so I put it away. \"You feel a failure,\" he said again, looking into the wind. \"The other night I was at a meeting: 140 farmers at a union meeting paying tribute to four hill farmers under 45 who'd committed suicide.\" He leaned against the side of the barn. \"We are no longer an island,\" he said. \"Everything's a commodity.\"</p> <p>\u00a9 Andrew O'Hagan.

We went over to the aisle with the cooking oils and Alison did one of her long arm-flourishes: \"When I was a child,\" she said, \"my mother used a bottle of prescription olive oil to clean the salad bowl. Now look!\" A line of tank-green bottles stretched into the distance. \"Choice!' she said. Supermarket people like to use certain words. When you are with them in the fruit department, they all say \"fresh\" and \"juicy\" and \"variety\" and \"good farming practices\". (Or, as head office puts it, \"in 1992 Sainsbury developed a protocol for growing crops under Integrated Crop Management System principles. Following these principles can result in reduced usage of pesticides by combining more traditional aspects of agriculture and new technologies.\") In the meat department there is much talk of \"friendly\", \"animal well-being\", \"humane\", \"safe\", \"high standards\" and \"provenance\". The executives spent their time with me highlighting what they see as the strength of the partnerships with British farming which keep everyone happy. \"The consumer is what matters,\" said Alison, \"and we believe in strong, creative, ethical retailing.\" Down at the front of the store again I put one of the gourmet sandwiches on a table and opened it up. The bread was grainy. The lettuce was pale green and fresh. Pieces of chicken and strips of pepper were neatly set out on a thin layer of butter. The open sandwich was a tableau of unwritten biographies: grains and vegetables and meat were glistening there, uncontroversially, their stories of economic life and farming history and current disaster safely behind them. When I was a boy we had a painting above the phone table. It was the only real painting in the house, and it showed a wide field in the evening with a farm at the far end. The farmhouse had a light in one of the windows. The painting had been a wedding present, and my mother thought it was a bit dour and dirty-looking, so she did the frame up with some white gloss, which flaked over the years. I used to lie on the hall carpet and look at the picture of the farm for ages; the field was golden enough to run through and get lost in, and the brown daubs of farmhouse were enough to send me into a swoon of God-knows-what. I suppose it was all part of a general childhood boredom, and it meant nothing, but it seemed very heightening at the time. The painting raised my feelings up on stilts, and made me imagine myself to be part of an older world, where people lived and worked in a state of sentimental peace. All rot, of course. But lovely rot. Sometimes I would come downstairs in the night and shine my torch on the painting. At one time it seemed as if all the farms around our way had been abandoned or pulled down to make room for housing. Past railway lines and beyond the diminishing fields we would find old, dilapidated Ayrshire farmhouses with rusted tractors and old wooden drinking troughs lying about in the yard, and we would play in them for half the summer. Cranberry Moss Farm, McLaughlin's Farm on Byrehill, Ashgrove Farm, the Old Mains - nowadays they are all buried under concrete, except for the farm at Toddhill, which became a home for the mentally handicapped. In my youth they had been like haunted houses. There were echoes in the barns. Those farms seemed as remote from the daily reality of our lives as the one in the wedding picture. We would never live there: computer factories and industrial cleaners would soon replace them as providers of jobs, and it was these new places, in our Ayrshire, that spoke of the lives we were supposed one day to live. We took it for granted - much too early, as it turned out - that farming was a thing of the past, a thing people did be fore they were sophisticated like us. We never considered the stuff on our plates; we thought the school milk came on a lorry from London. Never for a second did my friends and I think of ourselves as coming from a rural community; like all British suburban kids, we lived as dark, twinkling fallout from a big city, in our case Glasgow; and we thought carports and breezeblocks were part of the natural order. But, of course, there was plenty of agriculture. It surrounded us. The farms had just been pushed out a wee bit - and wee could seem larger than it was, at least for us, shocked by the whiteness of our new buildings into thinking a thatched roof was the height of exotic. Everything changed for me with the discovery of Robert Burns: those torn-up fields out there were his fields, those bulldozed farms as old as his words, both old and new to me then. Burns was ever a slave to the farming business: he is the patron saint of struggling farmers and poor soil. But in actual fact, despite our thoughts and our recovery from our thoughts, in the early 70s British farming was in a pretty good state. JGS and Frances Donaldson's Farming in Britain Today, published around this time, just before Britain's entry into the Common Market, expressed the view that a beautiful balance had been struck. Today, agriculture is one of Britain's most efficient industries. It has a controlled growth of 3.5% a year, and in the last 10 years its labour productivity has increased at twice the rate for industry as a whole. It supplies approximately 50% of the nation's food. Travelling through England today with its trim hedges, arable and ley farming, highly capitalised and intensively used buildings, it is hard to imagine the broken-backed appearance of yesterday. \"Yesterday\" meant the 20s and 30s. But now, as I write, the situation of farming in this country is perhaps worse than it has ever been, and the countryside itself is dying. We are at a stage where it is difficult to imagine British farming surviving in any of its traditional forms; and for millions living on these islands, a long-term crisis has been turning into a terminal disaster. Three years ago, agriculture contributed \u00a36.9bn to the British economy, around 1% of the gross domestic product. It represented 5.3% of the value of UK exports. The figure for 1999 was \u00a31.8bn. The total area of agricultural land is 18.6 million hectares, 76% of the entire land surface. According to an agricultural census in June 1999, there has been a decrease of 5.3% in the area given over to crops, as a result of a decrease in cereals and an increase in set-aside. According to a recent report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff), the 1999 figures show a drop in the labour force of 3.6%, the largest decrease in a dozen years. \"These results,\" the report continues, \"are not unexpected given the financial pressures experienced by most sectors of the industry over the last few years.\" Farmers' income fell by over 60% between 1995 and 1999. Despite increases in production, earnings were lower in 1999 by \u00a3518m. The value of wheat fell by 6.5%, and barley by 5.4%. Pigs were \u00a399m down on 1998, and lambs \u00a3126m down; the value of poultry meat fell by \u00a3100m, or 7.4%; the value of milk fell by \u00a345m; and the value of eggs by 10%, or \u00a340m. A giant profit gap has opened up throughout the industry: rape seed, for example, which costs \u00a3200 a ton to produce, is selling for \u00a3170 per ton (including the government subsidy); a savoy cabbage, costing 13p to produce, is sold by the farmer for 11 pence, and by the supermarkets for 47p. Hill farmers earned less than \u00a38,000 a year on average in 1998-99 (and 60% of that came to them in subsidies), but late last year, when I first started talking to farmers, many were making nothing at all, and most were heavily in debt to the bank. A suicide helpline was set up and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concern at the increased number of suicides among hill farmers in particular. A spokesman for Maff said that agriculture was costing every British taxpayer \u00a34 a week. After Germany and France, the UK makes the largest annual contribution to the Common Agricultural Policy, and yet, even before the great rise in the strength of the pound, British farmers' production costs were higher than anywhere else in the EU, to a large extent because of the troubles of recent years. \"Everything is a nightmare,\" one farmer told me. \"There are costs everywhere, and even the subsidy is spent long before you receive it. We are all in hock to the banks - and they say we are overmanned, but we don't have anybody here, just us, and children maybe, and an absolute fucking nightmare from top to bottom.\" The strong pound, the payment of subsidy cheques in euros, the BSE crisis, swine fever, and now foot and mouth disease, together with overproduction in the rest of the world's markets - these are the reasons for the worsened situation. But they are not the cause of the longer-term crisis in British farming: local overproduction is behind that, and it is behind the destruction of the countryside, too. For all the savage reductions of recent times, farming still employs too many and produces too much: even before the end of February, when diseased livestock burned on funeral pyres 130ft high, some farmers were killing their own livestock for want of a profit, or to save the fuel costs incurred in taking them to market. In Britain nowadays most farmers are given aid - a great deal of aid, but too little to save them - in order to produce food nobody wants to buy. The way livestock subsidies work - per animal - means that there is an incentive for farmers to increase flocks and herds rather than improve the marketing of what they have got. As things are, subsidies save some farmers, but they are a useless way to shore up an ailing industry, except perhaps in wartime. The evidence of what is wrong is out in the British land itself. Farming - more even than coal, more than ships, steel, or Posh and Becks - is at the centre of who British people think they are. It has a heady, long-standing, romantic and sworn place in the cultural imagination: the death of farming will not be an easy one in the green and pleasant land. Rain was running down Nelson's Column and Trafalgar Square was awash with visitors inspecting the lions. An American woman stepping into the National Gallery was worried about her camera lens. \"This British weather will be the end of us,\" she said, as her husband shook out the umbrellas. In the Sackler Room - Room 34 - children with identical haircuts sat down on the wooden floor; they stared at the British weather of long ago, spread in oils with palette knives, and they, too, asked why it was always so fuzzy and so cloudy. One group sat around Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway. The instructor encouraged them to express something about the atmosphere of the picture. \"Does it make you shiver?\" she said. \"It's like outside,\" one of the children replied. But most of them were interested in the hare running ahead of the train. \"Will it die?\" one of them asked. \"Where is it running to?\" The future. You feel the force of change in some of these weathery British pictures. Over the last few months I kept coming back to this room, and sitting here, further up from the Turners, looking at Constable's The Cornfield. We see an English country lane at harvest time where nothing is unusual, but everything is spectacular. Corn spills down an embankment, going to grass and ferns, going to pepper saxifrage or hog's fennel, dandelion and corn poppy, down to a stream. Giant trees reach up to the dark, gathering clouds. At their foot, a small boy lies flat on his front drinking from the stream. He wears a red waistcoat and has a tear in the left leg of his trousers. A dog with a marked shadow looks up and past him with its pink tongue out. The sheep in front of the dog are making for a broken gate that opens on to the cornfield. A plough is stowed in a ditch; the farmer advances from the field; and in the distance, which stretches for miles, you see people already at work. The picture has philosophical currency: people will still say it is an important part of what is meant by the term \"British\" - or, at any rate, \"English\". This is the country delegates sing about at the party conferences, the one depicted in heritage brochures and on biscuit tins, the corner that lives in the sentiments of war poetry, an image at the heart of Britain's view of itself. But here's the shock: it no longer exists. Everything in Constable's picture is a small ghost still haunting the national consciousness. The corn poppy has pretty much gone, and so have the workers. The days of children drinking from streams are over, too. And the livestock? We will come to that. Let me just say that a number of the farmers I spoke to in the winter of 2000 were poisoning their own fields. The Constable picture fades into a new world of intensive industrial farming and environmental blight. The Cornfield is said to show the path along which Constable walked from East Bergholt across the River Stour and the fields to his school at Dedham. Last October I made my way to Dedham. It was another wet day, and many of the trucks and lorries splashing up water on the M25 were heading to the coast to join a fuel blockade. On the radio a newscaster described what was happening: \"The situation for the modern British farmer has probably never been so dire, and a further rise in the price of fuel could kill many of them off.\" Before leaving I had rung a pig farmer, David Barker, whose farm is north of Stowmarket in Suffolk. Barker is 50 years old. His family has been farming pigs in Suffolk for four generations; they have lived and worked on the present farm since 1957. He owns 1,250 acres and 110 sows, which he breeds and sells at a finishing weight of 95 kilos. Among his crops are winter wheat, winter-sown barley, grass for seed production, some peas for canning, 120 acres of field beans, 30 acres of spring oats and 100 acres of set-aside. \"Five years ago I was selling wheat for \u00a3125 a ton, and now it's \u00a358.50,\" Barker said. \"I was selling pigs for \u00a390, and now they're down to \u00a365. And meanwhile all our costs have doubled: fuel, stock, fertiliser. There's hardly a farmer in East Anglia who's making a profit. The direct payments from Europe have declined also because they're paid out in euros.' \"What about swine fever?\" I asked, innocent of the epidemics to come. \"There are over 500 farms that haven't been able to move pigs since August,\" he said. \"Immediately, this becomes an agricultural nightmare. The pigs are breeding, the feed is extortionate, and you end up relying on things like the Welfare Disposal Scheme, where pigs are removed for next to nothing. Gordon Brown's bright idea: they give you \u00a350 for a pig that costs \u00a380 to produce.\" \"What can be done?\" The stormy weather was making his phone crackly. \"Well, this government has no interest in farming,\" he said. \"People in the countryside in England feel they are ignored and derided and, frankly, it appears that the government would be much happier just to import food. This is the worst agricultural crisis in dozens of years. We're not making any money anywhere. Take milk: the dairy farmer receives seven pence in subsidy for every pint; it takes between 10 and 12p to produce, and it costs 39p when it arrives at your door. A lot of farmers are giving up, and many of those who stay are turning to contract farming - increasing their land, making prairies, to make it pay.\" \"Is that the only way to reduce costs?\" \"Yes, that. Or by going to France.\" David Barker used the word \"nightmare\" at least a dozen times during my conversation with him. He told me about a friend of his, another Suffolk farmer, who, earlier in the swine fever debacle, had sold his 250 pigs into the disposal scheme, losing \u00a330 on each one. Barker himself was waiting for results of blood tests to see if his pigs had the fever. \"If it goes on much longer it will ruin me,\" he said. When I arrived at Nigel Rowe's farm near Dedham, only the weather was Constable-like. Out of his window the fields were bare and flat. \"European pig meat is cheaper to produce,\" he said, \"because we have higher standards and higher production costs. As soon as foreign bacon gets cheaper by more than 10p per kilo, the housewife swaps. That is the rule.\" I asked him if he felt British supermarkets had been good at supporting bacon produced in Essex or Suffolk. \"The supermarkets have been very clever at playing the different farming sectors off against each other,\" he said. \"The Danish model is very centralised - they are allowed to produce and market something called Danish Bacon. We are very regional over here, very dominated by the tradition of the local butcher. Supermarkets want the same produce to be available in Scotland as you get in Sussex. Only the Dutch and the Danish can do that, and some of these foreign producers are so powerful - the Danish producers of bacon are much bigger than Tesco.\" Nigel has 2,000 pigs. But he is not making money. As well as working the farm, he has a part-time job as caretaker at the local community centre. \"In the 70s we were all earning a comfortable living,\" he said, \"and when I was at primary school in the 60s, at least 30 of my schoolmates were connected with farming. Now, in my children's classes, there are three. I had 120 acres and I had to sell it recently to survive. I also had to sell the farm cottage my mother lived in, in order to stay here. That's what I was working on when you came - a little house for my mother.\" He looked out of the window at the flatness beyond. \"The arithmetic is simple,\" he said. \"When I started in this game it took five tons of grain to buy the year's supply of fuel for the tractor. Now it takes 500 tons. What do you think that means if your acreage is the same? The government seems hell-bent on the old green and pleasant land, but they won't get behind the people who keep it that way.\" Nigel sat in his living room wearing a rugby shirt and jeans speckled with paint from his mother's new house. \"They're not thinking straight,\" he said. \"Our product needs to be marketed - branded, with a flag, which is presently not allowed. It's all wrong. We have to import soya as a protein source for our pigs now because we can't use other animal meat or bone fat. But this country imports tons of Dutch and Danish meat fed on bone fat.\" As we walked out of the living room, I noticed there were no pictures on any of the walls. We went outside to the pigsties. The rain was pouring down, the mud thick and sloppy on the ground, and one of Nigel's pigs was burning in an incinerator. As we looked out I asked him what had happened to the land. \"The subsidies from the Common Agricultural Policy have got out of hand,\" he said, \"because they are linked to production rather than the environment. Did you know the rivers around here are polluted with fertiliser and crap? We're seeing a massive degradation of rural life in this country. Bakers and dairies have already gone, onions have gone, sugarbeet is gone, beef is pretty much gone, lambs are going.\" Before we went into the sty, he asked me if I was \"pig-clean\". \"I'm clean,\" I said, \"unless the fever can come through the phone.\" Hundreds of healthy-looking pink pigs scuttled around in the hay and the mud. He picked one up. \"Farming is passed down,\" he said, \"or it should be. A farm is built up for generation after generation, and when it starts to slip and go - you feel an absolute failure. That's what you feel.\" We went around the farm and Nigel explained how things work. The notebook was getting very wet so I put it away. \"You feel a failure,\" he said again, looking into the wind. \"The other night I was at a meeting: 140 farmers at a union meeting paying tribute to four hill farmers under 45 who'd committed suicide.\" He leaned against the side of the barn. \"We are no longer an island,\" he said. \"Everything's a commodity.\" \u00a9 Andrew O'Hagan.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was warned yesterday by Labour party figures of the danger of mixing religion and politics in the drive to win votes. As the prime minister prepared to address the Christian Socialist Movement on Thursday, where he is expected to say that religious organisations should get more involved in helping communities, the former deputy party leader Lord Hattersley said \"evangelising\" was dangerous and could alienate sections of society. Martin O'Neill, chairman of the trade and industry select committee, said on BBC1's On the Record: \"We could be in danger of reinforcing social divisions in the name of alternative forms of provision.\" Downing Street yesterday said Mr Blair's speech had yet to be finalised. A year ago, Labour attacked the Conservatives for exploring ideas adopted by \"compassionate Conservatives\" in the US, which would see faith-based groups taking over some social services roles from the state, such as education and unemployment programmes. The Tories have not directly followed that policy example, but their leader, William Hague, has praised the ideas of Marvin Olasky, welfare guru to President George Bush, which give more responsibility to charities and faith groups and demolish the idea of state handouts. Mr Bush has run into trouble with the initiative, as faith groups resist offers of government cash amid fears of being overrun with paperwork and regulation of their work. There are also concerns in the US that the definition of a faith-based group is unclear, potentially including radical separatist groups, those who oppose rights for women or minorities, or controversial groups such as the Church of Scientology, Hare Krishna, and the Unification Church - the Moonies. The programme has been postponed. The British government is interested in an increased role for faith groups in its quest to re-energise deprived communities, but figures including the chancellor, Gordon Brown, are keen to ensure that that does not mean an erosion of public welfare provision. Faith groups, meanwhile, have argued that they often miss out on cash such as lottery funding because their work may be aimed at particular sections of the community or because they employ only staff with particular beliefs. In Thursday's speech Mr Blair will develop the theme of how faith communities can help the disadvantaged, saying that churches have a role in providing continuity during periods of change. While Mr Blair has spoken before of his personal faith and its influence on his politics, there are concerns in Downing Street that talk of religion could repel some voters, while others may be antagonised by any suggestion that Mr Blair is aligning Christian morality and centre-left beliefs. Lord Hattersley gave a taste of the opposition Mr Blair could expect: \"This is an agnostic nation. To evangelise on behalf of one point of view, whatever it is, might just alienate people of a different sort.\" Mr O'Neill, MP for Ochil, added: \"There are a lot of dedicated professionals who might find it offensive to be asked what their religion was first and then be considered for employment. It would be a dangerous precedent to set.\"",

There were also suspicions about animals at a second farm in nearby Dunbar and tests were continuing. Neither farm was thought to have links with previously infected sites.</p> <p>The news will be a grievous blow to farming officials who had hoped to contain the outbreak in Dumfries and Galloway, the only part of Scotland with confirmed cases.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday dramatically stepped up its efforts to bring under control the escalating foot and mouth crisis with two new policies - burial for up to half a million sheep and slaughter on suspicion of the disease for new cases without the need to wait for laboratory tests. The army began digging a mass grave on a disused airstrip in Cumbria licensed to take the bodies of up to 500,000 sheep. The sheep will be brought in convoys from heavily infected zones nearby to be slaughtered and buried in the trenches at Great Orton, near Penrith. As Tony Blair today enters the week that will decide whether he can call a general election for May 3, the government was at pains to show it was coping with the crisis. Downing Street sought to portray Mr Blair as throwing his energies into tackling the crisis, \"bashing the phones\" and receiving regular updates from the agriculture secretary, Nick Brown. Senior ministers yesterday indicated that, while the prime minister has not taken a final decision, county council elections are still likely to take place as planned. But the crisis looked set to worsen - the disease spread to new areas of the country yesterday, ones particularly important for tourism. East Lothian, near Edinburgh, nearly 100 miles from the nearest other outbreak in Scotland, and Broughton-in-Furness, on the edge of the Lake District national park, were named by the government deputy chief vet, Martin Atkinson, as particularly worrying. The Broughton outbreak had jumped a buffer zone set up to keep vulnerable tourist areas safe. Mr Atkinson said Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Gal loway, at the opposite end of the county from existing outbreaks, and Northwich in Cheshire, and Nuneaton, Warwickshire, also confirmed cases in areas which had hoped to stay disease-free. There were 52 new cases over the weekend, including 47 yesterday, bringing the total to 607, including one case in Northern Ireland. Vets were authorised to slaughter on suspicion to speed up the killing once farmers had called to say they believed they had an outbreak. This is to fulfil Mr Blair's pledge to cut the time from diagnosis of foot and mouth to destruction of animals to less than 24 hours. Officials from the Scottish executive confirmed that a vet made a clinical diagnosis of foot and mouth at a farm near Haddington in East Lothian at the weekend and all 180 sheep were immediately destroyed without waiting for test results. There were also suspicions about animals at a second farm in nearby Dunbar and tests were continuing. Neither farm was thought to have links with previously infected sites. The news will be a grievous blow to farming officials who had hoped to contain the outbreak in Dumfries and Galloway, the only part of Scotland with confirmed cases. It will bring the crisis right to the doorstep of the executive, which has been accused of not acting decisively enough. \"There was no history of the disease in that area,\" said a spokesman for the executive yesterday. \"We just have to keep monitoring, keep an eye on that area to see what happens. If there are more cases, that would be very worrying.\" Wuffy McIntyre, a National Farmers' Union official from Dumfries and Galloway, said if the virus had spread north it would be a nightmare. \"If it is outside the south-west of Scotland, it is a huge worry. This place here is just a disaster. We're now talking about no livestock between Carlisle and Moffat.\" The grave being dug in Cumbria, almost certainly the largest ever disposal site for animal carcasses, is designed to allow the mass cull of animals in infected areas and provide buffer zones. Exactly how the government intends to do this is to be announced this week but already it has been decided that every farm next to an outbreak will be cleared. The government has a recommendation to kill every farm animal within two miles but up to now has shrunk from the idea of killing pedigree herds because of a backlash from farmers who fear the loss of bloodlines.

Army bulldozers frantically hollowed a series of muddy pits at a disused airfield at Great Orton, near Carlisle, as the number of confirmed cases in Cumbria rose to 215. The graves - each 150 metres long, 15 metres wide and four metres deep - will serve as the first mass burial ground for the thousands of diseased carcasses that have lain festering on farms in Cumbria over the past few days. Brigadier Alex Birtwistle, head of the army's operation in Cumbria, said the pit was licensed to bury up to 500,000 animals - first the backlog of carcasses, then live sheep from areas surrounding infected farms would be brought in and slaughtered humanely. The grim task of transporting the backlog of decomposing animals to the site in covered lorries is expected to begin today. The rotting carcasses will be taken from the farms and sealed in trucks to stop them spreading disease on their way to the airfield, and the wagons will be disinfected before leaving. The airfield will be scattered with lime to alter the soil's acidity to destroy the disease. The live sheep earmarked for slaughter as part of the three-kilometre (two-mile) pre-emptive cull were due to be killed at the airfield later this week, Mr Birtwistle said. \"In the first part of the cull we have about 500,000 sheep to take out of farms live and bring to be slaughtered in the most humane way - it is an apocalyptic task, this is a mass problem,\" he said. The slaughter had taken its toll on Cumbrian farmers' emotions. \"I can't tell you how much - I have had farmers in tears,\" he added. Jane Brown, coordinator of the Ministry of Agriculture's Cumbria operation, said she was encouraged that farmers were working with the ministry to ensure the burial of an imals went smoothly. The ministry said it intended to bury 200,000 at the Great Orton airfield. South of Carlisle, the first case of foot and mouth in the Lake District national park prompted panic that breeds of sheep crucial to the region's ecology could be lost forever, turning the picturesque grasslands of the Fells into shrublands. Meanwhile, in response to criticism about delays between farmers reporting potential foot and mouth and vets visiting the farm, and the subsequent order to destroy the animals, the ministry has decided on a policy of slaughter on suspicion. Previously if there was a doubt that animals had foot and mouth samples were taken and sent to the laboratory, with a vet returning the following day.

Chris Ingram, chairman of the group, said Tempus had \"confidence\" for the year ahead because only 11% of its revenue came from the US. \"While we are not immune to the effects of a slowdown in worldwide advertising growth, our European bias, increasing proportion of fee based income and distinctive position as a value added, strategic advisor, places us well ahead of our peers,\" said Mr Ingram. Exposure to the US market is seen as the kiss of death for companies involved in the advertising industry, as a near-recession across the Atlantic wreaks havoc with companies' marketing budgets. However, Tempus said it was well placed for 2001 after it decided to move away from its traditional role as a media agency and transform itself into an integrated client-led media and marketing group. The strategic shift appears to be paying off, with Tempus today announcing pre-tax profits for last year had climbed 29% to \u00a321.5m, with new business wins soaring 52% to \u00a3594m. \"Our new business performance in 2000 across the group was strong and the full effect of this will impact in the current year,\" added Mr Ingram. Tempus was boosted by strong contributions from the three consultancy businesses it bought last year - Added Value, BrownKSDP and Outrider. The companies are key to the much-hyped Tempus partners project, which manages clients' needs on a \"tailormade\" basis. Tempus partners has already won business from Vodafone and Coca-Cola, which the parent group described as a \"validation of our vision.\"",

      "bodyText": "While Tony Blair tries to make up his mind about the date of the general election, staffers in Labour's Millbank headquarters are facing an equally difficult dilemma - which song to choose as the party's official campaign anthem. In 1997 New Labour soared to power on the back of D:Ream's Things Can Only Get Better. This time round, a senior party insider on the campaign team has confirmed that the choice has come down to two tunes: Primal Scream's Movin' On Up and Lifted by the British soul band the Lighthouse Family. \"They're both in the running,\" he said. \"We tried one two weeks ago but still haven't made a final decision.\" Lifted was played recently at a Labour party gala fund raising dinner in London. The choice is between a radical option - Primal Scream's funky dub sound and chill out lyrics - and a safe one, the Lighthouse Family's feelgood soul tune. The latter is certain to appeal more to middle England - but whether either will win back Labour's disillusioned heartland support is unclear. Primal Scream's Movin' On Up hit the charts 10 years ago when it was associated with the ecstasy-fuelled acid house revolution of the early 1990s. It comes from the Scottish band's 1991 hit album Screamadelica. The song's lyrics include the couplet: \"I was blind, now I can see / You made a believer, out of me.\" Primal Scream are signed to the Creation label, whose founder Alan McGee donated money to Labour's 1997 campaign but has now turned his back on the party. Meanwhile the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats have already made their choices. The Tories have commissioned a song from composer Mike Batt after a row over the party's use of a Massive Attack song, which the band complained they had not been consulted over. The tune, Heartland, will be used at election campaign rallies and to introduce leader William Hague. Mike Batt is more famous for penning the lines: \"underground, overground, wombling free/ the Wombles of Wimbledon, common are we\". \"This shows the difference between the parties - the Tories have an awkward pre-pubescent feel to them with their Wombles song, whereas Primal Scream are very funky,\" said the Labour MP Paul Flynn. Not to be outdone, the Liberal Democrats have their own tune, a cover of Boyzone star Stephen Gately's song New Beginning, unveiled at their spring conference earlier this month. Labour is set to make a decision on which to use in the next few days. A spokesman for the party dismissed earlier reports that the campaign was dropping any proposals to use S Club 7 after the three male members of the band were caught smoking cannabis in a Covent Garden street last week.

As they trickled in to work, unaware of the fate that lay in store, they started to realise something more severe than the sale of the internet service provider ic24 was on the cards. </p> <p>Suspicions were first aroused when Graham Mead, the recently appointed managing director of the IC Network, started calling senior staff in four at a time at 15-minute intervals between 8.30am and 9.30am. The look on their faces after their little chats with Mead said it all, according to the gathered onlookers, and it wasn't long until the awful truth came out. </p> <p>A staff meeting was called for 9.30am where they were told that the rumours about the sale of the ISP side of the business were true.

      "bodyText": "Thursday March 15 was one of those cold and rainy mornings, not unlike every other miserable day in March. But for Trinity Mirror Digital staff it took an unexpected turn for the worse. As they trickled in to work, unaware of the fate that lay in store, they started to realise something more severe than the sale of the internet service provider ic24 was on the cards. Suspicions were first aroused when Graham Mead, the recently appointed managing director of the IC Network, started calling senior staff in four at a time at 15-minute intervals between 8.30am and 9.30am. The look on their faces after their little chats with Mead said it all, according to the gathered onlookers, and it wasn't long until the awful truth came out. A staff meeting was called for 9.30am where they were told that the rumours about the sale of the ISP side of the business were true. But the news that caused most ripples was that the members of the board had let their nerves about internet revenues get the better of them. They had decided to close the brand spanking new, and very expensive, websites icShowbiz and icSport post-haste, and redundancies would be inevitable. About 60 of them were immediately told to go off and garden (vacate the premises and await their fate) and security suddenly appeared from nowhere, in case anyone forgot the location of the door. The remaining 240 were asked to stay for the time being and keep the flagship sites, ic24.net, Mirror.co.uk, DailyRecord.co.uk and the regional ic portals, icScotland and icBirmingham, to name a few, afloat.

As the woman who popularised Mother's Day in America knew, valuing the sacrifices mothers make doesn't go well with the idea of paying for what you get. Mothers do what they do because they think it's right, not because they expect something in exchange.

Parenting is one of those things we do to be good people, but we need to have this sort of motivation validated to keep it going. </p> <p>We need it confirmed that this more moral motivation is alive and well because without confirmation people will continue to opt out: why not outsource the job of being a mother to someone who can do it more efficiently while we concentrate on our core business of making money? We increasingly prefer to get other people to do our parenting instead of us. Very nearly half of all pre-school children have other carers as well as their parents. More than two-thirds of women with a child under five do some paid work (80% where the youngest child is between five and 10 years old). </p> <p>Motherhood has suffered a huge drop in status since the 1950s and this means fewer people want to do it. There are twice as many child-free young women as there were a generation ago. As a result, we have a rapidly ageing population and even the people who have kids spend less and less time actually being mothers. They put it off until later in their lives and then they spend, on average, 45 minutes a day looking after their children or playing with them. In fact mothering takes less than 20% of the time the average woman spends watching TV (for fathers the figure is under 10%). </p> <p>These figures will not surprise readers of Arlie Hochschild (The Time Bind, Henry Holt &amp; Co) who shows how families squeeze in the demands of work by cutting down on the time spent parenting. The families studied by Hochschild regimented their kids according to strict time discipline, used technology to make parenting less intensive (who doesn't use the TV to babysit?), and lowered their general expectations of what families could actually do together. </p> <p>Along with other sociologists, Hochschild shows that mothers feel undervalued and demoralised. Of course everyone is demoralised these days: there are demoralised teachers, demoralised doctors, not to mention the social workers who have been demoralised for decades. Demoralisation is all about not feeling valued and this certainly applies to social workers as much as to mothers, and with the same effects. It is no surprise that motherhood and the professions have other things in common. Even more so than the work of public-sector professionals, the contributions of parents cannot be valued in terms of inputs and outputs, in fact the outcomes cannot be reliably measured at all. Valuing motherhood means valuing something that cannot be cashed out. </p> <p>The idea behind Mother's Day is to honour people for their attempt to be good people rather than to reward their contribution to society. To persuade people that parenting is a good idea we need to revalidate the logic of doing the right thing and this is where the relaunch comes in. The American version of Mother's Day (celebrated on the second Sunday in May) was thought up by Anna Jarvis in 1905 as a way of recognising the real value of motherhood. </p> <p>The success of Mother's Day in America - 96% of consumers take part and buy, among other things, 132m cards (Hallmark Research) - suggests Anna Jarvis achieved all she wanted. But she actually spent the last 40 years of her life trying to put a stop to Mother's Day; indeed one of her protests against its commercialisation got her arrested for disturbing the peace. </p> <p>The old English Mothering Sunday and Anna Jarvis's ideas were very similar: families and communities would get together in Church to \"honour\" mums. This is why it made sense to have Mother's Day on a Sunday, but of course only a tiny minority of us go to church now. It would be a potent symbol of the importance we attach to motivation that isn't commercial if we made Mother's Day a weekday public holiday. That would be one in the eye for commercial logic. Mother's Day on a Monday would be a perennial reminder that we value that other sort of motivation enough to take a whole day off from making money in order to celebrate it. </p> <p>Ralph Fevre is the author of The Demoralization of Western Culture (Continuum, \u00a313.99). </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

In his first role outside Albert Square for a decade, the actor will star in Murder in Mind, a feature-length psychological thriller. The deal gives McFadden the opportunity his former co-star Ross Kemp never received and is part of the BBC's effort to stop its home-grown talent switching sides. Kemp quit EastEnders and defected to ITV in a \u00a32m deal after his repeated pleas for a new challenge fell on deaf ears at the corporation. McFadden plays one of Albert Square's best-loved characters, hardman Phil Mitchell. He is currently at the centre of one of the soap's biggest storylines after being shot on his doorstep. The BBC's renewed drive in drama comes comes just weeks after it killed off Sunday night drama Ballykissangel. At the time rivals at ITV including drama controller Nick Elliott warned the corporation needed to \"have courage\" and keep its best dramas on Sunday night. The BBC's sense of impotence on Sunday nights was compounded by the corporation's decision to move one of its most successful dramas, Clocking Off, from a Sunday night to a midweek slot.

      "bodyText": "BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey has unveiled a \u00a3253m spring/summer schedule with 20% more drama than in the same period last year. The BBC1 drama line-up for spring/summer 2001 includes 14 new and returning shows and an extra \u00a311m investment compared with last year. The season also features Son of God, a documentary series presented by Jeremy Bowen that brings the story of Jesus to life, including a computer-generated impression of what he may have looked like. Other new BBC1 shows include the Savages, a new Simon Nye sitcom starring Geoffrey Palmer; and Dog Eat Dog, a team gameshow hosted by Ulrika Jonsson. Detectives, investigators, policing and suspense feature heavily in the new BBC1 drama line-up. It includes the Whistle-Blower, a thriller from ER writer Patrick Harbinson starring Amanda Burton, Neil Pearson and Bill Paterson. In a similar vein is Murder in Mind, a series of psychological TV film thrillers, one of which features EastEnders' Steve McFadden in his first role outside the soap in a decade. A third new thriller, Messiah: the First Killings, stars Ken Stott as a detective hunting a serial killer in London. Ricky Tomlinson stars as a Liverpudlian private eye in Nice Guy Eddie and Mersey Beat features Hadyn Gwynne as a north west-based police superintendent. The Fabulous Bagel Boys stars Denis Lawson and former EastEnders actor Michael French in Glasgow-set drama billed as combining \"investigative policing with the manic hubbub of the local deli\". In entertainment, Ian Wright takes over from Ant and Dec fronting the third series of Friends Like These, while Richard Wilson takes his first new BBC1 sitcom role since One Foot in the Grave with Other Animals. BBC1 factual offerings include Ewan McGregor joining survival expert Ray Mears for a gruelling central American jungle journey in Trips Money Can't Buy. Spring and summer sporting highlights will include the return of bigtime boxing to BBC1, with Lennox Lewis and Audley Harrison fights, as well as the channel's traditional coverage of Wimbledon, with John McEnroe again joining the commentary team.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>March 26:</strong> The media awards season seems to get longer, more trivial and gaudier with each turn of the calendar, writes <strong>Emily Bell</strong>.</p>",
      "byline": "Emily Bell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This is the time of year when those with stout hearts, sharp swords and a nice frock look forward to walking on to a podium, as the world showers them with glittering prizes. </p> <p>Awards season for the media, like Christmas, seems to get longer, more trivial and gaudier with each turn of the calendar. That is, of course, unless your shelves groan with gongs, in which case there is a warm glow of peer-group validation that hangs over your organisation with a heady aura. All stem from the Oscars - the blueprint for every awards ceremony from \"best glazing salesperson in the East Midlands\", to our very own Baftas. </p> <p>Every creative discipline now has a raft of opportunities to sashay into the Grosvenor House Hotel or the Hyde Park Hilton, to wait with enormous anticipation for \"The Best Campaign for a Bus Shelter\" to be called and acclaimed. In fact, the pomp of the ceremony is usually inversely proportional to the greatness of the prize. </p> <p>If you are lucky enough to have designed the best point-of-sale material for a petrol station, you are likely to be carried shoulder high through swaying crowds on a golden sedan chair to receive a platinum monolith ringed by rampant lions and unicorns. If, however, you receive the Turner prize, arguably Britain's most prestigious award for creative achievement, the Tate gallery director, Nicholas Serota, will stand on a wobbly box under kitchen-bright lighting while a small number of onlookers clap politely as a small envelope is handed over. </p> <p>The press enjoyed its own Oscars last week with the British Press Awards, arriving in its usual hail of disco lights and thunderous techno. It would be easy and cheap to spend the rest of the column in an extended \"we was robbed\" tirade, but the fact is it wasn't really a \"broadsheet year\", with the tabs taking most of the top honours. Our own Emma Brockes picking up Young Journalist of the Year was highly pleasing, as it is just about the only category where there is no chance of the award being interpreted as Buggins' turn. </p> <p>Although nobody in the press would openly admit it, we are all deeply grateful to Press Gazette for designing an evening where you can, if you so desire, spend many hours bitching and moaning, or celebrating, with your peers. But as we are often told, and were reminded again this year by a dour Michael Parkinson, it is OUR awards, where we celebrate the craft of journalism. Yet the style of the BPAs, like the profession it is meant to celebrate, has erred to the frustratingly inarticulate and bland. </p> <p>Parky, a joke-free, joy-free zone, told us there would be no jumping up on stage by anyone other than winners, and no acceptance speeches. He could have added that there would be no commendations this year, no reading from the winning entries, no pictures of short-listed candidates and examples of their work. More depressingly, there was no citation for Auberon Waugh or John Diamond, no mention of the PCC's 10th anniversary, no reflection, funny or grave, on the state of the free press in the UK. No sobering reminders of the people who risk their lives to do our jobs in less pleasant places. No gravitas, no humour, no crossword. In fact, no working journalist, apart from the editor of PG, was allowed to utter a single syllable into the microphone all evening. It was the only awards ceremony I have ever been to where, far from being celebrated, the craft in question was comprehensively buried. </p> <p> This may, of course, have been down to past years where tempers have frayed and fists flown, albeit in the bar afterwards.

      "bodyText": "This is the time of year when those with stout hearts, sharp swords and a nice frock look forward to walking on to a podium, as the world showers them with glittering prizes. Awards season for the media, like Christmas, seems to get longer, more trivial and gaudier with each turn of the calendar. That is, of course, unless your shelves groan with gongs, in which case there is a warm glow of peer-group validation that hangs over your organisation with a heady aura. All stem from the Oscars - the blueprint for every awards ceremony from \"best glazing salesperson in the East Midlands\", to our very own Baftas. Every creative discipline now has a raft of opportunities to sashay into the Grosvenor House Hotel or the Hyde Park Hilton, to wait with enormous anticipation for \"The Best Campaign for a Bus Shelter\" to be called and acclaimed. In fact, the pomp of the ceremony is usually inversely proportional to the greatness of the prize. If you are lucky enough to have designed the best point-of-sale material for a petrol station, you are likely to be carried shoulder high through swaying crowds on a golden sedan chair to receive a platinum monolith ringed by rampant lions and unicorns. If, however, you receive the Turner prize, arguably Britain's most prestigious award for creative achievement, the Tate gallery director, Nicholas Serota, will stand on a wobbly box under kitchen-bright lighting while a small number of onlookers clap politely as a small envelope is handed over. The press enjoyed its own Oscars last week with the British Press Awards, arriving in its usual hail of disco lights and thunderous techno. It would be easy and cheap to spend the rest of the column in an extended \"we was robbed\" tirade, but the fact is it wasn't really a \"broadsheet year\", with the tabs taking most of the top honours. Our own Emma Brockes picking up Young Journalist of the Year was highly pleasing, as it is just about the only category where there is no chance of the award being interpreted as Buggins' turn. Although nobody in the press would openly admit it, we are all deeply grateful to Press Gazette for designing an evening where you can, if you so desire, spend many hours bitching and moaning, or celebrating, with your peers. But as we are often told, and were reminded again this year by a dour Michael Parkinson, it is OUR awards, where we celebrate the craft of journalism. Yet the style of the BPAs, like the profession it is meant to celebrate, has erred to the frustratingly inarticulate and bland. Parky, a joke-free, joy-free zone, told us there would be no jumping up on stage by anyone other than winners, and no acceptance speeches. He could have added that there would be no commendations this year, no reading from the winning entries, no pictures of short-listed candidates and examples of their work. More depressingly, there was no citation for Auberon Waugh or John Diamond, no mention of the PCC's 10th anniversary, no reflection, funny or grave, on the state of the free press in the UK. No sobering reminders of the people who risk their lives to do our jobs in less pleasant places. No gravitas, no humour, no crossword. In fact, no working journalist, apart from the editor of PG, was allowed to utter a single syllable into the microphone all evening. It was the only awards ceremony I have ever been to where, far from being celebrated, the craft in question was comprehensively buried. This may, of course, have been down to past years where tempers have frayed and fists flown, albeit in the bar afterwards. Sponsors were appalled and pulled out, apparently. But this year we even missed the alarming sight of the Sunday People editor, Neil Wallis, storming the stage to protest at, well, everything. The organisers could even pace the evening and hand out prizes in two bitesize chunks so that individual awards arrived between the side of beef and fruit flan, with the big team awards and paper of the year coming at the end. This would avoid the small problem of creating an atmosphere of bar-room barracking before even the business journo of the year has risen to his feet. Awards, of course, essentially don't matter until you win one. But the BPAs represent the one night of the year when the entire spectrum of the print community is gathered in one place.

      "bodyText": "Ulster Television will escape the worst of the ITV advertising slump this year, having missed the boom in dot.com spending over the past 12 months. The company is one of the last standalone ITV franchises. Announcing its full-year results, Ulster Television said it was not suffering from bad year-on-year advertising revenue figures because it had been largely ignored in the internet marketing frenzy. \"As we did not benefit from the substantial increase in dot.com advertising expenditure last year, we are less likely to be affected by any retreat that may happen this year,\" said John McGuckian, chairman of Ulster Television. Ulster's advertising revenue increased by 6.4% in 2000, compared with ITV's 5% (the latter was hit by a drop-off in internet marketing at the end of the year). The ITV advertising market is in recession, with revenues down by around 9% so far this year. However, Ulster expects to increase its share of ITV advertising income in 2001 thanks to growing ratings and an advertising market that stretches to London, Belfast and Dublin. Ulster's full-year results showed a surge in pre-tax profits - from \u00a37.8m to \u00a327m - although the figure included a \u00a313.4m one-off payment from selling a stake in satellite giant Societe Europeenne des Satellites. Turnover increased from \u00a338m to \u00a340.8m, a rise of 6.5%, with advertising providing \u00a337.4m of that total. Ulster has joined a consortium comprising Sky News, CBS, Bloomberg and Chrysalis in a bid to oust ITN from the ITV news contract. The company said it expects to complete negotiations with the network by the autumn.",

      "body": "<p>Two of the most theatrical of recent libel actions have concerned politicians: the Aitken and Hamilton cases against this paper. Now we have the prospect of a third with trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers bringing an action against the Daily Mail, Tom Bower and his publishers, over the serialisation of Bower's book about Geoffrey Robinson. </p> <p>Is this going to be another hugely expensive, time-consuming action over the type of allegation that every politician should regard as part and parcel of public life? Should Byers even have the right to sue? </p> <p>Most press comment has so far focused on the apparent attempt by him to use an extremely effective tool of the libel litigant - putting booksellers on notice of his claim and in that way bringing them into the loop of liability if his claim were to be successful. The ability to use this tactic, disgraced by Robert Maxwell, is at odds with a general respect for freedom of information and, in particular, with Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights which deals with freedom of expression. </p> <p>One of the effects of Article 10 is to make it practically impossible for a claimant to obtain an injunction prior to trial which would prevent an allegedly defamatory publication from being published.

      "bodyText": "Two of the most theatrical of recent libel actions have concerned politicians: the Aitken and Hamilton cases against this paper. Now we have the prospect of a third with trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers bringing an action against the Daily Mail, Tom Bower and his publishers, over the serialisation of Bower's book about Geoffrey Robinson. Is this going to be another hugely expensive, time-consuming action over the type of allegation that every politician should regard as part and parcel of public life? Should Byers even have the right to sue? Most press comment has so far focused on the apparent attempt by him to use an extremely effective tool of the libel litigant - putting booksellers on notice of his claim and in that way bringing them into the loop of liability if his claim were to be successful. The ability to use this tactic, disgraced by Robert Maxwell, is at odds with a general respect for freedom of information and, in particular, with Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights which deals with freedom of expression. One of the effects of Article 10 is to make it practically impossible for a claimant to obtain an injunction prior to trial which would prevent an allegedly defamatory publication from being published. Putting booksellers or newsagents on notice, however, has all the hallmarks of an injunction (preventing publication) without any of the risk. A party seeking an injunction is responsible for the bookseller's lost revenue if the claimant turns out to be wrong. The introduction of the Human Rights Act seems to have made little difference. WH Smith is reported to have withdrawn the Bower book and any libel practitioner knows that the best way to remove a defamatory article on the internet is to put the internet service provider on notice under the same rule. Most ISPs pull the plug on the site or article very quickly. The answer is to make the obligations associated with putting a publisher on notice the same as those associated with obtaining an injunction - so that if Byers does not sue or fails in his suit he should bear the burden of the profit WH Smith has lost in withdrawing the Bower book because of his unwarranted (as it then turns out) threat.

      "body": "<p>Jason Fraser, the new executive director of Express Newspapers, and his boss Richard Desmond are perfectly suited. Both of them are in denial. The former hates being called what he is: a paparazzo. The latter hates being called what he is: a pornographer. </p> <p>Joining forces therefore is logical. The celebrity-stalking sneak photographer will provide juicy product for the man who, while claiming to have cleaned up his act, is in the process of trashing a newspaper. </p> <p>Fraser's first contribution to the Daily Express since joining - pictures of actors Emma Thompson and Greg Wise with their baby daughter - was a classic illustration of his work and also the deceit which underlies his defence of it. </p> <p>One of the pictures, taken while Thompson and Wise were on holiday in Cyprus, showed the couple with their daughter, Gaia, on a beach. Two more, one of which appeared on the front page, were of Thompson alone on the beach. A fourth showed Wise with Gaia in a hotel pool. They were taken by Mario Brenna, one of the most active of the various paparazzi marketed by Fraser through his agency. He rarely goes out on shoots nowadays, but he invariably provides the essential information on the whereabouts of his star victims, and then insists that his byline appears when the pictures are published. </p> <p>When I have protested in the past about the use of these grainy, telephoto shots, pointing to the editors' code of practice which outlaws \"the use of long lens photography to take pictures of people in private places without their consent\", Fraser - and the papers which have regularly used his work - have offered two justifications. </p> <p>First, sticking to the letter of the code, they say that public beaches are not private places. Even if the victims, again quoting from the code, believe they have \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" because they are thousands of miles from home and are not seeking publicity, they forfeit any protection by disporting themselves on a public beach. </p> <p> Second, and here comes Fraser's favourite escape clause, is the suggestion that the supposed victims are complicit. They take part in the pretence that they have been snapped unawares for publicity reasons. That is why, according to Fraser, there have never been any complaints about his pictures to the press complaints commission. </p> <p>Though I have little doubt that some people do indeed reach secret agreements with Fraser, and others are probably relaxed about being photographed, the suggestion of widespread complicity smears those who are genuine victims. </p> <p>My firm understanding is that Thompson did not give any permission to any photographer to take the shots of her, and I would not be in the least surprised if she did make a formal complaint to the PCC. </p> <p>Apart from the intrusion into her privacy - hotels are not public places - she might also consider a complaint under the clause which protects children being photographed \"without the consent of a parent\". </p> <p>Even if she does complain, and even if she is successful in winning an adjudication, it would still rely on a narrow interpretation of the code and doesn't come close to ending the whole sordid nonsense of sneak photography. </p> <p>Going on the precedent of last month's PCC adjudication following the complaint by Anna Ford about pictures of her which appeared in the Daily Mail and OK! magazine, the main picture of Thompson, Wise and their child would escape censure. Surely, that is unfair and entirely against the spirit of the code. </p> <p>Ford's case is particularly relevant. She and her friend, the former astronaut, David Scott, were pictured sunbathing while on holiday in Majorca with her teenage children. </p> <p>Ford explained: \"We deliberately chose a small, unpretentious family hotel right at the end of the beach... away from the crowds.\" She believed, erroneously but sincerely, that the beach in front of the hotel was private. As far as she was concerned, and I agree, she therefore had \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\". </p> <p>But the PCC found against her, stating that though it understood she and Scott were \"uncomfortable at having been photographed... it could do nothing more than apply strictly the terms of the code\". </p> <p>That's an interesting phrase, is it not? It might just have been possible to have applied the code strictly on behalf of Ford by supporting her \"reasonable expectation of privacy\". More pertinently, I think the code needs rewording to stop the abuse. On the other hand, I realise the implications of finding in Ford's favour: if routine newspaper pictures of \"ordinary members of the public\" on a beach or in the street were allowed, it would suggest that celebrities were getting special protection. </p> <p>Ford is now trying to obtain a judicial review of the PCC's decision. Her lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, will have to convince a judge that the PCC has failed to follow its procedures correctly. Before he does that, he will need to show that the delay in going to court is justified. </p> <p>I understand that the PCC is fairly relaxed about this unprecedented legal move, believing that it cannot be judicially reviewed. If it is, of course, the implications are far-reaching because it calls into question the validity of press self-regulation. Nor is this the only challenge the PCC is facing. In a separate development, two people are also hoping to obtain a judicial review because the PCC refused to adjudicate on their complaint. </p> <p>Ann and Derek Taylor are the parents of two women, Lisa and Michelle, who were convicted in 1992 of murdering Alison Shaughnessy, wife of Michelle's former lover. Less than a year later, the sisters were freed after the court of appeal decided that \"sensational, inaccurate and misleading\" press coverage had seriously prejudiced their trial. He quashed the murder convictions, pointing out that the police's failure to disclose evidence also rendered the convictions unsafe. Indeed, all the evidence against them had been flimsy. </p> <p>But in June last year, the Daily Mail carried a three-page so-called \"damning dossier\" by Jo Ann Goodwin headlined \"Why I believe they are murderers\". The article was based largely on the \"evidence\" of Bernard O'Mahoney, described as \"a 40-year- old gangster who makes no secret of his background\". </p> <p>He had previously befriended the Taylor sisters and, after their release, had an affair with Michelle. After an acrimonious split with her, he later claimed that he had discovered a letter which proved Michelle's guilt, and that she had also confessed to him. Michelle vehemently denied this in a later court action. </p> <p>In spite of this, Goodwin's article accepted O'Mahoney's version of events. According to investigative journalist Nick Davies, who has written widely about the case, her piece \"essentially consisted of a highly partisan reworking of the prosecution case\". </p> <p>He and the Taylor family were outraged that the Mail had given the Taylors very little time to respond to O'Mahoney's allegations. Goodwin called Mrs Taylor the day before publication and had only a brief conversation with her. The result was a one-sided article. </p> <p>Davies supported the Taylors' complaint to the PCC and was as astonished as they were when the commission announced months later, following several exchanges of letters, that it was not able to adjudicate. </p> <p>It cited several reasons: it was unable to decide in a complex case where the truth lay, it was worried about overlapping legal moves, and it thought the proper course was for the case to be adjudicated by a court, as the Taylors could take libel proceedings. </p> <p>Let's look briefly at those excuses, sorry reasons. No one was expecting the PCC to sit in judgment on a murder case. What was at issue was whether Goodwin and the Mail had published a fair and accurate article. </p> <p>There were no legal moves, so that is a red herring. As for the idea of suing for libel, they had no money to do so. Later, the PCC announced it was refusing to accept their complaint because it came from a third party. Why weren't the Taylors told that at the outset? Anyway, they are named in the article and, as leading members of the Taylor 2 campaign, they are materially involved. </p> <p>There is one further point which links the Taylors to Anna Ford and may well also affect Emma Thompson should she complain. The PCC makes much of the fact that it is not a court. It does not hold oral hearings. It does not have powers of investigation. </p> <p>But I cannot help noticing - and there have been other cases I have championed where this has been the case - that when complaints are not upheld, or there is a failure to adjudicate, the PCC is inclined to offer a very narrow, overtly legalistic interpretation of the editors' code. </p> <p>By sticking firmly to the wording as a defence of newspapers' activities, rather than applying the spirit of a code designed to help the public, the PCC is endangering its reputation. </p> <p>What complainants are so concerned about is journalistic ethics. It's a denial of press freedom to ban the picturing of celebrities on public beaches. But does it mean that a well-known person can never be free from a prying camera? Where is the respect for private and family life accorded by the European Convention of Human Rights? </p> <p>OK, so a journalist should have the freedom to write a heavily biased report accusing people of murder. But should it mean that papers bear no burden of responsibility, losing all sense of fairness? </p> <p>After the hype of its tenth birthday bash, the PCC - and the editors' code committee - need to think deeply about their role. </p> <p>It would be richly ironic, would it not, if a changed code outlawed the very pictures which have resulted in Jason Fraser's preposterous \u00a31m appointment to the Express?</p>",

But 12 months on and \u00a34m later, Granada has finally admitted viewers couldn't care less about their internet venture G-wizz. The company is finally pulling the plug on the much-hyped internet service provider - the site today is advising users there are now just \"two days to go\". The closure of the portal and internet service provider is an embarrassing climbdown for Granada, which spent \u00a34m on marketing the brand last year. It follows similar retrenchments by other media groups including Trinity Mirror and News International. G-wizz was always seen a risky experiment as it moved Granada into the unfamiliar territory of internet access provision. On Wednesday the company will close down the service and encourage users to subscribe to BT Internet. The digital division of Granada Media has also finally admitted it has abandoned plans to take on BSkyB and OnDigital with a service providing internet access through the TV set. The company had been expected to launch its Granada PowerChannel last July after investing more than \u00a313.5m in the project. It was a partnership with a an internet research group which subsidised the cost of the special set-top boxes which were in turn supposed to be distributed by Granada's rental network. Granada however will now focus all its energies on programme-branded websites. It has admitted that viewers do not make the connection between its top programmes including Coronation Street and G-wizz and will not concentrate on developing services with an obvious tie-in with its big programmes such as popstarsonline.net, Ccronationstreet.co.uk and ThisMorning.co.uk. Its decision is part of a wider internet strategy to build up an ITV internet service. In future it will work with Carlton TV to build up itv.co.uk. In a tacit admission that ITV has failed to capitalise on its brand online, the two companies have decided to pool resources in an attempt to compete with bbc.co.uk which has become one of the most popular sites in the world. Granada PowerChannel has been beset by technical problems since unveiling plans to develop a TV internet box last April. The decision to axe the PowerChannel TV internet box has been known internally for some time, but this is the first time Granada has publicly admitted the plan. Granada Broadband now has to demonstrate it can start to make money from new media ventures, having spent almost \u00a320m in 2000 and recouped a little less than \u00a31m. Just over \u00a39m of this was spent on G-wizz alone. Related stories Sep 25: Granada Broadband purchases 37% share in SwapitShop Oct 9: Royles lined up for PowerChannel push Useful link g-wizz.net",

Because the virus is prone to mutate, its resistance to some of the drugs used has steadily grown. If patients do not rigidly comply with the treatment, taking exact doses at precise times and sticking to dietary regimes, the virus mutates, the treatment fails, and the patient may become sick. </p> <p>A combination of three drugs, known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy or Haart, is the norm.

      "bodyText": "The UK is to take part in an international trial to find how to combat a possible resurgence of Aids in the west, as resistance grows to the drugs given people who are HIV-positive. While HIV/Aids spreads across Africa, complacency has grown in the US and Europe because of the powerful if expensive medicines that are readily available. But anti-retroviral drugs only suppress the virus; they cannot destroy it or prevent others getting it. Because the virus is prone to mutate, its resistance to some of the drugs used has steadily grown. If patients do not rigidly comply with the treatment, taking exact doses at precise times and sticking to dietary regimes, the virus mutates, the treatment fails, and the patient may become sick. A combination of three drugs, known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy or Haart, is the norm. But with growing resistance to the drugs in the west, a major trial called Optima (options in management with anti-retrovirals) is to start in the UK, the US and Canada. It will test whether using a cocktail of five or more drugs is an improvement on three.

Now he paces its grounds pointing at buildings that are being gutted or mothballed. </p> <p>The hospital is being down-sized under NHS plans that promise to raise standards of care. But the plans have evoked fierce resistance from a diehard band of campaigners who call themselves Health Concern. </p> <p>Two years ago, Health Concern stopped the futile business of raising petitions and took to the ballot box. </p> <p>It was a last resort and it worked. They won seven seats in elections to Wyre Forest district council, which covers the towns of Kidderminster, Stourport-on-Severn and Bewdley. </p> <p>\"I'll never forget the feeling when the first result came up,\" Dr Taylor recalled. \"We suddenly realised that it was possible. That evening was absolutely electric.\" </p> <p>Last year they took another 11 council seats, making them the largest member of the ruling Rainbow Alliance, and reducing the Labour vote to less than 20%. </p> <p>Now Dr Taylor, 66, a retired consultant, is challenging Labour incumbent David Lock, who took Wyre Forest with a majority of nearly 7,000 in the 1997 landslide. Mr Lock is understandably anxious. </p> <p>The MP, a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor's department, whose wife practises as a GP locally, accuses Health Concern of distorting the facts to whip up alarm among the voters of Kidderminster. </p> <p>\"Local people are not taken in by campaigners who try to pretend they know more about the health service than doctors, nurses and the health authority,\" he insisted. </p> <p>Dr Taylor appeals to tradition, with all the patriarchal dignity of the old-style consultant. </p> <p>\"The hospital is woven into the fabric of Kidderminster life,\" he said. \"There has been a hospital here since 1920. It has been supported by the people all the way through - the [hospital's] League of Friends has raised between \u00a32.5m and \u00a33m in the last decade.\" </p> <p>Last September, Kidderminster's accident and emergency facilities were downgraded to a minor injuries unit. Its in-patient facilities were closed. This meant that any blue light emergency cases would have to travel 18 miles to Worcester royal infirmary. </p> <p>In February that decision had fatal consequences when a pensioner, John Jones, who lived five minutes from Kidderminster hospital, had a heart attack. </p> <p>The ambulance drove past Kidderminster's closed A&amp;E on a 50 minute journey to Worcester, where Mr Jones was pronounced dead after 20 minutes. </p> <p>The tragedy was grist to Health Concern's mill; a deeply emotive case that appeared to encapsulate the human cost of Kidderminster hospital's demise. </p> <p>But while the loss of services at Kidderminster has made for politics with instant appeal, not all the facts stack up on Dr Taylor's side. </p> <p>The hospital is being downsized for two reasons. The first is financial; in 1997, Worcestershire health authority was driven to reform all health services in the area to help resolve a multi-million pound deficit. </p> <p>The reforms turned on axeing in-patient services at Kidderminster in exchange for building a state-of-the-art hospital that will open in Worcester next April. </p> <p>The second reason was medical. Around 10 years ago, according to a consultant who worked there, junior doctors at Kidderminster were working well over 100 hours a week. </p> <p>After years of campaigning, moves to reduce junior doctors' hours were brought in. But that made providing cover at the small hospital increasingly difficult. </p> <p>Supporters of the changes say that providing the kind of intensive staffing levels needed for an accident and emergency department was rapidly becoming impossible. </p> <p>A bigger regional centre also offered patients a wider choice of specialists familiar with the latest techniques in each field. </p> <p>James Goodman, chairman of the Wyre Forest GPs' Association, said: \"We didn't necessarily fully support the changes at the start of the process. But after a lot of negotiation we had to agree that it was the only effective way forward. It finally came down to staffing; the need to have more specialists, and the increasing problem of junior doctors' hours.\" </p> <p>Turning the clock back now is impossible, he believes. The new Worcester facilities will be better and safer than the old Kidderminster hospital. </p> <p>The case of John Jones was a \"terrible tragedy\", he concedes. \"But these cases do happen. Even if Kidderminster had been open, the outcome might not have been different.\" </p> <p>For all the arguments against him, Dr Taylor's campaign has the powerful emotional appeal of the outsider. </p> <p>If elected, it will be a rare victory for a candidate without the backing of a big party machine, following in the footsteps of Martin Bell, who is at present Britain's only independent MP. </p> <p>\"I think we have started a revolt against the major party political system. If we achieve an MP we will send a signal to other areas to say that they can do something by having independent people running.\" </p> <p>And he has indeed sent a signal. In Dudley, where Unison is about to embark on its 12th strike against a private finance initiative (PFI) scheme to redevelop the town's hospitals, campaigners are also turning to the ballot box. </p> <p>Angela Thompson, a hospital catering worker and Unison branch secretary, threatens to dent Labour's majority by standing as a Socialist Alliance candidate against privatisation. </p> <p>Back in Wyre Forest, Clive Joyce, editor of the local paper, notes that complaints from readers about the NHS have mushroomed since Kidderminster's A&amp;E department closed. </p> <p>Letters have flooded in bemoaning long waits on trolleys in the outdated facilities of Worcester royal infirmary. </p> <p>This hospital's main buildings at Castle Street and Ronkswood in Worcester will also be replaced by the new PFI hospital, when it opens. </p> <p>\"They are not coping at Worcester,\" Mr Joyce said. \"In the health authority's defence, they have had to bring the plan forward. </p> <p>\"It was intended to down grade Kidderminster when the new Worcester hospital comes on-stream in 2002. </p> <p>\"But by announcing that Kidderminster was virtually going to be turned into a cottage hospital, that led to a crisis in staffing.

      "body": "<p>Last night's Oscars signalled much more than another glossy night out for the Hollywood elite. Worried eyes focused not on the shortlist for best picture, but the ad breaks between the speeches. News had seeped out that the broadcaster - ABC - was having trouble filling its premium ad slots in the biggest show of the year. As an illustration of the scale of the advertising downturn sweeping the US it could not have been more dramatic. If the make-up and shampoo commercials are deserting the Oscars then truly nothing is sacred. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at an overseas sales conference, ITV's ad sales directors were trying to dispel alarmist talk that the full-blown contagion had spread to the UK by predicting a revival in the second half of this year. </p> <p>But on Thursday, one of the country's largest radio groups, Capital Radio, issued a profits warning - confirmation that conditions were worsening. Ralph Bernard, chief executive of rival GWR, had to watch his own share price slide in sympathy, though the Classic FM operator is still showing double-digit growth. \"I can't give you any predictions,\" he said last week, \"I simply don't know.\" </p> <p>There are all sorts of reasons why the ad market is suffering - the meat industry's planned campaign to tempt us back to the joys of a juicy steak is on ice due to foot and mouth; an election means a pause in the record levels of government-backed advertising, and the railway network has yet to reach the state where it is safe to woo travellers back. \"And as storm clouds gather, companies go for softer areas, cut into their advertising budgets,\" Bernard says wearily. </p> <p>The broadcasters are not alone in their fog. National Magazines managing director Terry Mansfield, whose portfolio spans from Good Housekeeping to Cosmopolitan, speaks candidly of \"navigating without a map for the rest of the year\". He says: \"Cancelling of advertising really began after Christmas. A lot of businesses didn't have the best Christmas. The one certainty was ads for jewellery in up-market titles such as Harpers.\" </p> <p>The crisis of confidence in the US cannot be denied [see Stefano Hatfield, right] but the real conundrum is this: if America sneezes, does the rest of the world catch a cold? Is the domino effect, which caused the massive media recession of 1990-91 [see panel above], striking again? And, if the UK isn't affected directly by the US downturn, is the industry busy panicking itself into a decline? </p> <p>The irony is that nine years of unbroken advertising growth have created a false sense of security, and few saw a downturn coming. Adland is populated by youngish people who weren't around in the early 90s and have never known tough times. For Justin Sampson, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, a sector which doubled its share of total ad revenue (now \u00a3535m) in 10 years, this is new territory. He says he has no idea how commercial radio will cope with the expected seizure. \"I have very little experience of living through a recession. I was busy being an irresponsible 20-something last time, in 1991.\" </p> <p>Publisher of the Economist, David Hanger, who is also world president of the International Advertising Association, says: \"Last year just absolutely flew. The Economist was up 30% as banks chased e-commerce. In the States, it was the strongest year advertising had ever seen.\" Business Week was turning away ads. </p> <p>\"Suddenly in November,\" says Hanger, \"The Wall Street Journal had a fall-off in the number of pages - a hint. We hadn't noticed it. Then it deepened - it depended on how involved you were with the dot.com bubble.\" </p> <p>Martin Sorrell, who heads global agency WPP and is Britain's most prominent ad man, says: \"It was bound to happen. The year 2000 was unsustainable.\" Last year, off the back of the dot.com boom, his company grew by 15%, excluding acquisition and profits were up by 20%. We're now seeing \"the revenge of the brands\", he says. </p> <p>It's all timing, says Sorrell, but then adds: \"The $64,000 question is whether the ripple effect of [US] interest rate cuts and tax cuts from Bush will also ripple out to Europe,\" - and thereby avert a serious fall. </p> <p>Many take comfort from signs that the US has had it worse. Hanger, whose role spans the globe, says: \"The UK is definitely behind [the US] but also it attracted less dot.com froth, so it won't have the same fall to make.\" It's this kind of thinking which is causing the uncertainty and confusion and leading some to argue that the industry is psyching itself into recession. Andy Barnes, Channel 4 director of advertising sales and marketing (revenue up 6% so far this year) says: \"Two things have historically driven advertising. Company profit and consumer expectations. It was marvellous until six months ago, but whether you're going up a cliff or down over a cliff, you can't see it until it happens.\" </p> <p>Yet there are reasons to be cheerful: in Europe far less personal wealth is directly invested in shares. In the UK, unemployment of under 1m means employers are still chasing key staff. And some media companies are still predicting growth: RTL, which controls Channel 5, last week forecast 3% ad growth this year. </p> <p>The uneven impact so far - is the UK merely lagging behind the US or genuinely reprieved? - is demonstrated by what is happening in newspapers. </p> <p>On March 15, Trinity Mirror's cheery chief executive Philip Graf reported advertising revenue from national titles was 9% higher in the first two months of the year, and from regional titles it was up 7% - though he excluded internet investments. Johnston Press, a regional operator, was also in perky form. Yet last week Independent Newspapers, with wider flung interests, spoke of uncertainty. Associated Newspapers, too, is trimming its editorial budgets by 10%. </p> <p>And the advertising director of a major British newspaper group confided: \"I'm feeling very, very nervous. I absolutely know we are going to be down on last year, but not by how much. I knew the bubble had to burst.\" </p> <p>So what's the outlook for Britain's leading TV network? ITV, just like the US networks, was first to feel pressure last autumn.

Carlton and Granada have duly confirmed that in the four months to January, advertising was down 5%. Merrill Lynch's latest report says that during the first quarter of 2001, ITV advertising is down 7.7%, while the April fall could be anywhere between 15 and 20%. \"We always believed 2001 would be down around 5-7% But this is far worse than expected.\" </p> <p>But consider: last year during April, May and June, ITV recorded respective revenue jumps of 19.4%, 15.5% and 20.4% on the year before. After Euro 2000 is it surprising it went flat? And the bottom line is that ITV advertising revenue in February this year totalled \u00a3142m.

      "bodyText": "Last night's Oscars signalled much more than another glossy night out for the Hollywood elite. Worried eyes focused not on the shortlist for best picture, but the ad breaks between the speeches. News had seeped out that the broadcaster - ABC - was having trouble filling its premium ad slots in the biggest show of the year. As an illustration of the scale of the advertising downturn sweeping the US it could not have been more dramatic. If the make-up and shampoo commercials are deserting the Oscars then truly nothing is sacred. Meanwhile, at an overseas sales conference, ITV's ad sales directors were trying to dispel alarmist talk that the full-blown contagion had spread to the UK by predicting a revival in the second half of this year. But on Thursday, one of the country's largest radio groups, Capital Radio, issued a profits warning - confirmation that conditions were worsening. Ralph Bernard, chief executive of rival GWR, had to watch his own share price slide in sympathy, though the Classic FM operator is still showing double-digit growth. \"I can't give you any predictions,\" he said last week, \"I simply don't know.\" There are all sorts of reasons why the ad market is suffering - the meat industry's planned campaign to tempt us back to the joys of a juicy steak is on ice due to foot and mouth; an election means a pause in the record levels of government-backed advertising, and the railway network has yet to reach the state where it is safe to woo travellers back. \"And as storm clouds gather, companies go for softer areas, cut into their advertising budgets,\" Bernard says wearily. The broadcasters are not alone in their fog. National Magazines managing director Terry Mansfield, whose portfolio spans from Good Housekeeping to Cosmopolitan, speaks candidly of \"navigating without a map for the rest of the year\". He says: \"Cancelling of advertising really began after Christmas. A lot of businesses didn't have the best Christmas. The one certainty was ads for jewellery in up-market titles such as Harpers.\" The crisis of confidence in the US cannot be denied [see Stefano Hatfield, right] but the real conundrum is this: if America sneezes, does the rest of the world catch a cold? Is the domino effect, which caused the massive media recession of 1990-91 [see panel above], striking again? And, if the UK isn't affected directly by the US downturn, is the industry busy panicking itself into a decline? The irony is that nine years of unbroken advertising growth have created a false sense of security, and few saw a downturn coming. Adland is populated by youngish people who weren't around in the early 90s and have never known tough times. For Justin Sampson, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, a sector which doubled its share of total ad revenue (now \u00a3535m) in 10 years, this is new territory. He says he has no idea how commercial radio will cope with the expected seizure. \"I have very little experience of living through a recession. I was busy being an irresponsible 20-something last time, in 1991.\" Publisher of the Economist, David Hanger, who is also world president of the International Advertising Association, says: \"Last year just absolutely flew. The Economist was up 30% as banks chased e-commerce. In the States, it was the strongest year advertising had ever seen.\" Business Week was turning away ads. \"Suddenly in November,\" says Hanger, \"The Wall Street Journal had a fall-off in the number of pages - a hint. We hadn't noticed it. Then it deepened - it depended on how involved you were with the dot.com bubble.\" Martin Sorrell, who heads global agency WPP and is Britain's most prominent ad man, says: \"It was bound to happen. The year 2000 was unsustainable.\" Last year, off the back of the dot.com boom, his company grew by 15%, excluding acquisition and profits were up by 20%. We're now seeing \"the revenge of the brands\", he says. It's all timing, says Sorrell, but then adds: \"The $64,000 question is whether the ripple effect of [US] interest rate cuts and tax cuts from Bush will also ripple out to Europe,\" - and thereby avert a serious fall. Many take comfort from signs that the US has had it worse. Hanger, whose role spans the globe, says: \"The UK is definitely behind [the US] but also it attracted less dot.com froth, so it won't have the same fall to make.\" It's this kind of thinking which is causing the uncertainty and confusion and leading some to argue that the industry is psyching itself into recession. Andy Barnes, Channel 4 director of advertising sales and marketing (revenue up 6% so far this year) says: \"Two things have historically driven advertising. Company profit and consumer expectations. It was marvellous until six months ago, but whether you're going up a cliff or down over a cliff, you can't see it until it happens.\" Yet there are reasons to be cheerful: in Europe far less personal wealth is directly invested in shares. In the UK, unemployment of under 1m means employers are still chasing key staff. And some media companies are still predicting growth: RTL, which controls Channel 5, last week forecast 3% ad growth this year. The uneven impact so far - is the UK merely lagging behind the US or genuinely reprieved? - is demonstrated by what is happening in newspapers. On March 15, Trinity Mirror's cheery chief executive Philip Graf reported advertising revenue from national titles was 9% higher in the first two months of the year, and from regional titles it was up 7% - though he excluded internet investments. Johnston Press, a regional operator, was also in perky form. Yet last week Independent Newspapers, with wider flung interests, spoke of uncertainty. Associated Newspapers, too, is trimming its editorial budgets by 10%. And the advertising director of a major British newspaper group confided: \"I'm feeling very, very nervous. I absolutely know we are going to be down on last year, but not by how much. I knew the bubble had to burst.\" So what's the outlook for Britain's leading TV network? ITV, just like the US networks, was first to feel pressure last autumn. Neil Blackley, star media analyst of Merrill Lynch, justified his ranking last September by reporting the downturn which had started in July. Carlton and Granada have duly confirmed that in the four months to January, advertising was down 5%. Merrill Lynch's latest report says that during the first quarter of 2001, ITV advertising is down 7.7%, while the April fall could be anywhere between 15 and 20%. \"We always believed 2001 would be down around 5-7% But this is far worse than expected.\" But consider: last year during April, May and June, ITV recorded respective revenue jumps of 19.4%, 15.5% and 20.4% on the year before.

They are constantly improving their homes or gardens and always go to a different place for every holiday. In the UK, there are 1.8m of them, of both sexes and any age or social class. However, they are most likely to be young, with three-fifths under 35, and a fair number are students. How can I spot them? Brand adventurers like to stand out in a crowd, are keen to keep up with the latest fashions and believe that wearing a designer label improves their image. They often buy new brands just to see what they're like. How do they keep up with what's hot? Brand adventurers are big users of all media - they are 30% more likely than other adults to have satellite TV and they are frequent visitors to the cinema.

Heat, the group's entertainment weekly, has caught fire in circulation terms, reaching 230,000 in recent weeks.

In the US, the lad mag that leapfrogged Loaded is selling 830,000 copies. </p> <p>But for investors the broader picture is more worrying. The group's US business is struggling, radio has nowhere to go under current ownership regulations, and debts are about \u00a3600m. There have been reports of low morale and the group faces, along with the rest of the media sector, an advertising market that is at best uncertain. The Emap share price, which was \u00a317.50 about 14 months ago, is now around \u00a37. </p> <p>The City is baying for blood. Whether it be the sale of the US business, Petersen, which Emap acquired just over two years ago, or the disposal of the company's business-to-business magazines, there are few without an opinion of where the scalpel should cut. Some reports are suggesting that Kevin Hand, Emap's chief executive, has been given six months to turn around the group or face a putsch. In the current unforgiving climate in stock markets, investors are impatient for change. </p> <p>Hand, 47, has a strong record. A former advertising salesman, he was shipped off to Paris by Emap in 1994, unable to speak a word of French. There, he built the company from scratch into the second biggest consumer publishing group in France behind Hachette. But his destiny will be more closely linked to the US business. The $1.2bn acquisition of Petersen in December 1998 is being seen as the turning point for Emap, the moment when the company began to look vulnerable. At the time Hand described Emap and Petersen as \"twins separated at birth\". </p> <p>Analysts appeared to agree that it was the right target, but even at that time argued that Hand had overpaid. He has found it difficult to shift that suspicion, and critics pounced when, in the first half, profits from the US business fell by 23% to \u00a317m. </p> <p>The US group, whose portfolio includes Hot Rod, Dirt Rider, Sport, Teen and Guns'n'ammo, has suffered hardest from a drop in advertising from the automotive sector. Ford, in particular, shifted spend from specialist magazines onto the internet. </p> <p>Emap is clearly reviewing the group's structure. The recent arrival of finance director Gary Hughes from Scottish Media Group has contributed to a strategic rethink. \"The purchase of Petersen in the US has gone a little slower than we would have liked and therefore we are working really hard to make up that ground, and that is our intent,\" Hand told the Guardian last month. \"But if we cannot see a way forward then we have no intention of publishing purely for vanity. We are not going to be in there at all costs.\" </p> <p>The sale of the US business would be a clear sop to the investment community - the suggestion of a sale sparked a rare 10% rise in the share price last month. But the disposal of Petersen would be humiliating for Hand. With the advertising market sunk, this would be the worst time to seek a buyer. It would probably fetch less than \u00a3450m, leaving Emap with a \u00a3400m loss on its investment. </p> <p>A sale would see the company joining the rollcall of British businesses that have failed to break the US. For Emap it would also remove the central plank of the strategy it has pushed for the past 18 months - the development of global brands based on the FHM model. Last year, Hand committed a \u00a320m budget to FHM in the US for its first three years. Petersen was also seen as the platform for growth in a market where no one publisher has a market share of more than 10%, and which is ripe for consolidation. </p> <p>The problems, though, have not been confined to the US. When announcing last results, Emap admitted a restructuring of its advertising salesforce around genres such as music or health had caused disruption to revenues. Media buyers are cynical about selling across brands and different types of media, but Emap insiders claim the strategy is beginning to bear fruit. </p> <p>The other problem is that the UK magazine business is essentially mature, which means slower growth - making it all the more important that the likes of Heat demonstrate that Emap can still launch successful titles. More established titles on the slide include Sky, Red and Arena. </p> <p>In radio, where its assets include Kiss FM, regulations prevent further expansion, although it is understood at least to have escaped the advertising downturn that has stricken Capital. </p> <p>Emap has already retrenched on the internet. In November, it cut its spending forecast for web-based services from \u00a3250m over the next three years to \u00a3120m, an investment that still looks high in the current climate. It has homed in on eight targets for the cash, including online versions of FHM, music monthly Q and the construction trade titles. </p> <p>If the company does alight on its business magazines as a candidate for sale, it would at least be putting them into a market where there will be no shortage of buyers. The business division, which includes titles such as Retail Week, Drapers Record and Broadcast, would fetch between \u00a3500m and \u00a3700m, enough to pay off the group's debts. Insiders suggest that if action is taken, however, it is more likely to be in the US. </p> <p>Hand has maintained that the \"pressure\" to take action is not as tangible as some in the City would like to suggest, and the calls for change are more a reflection of analysts' herd-like mentality. He said last month that the company was not actively seeking buyers for the US business. The same, he said, was true of the company's business magazines division, which was first rumoured to be for sale at the end of last year. \"We are running both businesses as we run all of our businesses all of the time, which means keeping options open.\" </p> <p>A third way for Emap may to be find a joint venture partner in the US to reduce its exposure to the market while still being able to share in the potential upside of FHM.

BBC audience research shows that almost a third of people in the country have never heard of 5 Live - and some of those who claim to know about the station think it is a music network. </p> <p>The BBC has never really quite decided what Radio 5 is for. At its conception, sport was an add-on. Indeed, for most of its life it came under the news and current affairs umbrella. </p> <p>Now, however, its controller is the former BBC head of sport, and the station has been transferred into the radio family. In the eight months since he took over, his image of the station is becoming clear. He has cleared out \"anomalies\" - axed the media show Paper Talk, sacked Andrew Neil from his Sunday breakfast show and discontinued the Saturday satirical series The Treatment. </p> <p>Shennan has devoted most of his attention to sport: every weeknight is now a sports night, starting at 7pm. He has placed Ian Wright and Mark Bright in The Treatment's old slot between the mid-morning Saturday news and sports mix of Adrian Chiles and the main sporting action of Saturday afternoon. </p> <p>Some disgruntled voices say he is busily stripping out all the character from Radio 5, homogenising the output so that listeners will have even less idea of what the station stands for. There are mutterings from staff: some suggest darkly that while Shennan may be able to add a few hundred thousand to the listening figures, he's not a visionary. </p> <p>Visionary or not, he is certainly not a revolutionary, preferring change by evolution. He denies the charge of homogenisation, saying he has brought \"clarity and logic\" to the schedule. He promises plenty more \"quirk\" - there is a Saturday night media and entertainment show to come, presented by travel news reporter Caroline Faraday, and a sports quiz show with former Sky presenter Helen Chamberlain. A new entertainment correspondent, Phil Williams, has been appointed from Radio 1 with a brief to cover showbiz \"properly\". Election coverage will be comprehensive, but not overwhelming. </p> <p>And while change has been gradual so far, there are a number of radical shake-ups planned. Shennan will not give details, but it seems that big names are being talked about. The Guardian understands that Frank Skinner is being lined up to replace Mellor as presenter of a football phone-in show, former ITN political editor Michael Brunson has been approached to do regular work, and Brian Alexander is about to move from the 10pm slot - which he has presented with mixed critical success - to present the weekend breakfast programme alongside Shelagh Fogarty. The gap left by Alexander means that Fi Glover, a favourite with listeners and critics, will finally get a permanent home on the network. </p> <p>There are more plans for sport: there will be a cricket show presented by Jamie Theakston, and a dedicated Formula One programme - something 5 Live has never developed, even though it holds the rights to the sport. And while Shennan insists he is committed to news - it makes up almost 80% of the station's output - his greatest victory has been to secure (very expensive) premier league commentary rights for a further three years. </p> <p>While the proportion of sport to news has remained largely unchanged, there is an impression that sport has gained ground simply because it has a greater focus, and the \"news camp\" in the station is worried. </p> <p> The overall budget for news has just been cut, if only slightly, and the station's marketing campaign is focused exclusively on sport. The news judgments of Shennan's management team have sometimes been questioned; it had to be pointed out recently that while it might have been a good idea to take Tony Blair's speech live from the Labour Spring conference, the station would have to give similar coverage to those of William Hague and Charles Kennedy - which fell in the middle of football matches. While Shennan talks the news game, praising the 5 Live Report and pointing to the recent decision to clear the schedules for a themed debate evening on race, news staff say fears are yet to be allayed. </p> <p>And then there's Kelvin MacKenzie, swishing his gladiatorial sword. </p> <p>The TalkSport boss claims that Shennan is turning Radio 5 into a sports network in all but name. Dyke and Shennan are \"fire-hosing\" taxpayers' money at sporting rights, he claims, wasting tens of millions of pounds simply to corner a market and drive out competition. \"In America, where there are anti-trust laws to curb predatory behaviour, Greg Dyke would be in jail, as would a number of radio executives. Here in Britain they're on the loose, ripping off the taxpayer and squandering his money, crushing the competition, cheating the sports fan and openly bragging about it,\" MacKenzie told the Broadcasting Press Guild recently. </p> <p>He has a point. In Australia, if broadcasters amass rights to events they cannot find time to transmit, they must give them up for a dollar apiece. </p> <p>Shennan dismisses MacKenzie wearily. \"I've heard all this before. I think his argument is pretty transparent. What is the BBC supposed to do? It's criticised for being the dozy old BBC, losing the plot if we lose sports rights; if we go for them, we are killing the competition.\" </p> <p>So 5 Live will forge ahead. Shennan reckons that sport is a crucial method of driving listeners to the rest of the station's output, and believes sports rights deliver value to the licence-fee payer: without them, there would be little to offer. Others question the strategy: while sports rights are crucial, they point out that sports audiences are falling while those for news are rising. Most of the new listeners to 5 Live in the past year came in through the breakfast and drive-time programmes. \"The idea that you can drive listeners from sport to the rest of the output is at best defensive, it's protecting what you've got,\" says one senior journalist. </p> <p>But Shennan believes that sport is what makes 5 Live stand out - and he will not bow to MacKenzie. \"Sport is hugely important for us. It makes us the key player in football on radio. We are being commercially astute but we are not bludgeoning anybody by overpaying. The record is stuck, Kelvin has lost.\"</p>",

Here in Britain they're on the loose, ripping off the taxpayer and squandering his money, crushing the competition, cheating the sports fan and openly bragging about it,\" MacKenzie told the Broadcasting Press Guild recently. He has a point. In Australia, if broadcasters amass rights to events they cannot find time to transmit, they must give them up for a dollar apiece. Shennan dismisses MacKenzie wearily. \"I've heard all this before. I think his argument is pretty transparent. What is the BBC supposed to do? It's criticised for being the dozy old BBC, losing the plot if we lose sports rights; if we go for them, we are killing the competition.\" So 5 Live will forge ahead. Shennan reckons that sport is a crucial method of driving listeners to the rest of the station's output, and believes sports rights deliver value to the licence-fee payer: without them, there would be little to offer. Others question the strategy: while sports rights are crucial, they point out that sports audiences are falling while those for news are rising. Most of the new listeners to 5 Live in the past year came in through the breakfast and drive-time programmes. \"The idea that you can drive listeners from sport to the rest of the output is at best defensive, it's protecting what you've got,\" says one senior journalist. But Shennan believes that sport is what makes 5 Live stand out - and he will not bow to MacKenzie. \"Sport is hugely important for us. It makes us the key player in football on radio. We are being commercially astute but we are not bludgeoning anybody by overpaying. The record is stuck, Kelvin has lost.\"",

      "bodyText": "So stiff is the competition that they are probably the most difficult film awards to win. But the film Battlefield Earth which starred John Travolta has managed almost a clean sweep of Golden Rapsberries in recognition of its profound awfulness. In the eve of Oscar ceremony in Santa Monica, the film based on the novel by Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard took almost every Razzie. Only Madonna, who won worst actress for The Next Best Thing, and the Blair Witch Project sequel, disturbed Battlefield Earth's progress to glory. \"It was actually a cake walk for jurors. 'Battlefield' was truly wretched,\" said Golden Raspberry Foundation founder John Wilson. The Razzies, which are gold-painted raspberries, go to the films and actors voted the worst of the year by 535 foundation members. Razzies for Battlefield Earth included Worst Picture, and John Travolta won Worst Actor and Worst Screen Couple along with anyone sharing the screen with him in Battlefield Earth.",

      "body": "<p>Waseem Hussain says he has been bad since he was about eight years old. He was always messing about, fighting and swearing. After exclusion from a number of schools, Waseem took his trouble out on to the streets of Rotherham. </p> <p>Hanging around in gangs, Waseem, 16, started looking for fights every day. But he never seemed to get caught. One day, though, the scale and violence of Waseem's offences escalated. </p> <p>\"I was in the bus station and I followed this lad in the toilets and I punched him twice. After that it started getting more serious. I thought I liked it then, getting into trouble. Put it this way, I enjoyed it, it felt powerful,\" he says, admitting that the severity of the offences increased. \"I put the boot in as well.\" </p> <p>Waseem says he has been caught for between 10 and 12 offences and admits to \"at least another seven or eight on top of that\". </p> <p>He goes on: \"I was in Worcestershire one day and this lad, I saw him, he were running and I asked him what has he done and he said \"I nicked something off a bus\". The police came and he told the police that I did it. The next day I saw him and I told him \"let's go for a joint\". I took him into the subways and said to him \"this is for grassing me up\". I was stamping him, I kicked his face and when they found him he was unconscious. I got arrested and they found forensic evidence, they found his blood on my trainers.\" </p> <p>Waseem was given a detention training order of eight months, four months of which he spent inside Wetherby young offenders' institution. He says: \"I was still having fights in there. I did one month in segregation. My problem magnified then because I was meeting the same crew. When I came out of prison, my offences started to change and I was messing about with cars and knives. Being in prison made me more interested in cars. Then I started carrying a lock knife.\" </p> <p>Waseem is the perfect example of what the government classes as a hardcore persistent young offender, one of the 3% of young offenders reckoned to be responsible for up to 25% of crimes. He is also a boy whose crimes escalated to a terrifying degree after his time in prison. He says he could have easily used that lock knife. </p> <p>Waseem is sitting in an office in the Rotherham intensive support supervision advocacy programme, a place he hopes will make him think twice about ever picking the lock knife up again. He is one of 22 young offenders who have had to come to this project since it started last August. The project's aim is to prevent reoffending by young offenders who have broken the law on more than three occasions by offering support and help with their difficulties. The Rotherham project also has a dedicated police officer known as a \"tracking officer\" who keeps a very close eye on all the offenders. </p> <p>The Rotherham project is a blueprint for the government's intensive surveillance and supervision programme to be launched on Wednesday. While the Rotherham pilot has not used electronic surveillance, its tracking officer checks up on the young offenders all the time. PC Bill Thomas is with the Rotherham project. He says it works: \"It's fair to say that Waseem's offending has not been on the same level of escalation. Waseem has had problems with his anger and we have been working on his self-esteem. But since he has been on the programme, he has become a little bit more mature and is making more informed choices. </p> <p>\"So far, we have not completely excluded offending from Waseem's life but we have reduced the seriousness and the impact of it. Waseem was very much a lad who was destined to do a lot of time because he was so chaotic. Within the project, he has got a little bit more structure and he is calmer and perhaps his future has changed.\" </p> <p>As a tracking officer, Mr Thomas uses his intelligence-collating skills garnered from his police work to make sure that his offenders feel them breathing down their collar. If they don't turn up at the programme when required, he goes out and finds them and hauls them back in - if they persist with this behaviour they find themselves back in the criminal justice system without the project's support. </p> <p>\"In real terms my role is about getting to know people like Waseem, about his family, about his habits, his environment, what his expectations are. I will then devise a plan on how we can incorporate all of those and at the same time work within the confinements of the law. If it does go wrong, I pull him up and maybe have to deal with his family and the situation in the neighbourhood if that becomes a problem,\" explains Mr Thomas. \"It should make a marked impact on some people's lives. We have had youngsters who have been on the project who have not been back inside. One young man has never reoffended and has got a steady job.\" </p> <p>Simon Perry, manager of Rotherham youth offending services, says the Rotherham project (based on a successful American one) is a sort of blueprint but adds that it is not required that the new programmes across the country replicate it. </p> <p>\"What we know is that there's a very small group of very hard to reach, socially excluded children who don't go to school, don't work, are very often homeless, very often victims of abuse and often involved in drug taking. A significant number are involved in persistent offending and because of that the more socially ostracised they become. And young people commit a disproportionate amount of crime. It is incredibly difficult to engage these chil dren,\" he explains. \"There is a greater chance that they will become potentially violent, criminally offending adults. Because they are difficult to engage, we have to take longer over doing it and that's where the word intensive is appropriate.\" </p> <p>The Rotherham project has a social worker, police officer, probation service officer, a volunteer coordinator and three development workers who work with housing, drugs and alcohol, and employment issues. It also uses volunteer mentors from within the community to work with offenders. Jackie Key, the project manager, says she has dealt with 22 offenders involved mostly in assaults, burglary and car crime. \"The majority are white and male, a proportion are mixed race or Asian children and we have had two females. A lot of them want to stop reoffending but their life circumstances have stopped them from doing that.\" </p> <p>Even in the short term, she says, the Rotherham project seems to be working. Prior to the young people coming on the programme, the number of offences they committed was 156. While on the programme the number of offences they committed was 28. The average number of weeks of the programme is 14.3; the average number of offences committed by young people prior to the programme is 7.09, while on the programme it is 1.36. </p> <p>Waseem thinks the project works. He is less violent but he hasn't stopped offending completely yet. He says it is difficult. \"I think I want to stop but sometimes it's a thrill, a buzz. But I am trying.\" </p> <p> Waseem Hussain is not a real name</p>",

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday mornings, the hairdresser visits. And at lunchtime, the dining room of the Essex nursing home is a sea of high set curls. Mary Whitehouse surveys the wispy throng with a gimlet eye, then leans across the table. Her huge bead necklace swings precariously close to the plate of brown stew and swedes boiled senseless. \"Some of these dears don't have much hair to do,\" she whispers. </p> <p>Now 90, the woman who has devoted her life to safeguarding the morals of the nation - whether the nation liked it or not - remains quite contrary. She insists that the television in the day room is switched off when she wants to read her newspaper. </p> <p>Earlier, Whitehouse receives me in her room. She is lying on her bed with the Daily Telegraph over her knees, open at the letters page. She has written the word \"cataracts\" in the margin in capital letters. She is immaculately dressed, her high apple cheeks professionally powdered. She has to keep her legs up, she explains, as a result of a fall she had six years ago. She tugs down one of her pink crocheted socks to reveal the ruby welts across her shin. She is in a lot of pain. She cannot walk without her frame. </p> <p>Though she clasps my hand hungrily, she is not a cuddly soul. Crusaders seldom are. Battling with the unholy trinity of foul language, sex and violence on television over four decades, she employed a suspicion of nuanced debate, which she successfully coupled with a fulsome talent for self-publicity. For Whitehouse, there was never any difference between pornography and Dennis Potter. Expletives were counted, not contextualised. Self-appointed, but remarkably effective, she has been called the original spin doctor. </p> <p>There were times during the 80s when she appeared to terrify the BBC hierarchy. For all those who mocked, she had the ears of the influential. Since launching her Clean Up TV campaign in 1964, she has enjoyed audiences with prime ministers, the Pope and Cliff Richard. She was instrumental in Margaret Thatcher's decision to establish a taste and decency watchdog specifically for broadcasting. </p> <p>Now president emeritus of the National Viewers and Listeners Association, which she founded in 1965, at the age of 55, she watches only the news. Whitehouse began her lobbying career while in the unlikely post of head of sex education at a secondary school in Telford. After bringing up her three sons she had returned to her teaching at the height of the Profumo scandal, and one day found three girls with two boys up to no good behind the bike sheds. \"I said, 'What on earth do you think you're doing?' and they said, 'Well Miss, we seen how well them girls did, Mandy Rice Davis and Christine Keeler, so we thought we'd have a go.' 'Where did you see what they did?' 'On telly last night.'\" </p> <p>She slams her hands on to her thighs, freshly outraged. The influence of the box in the corner was direct and obvious, she says. So she and a friend started a petition. They organised a public meeting at Birmingham town hall. The Times wrote an article about it. And the country was first introduced to Mrs Whitehouse - a handbaggy, horn-rimmed icon of mumsy disgust, preaching her certainties from whatever platform was offered to her. </p> <p>Certainties became her. Her force came from moral rather than intellectual argument; her objections were nebulous and kneejerk, steeped in a biblical terror of the corruption of innocents. Notable targets included Alf Garnett (\"a gross insult to the Queen\"), EastEnders (\"this bi-weekly violation of the sensitivities of us all\") and Jackanory (\"completely irresponsible\"). She was sustained, she says, by \"a deep sense that what we were doing was right and important ... I love children and when I see them being exploited or put in danger I'm ready to fight for them.\" </p> <p>As ever, attempting to engage her in reasoned debate is like trying to climb a glass wall. Did she genuinely believe that those programmes put children in danger? \"Of course, not only on a sexual level, but also the violence. I am convinced that the violence in our society now has its roots in the violence we see on television. It was Sir Hugh Greene who said that television is the most powerful medium for teaching and I believe that to be true.\" </p> <p>But surely some of that violence is a reflection of what's already happening in society? She disagrees, naturally. Nor does she accept, unsurprisingly, that the sensitive portrayal of sexuality can educate and inform. \"I can't say, speaking personally, that I had to wait to see sex on television before I knew what it was,\" she adds, with a hint of a smirk. </p> <p>Last week, the newly appointed chair of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, Lord Dubs, insisted that the watchdog would not be influenced by \"mini-campaigns and petitions\". \"The National Viewers and Listeners Association can be as vocal as they want,\" he added. \"But if one letter comes from their general secretary now, that's one letter. It's the same as if Joe Bloggs writes a letter.\" Whitehouse is unimpressed. \"Well, he'd better find another job,\" she says tartly. \"Nobody's going to take him seriously once they've seen that. I certainly wouldn't.\" </p> <p>The NVLA - recently rebranded Mediawatch-UK - has been unusually meek since Whitehouse ceased daily involvement. Its membership remains mysterious, though it has reportedly slumped to 7,000. It was, according to Michael Grade, \"an unaccountable and opaque organisation that had influence way beyond what it should have done\". It was also, essentially, a one-woman show, though that one woman would always imply that she was speaking for a swathe of similarly outraged viewers. And perhaps that was her appeal - that she spoke with a single voice to a gentler, more uniform, time, when people like her knew best. </p> <p>According to Whitehouse, the organisation is thriving, though she doesn't see the need to change its name. \"It does represent a great number of people. I've spoken all over this country and the heart of my message has always been: whenever you see a programme, if it's a good one you like or a bad one you feel is irresponsible, then write, make your voice heard.\" </p> <p>These days, she sits uncomfortably. Immobility frustrates her. As she takes me down to lunch, veering perilously along the corridor on her wheeled frame, she mutters a sporting litany: \"First XI hockey team you know, tennis too, lovely red carpet.\" </p> <p>Her mind is well preserved: the picture is distinct, though sometimes the contrast isn't so sharp, and there are occasional fade-outs. Her conversation is disjointed but direct. \"[My husband] Ernest died on the 26th of August last year, when we'd been here just about a week.\" </p> <p>What happened, I ask. \"You mean why did he die?\" she corrects. \"He was 86, and he didn't have anything specific, he just really quietly ...\" She drifts off. \"He was in another bedroom, and at six o'clock one morning they came and woke me up and said, 'You ought to be with him'. So I went to his room, and I sat and held his hand. I held it for 12 hours, until six o'clock that evening. Then the nurse came in and put her arms round me, and she said, 'I think you must go, Mary.'\" She tells it like a story she is used to. </p> <p>They had been married for 60 years. \"We never had a row, because we thought alike on so many things, and as far as the work was concerned he was 100% with me.\" Did it ever feel like he was in her shadow? She laughs delightedly. \"That's where he wanted to be! He didn't come with me to Australia or the States [where she travelled on speaking tours]. He'd stay at home with the children.\" </p> <p>Her room is dominated by a large framed photograph of the couple, set to the left of a dusty portable TV. The walls are covered with cards and snapshots. In one corner are the photographs she took of the plants in her garden before they sold the house. Her favourite was the peach tree. The pink blossoms grew straight out from the bark. </p> <p>It is not for her to judge her public achievements, she tells me. \"I was successful professionally, I was a wife, I was a mother and I found that I could get on my feet and say what I wanted to say. I just get on with whatever I think's got to be done.\" </p> <p>The conversation is becoming rickety now. She tells me I'm wearing her out. Then suddenly she vaults across the bed and roots around in a cupboard. She volleys a brown box in my direction. It's her CBE. How did she feel when she got it? \"Overcome really, with the Queen ...\" She points to the place on the wall where the day is recorded - her with her granddaughter Cathy. </p> <p>She doesn't think much of the current government's regulation policy, she blusters, although one senses that she hasn't been following the debate as forensically of late. </p> <p>Does she have any regrets? She laughs. \"I think I could have been a nicer person.\" Was she difficult to live with? \"I'm tempted to say I wasn't there all that much to be lived with. But I had a lot of friends, and my family were very loving.\" </p> <p>And does she have friends here in the nursing home? She looks incredulous. \"It depends what you mean by friends,\" she qualifies. \"They sleep most of the time. They're all old and many of them are handicapped. But they're all very friendly. It couldn't be nicer really.\"</p>",

Could it be that the name Richard was deemed slightly inappropriate given the urban legend of a gerbil and a certain hunky Hollywood movie star? Surely it's not that obvious. </p> <p>\u0095 The lengths that folk will go to in order to get the perfect shirt. Andy Broughton-Braithwaite, managing editor of BT Openworld, has taken to shopping in pubs and thinks nothing of going up to strangers and literally buying shirts off their backs. Last week's item was a mod shirt (yes, ABB is still living in the 60s, unable to escape a charming mod obsession) that the student in question bought for a fiver from a charity shop (where else). Flash Andy paid a king's ransom of \u00a380 - quite a mark-up I think you'll agree, but peanuts for a high-flying Openworld exec. \"I just had to have it,\" raves ABB, \"Paul Weller had one.\" So that's alright then, but pity the poor and, by this point, half-naked student who chose hard currency over warmth on a freezing cold night. </p> <p>\u0095 Never one not to applaud dexterity, diary would like to congratulate Neil Crofts, the erstwhile strategic management guru at Razorfish, on a splendidly creative email signature. The confident \"change agent\" (the new word for a dot.commer in-between jobs) describes himself in electronic missives as a \"futurist visionary; public speaker and writer\". But that's not all, Crofts feels the urge to list his attributes, which are: \"Leadership; inspiration; passion; energy; authenticity.\" Who needs to pay for PR when us sucker diarists are amused enough to take the piss, even if it inadvertently borders on a free advertisement?

      "bodyText": "\u0095 And so it came to pass that the Yahoo gerbil, the little fella that adorns Channel 5's 9pm movie sponsorship slot, was christened Warren. In the spirit of web democracy, the cute rodent's name was decided by a user poll at Yahoo.co.uk/gerbil from a selection of chosen names. But wait, whatever happened to the name Richard - a clear leader before the URL was press released, but nowhere to be seen a few days into the stunt? Wonder why. Could it be that the name Richard was deemed slightly inappropriate given the urban legend of a gerbil and a certain hunky Hollywood movie star? Surely it's not that obvious. \u0095 The lengths that folk will go to in order to get the perfect shirt. Andy Broughton-Braithwaite, managing editor of BT Openworld, has taken to shopping in pubs and thinks nothing of going up to strangers and literally buying shirts off their backs. Last week's item was a mod shirt (yes, ABB is still living in the 60s, unable to escape a charming mod obsession) that the student in question bought for a fiver from a charity shop (where else). Flash Andy paid a king's ransom of \u00a380 - quite a mark-up I think you'll agree, but peanuts for a high-flying Openworld exec. \"I just had to have it,\" raves ABB, \"Paul Weller had one.\" So that's alright then, but pity the poor and, by this point, half-naked student who chose hard currency over warmth on a freezing cold night. \u0095 Never one not to applaud dexterity, diary would like to congratulate Neil Crofts, the erstwhile strategic management guru at Razorfish, on a splendidly creative email signature. The confident \"change agent\" (the new word for a dot.commer in-between jobs) describes himself in electronic missives as a \"futurist visionary; public speaker and writer\". But that's not all, Crofts feels the urge to list his attributes, which are: \"Leadership; inspiration; passion; energy; authenticity.\" Who needs to pay for PR when us sucker diarists are amused enough to take the piss, even if it inadvertently borders on a free advertisement?

Can you send an armoured personnel carrier? Can you get us back to barracks?\"</p> <p>Four hours into the Macedonian offensive to capture guerrilla-held positions on wooded hillsides above Tetovo, the incident was sad evidence of the army's overall weakness as it attempted the biggest operation in its 10-year history.</p> <p>Most men in the desperate platoon were reservists pressed into service over the last few days. \"I'm scared. I just want this to be over so I can go home,\" Rade, 25, said shortly before the volley of rapid rifle fire sent us running for cover. \"We don't know if there are snipers with guns in the houses round here. We were supposed to go up the hill.\"</p> <p>For several days the army has been using houses owned by Macedonian civilians to hide its own snipers on upstairs floors facing the hillside. In their panic the soldiers thought an Albanian sniper may have opened up on them from a nearby house, although it seemed more likely the shooting had come from the hills.</p> <p>Officially the army has around 15,000 men - including some 1,400 reservists called up last week. Western diplomats put the number of \"combat-capable\" soldiers at no more than 1,200. They include 350 special forces known as the Wolves.</p> <p>\"The conscripts come in for nine months' service and you can't train a man to be a proper soldier in so short a time,\" a western analyst said.</p> <p>Around 30% of the conscripts are Albanian and about 10% are Roma, Turks and other minorities.</p> <p>Some officers have genuine experience. The captain of the cowering platoon had served for 20 years, including two in action with the Yugoslav army against Croatia in the early 1990s. The government can also call on 350 special police and 450 gendarmes trained in riot control and paramilitary operations.</p> <p>Two Ukrainian-supplied helicopter gunships arrived in Macedonia on Friday and were promptly pressed into action at the weekend, firing rockets at guerrilla targets in the hills. Two transport helicopters from Ukraine also flew in and two more are on their way.</p> <p>Before their arrival, the Macedonian air force had one helicopter left in service. Its stable-mate flew into power lines and was destroyed 10 days ago.</p> <p>The guerrillas are thought to have around 800 men, who are operating in sympathetic Albanian villages in well placed high ground. Many have combat experience from Kosovo. They are equipped with Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifles, mortars, Chinese-made machine guns, anti-tank launchers and sniper rifles.</p> <p>Britain sent 13 officers, mainly from the Royal Marines, last week to discuss with the Macedonian defence ministry what help could be given.</p> <p>Even the Macedonian opposition has warned the government not to go for a military solution.

      "bodyText": "Eighteen Macedonian soldiers cowered behind a wall. Their captain could be heard shouting into a mobile phone: \"Gentlemen, we're under fire and surrounded on all sides. Can you send an armoured personnel carrier? Can you get us back to barracks?\" Four hours into the Macedonian offensive to capture guerrilla-held positions on wooded hillsides above Tetovo, the incident was sad evidence of the army's overall weakness as it attempted the biggest operation in its 10-year history. Most men in the desperate platoon were reservists pressed into service over the last few days. \"I'm scared. I just want this to be over so I can go home,\" Rade, 25, said shortly before the volley of rapid rifle fire sent us running for cover. \"We don't know if there are snipers with guns in the houses round here. We were supposed to go up the hill.\" For several days the army has been using houses owned by Macedonian civilians to hide its own snipers on upstairs floors facing the hillside. In their panic the soldiers thought an Albanian sniper may have opened up on them from a nearby house, although it seemed more likely the shooting had come from the hills. Officially the army has around 15,000 men - including some 1,400 reservists called up last week. Western diplomats put the number of \"combat-capable\" soldiers at no more than 1,200. They include 350 special forces known as the Wolves. \"The conscripts come in for nine months' service and you can't train a man to be a proper soldier in so short a time,\" a western analyst said. Around 30% of the conscripts are Albanian and about 10% are Roma, Turks and other minorities. Some officers have genuine experience. The captain of the cowering platoon had served for 20 years, including two in action with the Yugoslav army against Croatia in the early 1990s. The government can also call on 350 special police and 450 gendarmes trained in riot control and paramilitary operations. Two Ukrainian-supplied helicopter gunships arrived in Macedonia on Friday and were promptly pressed into action at the weekend, firing rockets at guerrilla targets in the hills. Two transport helicopters from Ukraine also flew in and two more are on their way. Before their arrival, the Macedonian air force had one helicopter left in service. Its stable-mate flew into power lines and was destroyed 10 days ago. The guerrillas are thought to have around 800 men, who are operating in sympathetic Albanian villages in well placed high ground. Many have combat experience from Kosovo. They are equipped with Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifles, mortars, Chinese-made machine guns, anti-tank launchers and sniper rifles. Britain sent 13 officers, mainly from the Royal Marines, last week to discuss with the Macedonian defence ministry what help could be given. Even the Macedonian opposition has warned the government not to go for a military solution. It criticised President Boris Trajkovski's decision to issue a 24-hour ultimatum to the gunmen to withdraw or face an all-out assault. \"Now we think the government is in a worse position, Radmila Sekarinska, vice president of the Social Democratic Union, said. \"If they mount a big offensive up the hill one can debate whether it will work since the army cannot hold any positions they occupy for very long or even overnight. \"If they do nothing they erode what people believe and expect from state institutions,\" she said. The army is also in a weak position because one of Tetovo's main ethnic Macedonian districts lies just below guerrilla-held positions. Remarkably many people from Tetovo were still in the city until yesterday's offensive although they were staying indoors. \"We can't leave because my mother is too ill to move,\" said a retired Macedonian carpenter whose house stands at the foot of the hill. He and his wife have barricaded the front windows and sleep in the kitchen.. \"The extremists are using our weekend cottage in the vineyard just 200 yards away up there,\" he said, gesturing over to the house. \"We have two fears,\" he added. \"One is that the extremists come down from the hills and slit our throats and the other is for our two sons who are in their twenties.

      "bodyText": "Macedonian tanks and infantry seized a key ridge above the city of Tetovo yesterday after artillery and helicopter gunships bombarded ethnic Albanian rebel positions and nearby villages in their biggest offensive since Albanian gunmen launched their revolt 12 days ago. Plumes of flames and smoke from burning houses rose into the sky when the attacks started shortly after dawn, and troops fanned out through the northern districts of Tetovo. At the height of the artillery barrage, dozens of explosions echoed around the mountains and the city every minute, with smoke rising from nearby Albanian positions. Reporters saw six armoured personal carriers (APCs) followed by groups of 15 soldiers behind each vehicle climbing the road which rose from the north-west of the city. Three hours later two tanks advanced up the same slope. By nightfall the army had driven through the village of Gajre and was holding ground beyond it. Across the small river, which bisected the wooded hillsides, three more tanks were seen inching forward with their cannons firing towards Lavce, once a main guerrilla stronghold. The guerrillas poured machine-gun and sniper fire on the ascending troops, and the army reported that one member of the special police was wounded, as well as four ethnic Albanian civilians. Insisting this was not the long-promised, all-out offensive, Georgi Tiandafilov, a spokesman for Macedonia's defence ministry, said: \"This is one of the last phases of the operation that we have taken for the complete expulsion of the terrorists from Macedonian territory.\" The Macedonian government claims the gunmen are from Kosovo and that their emergence amounts to foreign aggression. But Ali Ahmeti, the political leader of the gunmen who have formed a self-styled National Liberation Army (NLA), was born in Macedonia, as were many of the guerrillas interviewed by reporters in recent days. Macedonia has been under strong pressure from the west not to risk civilian casualties, but the government insists it must liberate its territory. \"To have the country's second city under siege for 12 days does great damage to inter-ethnic relations,\" Antonio Milososki, a government spokesman, said. \"We have to restore a sense of order before we can have political dialogue.\" In Gajre, six houses were in flames and people hid in basements for most of the day as the army pushed aside makeshift barricades and took up positions beyond the village. Reporters saw three gunmen with rifles still in the village after the army's APCs drove through. The village of Selce, where the guerrillas had their local headquarters, suffered massive damage from shell and rocket fire, according to a local school teacher reached by mobile phone. No army troops had entered the village, he said, and people were determined to stay in their homes. \"I've been inside all day but I know the house next door was destroyed,\" he said. Between 10 and 20 civilians were lightly injured. The village's two Albanian doctors were tending to them. \"We have food for now, but after seven days I don't know,\" the schoolteacher said. In London, defence sources said priority, as far at Nato troops was concerned, should be given to reinforcing the Kosovo side of the Macedonian border. Britain has sent a 10-man team of military advisers to Macedonia to help provide intelligence on the movement of Albanian guerrillas, and tactical advice about how to deal with them. While applauding action taken by Macedonian forces against the rebels, Nato and the EU are deeply concerned about the danger of triggering a backlash among Macedonia's ethnic Albanians, who make up about 30% of the country's population. Britain, which has about 3,300 troops in Kosovo, is prepared to bolster patrols on the Kosovo side of the border with Macedonia. Germany, which has about 5,000 soldiers in Kosovo, has agreed to send an extra 130 soldiers, who will be based in Prizren, in southern Kosovo. There are now more than 40,000 troops in the Nato-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Publicly, both of the main Albanian parties in Macedonia have called on the gunmen to lay down their arms and go home. The same demand was made by Kosovo's Albanian leaders after heavy pressure from European Union officials. Lord Robertson, Nato's secretary general, is due in Skopje today. His presence is designed to reinforce the message to the government to show restraint because it is winning the diplomatic battle. \"Our concern is that innocent civilians may suffer,\" a western diplomat said.

      "body": "<p>The bodies are laid out in the mud, a pathetic miniature version of the mounds of carcasses piling up on farms across Devon. Like the thousands of other sheep that have died since foot and mouth arrived in the county four weeks ago, Hazel and Graeme Butt's lambs did not stand a chance.</p> <p>But it was not foot and mouth or the slaughtermen who killed them; it was the movement restrictions imposed across the country by Maff in a vain attempt to contain the infection. Dropping from their mothers in the biting cold of night on to a field turned into an shin-deep bog by constant rain, they were claimed by hypothermia within minutes.</p> <p>These were not unhealthy lambs, just unlucky. The Butts had done everything right. They had separated out the 20 breeding ewes who would require most care - the ones expecting triplets or lambing for the first time - and put them into the best field, rich with grass.</p> <p>By the time they were due to lamb, they should have been back in sheds at the Butts' farmyard seven miles away at Highhampton - sheds with straw, running water, medicine and where the couple could be on hand 24 hours a day to tend them properly. Then foot and mouth hit, the restrictions were imposed and the sheep were trapped.</p> <p>\"They are wet when they come out,\" said Mr Butt, who celebrated his 33rd birthday fighting to save his stock on Saturday. \"They fall on to this mud and then they are getting blasted by that cold wind, and they are not going to last 10 minutes. If we could have had them in the barn up to their knees in straw, they definitely would have lived.\"</p> <p>Across the country, hundreds of thousands of animals untouched by foot and mouth directly are facing the same fate. It is a cruel twist to an already horrific chain of events that the infection hit at this time of year, when farms are teeming with new life.</p> <p>Add to that the rain, sleet and freezing winds of the past two weeks and the result is suffering on a scale overlooked by the official foot and mouth slaughter statistics. Already 18 lambs have been born on the Butts's small field; seven have survived. \"With the weather this bad it's getting to be like the trenches of the first world war out there,\" said Ian Johnston, of the local farmers' union. \"If farmers were keeping their animals in this state under normal circumstances, they would be prosecuted in a minute.\"</p> <p>The government has now announced a slaughter scheme on welfare grounds for animals trapped in horrendous conditions by the movement restrictions.

      "bodyText": "The bodies are laid out in the mud, a pathetic miniature version of the mounds of carcasses piling up on farms across Devon. Like the thousands of other sheep that have died since foot and mouth arrived in the county four weeks ago, Hazel and Graeme Butt's lambs did not stand a chance. But it was not foot and mouth or the slaughtermen who killed them; it was the movement restrictions imposed across the country by Maff in a vain attempt to contain the infection. Dropping from their mothers in the biting cold of night on to a field turned into an shin-deep bog by constant rain, they were claimed by hypothermia within minutes. These were not unhealthy lambs, just unlucky. The Butts had done everything right. They had separated out the 20 breeding ewes who would require most care - the ones expecting triplets or lambing for the first time - and put them into the best field, rich with grass. By the time they were due to lamb, they should have been back in sheds at the Butts' farmyard seven miles away at Highhampton - sheds with straw, running water, medicine and where the couple could be on hand 24 hours a day to tend them properly. Then foot and mouth hit, the restrictions were imposed and the sheep were trapped. \"They are wet when they come out,\" said Mr Butt, who celebrated his 33rd birthday fighting to save his stock on Saturday. \"They fall on to this mud and then they are getting blasted by that cold wind, and they are not going to last 10 minutes. If we could have had them in the barn up to their knees in straw, they definitely would have lived.\" Across the country, hundreds of thousands of animals untouched by foot and mouth directly are facing the same fate. It is a cruel twist to an already horrific chain of events that the infection hit at this time of year, when farms are teeming with new life. Add to that the rain, sleet and freezing winds of the past two weeks and the result is suffering on a scale overlooked by the official foot and mouth slaughter statistics. Already 18 lambs have been born on the Butts's small field; seven have survived. \"With the weather this bad it's getting to be like the trenches of the first world war out there,\" said Ian Johnston, of the local farmers' union. \"If farmers were keeping their animals in this state under normal circumstances, they would be prosecuted in a minute.\" The government has now announced a slaughter scheme on welfare grounds for animals trapped in horrendous conditions by the movement restrictions. Compensation will be available to farmers forced to slaughter their breeding sheep and cows. For Mrs Butt's father, Eddie Williamson, that is cold comfort. He has 199 breeding ewes trapped in a bare, sodden field near Halwill Junction, almost 10 miles from his farm. In two weeks they are due to start lambing, but Mr Williamson doubts they will last that long. \"The vets have been out looking at them every couple of days, and the wool is already starting to come out.

After exclusion from a number of schools, Waseem took his trouble out on to the streets of Rotherham.</p> <p>Hanging around in gangs, Waseem, 16, started looking for fights every day. But he never seemed to get caught. One day, though, the scale and violence of Waseem's offences escalated.</p> <p>\"I was in the bus station and I followed this lad in the toilets and I punched him twice. After that it started getting more serious. I thought I liked it then, getting into trouble. Put it this way, I enjoyed it, it felt powerful,\" he says, admitting that the severity of the offences increased. \"I put the boot in as well.\"</p> <p>Waseem says he has been caught for between 10 and 12 offences and admits to \"at least another seven or eight on top of that\".</p> <p>He goes on: \"I was in Worcestershire one day and this lad, I saw him, he were running and I asked him what has he done and he said \"I nicked something off a bus\". The police came and he told the police that I did it. The next day I saw him and I told him \"let's go for a joint\". I took him into the subways and said to him \"this is for grassing me up\". I was stamping him, I kicked his face and when they found him he was unconscious. I got arrested and they found forensic evidence, they found his blood on my trainers.\"</p> <p>Waseem was given a detention training order of eight months, four months of which he spent inside Wetherby young offenders' institution. He says: \"I was still having fights in there. I did one month in segregation. My problem magnified then because I was meeting the same crew. When I came out of prison, my offences started to change and I was messing about with cars and knives. Being in prison made me more interested in cars. Then I started carrying a lock knife.\"</p> <p>Waseem is the perfect example of what the government classes as a hardcore persistent young offender, one of the 3% of young offenders reckoned to be responsible for up to 25% of crimes. He is also a boy whose crimes escalated to a terrifying degree after his time in prison. He says he could have easily used that lock knife.</p> <p>Waseem is sitting in an office in the Rotherham intensive support supervision advocacy programme, a place he hopes will make him think twice about ever picking the lock knife up again. He is one of 22 young offenders who have had to come to this project since it started last August. The project's aim is to prevent reoffending by young offenders who have broken the law on more than three occasions by offering support and help with their difficulties. The Rotherham project also has a dedicated police officer known as a \"tracking officer\" who keeps a very close eye on all the offenders.</p> <p>The Rotherham project is a blueprint for the government's intensive surveillance and supervision programme to be launched on Wednesday. While the Rotherham pilot has not used electronic surveillance, its tracking officer checks up on the young offenders all the time. PC Bill Thomas is with the Rotherham project. He says it works: \"It's fair to say that Waseem's offending has not been on the same level of escalation. Waseem has had problems with his anger and we have been working on his self-esteem. But since he has been on the programme, he has become a little bit more mature and is making more informed choices.</p> <p>\"So far, we have not completely excluded offending from Waseem's life but we have reduced the seriousness and the impact of it. Waseem was very much a lad who was destined to do a lot of time because he was so chaotic. Within the project, he has got a little bit more structure and he is calmer and perhaps his future has changed.\"</p> <p>As a tracking officer, Mr Thomas uses his intelligence-collating skills garnered from his police work to make sure that his offenders feel them breathing down their collar. If they don't turn up at the programme when required, he goes out and finds them and hauls them back in - if they persist with this behaviour they find themselves back in the criminal justice system without the project's support.</p> <p>\"In real terms my role is about getting to know people like Waseem, about his family, about his habits, his environment, what his expectations are. I will then devise a plan on how we can incorporate all of those and at the same time work within the confinements of the law. If it does go wrong, I pull him up and maybe have to deal with his family and the situation in the neighbourhood if that becomes a problem,\" explains Mr Thomas. \"It should make a marked impact on some people's lives. We have had youngsters who have been on the project who have not been back inside. One young man has never reoffended and has got a steady job.\"</p> <p>Simon Perry, manager of Rotherham youth offending services, says the Rotherham project (based on a successful American one) is a sort of blueprint but adds that it is not required that the new programmes across the country replicate it.</p> <p>\"What we know is that there's a very small group of very hard to reach, socially excluded children who don't go to school, don't work, are very often homeless, very often victims of abuse and often involved in drug taking. A significant number are involved in persistent offending and because of that the more socially ostracised they become. And young people commit a disproportionate amount of crime. It is incredibly difficult to engage these chil dren,\" he explains. \"There is a greater chance that they will become potentially violent, criminally offending adults. Because they are difficult to engage, we have to take longer over doing it and that's where the word intensive is appropriate.\"</p> <p>The Rotherham project has a social worker, police officer, probation service officer, a volunteer coordinator and three development workers who work with housing, drugs and alcohol, and employment issues. It also uses volunteer mentors from within the community to work with offenders. Jackie Key, the project manager, says she has dealt with 22 offenders involved mostly in assaults, burglary and car crime. \"The majority are white and male, a proportion are mixed race or Asian children and we have had two females. A lot of them want to stop reoffending but their life circumstances have stopped them from doing that.\"</p> <p>Even in the short term, she says, the Rotherham project seems to be working. Prior to the young people coming on the programme, the number of offences they committed was 156. While on the programme the number of offences they committed was 28. The average number of weeks of the programme is 14.3; the average number of offences committed by young people prior to the programme is 7.09, while on the programme it is 1.36.</p> <p>Waseem thinks the project works. He is less violent but he hasn't stopped offending completely yet. He says it is difficult. \"I think I want to stop but sometimes it's a thrill, a buzz. But I am trying.\"</p> <p>Waseem Hussain is not a real name</p>",

History suggests that eventually the storm will abate, calm will return to world financial markets and things will start to get better. </p> <p>And when they do, we may find the world faces new and unusual challenges. After two decades in which mass unemployment has been a feature of western societies, it is likely that the next 20 years will see a return to full employment, and the result will be to change the dynamics of work, education and society. The balance between jobs and home life, the structure of our working lives, the way we educate may all be about to change. </p> <p>This notion is based on two main premises - that the world economy is not about to enter a 30s-style slump and that the relationship between unemployment and inflation has reverted to that seen in earlier epochs of industrialisation. </p> <p>The first conjecture is impossible to prove or disprove: there are those who believe that Armageddon is just around the corner, but even after the events of the past few weeks that still looks like the remotest of prospects. </p> <p>The second premise is supported by what happened in the British and US economies in both the 1980s and 1990s, when expansionary policies led to a considerable fall in unemployment without inflationary pressure emerging. This is the precise opposite of what we were told would happen by those economists who argued that macro-economics was dead. </p> <p>More technically, they turned the idea of the Phillips curve on its head. Phillips said a bit more inflation could be traded for a little less unemployment. Milton Friedman and his chums said this was untrue. The Phillips curve was in the long run a vertical line. That meant, according to the believers in a natural rate of unemployment, that any attempt to boost demand would lead to higher prices not more jobs. </p> <p><strong> Severe inflation</strong><br> </p> <p> As the years roll by, it is clear that natural-rate analysis was true, but only for the specific conditions of the late 1970s. Western countries have been prone to bouts of severe inflation, but only normally in times of war. For the most part, the competitive pressures of a market economy have kept prices in check. This was true for a prolonged period in the 1980s, when unemployment fell sharply without a rise in inflation; it was true for an even longer period in the 1990s and - given the intensified competitive pressures associated with globalisation - will be true again in the future. </p> <p>The theory may say that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, but as the graph of UK performance since the early 70s show, the only period when the theory translated into practice was in the mid-70s. The cost of ridding Britain of inflation in the 1980s was a colossal increase in unemployment, but after that there was a short period in the late 80s and a longer period from 1993 to 2000 when the line is horizontal. </p> <p>That's not to say that policymakers can simply go for growth and forget all about inflation. If economies are over-stimulated it does cause inflationary pressure, manifested either through a pick-up in the cost of living or in a disguised way through a worsening current account or unsustainable booms in asset prices. It happened in Britain with the Lawson boom of 1988 and it happened in the US in the first half of last year. </p> <p>But there is no intrinsic reason why economies should not enjoy long periods of low unemployment and low inflation. Despite all the gloom and doom, the good news is that we have it in our grasp to return to an era of full employment. </p> <p>As the Institute for Public Policy Research said last week, we are not there just yet. There are still 68 local labour markets with employment rates below 70%, compared to a national average of 75%. Direct action - and that means creating jobs as well as making people more employable - will be needed if the employment rate is to reach 80% nationwide, and nowhere be below 70%. </p> <p>Again, let us assume that is can be achieved. How will that change things? The first thing jobs for all will do is to make us a happier country. Andrew Oswald at Warwick University is Britain's leading expert on the economics of happiness and his joint research with Rafael Di Tella of Harvard Business School and Robert MacCullough of the University of Bonn shows that unemployment is far more costly in terms of wellbeing than inflation. (Although it could, of course, be argued that rising inflation leads to higher unemployment in the end anyway). </p> <p>Their estimates indicate that people would trade off a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate for a 1.7 percentage point increase in the inflation rate. The conclusion from this research is clear: once you've got unemployment down, keep it down. </p> <p>Secondly, a full employment economy --if sustained - would change the balance of power in the workplace, allowing us to re-think the way we manage our time. Prof Oswald has also found that job satisfaction in tBritain varies markedly over an individual's working life, and is lowest when people are trying to cope with the joint pressures of holding down a job and bringing up a family. This leads to stress, guilt, anxiety, and less productive workers. </p> <p>In terms of high unemployment, employers call the shots. Employees may yearn to be at home with their children, but stick around for fear of upsetting their boss. In terms of low unemployment, it is the employers who have to make the concessions. </p> <p>During the 1950s and 1960s, the battle between capital and labour was over money; in the next 20 years it will be about leisure time and workplace flexibility that means more than the ability of employers to hire and fire at will. The more progressive employers are already showing some recognition of the need to keep their staff happy, but there is a lot further to go. </p> <p>As Prof Oswald's research shows, the happiest groups of workers are the young and the old, precisely the groups of workers who have been under-utilised in the past 20 years. Employers only really want prime-age workers in their 20s, 30s and 40s, and make their lives miserable by working them too hard. This is madness. With a decrease in the number of jobs requiring hard, physical labour and an increase in longevity, it should be possible to spread our working time over a larger number of years, with the highest concentrations of activity at the beginning and the end rather than in the middle. </p> <p><strong> Shakespeare</strong><br> </p> <p> Finally, the nature of education will have to change. The shortage of jobs, particularly for the young, in the past quarter of a century has meant that there has been an obsession with turning out the sort of pupils that \"business wants\". Why teach children Shakespeare when they need to know how to write a letter asking for a job? Why bother with Wordsworth when what employers want is somebody who knows how to send an e-mail? </p> <p>But in full employment world, there is the chance for education to do something different, to prepare children for life rather than work. With more and more people having to cope with ageing parents, it seems quite a good idea to study King Lear. With the tension between growth and the environment, an intimate knowledge of the Romantic poets may be more useful than being able to surf the net. Full employment allows society to ask some questions that need answering. Perhaps that's why it's never been all that popular. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Cable &amp; Wireless will add to its \u00a34bn cash pile today when it announces that it has sold its controlling stake in Optus, Australia's second largest telecoms operator, to Singapore Telecommunications. </p> <p>The cash and paper bid, which saw off a rival offer from Vodafone, is likely to value Optus at around A$ 17bn (\u00a36bn) and will increase the pressure on C&amp;W's chief executive, Graham Wallace, to return some cash to shareholders. </p> <p>Investors have been pressing for a share buyback or a special dividend since a bungled profits warning wiped 20% wiped off C&amp;W's share price a couple of weeks ago. </p> <p>It is thought that more than half the payment for C&amp;W's 52.5% holding will made in cash. </p> <p>Vodafone was yesterday trying to mask its disappointment in losing the long-running battle for control of Optus. Announcing it was pulling out of the auction, Vodafone said it wanted to grow a profitable business in Australia but that the proposed deal \"did not meet\" its return criteria. </p> <p>But the sale to SingTel, 78% owned by the Singapore government, is a blow to its ambitions in the region. Vodafone wanted Optus for its mobile phone arm. A deal would have left it with a 40% share of the Australian mobile phone market. </p> <p>SingTel's offer is thought to have triumphed primarily because it presented few regulatory problems but also because of its composition. </p> <p>Vodafone's bid faced opposition from the Australian regulators who were concerned that it might create a damaging duopoly.

      "bodyText": "Cable &amp; Wireless will add to its \u00a34bn cash pile today when it announces that it has sold its controlling stake in Optus, Australia's second largest telecoms operator, to Singapore Telecommunications. The cash and paper bid, which saw off a rival offer from Vodafone, is likely to value Optus at around A$ 17bn (\u00a36bn) and will increase the pressure on C&amp;W's chief executive, Graham Wallace, to return some cash to shareholders. Investors have been pressing for a share buyback or a special dividend since a bungled profits warning wiped 20% wiped off C&amp;W's share price a couple of weeks ago. It is thought that more than half the payment for C&amp;W's 52.5% holding will made in cash. Vodafone was yesterday trying to mask its disappointment in losing the long-running battle for control of Optus. Announcing it was pulling out of the auction, Vodafone said it wanted to grow a profitable business in Australia but that the proposed deal \"did not meet\" its return criteria. But the sale to SingTel, 78% owned by the Singapore government, is a blow to its ambitions in the region. Vodafone wanted Optus for its mobile phone arm. A deal would have left it with a 40% share of the Australian mobile phone market. SingTel's offer is thought to have triumphed primarily because it presented few regulatory problems but also because of its composition. Vodafone's bid faced opposition from the Australian regulators who were concerned that it might create a damaging duopoly. Although Vodafone sought to clear the way for its offer by presenting the regulators with a plan to transfer 1m of its mobile telephone customers to a rival, it still risked being blocked. The SingTel deal is expected to be waved through by local regulators. C&amp;W is also thought to have looked more favourably on SingTel's offer because of its big cash element. C&amp;W sold its controlling interest in Hongkong Telecom to Pacific Century Cyberworks for \u00a34.2bn in cash and 450m PCCW shares last year, but got its fingers burnt when PCCW's stock price collapsed in the aftermath of the deal.

      "body": "<p>In a memorable scene from the first episode of New EastEnders, a new BBC documentary series about the artists in London's Hoxton, Philippe Bradshaw shows viewers around the unconverted women's toilet that used to be his studio. Later on he is filmed in a new space in a former office building in nearby Bethnal Green, where he is assembling an installation destined for Paris and based on Fragonard's The Swing. As his model eases herself into position on set, Bradshaw talks about living apart from his partner and their four-year-old son: he sees life as an artist as incompatible with family. \"It's quite a selfish environment, which just serves its own purpose, which is to produce The Work.\" </p> <p>Bradshaw is in the ascendant, and one senses he is open all hours, working the circuit as vigorously as any glamour model. If Tracey Emin is the pearly queen of the New EastEnders, then Bradshaw is a prince in waiting. He is a member of the new aristocracy. The hedonism his new life requires is as artful as his Fragonard. </p> <p>Emin is filmed at the Lux cinema in Hoxton Square as a group of Turkish musicians play the theme tune from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It's for a 60-second movie sponsored by Becks, the beer of choice at many a private view. Bradshaw probably drinks it, and he makes art out of what he drinks. At the opening for his show in Bethnal Green - \"an inventory of everything I drank\" - he urinates over his own installation of empties, then turns to the camera, laughing, as the credits roll. Rents are high, price matters. Bradshaw is on a roll, and there is no room for doubt. </p> <p>In the same episode we follow work on British Wildlife, a new silhouette sculpture by Tim Noble and Sue Webster. The sculpture is made from a collection of stuffed animals. \"My dad got ill recently, and died,\" explains Noble. \"We had to clear his house out. He was an artist and had a lot of stuffed animals that I think he'd stolen from a museum. We took the stuffed animal collection and decided to do something with it.\" </p> <p>From Noble's inheritance they fashion their trademark double silhouette projected on to the gallery walls. At the opening night, the camera observes Noble discussing the piece and his father's legacy. \"Maybe he's up in heaven looking down,\" says his companion. Noble laughs, looks up and gives the finger. They both laugh and then Noble turns his head and says to no one in particular: \"I hope so ... \" </p> <p>Filmed by Simon Chu and Mary Sackville-West over the past six months, New EastEnders is a hugely entertaining cinema-verite take on how the art world operates - which is more or less in zero gravity. There is a strange sense of weightlessness at the heart of the Britart phenomenon, as if it's trapped in its own hall of mirrors. Now Hoxton is sufficiently well-known for a documentary to be made about it, the community that made the area what it is is being priced out. With the West End moving east, and East End prices moving west, Hoxton's artists have been prised from their most famous installation: Hoxton itself. </p> <p>Inevitably the artists, dealers and curators who agreed to be filmed define what we see of their world, but New EastEnders reveals more than its participants are aware. The series covers four major themes: the artist, the gallery, the show and the market. Shot on a shoestring, the films approach their subject with a candid-camera invisibility. Each episode threads three or four strands together; it could be a young artist looking for a dealer, or a dealer looking for Charles Saatchi, or the curator of Apocalypse facing his first bad press. It's all about context over content. There is no intrinsic value system, and the documentary offers a detached account of what is going on in Hoxton. Like the ladder standing in the Chapman brothers' freshly whitewashed gallery, its status depends entirely on who put it there, whether they call it art - and whether we believe them. It is all potentially significant, and it is all equally weightless. </p> <p>As if to underline this, a Godardian soundtrack of extraneous noise swells and falls through each episode. Victoria Miro opens the doors to her new gallery to the cacophonous hammering and drilling of her East End crew of artisans, which gives way to the gallery dinner and the murmur of West End diners, the generic buzz of the private view spilling out on to the street, and the indifferent drone of London's traffic. These noises off signal how close to chaos and brass tacks the art world always is. For the underlying theme of the series, from the opening montage of gallery and estate-agent signs to Michael Landy's anti-monumental Break Down in the last episode, is commodity. </p> <p>The New EastEnders appear acutely aware of their commodity value; some translate it into real money, which in turn translates into more work. Noble and Webster, and Jake Chapman in his guise as Britart's Victor Meldrew, disparage the production-line ethos their work inspires in dealers east or west. Freeze veteran Matt Collishaw, meanwhile, admits to being \"only really happy when you conceive the idea. You have an orgasm of conception, and after that it is just work, and boring.\" </p> <p>Collishaw stands out because he says exactly what he wants to do and the problems he faces in achieving it. Another memorable figure is Hoxton estate agent James Goff. At the beginning of the first episode he takes a young artist from Nottingham, Laura White, to view a studio on Charlotte Road, \"the Bond Street of Shoreditch\". It costs \u00a320,000 a year to rent. He smiles: \"It's all part of this artists' culture thing, isn't it, the little garret and working away ...?\" Look further east, he tells her, and a bemused White nods. It's time for her to face some home truths. Hoxton is not a place to begin a career: you have to come ready-made. </p> <p>Noble and Webster live next door to Goff. They are Hoxton's leading brand, using their celebrity the way Carl Andre used his bricks. They featured as \"conceptualists with attitude\" in an episode of the BBC documentary Living With the Enemy, and attitude is their sharpest tool. At one point in New EastEnders, Webster is heard saying, \"I hate being a part of any community. I don't want to be part of a crowd,\" at the same time as she draws up a guest list of 350 for her birthday party and the opening of British Wildlife. In the art of Noble and Webster, celebrity is its own reward. </p> <p>At the other end of town, metaphorically, Sandy Simeonides installs his sculptures in the dead of night in Hoxton Square.

We want some fucking art!\" The next day Noble and Webster come across Simeonides's work in cruel daylight. It doesn't look anything like it did the night before. \"Is it a TV aerial?\" asks Sue, barely breaking her step before walking out of shot.

      "body": "<p>US intelligence services instigated and abetted rightwing terrorism in Italy during the 1970s, a former Italian secret service general has claimed.</p> <p>The allegation was made by General Gianadelio Maletti, a former head of military counter-intelligence, at the trial last week of rightwing extremists accused of killing 16 people in the bombing of a Milan bank in 1969 - the first time such a charge has been made in a court of law by a senior Italian intelligence figure.</p> <p>Gen Maletti, comannder of the counter-intelligence section of the military intelligence service from 1971 to 1975, said his men had discovered that a rightwing terrorist cell in the Venice region had been supplied with military explosives from Germany.</p> <p>Those explosives may have been obtained with the help of members of the US intelligence community, an indication that the Americans had gone beyond the infiltration and monitoring of extremist groups to instigating acts of violence, he said.</p> <p>\"The CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], following the directives of its government, wanted to create an Italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left and, for this purpose, it may have made use of rightwing terrorism,\" Gen Maletti told the Milan court. \"I believe this is what happened in other countries as well.\"</p> <p>The general has been living in South Africa for the last 21 years as a fugitive from Italian justice. He has been sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for leaking a secret service document to the press and last year received a 15-year sentence for obstructing justice. He was granted a special 15-day immunity from arrest to enable him to give evidence at the trial for the bombing of a bank in Milan's Piazza Fontana, the atrocity that inaugurated the \"strategy of tension\", a series of bombings intended to shift the country's political centre of gravity to the right.</p> <p>\"The impression was that the Americans would do anything to stop Italy from sliding to the left,\" Gen Maletti said during an interview at his Milan hotel.</p> <p>\"Don't forget that [former US president Richard] Nixon was in charge and Nixon was a strange man, a very intelligent politician but a man of rather unorthodox initiatives.\"</p> <p>The CIA supported SID, the Italian defence intelligence service, financially, but Gen Maletti's US counterparts were rarely willing to share information. There may have been good reason for the American caginess. In a posthumous memoir published last year, the wartime resistance hero Count Edgardo Sogno described how he visited the CIA station chief in Rome in July 1974 to inform him of his plans for an anti-communist coup.</p> <p>\"I told him that I was informing him as an ally in the struggle for the freedom of the west and asked him what the attitude of the American government would be,\" Mr Sogno wrote. \"He answered what I already knew: the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government.\"</p> <p>Despite contacts with his CIA counterparts, no word of the Sogno plot was uttered. \"I, for one, didn't know about the Sogno thing. I knew Mr Sogno was being investigated by a Turin magistrate but I didn't know he had such important contacts with US agencies in the United States and Italy,\" Gen Maletti said. \"Clearly, Sogno had great confidence in the complicity of the American service.\"</p> <p>The lucid 79-year-old general, whose English is almost perfect, has spent his retirement in South Africa painting and writing his memoirs, which are due to be published soon. He admits to feeling nostalgic for his homeland.</p> <p>But the judges who convicted him in absentia last year were far from convinced of his gentlemanly qualities. In their written verdict they said he had obstructed an investigation into a 1973 attack on the interior minister by withholding crucial information from the magistrates.</p> <p>Four members of the public were killed and 45 injured when an anarchist, Gianfranco Bertoli, hurled a grenade into a crowd outside police headquarters in Milan. Bertoli, according to the judges, was really a man of right-wing sympathies and a long-standing SID informant, codenamed Negro.

      "bodyText": "US intelligence services instigated and abetted rightwing terrorism in Italy during the 1970s, a former Italian secret service general has claimed. The allegation was made by General Gianadelio Maletti, a former head of military counter-intelligence, at the trial last week of rightwing extremists accused of killing 16 people in the bombing of a Milan bank in 1969 - the first time such a charge has been made in a court of law by a senior Italian intelligence figure. Gen Maletti, comannder of the counter-intelligence section of the military intelligence service from 1971 to 1975, said his men had discovered that a rightwing terrorist cell in the Venice region had been supplied with military explosives from Germany. Those explosives may have been obtained with the help of members of the US intelligence community, an indication that the Americans had gone beyond the infiltration and monitoring of extremist groups to instigating acts of violence, he said. \"The CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], following the directives of its government, wanted to create an Italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left and, for this purpose, it may have made use of rightwing terrorism,\" Gen Maletti told the Milan court. \"I believe this is what happened in other countries as well.\" The general has been living in South Africa for the last 21 years as a fugitive from Italian justice. He has been sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for leaking a secret service document to the press and last year received a 15-year sentence for obstructing justice. He was granted a special 15-day immunity from arrest to enable him to give evidence at the trial for the bombing of a bank in Milan's Piazza Fontana, the atrocity that inaugurated the \"strategy of tension\", a series of bombings intended to shift the country's political centre of gravity to the right. \"The impression was that the Americans would do anything to stop Italy from sliding to the left,\" Gen Maletti said during an interview at his Milan hotel. \"Don't forget that [former US president Richard] Nixon was in charge and Nixon was a strange man, a very intelligent politician but a man of rather unorthodox initiatives.\" The CIA supported SID, the Italian defence intelligence service, financially, but Gen Maletti's US counterparts were rarely willing to share information. There may have been good reason for the American caginess. In a posthumous memoir published last year, the wartime resistance hero Count Edgardo Sogno described how he visited the CIA station chief in Rome in July 1974 to inform him of his plans for an anti-communist coup. \"I told him that I was informing him as an ally in the struggle for the freedom of the west and asked him what the attitude of the American government would be,\" Mr Sogno wrote. \"He answered what I already knew: the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government.\" Despite contacts with his CIA counterparts, no word of the Sogno plot was uttered. \"I, for one, didn't know about the Sogno thing. I knew Mr Sogno was being investigated by a Turin magistrate but I didn't know he had such important contacts with US agencies in the United States and Italy,\" Gen Maletti said. \"Clearly, Sogno had great confidence in the complicity of the American service.\" The lucid 79-year-old general, whose English is almost perfect, has spent his retirement in South Africa painting and writing his memoirs, which are due to be published soon. He admits to feeling nostalgic for his homeland. But the judges who convicted him in absentia last year were far from convinced of his gentlemanly qualities. In their written verdict they said he had obstructed an investigation into a 1973 attack on the interior minister by withholding crucial information from the magistrates. Four members of the public were killed and 45 injured when an anarchist, Gianfranco Bertoli, hurled a grenade into a crowd outside police headquarters in Milan. Bertoli, according to the judges, was really a man of right-wing sympathies and a long-standing SID informant, codenamed Negro. Gen Maletti's men were warned in advance of the attack on the minister, Mariano Rumor, but took no action to prevent it and failed to pass on their information on Bertoli even after the killings. Gen Maletti's role at the heart of the complex intrigues makes him an illuminating witness. Italy must clarify the mysteries of that time if it is to recover its national dignity and sovereignty, he said. \"Among the larger western European countries, Italy has been dealt with as a sort of protectorate. I am ashamed to think that we are still subject to special supervision.\"",

George Bush has reversed these priorities. He, or at least influential figures in his administration, really do want to implement the Iraqi Liberation Act - whereby the US will help the Iraqi opposition to bring \"representative\" government to Iraq - to which Mr Clinton paid mere lip service. President Saddam, not Mr Sharon, is the problem on which all must \"focus and unite\". And, as a vital part of that, there must be a revival of the Gulf war coalition under which the previous President Bush drove the Iraqi leader from Kuwait.</p> <p>This suits Mr Sharon, though he wants more. On his inaugural visit to the US, he sought to promote the notion that Yasser Arafat, far from being the partner for peace that till now the US and Israel had considered him to be, had reverted with a vengeance to his original \"terrorist\" self. If the Palestinian leader has any natural partner, it is President Saddam, the Israeli right argues. The two sustain and reinforce each other. And along with others - Iran, Hizbullah, Hamas - they constitute a threat to Israel, the US and the whole moderate peace-seeking camp.</p> <p>The US does not go along with all of that. But it has ceded a substantial amount of what Mr Sharon wants. It agrees that there can be \"no negotiation under fire\", a way of saying that Palestinian violence is not a normal response to occupation, and that \"leaders have a responsibility to denounce violence\" - a way of saying that Mr Arafat condones the attacks on Israelis. Nor will the US force peace on the parties: they must settle matters between themselves - a pro-Israeli position, in that without external assistance the Palestinians cannot hope to dent a balance of power overwhelmingly in Israel's favour.</p> <p><b> Partisanship</b><br></p> <p>Many Arab regimes would agree with the US that President Saddam is a menace, though far less to Israel than to themselves.

Ironically, Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab states which have made peace with Israel, have led the way in this. It is only the opposition of the Gulf states, who do regard President Saddam as a greater menace than Mr Sharon, that will keep the summit from bringing him into the fold. It is one thing for the US, with help from its Arab friends, to impede his rehabilitation. It is quite another to expect them to join in a campaign to bring him down. Reviving the Gulf war coalition, said the Saudi newspaper al-Watan, \"is like trying to sell goods whose sell-by label expired long ago\".</p> <p>So the harder Mr Sharon smites the Palestinians - and probably in due course Hizbullah and the Syrians too - and the more the Americans besiege and imperil President Saddam, the more likely it becomes that this gambler, who invaded Iran and then Kuwait, will escalate from belligerent words to belligerent deeds and, with Israel-Palestine as his arena, stage the last great, pre-emptive gamble of his tumultuous career.

A short distance away stood a house with its red tiled roof gaping where a shell had entered, injuring four ethnic Albanian civilians.</p> <p>No one was killed, but the 5,000 villagers in rebel-held Sipkovica are not counting on being so lucky next time.</p> <p>On the main road snaking up the hillside below the village, Macedonian armoured personnel carriers were fighting their way up the little hanging valley, which holds the main guerrilla base in the town of Selce and nearby Sipkovica.</p> <p>Entering the village, a fighter of the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army, his face sunburned from manning his position in the mountains, strolled by in fatigues. We asked to speak to him but he drew a zip across his mouth and walked on. His colleagues were down a slope of orchards where some of the fiercest of the clashes with Macedonian forces took place yesterday around the village of Gajre. It was identifiable by plumes of dense white smoke, and fires visible through the trees.</p> <p>While the NLA was fighting, the women and children of Sipkovica were sheltering in cellars. In one house was Nayo, who had recently returned from his home in England to fetch his 13-year-old daughter, Brevina, and bring her to safety. Now he is trapped in the village, too scared to go to Tetovo and unwilling to attempt the 12-hour walk over the snow-covered Shar mountains to the safety of Kosovo.</p> <p>Brevina, her 80-year-old grandmother, mother and other relatives crouched in a darkened basement, its only window - at ceiling level - blocked off by stacks of wood to protect them from shrapnel.</p> <p>In the five days since the village first came under fire, the family's neighbours have also been gathering at night to sit around the stove on the mattresses that Nayo has spread on the floor.</p> <p>Brevina was brought forward, a slight and pretty girl with an ashen worried face. \"I am very scared,\" she said.</p> <p>\"They started shelling at six o'clock this morning,\" Nayo said. \"We could see the village of Lavce hit by over 20 shells. They are shelling from the ski station and from the mountain opposite as well. We saw helicopters come in three times to lead the attack.</p> <p>\"People don't want this. We just want to live our lives. If you ask me - am I scared? - I have to say I was scared two hours ago. Now I'm not frightened. I only have one life, what else can I do.

      "bodyText": "The trail of blood led down the cobbled narrow lane towards the mosque. A short distance away stood a house with its red tiled roof gaping where a shell had entered, injuring four ethnic Albanian civilians. No one was killed, but the 5,000 villagers in rebel-held Sipkovica are not counting on being so lucky next time. On the main road snaking up the hillside below the village, Macedonian armoured personnel carriers were fighting their way up the little hanging valley, which holds the main guerrilla base in the town of Selce and nearby Sipkovica. Entering the village, a fighter of the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army, his face sunburned from manning his position in the mountains, strolled by in fatigues. We asked to speak to him but he drew a zip across his mouth and walked on. His colleagues were down a slope of orchards where some of the fiercest of the clashes with Macedonian forces took place yesterday around the village of Gajre. It was identifiable by plumes of dense white smoke, and fires visible through the trees. While the NLA was fighting, the women and children of Sipkovica were sheltering in cellars. In one house was Nayo, who had recently returned from his home in England to fetch his 13-year-old daughter, Brevina, and bring her to safety. Now he is trapped in the village, too scared to go to Tetovo and unwilling to attempt the 12-hour walk over the snow-covered Shar mountains to the safety of Kosovo. Brevina, her 80-year-old grandmother, mother and other relatives crouched in a darkened basement, its only window - at ceiling level - blocked off by stacks of wood to protect them from shrapnel. In the five days since the village first came under fire, the family's neighbours have also been gathering at night to sit around the stove on the mattresses that Nayo has spread on the floor. Brevina was brought forward, a slight and pretty girl with an ashen worried face. \"I am very scared,\" she said. \"They started shelling at six o'clock this morning,\" Nayo said. \"We could see the village of Lavce hit by over 20 shells. They are shelling from the ski station and from the mountain opposite as well. We saw helicopters come in three times to lead the attack. \"People don't want this. We just want to live our lives. If you ask me - am I scared? - I have to say I was scared two hours ago. Now I'm not frightened. I only have one life, what else can I do. This is reality.\" Like everyone in the village he was aware how close the Macedonian forces were. \"They will come here and they will fight,\" he said. \"Then they will destroy this village and my house to show the world how strong they are. I don't want to fight. What have I to fight with - with my empty hands? But if I had a weapon I would fight. I am so shocked by this\". \"I believed that Macedonia would never have a war. I thought Macedonians and Albanians could talk it out.\" What's going on? The fighting in Macedonia explained Map: where is Tetovo? Talk about it Should Nato intervene?

      "bodyText": "Germany's conservatives held on to the richest state of Baden W\u00fcrttemberg yesterday, defying predictions that the opposition party was about to lose its traditional stronghold. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) won 45% of the vote, according to exit polls, compared with 41.3% in the last election five years ago. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which is viewed as the epitome of German post-war success, had looked in danger of falling out of the conservative grip after almost half a century. The conservatives had been unsettled by internal rows over party funding, and threatened by the ruling Social Democrats' (SPD) charismatic woman candidate, Ute Vogt. The results are likely to secure, at least for the time being, the position of Angela Merkel who took over as national CDU leader last year, promising a new start after a slush-fund scandal centring on the former chancellor Helmut Kohl. Edmund Stoiber, the eurosceptic prime minister of Bavaria and leader of the CDU's sister party, the CSU, has made no secret of his ambition to replace Ms Merkel as the main challenger to Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at next year's general election. The SPD's gains of 8.1% failed to unsettle the CDU, which benefited from bad performances by the Greens and far right Republicans in the state. Mr Schr\u00f6der will see the SPD gains as the voters' endorsement of his Neue Mitte [new centre] brand of moderate, market-friendly socialism. But the results are also down to the appeal of Ms Vogt, who throughout the campaign consistently polled 11 points more than the 25% achieved by the SPD in the 1996 election. At 36, the photogenic lawyer from Heidelberg is the youngest lead candidate ever fielded by a main party in a post-war state election. Her rival, state premier 61-year-old Erwin Teufel, who has ruled the staunchly conservative Roman Catholic state for 10 years, campaigned on the adage: \"It's competence that counts\", urging voters not to risk spoiling the state's successes. He presented the left as unpatriotic and unfit to rule Germany, hammering home his point by ending his rallies with the national anthem. In next-door Rhineland-Palatinate, the ruling SPD won about 44%, against just under 40% five years ago. The CDU dropped to about 36% from nearly 39%, according to exit polls. In Austria, the poor results of the far right Freedom Party (FPO) in yesterday's Vienna city elections indicate that its popularity has fallen nationwide. In its first real test since entering a coalition government after polling almost 29% in national polls a year ago, the FPO received just 20% of the vote in the capital, down almost 8% from five years ago. The election campaign was overshadowed by claims that Mr Haider, who resigned as party leader in May, but remains its strongest force, led an anti-Semitic, xenophobic campaign, in which he lashed out at Ariel Muzicant, head of the city's Jewish community.",

Eric Ambler's screenplay, from Nicholas Montsarrat's novel, encompasses both the tedium of long weeks at sea and the courage of men under fire. Jack Hawkins is the war-weary skipper, leading the likes of Stanley Baker, Donald Sinden, Denholm Elliott. </p> <p><strong> Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</strong><br> (Jay Roach, 1999) <br>10pm, Sky Premier</p> <p>Yeah, baby, yeah, he's back: the psychedelically challenged superspy returns for a second duel with Dr Evil. Since the fizzy formula of the original International Man Of Mystery - crass jokes, spy-spoof buffoonery and swinging 60s stupidities - proved so potent at the box office, there seems little reason to change it. So Roach again directs, Mikes Myers again plays both Powers and his nemesis (plus the gruesome security man, Fat Bastard), while Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell replaces Liz Hurley's Vanessa Kensington as the sexy sidekick. Great - but excruciating - fun. </p> <p><strong> Chinatown</strong> <br>(Roman Polanski, 1974)<br> 10pm, Sky Cinema</p> <p>Near faultless recreation of film noir, set in a dazzling 30s Los Angeles shaded by the themes of evil and corruption that seem to resonate in the Polanski psyche. Jack Nicholson is private eye JJ Gittes, Faye Dunaway the femme fatale, as a murder at a dam starts a tortuous trail towards lecherous old John Huston. Scriptwriter Robert Towne invests Gittes with a Chandleresque nobility. </p> <p><strong> Ravenous </strong><br> (Antonia Bird, 1999) <br>10pm, Sky MovieMax</p> <p> Forget Ridley Scott's toothless Hannibal: for a really unspeakable portrait of murderous cannibalism, this is the genuine article. Director Bird has fashioned a hilarious, bloody, gothic Western in which a small band of soldiers at a remote, snowy army outpost in the high Nevadas, circa 1847, are picked off by Robert Carlyle's demonic Colquhoun. It's a superb portrait of a gleeful maneater, with Guy Pearce as the horrified Captain Boyd, headed for a final showdown.</p> <p><strong> Sports</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Live Tennis </strong><br> 5pm, British Eurosport/ONsport1</p> <p> The best tennis players in the world get together for the Ericsson Open. But while it may be one tournament there are two broadcasters, with British Eurosport showing the women and the men on ONsport1. To add to the confusion, the men are playing their third round today while the women are on the fourth.</p>",

Eric Ambler's screenplay, from Nicholas Montsarrat's novel, encompasses both the tedium of long weeks at sea and the courage of men under fire. Jack Hawkins is the war-weary skipper, leading the likes of Stanley Baker, Donald Sinden, Denholm Elliott. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (Jay Roach, 1999) 10pm, Sky Premier Yeah, baby, yeah, he's back: the psychedelically challenged superspy returns for a second duel with Dr Evil. Since the fizzy formula of the original International Man Of Mystery - crass jokes, spy-spoof buffoonery and swinging 60s stupidities - proved so potent at the box office, there seems little reason to change it. So Roach again directs, Mikes Myers again plays both Powers and his nemesis (plus the gruesome security man, Fat Bastard), while Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell replaces Liz Hurley's Vanessa Kensington as the sexy sidekick. Great - but excruciating - fun. Chinatown (Roman Polanski, 1974) 10pm, Sky Cinema Near faultless recreation of film noir, set in a dazzling 30s Los Angeles shaded by the themes of evil and corruption that seem to resonate in the Polanski psyche. Jack Nicholson is private eye JJ Gittes, Faye Dunaway the femme fatale, as a murder at a dam starts a tortuous trail towards lecherous old John Huston. Scriptwriter Robert Towne invests Gittes with a Chandleresque nobility. Ravenous (Antonia Bird, 1999) 10pm, Sky MovieMax Forget Ridley Scott's toothless Hannibal: for a really unspeakable portrait of murderous cannibalism, this is the genuine article. Director Bird has fashioned a hilarious, bloody, gothic Western in which a small band of soldiers at a remote, snowy army outpost in the high Nevadas, circa 1847, are picked off by Robert Carlyle's demonic Colquhoun. It's a superb portrait of a gleeful maneater, with Guy Pearce as the horrified Captain Boyd, headed for a final showdown. Sports Live Tennis 5pm, British Eurosport/ONsport1 The best tennis players in the world get together for the Ericsson Open. But while it may be one tournament there are two broadcasters, with British Eurosport showing the women and the men on ONsport1. To add to the confusion, the men are playing their third round today while the women are on the fourth.",

And if they were colour cameras, then so much the better.</p> <p>The past three years have proved that large audiences on mainstream channels can be attracted by a certain sort of history programme. ITV's unexpected success in 1999 with World War Two In Colour, and the follow-up Britain At War, made a crucial breakthrough in peaktime because they were drawing on rarely seen colour archives.

Yet Time Of Our Lives differs in a crucial aspect from these and other recent themed histories, including Channel 4's hit Elizabeth (about Queen Elizabeth I) and Simon Schama's History Of Britain. For it traces the changes wrought in ordinary lives by peacetime prosperity and social mobility. In some ways it is a high-risk project for ITV because it does not contain the kind of footage that has a proven track record of wowing audiences.</p> <p>BBC Timewatch's biggest ever audience (4.3 million), recalls Laurence Rees, creative head of history for the BBC, was Hitler's Secret Weapons. At the other end of the spectrum, lightweight nostalgia programmes that look at popular culture through pop and video clips, find it possible to \"do\" 1982 without mentioning the Falklands War. \"The history of history programmes on television tells us that the audience are interested in archive footage\", says Rees. \"But it's no guarantee that a programme will do well.\" \"If we can bring an audience to Time Of Our Lives I know they will enjoy it\", says David Liddiment, the programme director of ITV.</p> <p>But is television really the right medium through which to tell stories stretching back more than a couple of decades? Adrian Wood, the film archivist who thought up World War Two In Colour, thinks so. \"Actual footage and colour film in particular enables the viewer to identify with people. I remember going through archive footage of the refugees from the fall of Paris and the faces looked so very similar to those refugees caught in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the time.\"</p> <p>But the simple idea behind Time Of Our Lives, devised by an independent production company, RDF, is to see postwar changes - the rise of feminism, the birth of the National Health Service, the increase in divorce - through the personal histories and verbal testimonies of three families, neatly divided into upper, middle and working class.</p> <p>This is fairly conventional stuff: the (inevitable) decline and fall of the traditional upper class is supposedly represented by the fate of the Scottish Corbetts, an aristocratic family, shaken from the top of their tree by mismanagement, and the fatal liaison of the eldest son and heir with a transsexual model, April Ashley. The present Lord Rowallan talks of losing his castle, his possessions and his two wives. But by the third and final programme, he is remarkably happy with wife number three, running a show-jumping stable at a farm salvaged from the estate, while his son and heir is working as a west London estate agent.</p> <p>One of the main criteria for selecting the families - the essential \"casting\" without which no \"real people\" shows on television ever proceed - says the show's producer Malcolm Clark, was the availability of film footage. For the middle-class doctor's family, the Ashworths from Didsbury, home movies were available from the late 50s. The Rowallan clan had starred in a BBC Scotland series in 1973. As for the engaging working-class family, the industrious East End Beardsells who achieve modest prosperity, buying shares and their council house and going on foreign holidays, Clark says: \"We knew there wouldn't be any of them. Cameras were expensive, so we had to search for footage to illustrate their lives.\" One family member, Dora, describes her pride in making a converted Nissan hut into her first family home, as a news reel illustrates the shed-style houses.</p> <p>Later Dora became a feted shop steward at the Ford Motor Company, heading a strike of women workers for fair pay, and was invited to lead a group onto the BBC's Terry Wogan show. In the 1990s, her story centres on how she briefly falls out over class with her daughter, who works in the City and married into a wealthier family - cue video footage of a white wedding in a marquee.</p> <p>But Clark says: \"Most important, more than the footage, was their stories. They had to be strong, they had to be representative of their class, but also have lively memories of what had happened.</p> <p>\"This series is about things we are familiar with, and, as a society, we underplay the changes. Yet when you put them all together, and look back over nearly 60 years, you realise how utterly things have changed. We find it hard to believe that we and our parents have in fact lived through amazing times. In part, this series is a celebration of how well we are doing.\"</p> <p>At times the portentous music, swooping introductory camera work and laboured narration seem to load too great a significance on the highly selective accounts given by the three families, who are never allowed to demonstrate too much complexity. But, as Clark adds, he didn't pay any of the families to participate. \"No one asked. It is amazing how much goo will you get for making a history.\" </p> <p>All somewhat different from the worries about World War Two In Colour, and indeed other war series. Since there is no Japanese or Russian-shot colour footage of military engagements, the action is portrayed through American eyes and, (on the Russian front), from a German perspective. \"Also, it is true that all the archives of Nazi and Russian engagements are shot by totalitarian regimes\", adds Rees. \"But at the end of the day, the debate, like all history, is the same: whatever the medium, be suspicious of the sources.\"</p> <p>Wood says: \"What we are doing is accessible history programmes for a large audience.

The BBC production guidelines warn against filming people who may not be capable of understanding what such exposure means, and Malcolm must have been a tough decision in this respect. But the scene in which he finally cleans out his car before retiring it is deeply pow erful: a moment of real bereavement, in a culture in which wheels have largely replaced feet. </p> <p>While exceptions can be made in America for the Seinfields and the Tyler Moores, it's usually dismaying when the star of a British comedy has the same name on both the fictional and factual sides of the cast list.

He was seen by many in the environment movement as a tenacious hero, and a pioneer of non-violent direct action. Others, notably the French government, treated him at times like a terrorist.</p> <p>Despite his extraordinary flair in gaining publicity for the causes he believed in, McTaggart was an intensely private man. He rarely talked about himself and when he did some of the stories were so surprising it was hard to believe them, yet he had amazing contacts, astonishing adventures and successes - notably stopping the French continuing atmospheric testing on nuclear weapons in the 1970s, and a seven-year campaign, ending in 1991, to save Antarctica from mining.</p> <p>He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and nothing about his early life gave a hint of what was to follow. He said his family had a long history of Scottish Calvinism, although apart from a strong work ethic and an absolute belief in non-violence the rest of the family ideals seem to have passed him by. He smoked heavily, often drank a lot, and his language was peppered with expletives even when mixing with senior diplomats and politicians. He had at least two wives and a number of daughters, finally fathering a much wanted son when in his early 60s.</p> <p>McTaggart's teens were spent skiing, playing tennis, squash and golf. He particularly excelled at badminton, becoming three times Canadian national champion, the first time while still a junior. He had left school at 17, went into the construction business and for 20 years built up a very large business, first in Canada and then in the United States. All this came to an abrupt end when an explosion wrecked a ski lodge he was building in Bear Mountain, east of San Francisco. Several workers were hurt in the accident and he blamed himself - paying out a considerable part of the fortune he had amassed in compensation.</p> <p>This accident changed his life. He abandoned his wife and children, bought a yacht, the Vega, and set off on a trip round the Pacific to find out about himself - as he put it.</p> <p>Three years later he was still travelling rather aimlessly when he answered an advertisement asking for volunteers to sail to Mururoa to protest at the French government still doing atmospheric nuclear tests, when the rest of the world had already agreed to go underground.</p> <p>The advertisement was placed by Greenpeace, a fledgling organisation that, using Quaker techniques, had originally protested against US tests in the Canadian Pacific but had no volunteers in the southern hemisphere.</p> <p>The next bit of the story, told in McTaggart's long out of print book Greenpeace III, Journey into the Bomb, reads like a Boys Own adventure. By his own account he was more annoyed by the French government's unilateral decision to close part of the Pacific to all shipping than about the issue of nuclear testing, but his encounters with the French changed all that.</p> <p>Despite every effort of the New Zealand government to stop him leaving, and a cat and mouse game with the French navy, he succeeded in holding up the tests by sailing within a few miles of the about to be detonated bomb, daring them to kill him. His tiny yacht was eventually rammed and taken in tow by a minesweeper, an action the French tried to pass off as a rescue.</p> <p>It was a lesson in propaganda he was not to forget. The yacht was boarded again and he was badly beaten by French commandos, nearly losing the sight of an eye. The French tried to claim he had an accident, but the graphic photographs on a film taken by a fellow crew member and smuggled out in her vagina showed the French lied and gave McTaggart worldwide publicity. The French abandoned atmospheric testing.</p> <p>Although in his mid-40s, McTaggart set about creating a Greenpeace in Europe, finding like-minded people and setting up national organisations. The British branch started in 1978 and was run by Peter Wilkinson, a former Friends of the Earth campaigner. By 1979 Greenpeace was unified across the Atlantic and McTaggart was running it - remaining chairman until 1991.</p> <p>The swashbuckling David and Goliath image of Greenpeace, with idealistic campaigners in tiny rubber boats placing themselves between whaling boats and the whales, or ships dumping nuclear waste and the ocean, appealed to the public. McTaggart made sure that where his boats went film crews went too.</p> <p>The most astonishing miscalculation by the French in 1985, when they sent two secret service agents to sink the Greenpeace flagship in New Zealand on the eve of a new trip to Mururoa, transformed Greenpeace into a huge organisation. Money poured in from all over the world and it was able to run a fleet of ships and dozens of campaigns at once.</p> <p>McTaggart held on to the reins of power for another five years but the organisation became too big and too bureaucratic for his rough and ready style of management. Although he remained immensely influential, Greenpeace pushed him aside.</p> <p>Despite these changed circumstances he continued to campaign and attended every International Whaling Commission meeting. His job as he saw it was to lobby behind the scenes with the people he knew, and until his death he ran an organisation called the Third Millennium Foundation. Its latest project was a Caribbean-wide convention to protect the marine environment.</p> <p>McTaggart lived at Paciano in Italy, where he grew olives, but still travelled to campaign. In 1995 he sailed with three others back into the Mururoa test zone and went into hiding on the atoll to frustrate the underground tests. When discovered, he spent three weeks as part of a protest peace flotilla outside the exclusion zone, long after Greenpeace's two big ships, the Rainbow Warrior and the Greenpeace, had been boarded and captured by French marines. His reward, bobbing about in the Pacific once more, was to see the French finally abandon all testing in the Pacific - a victory that took 22 years to achieve.</p> <p>David McTaggart, environment campaigner, born June 23 1932; died March 23 2001</p>",

Three years later he was still travelling rather aimlessly when he answered an advertisement asking for volunteers to sail to Mururoa to protest at the French government still doing atmospheric nuclear tests, when the rest of the world had already agreed to go underground. The advertisement was placed by Greenpeace, a fledgling organisation that, using Quaker techniques, had originally protested against US tests in the Canadian Pacific but had no volunteers in the southern hemisphere. The next bit of the story, told in McTaggart's long out of print book Greenpeace III, Journey into the Bomb, reads like a Boys Own adventure. By his own account he was more annoyed by the French government's unilateral decision to close part of the Pacific to all shipping than about the issue of nuclear testing, but his encounters with the French changed all that.

Its latest project was a Caribbean-wide convention to protect the marine environment. McTaggart lived at Paciano in Italy, where he grew olives, but still travelled to campaign. In 1995 he sailed with three others back into the Mururoa test zone and went into hiding on the atoll to frustrate the underground tests. When discovered, he spent three weeks as part of a protest peace flotilla outside the exclusion zone, long after Greenpeace's two big ships, the Rainbow Warrior and the Greenpeace, had been boarded and captured by French marines. His reward, bobbing about in the Pacific once more, was to see the French finally abandon all testing in the Pacific - a victory that took 22 years to achieve. David McTaggart, environment campaigner, born June 23 1932; died March 23 2001",

      "bodyText": "Britons 'given jail beating' Two Britons accused of drug crimes in the United Arab Emirates told a court yesterday they had been beaten in custody. But a police chief told the court that Danielle Mallouf, 28, from London, and Stacey Simpson, 25, from Leeds, had made statements willingly. \u00a32,000 fine for sweetening river Sweet maker Trebor Bassett has been fined \u00a32,000 by magistrates for pumping cooling water contaminated with sugar back into the River Medway at Maidstone, Kent. Its factory, Kreemy Works, broke an undertaking with the environment agency over using the water as a result of a technical failure. Trainspotter's delight The National Railway Museum in York is to get its first foreign exhibit - the driving coach from a Japanese electric Shinkansen or \"bullet train\" that goes at up to 187mph and launched a new era in rail travel in 1964, when British Rail still had steam engines. Sleep warning to obese drivers Medical researchers today warn lorry drivers who are overweight to seek help if they think they might have sleep apnoea - heavy snoring at night and excessive sleepiness or fatigue during the day. An RAC survey found 34% of drivers doing 20,000 miles a year or more confessed to having fallen asleep at the wheel. Bedroom chums for Michael Singer Michael Jackson has 17 lifesized dolls, dressed to look like real adults and children, in his bedroom for \"company\". The claim is made by his interior decorator, Charmian Carr, in an ITV documentary tomorrow on the children in The Sound of Music. Carr, who was Liesl Von Trapp, said she became friendly with Jackson because he was a fan of the film. Four share \u00a320m jackpot Four tickets shared Saturday's \u00a320m lottery jackpot, with winning numbers 6, 25, 31, 32, 42 and 43; bonus ball 38. There were no lottery extra winners; numbers were 11, 24, 35, 38, 41 and 43.",

      "bodyText": "Alison Halford, formerly Britain's highest ranking woman police officer, is to be prosecuted for allegedly attacking a taxi driver outside her home, police said yesterday. North Wales police launched an investigation into the alleged assault in January after a formal complaint was made against the former Merseyside assistant chief constable, who is now the Labour Welsh assembly member for Delyn. A police spokesman said yesterday: \"We can confirm that a woman has been reported for summons in connection with an alleged common assault and public disorder. \"She will be appearing at a magistrates court at a later date.\" Ms Halford, 60, who was the first woman in the country to rise to the rank of assistant chief constable, was accused of assaulting Mold taxi driver Martin Blake during a disagreement about her dog outside her home in Ewloe, north Wales. She had heard that the crown prosecution service had decided there was a case for her to answer at the end of last week, a Wales Labour party spokesman confirmed. He said the party would not comment on the case but added that Ms Halford had always \"denied the allegations very vigorously\". The Welsh assembly had noted the fact that proceed ings are taking place, a spokeswoman said, adding: \"It would not be appropriate to comment at this time until we know the outcome of the court case.\" Ms Halford, who spent 30 years as a police officer, famously fought and won a sex discrimination case against Merseyside police in 1992. In 1997 she won a phone-tapping case against the home secretary and the government in the European court of human rights. She hit the headlines again in December 1999 after causing uproar in the Welsh assembly chamber when, during a debate, she told the Tory chief whip, David Davies, he had \"one of the nicest bottoms I have seen\".",

The choice between directly elected mayors and the style of cabinet government we have in Westminster is a bleak one; neither option is likely to strengthen democracy. The scarcity of first-rate councillors and professional officers flows from the transfer of responsibility elsewhere. For councillors, a further impediment is the burden of too much committee work. We need national politicians with time to deal properly with national issues, and a lively local democracy with real powers, run by councillors in close touch with their electors. Roger Crudge Bristol \u0095 Roy Hattersley's insightful reports on the changing state of local government accept councils as instruments of central government. Yet much of our decline could be blamed on over-centralisation, with too much Treasury control. The sagas of the dome and infrastructure projects such as the London Underground, epitomise how we have failed to invest in upgrading our infrastructure, while still going for grand projects. The challenge should be to devise financial instruments, such as bonds, that encourage local authorities to make better long-term decisions. It is only when they can exercise real authority that they will be able to attract better people. Nicholas Falk London n.falk@urbed.co.uk \u0095 It is a depressing symptom of political decline that you can illustrate an article by Roy Hattersley with a photo of a memorial to Thomas Attwood, who died in 1856 and is best known for his theory of expanding the money supply to deal with unemployment, a century before Keynes and light years beyond Hattersley in radical thinking, for which Birmingham was once synonymous. DBC Reed Northampton dbcreed@talk21.com \u0095 Roy Hattersley fails to notice the impact on councillors of Labour's local government reforms. Councillors who are not cabinet members are politically excluded. Scrutiny (ie select) committees have no power, no resources and no support. A mayoral system replaces teamwork, at which local government is quite good, with personality politics. I've just realised - it's the Westminster system applied to the town halls.

It was not an easy visit and it certainly had a profound impact on all of us but it did demonstrate that progress will only be made if we can work alongside the Chinese government. It is only 40 years ago that we too had rows of babies in our childcare institutions. </p> <p>In Shanghai, Care for Children has moved more than 260 children into foster families, where they really do appear to be thriving.</p> <p>British and Chinese society may be different in many ways, but the pressures on families and the need to raise money to help children who are waiting for a permanent home are major challenges for both countries and ones that are vital for the welfare all our children. </p> <p>Last weekend a small group of British social workers, lawyers, adopters and foster carers flew out to Beijing to join Rob Glover and his colleagues from Care for Children on a trek across the Great Wall. Adventure challenges are an increasingly common fundraising initiative and ours is a very small beginning - just 20 trekkers. </p> <p>But it signals something special - a transcontinental commitment to improving the lives of children. </p> <p>If you would like to sponsor any of the trekkers as they walk the Great Wall this week in aid of BAAF and Care for Children or would like information on the China Trek 2002, please contact Angela on 020 7593 2000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1998 I was invited to visit Shanghai with a colleague so that BAAF could lead a conference for foster carers and orphanage officials. The invitation came from Robert Glover, who had long been a member of BAAF, having worked as a social worker in Norfolk and Guernsey. It allowed us to visit the charity he had set up, Care for Children, which works with the Shanghai provincial government to place children from institutions in foster families in the community. The visit to Shanghai gave me an insight into a different world - where commercial enterprise and western influence had transformed a heavily populated country teeming with cyclists and pedestrians and where the collision of the old and the new had created a warmth and vibrancy which was genuinely infectious. But as we were escorted around the historic city, we also caught glimpses of the inevitable poverty of the hugely populated urban areas. We talked about children and family life to everyone we met, while remembering that we were in a country where the \"one child, one family policy\" had both transformed the economy and caused international outrage. My most distinctive memory was a taxi driver who told us how immoral it was to have more than one child - immoral because the end result could have been starvation and death for millions of people. It is easy for us to criticise, but who knows what the UK would have done if faced with the consequences of a population explosion of similar proportions? We visited the Shanghai Welfare Institution, where we were welcomed courteously but - following documentary The Dying Rooms which exposed appalling conditions in some of China's orphanages - with caution. Our passport was Rob Glover, who had gained enormous respect from government officials and was greeted with shrieks of glee from the children who clung to his side hoping for a game of football. Small children, many disabled, sat in rows at their computers (donated by commerce) and in some of the classrooms toddlers chanted rhymes. The most moving sights were the baby wards, with rows of cots and swaddled infants lying quietly in lines. It was not an easy visit and it certainly had a profound impact on all of us but it did demonstrate that progress will only be made if we can work alongside the Chinese government. It is only 40 years ago that we too had rows of babies in our childcare institutions. In Shanghai, Care for Children has moved more than 260 children into foster families, where they really do appear to be thriving. British and Chinese society may be different in many ways, but the pressures on families and the need to raise money to help children who are waiting for a permanent home are major challenges for both countries and ones that are vital for the welfare all our children. Last weekend a small group of British social workers, lawyers, adopters and foster carers flew out to Beijing to join Rob Glover and his colleagues from Care for Children on a trek across the Great Wall. Adventure challenges are an increasingly common fundraising initiative and ours is a very small beginning - just 20 trekkers. But it signals something special - a transcontinental commitment to improving the lives of children. If you would like to sponsor any of the trekkers as they walk the Great Wall this week in aid of BAAF and Care for Children or would like information on the China Trek 2002, please contact Angela on 020 7593 2000.",

But the research sends out a clear signal that bodies such as the education inspectorate, Ofsted often fail to translate this potential into concrete improvements, with just 45% of the councils surveyed saying that inspections had led to better services.

The survey's results will be particularly worrying for the year-old best value inspection service (BVIS) that councils rated the body least likely to improve services.

      "body": "<p>Five or six minutes into the match at Anfield on Saturday, Steven Gerrard thundered into a challenge with Jari Litmanen. The Finn must be harder than he looks. For once the strapping young English midfield player got up second and only after prolonged treatment. As he was led along the touchline and prodded back into the fray by his attendant physio, Gerrard puffed out his cheeks and grimaced. His home crowd held its breath, anxious to see what damage had been done to their cherished prodigy. </p> <p>Already, in the first two minutes of the match, Gerrard had produced two moments of majestic invention. Receiving from Paul Scholes in the opening seconds, he transferred the ball with a geometrically exquisite first-time pass to Steve McManaman. On it went to Michael Owen and then to Andy Cole, whose attempted return came back off a defender and gave him the opportunity for an instant drive which veered narrowly wide. Gerrard's second prominent contribution, a minute or so later, consisted of a lethal long ball down the right wing to David Beckham, whose instant whipped cross was punched away by Antti Niemi. </p> <p>After he returned to the pitch, Gerrard's performance was much reduced both in quality and in quantity for the remainder of the half. Apart from a couple of curiously misplaced passes, there was a definite slide into anonymity. Both he and Paul Scholes were lying too deep, sitting just in front of the back four and allowing the tireless Litmanen to dictate the zones in which the game was to be played. </p> <p>Fortunately for everyone, Gerrard appeared as much refreshed as anyone by Owen's equalising goal. He reappeared for the second half in much better fettle, the range and force of his play apparently restored. He played an important part in the winning goal, made a crucial interception when Jarkko Wiss threatened the England penalty area after 75 minutes, and later drew a yellow-card foul from Petri Pasanen. </p> <p>Afterwards Sven-Goran Eriksson was non-committal on the question of the nature of the medical attention Gerrard had received during the interval. Had he received an injection? \"Not as far as I know,\" the coach said. \"You would have to ask the doctor. I saw him on the massage bench and doing exercises. He had hurt himself, but he didn't say anything to me at half-time.\" Gerrard himself unconvincingly ascribed his recovery to a slug of Lucozade, and his withdrawal yesterday from the squad travelling to Albania came as no surprise. </p> <p>It is, Eriksson quietly observed, \"a difficult situation for him and for us and for Liverpool\". When an individual player is so evidently important to a team's fortunes, serious decisions have to be made. Diego Maradona, Trevor Francis and Ronaldo are just three virtuosi who were patched up and sent out time and again without proper consideration of their long-term welfare. </p> <p>What makes Gerrard different is that his game is based on power and energy. He is not a highly strung greyhound subject to constant tweaks and twinges. The long-striding muscularity and instant decisiveness are enough to tempt comparisons with Duncan Edwards, although the remoteness of Edwards's era and the subsequent evolution of the game render such a thought no more than the expression of a romantic yearning for a truly dominant player in the centre of England's midfield. </p> <p>This is not irrelevant, since what Eriksson's team lacked on Saturday, particularly while Litmanen was in charge of the game's shape, was what the Americans call the \"go-to guy\", the player whose permanent availability, all-round competence and instinctive understanding of the geography of the game make him the nodal point of the side. </p> <p>Scholes is too much of an old-fashioned inside forward to become such a figure. McManaman, too, has other virtues. A fully mature Joe Cole could be the answer. So could Beckham, if he moves inside on a permanent basis, as he showed by the manner in which he dispossessed Wiss to start the move that produced Owen's equaliser - a wonderful amalgam of sheer grit and balletic delicacy, topped off by a perfectly weighted pass wide to Gary Neville. Gerrard, however, is the best bet for this vital role, once his body has adapted to the extra inches and pounds he has added in the last year. </p> <p>In a way his contribution to the side is reminiscent of that made by Iain Balshaw to Clive Woodward's England rugby XV this season. Woodward already had a talented and reliable full-back in Matt Perry, but was prepared to stand him down in favour of a riskier and more expressive player whose presence added an extra dimension to the team, as Balshaw's explosive running has done. Nicky Butt performed extremely well in Gerrard's position against Spain a month ago and will no doubt be required to do so again in Tirana on Wednesday, but Eriksson is clearly aware that the insertion of Gerrard changes the complexion of the whole side and allows the possibility of an ascent to another level. </p> <p>The fluent interplay currently characterising Woodward's team came to mind again on Saturday during the construction of England's win ning goal. As Gerrard's quick ball set McManaman running at the Finland defence, drawing opponents towards him while two team-mates hared into position outside, readying themselves for the pass which Scholes flicked on to Beckham, the lines of running and timing of delivery were as clinical as anything seen in recent times from the likes of Wilkinson, Catt and Greenwood. </p> <p>Here was an example of the midfield getting ahead of their own forwards in the construction of a successful attack - and not just one or two of them, but all four.

      "bodyText": "Five or six minutes into the match at Anfield on Saturday, Steven Gerrard thundered into a challenge with Jari Litmanen. The Finn must be harder than he looks. For once the strapping young English midfield player got up second and only after prolonged treatment. As he was led along the touchline and prodded back into the fray by his attendant physio, Gerrard puffed out his cheeks and grimaced. His home crowd held its breath, anxious to see what damage had been done to their cherished prodigy. Already, in the first two minutes of the match, Gerrard had produced two moments of majestic invention. Receiving from Paul Scholes in the opening seconds, he transferred the ball with a geometrically exquisite first-time pass to Steve McManaman. On it went to Michael Owen and then to Andy Cole, whose attempted return came back off a defender and gave him the opportunity for an instant drive which veered narrowly wide. Gerrard's second prominent contribution, a minute or so later, consisted of a lethal long ball down the right wing to David Beckham, whose instant whipped cross was punched away by Antti Niemi. After he returned to the pitch, Gerrard's performance was much reduced both in quality and in quantity for the remainder of the half. Apart from a couple of curiously misplaced passes, there was a definite slide into anonymity. Both he and Paul Scholes were lying too deep, sitting just in front of the back four and allowing the tireless Litmanen to dictate the zones in which the game was to be played. Fortunately for everyone, Gerrard appeared as much refreshed as anyone by Owen's equalising goal. He reappeared for the second half in much better fettle, the range and force of his play apparently restored. He played an important part in the winning goal, made a crucial interception when Jarkko Wiss threatened the England penalty area after 75 minutes, and later drew a yellow-card foul from Petri Pasanen. Afterwards Sven-Goran Eriksson was non-committal on the question of the nature of the medical attention Gerrard had received during the interval. Had he received an injection? \"Not as far as I know,\" the coach said. \"You would have to ask the doctor. I saw him on the massage bench and doing exercises. He had hurt himself, but he didn't say anything to me at half-time.\" Gerrard himself unconvincingly ascribed his recovery to a slug of Lucozade, and his withdrawal yesterday from the squad travelling to Albania came as no surprise. It is, Eriksson quietly observed, \"a difficult situation for him and for us and for Liverpool\". When an individual player is so evidently important to a team's fortunes, serious decisions have to be made. Diego Maradona, Trevor Francis and Ronaldo are just three virtuosi who were patched up and sent out time and again without proper consideration of their long-term welfare. What makes Gerrard different is that his game is based on power and energy. He is not a highly strung greyhound subject to constant tweaks and twinges. The long-striding muscularity and instant decisiveness are enough to tempt comparisons with Duncan Edwards, although the remoteness of Edwards's era and the subsequent evolution of the game render such a thought no more than the expression of a romantic yearning for a truly dominant player in the centre of England's midfield. This is not irrelevant, since what Eriksson's team lacked on Saturday, particularly while Litmanen was in charge of the game's shape, was what the Americans call the \"go-to guy\", the player whose permanent availability, all-round competence and instinctive understanding of the geography of the game make him the nodal point of the side. Scholes is too much of an old-fashioned inside forward to become such a figure. McManaman, too, has other virtues. A fully mature Joe Cole could be the answer. So could Beckham, if he moves inside on a permanent basis, as he showed by the manner in which he dispossessed Wiss to start the move that produced Owen's equaliser - a wonderful amalgam of sheer grit and balletic delicacy, topped off by a perfectly weighted pass wide to Gary Neville. Gerrard, however, is the best bet for this vital role, once his body has adapted to the extra inches and pounds he has added in the last year. In a way his contribution to the side is reminiscent of that made by Iain Balshaw to Clive Woodward's England rugby XV this season. Woodward already had a talented and reliable full-back in Matt Perry, but was prepared to stand him down in favour of a riskier and more expressive player whose presence added an extra dimension to the team, as Balshaw's explosive running has done. Nicky Butt performed extremely well in Gerrard's position against Spain a month ago and will no doubt be required to do so again in Tirana on Wednesday, but Eriksson is clearly aware that the insertion of Gerrard changes the complexion of the whole side and allows the possibility of an ascent to another level. The fluent interplay currently characterising Woodward's team came to mind again on Saturday during the construction of England's win ning goal. As Gerrard's quick ball set McManaman running at the Finland defence, drawing opponents towards him while two team-mates hared into position outside, readying themselves for the pass which Scholes flicked on to Beckham, the lines of running and timing of delivery were as clinical as anything seen in recent times from the likes of Wilkinson, Catt and Greenwood. Here was an example of the midfield getting ahead of their own forwards in the construction of a successful attack - and not just one or two of them, but all four. Like their equaliser, in which Andy Cole redeemed a poor first touch with an unselfish ball to Owen, and the intricate work of Beckham and Scholes which led to Cole's spurned chance after 68 minutes, these were signs of a team growing in stature. From time to time in recent years England have shown similar flashes of accomplishment, notably in the first half against Holland at Wembley in 1993, against the same opponents on the same ground three years later, and, for an hour, against Portugal last summer. For Graham Taylor, Terry Venables and Kevin Keegan, these moments were little more than a series of mirages. Why should Eriksson's experience be any different? It could be said that even in their most unsatisfactory moments on Saturday, when they were penned in their own half and the lines of communication between midfield and attack had been ruptured, at least they kept their basic shape, so that Eriksson needed only to make a few adjustments at half-time to help them move the balance of the play into their opponents' territory. That was genuinely encouraging. And if leaving Gerrard at home this week primarily represents a gesture of good faith towards G\u00e9rard Houllier, then it may also turn out to be an investment in a better future.",

      "bodyText": "Most fans must have thought they were more likely to see Tord Grip doing a streak than they were to hear chants of \"One David Beckham\" rolling down from the Kop. But the sound of Anfield singing the England captain's praises was a mark of just how impressive the match winner was. In the event there was no need for Victoria and Brooklyn to have stayed away, a decision the Beckham family reached out of fear that his performance would be affected by worry over the reception which might await his wife and son. The Manchester United player may find Liverpool's crowd less accommodating when he returns with his club on Saturday, but for those who feel that he is loathed and hopelessly out of form this was an afternoon which changed a few minds.
