Attempts to prove its effectiveness have been unsuccessful. </p> <p>Yesterday's results showed that taking SRL172 failed to prolong survival rates in a trial involving 418 patients undergoing chemotherapy. The company's market value fell to \u00a317.3m, only a little above its cash reserves of \u00a311m. </p> <p>Mr Long said SR Pharma hoped that a new version, SRP299, would work on asthma and dermatitis patients. \"We've been very encouraged by its progress so far.

      "bodyText": "Biotechnology company SR Pharma saw its shares collapse for the second time in four years yesterday, after admitting that a microbacterium found by two doctors in Ugandan soil had no effect on terminally ill lung cancer patients. The \"unexpected and very disappointing\" outcome from the final stage of clinical trials followed the failure of the same substance in trials on tuberculosis sufferers in 1997. SR Pharma's shares, which once traded at 600p, fell by 241p to 72.5p. Business development di rector Thomas Long said: \"We're very, very disappointed. This was going to be the route by which we were going to get on to the commercial market.\" SR Pharma was founded nine years ago by John Stanford and Graham Rook, two doctors from University College, London. While working in Uganda, they noticed that exposure to certain microbes appeared to increase resistance to infection. The company has developed a refined version of these microbes, called SRL172. Attempts to prove its effectiveness have been unsuccessful. Yesterday's results showed that taking SRL172 failed to prolong survival rates in a trial involving 418 patients undergoing chemotherapy. The company's market value fell to \u00a317.3m, only a little above its cash reserves of \u00a311m. Mr Long said SR Pharma hoped that a new version, SRP299, would work on asthma and dermatitis patients. \"We've been very encouraged by its progress so far. We know the drug has an effect on the body's natural immune system.\" Analyst Lionel Wilson of Nomura said: \"This again highlights the risk and reward profile of biopharmaceuticals.\"",

In seven episodic playlets we watch the aristocratic Anatol, who describes himself as \"a frivolous melancholic\", seeking a fidelity in women that he himself disowns. </p> <p>In one scene he puts his 21-year-old partner under hypnosis only to funk the fatal question about her loyalty. Later he dubs his married mistress a coquette when she refuses to abscond with him. And, wining and dining a balletic lover, he is appalled when she pre-emptively reveals that it is she who has been two-timing him - that, in Anatol's world, is the male prerogative. </p> <p>Schnitzler, a doctor and neurologist by profession, brilliantly pins down the Don Juan's dilemma: that he craves sex, fears commitment and, in order to avoid rejection, has to be the first to terminate a relationship. At a time when British drama was still shrouded in sexual reticence, Schnitzler writes with clinical accuracy about lust's melancholy and the instability of the male ego. </p> <p>But he also captures the precise atmosphere of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna, where the sweet suburban girl was regarded as easy prey by urban lechers and where social masks concealed a weary dissipation. He perfectly conveys the genius loci, which is why I always thought it a mistake for David Hare to update Reigen as The Blue Room. </p> <p>Jepson's production and Michael Robinson's translation, first performed at London's Gate Theatre, here anchor Anatol's action squarely in 1890s Vienna; and Christopher Oram's designs, with their high neo-classical windows and decorative imperial eagles, convey exactly the right air of arid opulence. But the actors are forced to over-project an essentially intimate play. Duncan Duff's Anatol has a barking tetchiness rather than the veiled anxiety that is Anatol's natural mode.

But the most rounded performance, in every sense, comes from Mike Hayley who, as the sceptical friend indispensable to all heartless seducers, suggests a particularly sleek porpoise.

      "body": "<p>The last thing a normal business riddled with wildcat stoppages and presiding over a deteriorating service would do is to raise prices - especially when, after 350 years of monopoly, it faces genuine competition for the first time. </p> <p>Yet that is exactly what the Post Office, rebranded to hoots of derision as Consignia, has done, provoking the wrath of the new consumer watchdog, PostWatch, and the scarcely veiled anger of the new industry regulator, PostComm. </p> <p>But the PO is no ordinary business. For one thing, it has a (now legal) universal service obligation to deliver mail to Britain's 27m addresses at a single price. For another, it is the country's second-biggest employer (the NHS comes first), with more than 200,000 staff. </p> <p>Unlike other public services or utilities such as electricity, gas, telecoms and water, the PO has experienced the advent of competition unaccompanied by privatisation. Consignia plc may have won greater commercial freedom from government but the state remains its single shareholder and the Treasury still exercises tight control over its balance sheet and borrowings. </p> <p><strong> Late trains</strong> </p> <p>\"We are changing this business at a speed we have never achieved historically,\" John Roberts, chief executive, says. \"We're not just changing the machines but the working patterns of 160,000 postmen and women and doing that without the cathartic shock of privatisation.\" </p> <p>But the shock of the new culture is barely evident. The quality of service is declining: 89% of first-class letters (40% of the 28m delivered daily) arrive the day after posting, compared with an agreed target of 92%. An embarrassed Mr Roberts, who says 1% of this is due to late trains after the Hatfield crash and an equal amount is down to disputes, has accepted new targets imposed by PostWatch of 92.1% this year and 92.5% next. </p> <p>The PO's industrial relations record is appalling (see below). John Keggie, deputy leader of the Communication Workers Union, wants a change of culture, too, and is working with PostComm's chief executive, Martin Stanley, senior Consignia managers and union activists to achieve it. </p> <p>\"We've got to change and are prepared to change,\" he says. \"But there are sinister forces on the [Consignia] board that are putting out the message that the CWU has lost control and that favour privatisation. That's why we need an independent review of industrial relations.\" </p> <p>This cuts no ice with Peter Carr, PostWatch chairman and former managing director of Debenhams. Denouncing the proposed price rises, he says: \"It makes you wonder if this is a viable business any more. If your product is under attack from alternatives such as e-mail and not growing at the rate you want, the last thing you do is put the price up. Normally, you do the opposite. </p> <p>\"They've got to attack their cost base - staffing levels, the lot.\" He thinks the PO should in the meantime scrap the second delivery, streamline management and, like the privatised utilities, raise morale by increasing pay while sacking some staff and retraining others. </p> <p>Sitting in his fifth-floor suite at Consignia HQ on the edge of the City, Mr Roberts admits the scale of the problems but insists he and his board can overcome them: through growth, greater investment and improved efficiency. </p> <p>Growth is coming through international expansion (in parcels) and domestic deliveries (up 10% in two years). But, from March 26, the PO has lost its monopoly over items costing \u00a31 or more and the European Union plus PostComm will eventually cut that further, from 350 grams to 50 or even 20.

      "bodyText": "The last thing a normal business riddled with wildcat stoppages and presiding over a deteriorating service would do is to raise prices - especially when, after 350 years of monopoly, it faces genuine competition for the first time. Yet that is exactly what the Post Office, rebranded to hoots of derision as Consignia, has done, provoking the wrath of the new consumer watchdog, PostWatch, and the scarcely veiled anger of the new industry regulator, PostComm. But the PO is no ordinary business. For one thing, it has a (now legal) universal service obligation to deliver mail to Britain's 27m addresses at a single price. For another, it is the country's second-biggest employer (the NHS comes first), with more than 200,000 staff. Unlike other public services or utilities such as electricity, gas, telecoms and water, the PO has experienced the advent of competition unaccompanied by privatisation. Consignia plc may have won greater commercial freedom from government but the state remains its single shareholder and the Treasury still exercises tight control over its balance sheet and borrowings. Late trains \"We are changing this business at a speed we have never achieved historically,\" John Roberts, chief executive, says. \"We're not just changing the machines but the working patterns of 160,000 postmen and women and doing that without the cathartic shock of privatisation.\" But the shock of the new culture is barely evident. The quality of service is declining: 89% of first-class letters (40% of the 28m delivered daily) arrive the day after posting, compared with an agreed target of 92%. An embarrassed Mr Roberts, who says 1% of this is due to late trains after the Hatfield crash and an equal amount is down to disputes, has accepted new targets imposed by PostWatch of 92.1% this year and 92.5% next. The PO's industrial relations record is appalling (see below). John Keggie, deputy leader of the Communication Workers Union, wants a change of culture, too, and is working with PostComm's chief executive, Martin Stanley, senior Consignia managers and union activists to achieve it. \"We've got to change and are prepared to change,\" he says. \"But there are sinister forces on the [Consignia] board that are putting out the message that the CWU has lost control and that favour privatisation. That's why we need an independent review of industrial relations.\" This cuts no ice with Peter Carr, PostWatch chairman and former managing director of Debenhams. Denouncing the proposed price rises, he says: \"It makes you wonder if this is a viable business any more. If your product is under attack from alternatives such as e-mail and not growing at the rate you want, the last thing you do is put the price up. Normally, you do the opposite. \"They've got to attack their cost base - staffing levels, the lot.\" He thinks the PO should in the meantime scrap the second delivery, streamline management and, like the privatised utilities, raise morale by increasing pay while sacking some staff and retraining others. Sitting in his fifth-floor suite at Consignia HQ on the edge of the City, Mr Roberts admits the scale of the problems but insists he and his board can overcome them: through growth, greater investment and improved efficiency. Growth is coming through international expansion (in parcels) and domestic deliveries (up 10% in two years). But, from March 26, the PO has lost its monopoly over items costing \u00a31 or more and the European Union plus PostComm will eventually cut that further, from 350 grams to 50 or even 20. The regulator, says Mr Roberts, might also encourage geographical competition, opening up the service to rival operators. PostComm does not expect real competitors to emerge for, say, two years while it gets to grip with the PO's finances and draws up a pricing formula - on the RPI minus X model - to manage them. That gives the PO a grace period to get its house in order. Mr Roberts says price rises are essential to rectify chronic under-investment: an \u00a3800m funding gap, he estimates. Capital spending (on new automated sorting offices and the like) will be \u00a3400m this year and \u00a3360m next but has been \u00a3100m short each year for eight years. The PO, which lost a net \u00a3264m last year, largely through a failed computer system for paying benefits, says it has contributed \u00a31.72bn to Treasury coffers in recent years - money in government stocks on which it can draw down interest at ministers' say-so. 'Switch customers off' Mr Roberts wants government approval to re-engineer the balance sheet to take on some \u00a32bn in debt and then borrow in the market-place at commercial or preferential rates rather than go cap in hand to the Treasury. Through productivity growth of 3% annually, he expects earnings before interest and tax to rise to \u00a3300m a year over the next three years, and to help fund the investment programme. That means cutting working days lost - under 0.1% of the PO's 50m working days a year - to \"zilch\". \"If people get the choice of competition and we are not reliable enough or good enough they will vote with their feet,\" he admits. \"Unjustifiable strikes will quickly switch customers off and lead to a loss of business and jobs.\" That is the prospect motivating board, union and even the regulator to try to act in harmony.

      "bodyText": "Omara Portuondo is popularly described as Cuba's own Edith Piaf. She has enjoyed a 50-year career, becoming internationally famous in 1997 thanks to her participation in the Grammy-winning Buena Vista Social Club album. Her latest tour finds her in a congenial mood, leading a razor-sharp 14-piece band in a romping recital of music from last year's acclaimed solo long-player. Showmanship and physical spectacle were kept to a minimum, with the back-line brass players dressed in plain black outfits and Portuondo herself shuffling almost wearily about the stage, rubbing her eyes as if she had just got out of bed. Tres player Gilberto Oviedo was the only person who seemed remotely interested in showmanship. He danced affectionately with the leading lady and played his guitar on the back of his head, all the while looking like a tall light bulb in his shiny white suit.

And this vicious piece of hard-boiled, working-class Dublin noir by Mark O'Rowe elevates his own Mametesque brand of hard-core Dub baroque to a high martial art form. O'Rowe's relish in the violent, genito-urinary passages of this piece packs enough masculine punch to open many large exit wounds through the backs of the audience's heads. </p> <p>Significantly, this is a terse three-handed drama, not a series of monologues. It's set in the spare, deluxe loft apartment of a sharply dressed hard-man, Hughie. He has become dangerously introverted while continuing to execute baseball-bat mutilations on behalf of his offstage boss, Puppacat. Hughie's gauche, skinhead sidekick Paddy gormlessly endures Hughie's sharp, philosophically avuncular put-downs. Their close relationship is murderously imperilled by Hughie's deputy-in-crime, Kilby, a wire-thin, combat-skilled psycho. </p> <p>Hughie's mother has been mown down in a car crash but Hughie baulks at Puppacat's gift of a grisly, teeth-extracting torture of the other driver. By not participating he is disobeying orders, so he is expelled from the gang and threatened with the less-than-divine judgment of the manically destructive Kilby. </p> <p>The young Paddy (played with delicate hilarity by Luke Griffin) is the unlikely fulcrum of the piece, wavering between his see-sawing loyalties to Hughie (Anthony Brophy, athletically luxuriating in the wounded-animal part) and the refined homicidal tastes of Kilby. As the latter, Andrew Connolly inflates into a depraved performance, oscillating between Cuchulainn's \"rage-horn\" and Rutger Hauer's bleach-headed killing machine in Blade Runner. </p> <p>Director Gerry Stembridge concentrates the ideas and oceanic humour into an equation of menace and physical fraternity between violent men. At times the pace scrunches the language into total incoherence - a compacted idiolect of self-consciously florid vernacular that undermines the more outlandish plot-twists and, rather distractingly, plays for low laughs. But this is pure, exhilaratingly irresponsible theatre, with its grimly realistic message that violence ultimately triumphs. </p> <p>\u0095 Until May 12. Box office: 00 353 1 878 7222.</p>",

Significantly, this is a terse three-handed drama, not a series of monologues. It's set in the spare, deluxe loft apartment of a sharply dressed hard-man, Hughie. He has become dangerously introverted while continuing to execute baseball-bat mutilations on behalf of his offstage boss, Puppacat. Hughie's gauche, skinhead sidekick Paddy gormlessly endures Hughie's sharp, philosophically avuncular put-downs. Their close relationship is murderously imperilled by Hughie's deputy-in-crime, Kilby, a wire-thin, combat-skilled psycho. Hughie's mother has been mown down in a car crash but Hughie baulks at Puppacat's gift of a grisly, teeth-extracting torture of the other driver. By not participating he is disobeying orders, so he is expelled from the gang and threatened with the less-than-divine judgment of the manically destructive Kilby. The young Paddy (played with delicate hilarity by Luke Griffin) is the unlikely fulcrum of the piece, wavering between his see-sawing loyalties to Hughie (Anthony Brophy, athletically luxuriating in the wounded-animal part) and the refined homicidal tastes of Kilby. As the latter, Andrew Connolly inflates into a depraved performance, oscillating between Cuchulainn's \"rage-horn\" and Rutger Hauer's bleach-headed killing machine in Blade Runner. Director Gerry Stembridge concentrates the ideas and oceanic humour into an equation of menace and physical fraternity between violent men. At times the pace scrunches the language into total incoherence - a compacted idiolect of self-consciously florid vernacular that undermines the more outlandish plot-twists and, rather distractingly, plays for low laughs. But this is pure, exhilaratingly irresponsible theatre, with its grimly realistic message that violence ultimately triumphs. \u0095 Until May 12. Box office: 00 353 1 878 7222.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Harry Secombe, comedy genius of radio's The Goon Show, died today at the age of 79.</p> <p>The comic, who also presented ITV's religious music show Highway, had a run of ill health over the past few years. His daughter, Jenny Secombe, said he died at 3pm and said the family were shattered.</p> <p>Sir Harry was a natural clown and one of Britain's best-loved entertainers.</p> <p>He had a genius for slapstick and buffoonery and was a founder of one of Britain's most revered comedy shows, The Goon Show.</p> <p>Whether he was Neddy Seagoon, Sir Cumference or just plain Harry Secombe, his falsetto giggles spilling through to an inevitable raspberry were unmistakable.</p> <p>But he was also a singer with a classical tenor voice that sometimes moved people to tears, an actor, a writer and a tireless charity worker.</p> <p>Sir Harry was held in great affection by his peers as well as fans, who included royalty and prime ministers such as Lord Harold Wilson and John Major.</p> <p>In later years, however, he became best known for his Sunday night programme Highway, a \"God-slot\" show he began for Tyne Tees television in 1983.</p> <p>It was a series he had great affection for, meeting people doing worthy things for the community, from nurses to politicians.</p> <p>One of Wales' favourite sons, Harry was born in a Swansea council house on September 8, 1921. Life was spartan but happy and he never saw his parents fight.</p> <p>He had great respect for his father who would tell him: \"Always judge a man by the way he treats someone who is of no use to him.\"</p> <p>Harry was to follow that advice for the rest of his life. The son of a travelling salesman, who was the middle one of three children, grew up in the tough docks area of the city, showing great literary promise as a youth and harbouring ambitions to be a writer.</p> <p>He was a small, puny lad who acted the fool at school to stop himself being bullied. By impersonating the teachers he ingratiated himself with the other, bigger boys.</p> <p>In 1939 Harry volunteered for the Swansea Territorials and saw action in North Africa, Sicily and Italy as a lance bombardier.</p> <p>His clowning around continued throughout his Army days when he would imitate the sergeants. Then one morning his platoon was dug in with 7.2 howitzers as the Africa campaign reached its height. Suddenly a gun came spinning by after it was fired, missing him by a few feet.</p> <p>A face appeared over the parapet. It was Spike Milligan who said: \"Has anyone seen a gun?\" \"What colour?\" Harry replied. It was the first time they met.

      "bodyText": "Sir Harry Secombe, comedy genius of radio's The Goon Show, died today at the age of 79. The comic, who also presented ITV's religious music show Highway, had a run of ill health over the past few years. His daughter, Jenny Secombe, said he died at 3pm and said the family were shattered. Sir Harry was a natural clown and one of Britain's best-loved entertainers. He had a genius for slapstick and buffoonery and was a founder of one of Britain's most revered comedy shows, The Goon Show. Whether he was Neddy Seagoon, Sir Cumference or just plain Harry Secombe, his falsetto giggles spilling through to an inevitable raspberry were unmistakable. But he was also a singer with a classical tenor voice that sometimes moved people to tears, an actor, a writer and a tireless charity worker. Sir Harry was held in great affection by his peers as well as fans, who included royalty and prime ministers such as Lord Harold Wilson and John Major. In later years, however, he became best known for his Sunday night programme Highway, a \"God-slot\" show he began for Tyne Tees television in 1983. It was a series he had great affection for, meeting people doing worthy things for the community, from nurses to politicians. One of Wales' favourite sons, Harry was born in a Swansea council house on September 8, 1921. Life was spartan but happy and he never saw his parents fight. He had great respect for his father who would tell him: \"Always judge a man by the way he treats someone who is of no use to him.\" Harry was to follow that advice for the rest of his life. The son of a travelling salesman, who was the middle one of three children, grew up in the tough docks area of the city, showing great literary promise as a youth and harbouring ambitions to be a writer. He was a small, puny lad who acted the fool at school to stop himself being bullied. By impersonating the teachers he ingratiated himself with the other, bigger boys. In 1939 Harry volunteered for the Swansea Territorials and saw action in North Africa, Sicily and Italy as a lance bombardier. His clowning around continued throughout his Army days when he would imitate the sergeants. Then one morning his platoon was dug in with 7.2 howitzers as the Africa campaign reached its height. Suddenly a gun came spinning by after it was fired, missing him by a few feet. A face appeared over the parapet. It was Spike Milligan who said: \"Has anyone seen a gun?\" \"What colour?\" Harry replied. It was the first time they met. Later they got together for a concert party. When Harry was demobbed he decided on a career in showbusiness, becoming a graduate of the famous Windmill Theatre where he worked six comedy spots a day, six days a week, between the nudes. It was there that he met Spike Milligan again and two other struggling comics that were to help shape his life... Peter Sellers and Michael Bentine. Also in 1946, he met his wife to be, Myra Atherton, the only daughter of a south Wales steel worker, at a dance on Mumbles Pier. He was always to be proud of the fact that there were no skeletons in his marital cupboard throughout his life. \"Marriage is a lottery and I picked a winning ticket,\" he would say. \"I've always been loyal and so has she.\" They were to have four children, Andrew, Katy, Jennifer and David. Harry toured variety halls around the country as the second spot on the bill, an experience which he said sometimes engendered a desperate humour. Goon humour had already taken shape and in 1949 BBC Radio ran the first Goon Show series, regarded as a completely new form of broadcasting humour. It quickly took on a cult following and went on to run for 11 years, with Harry at the forefront with the infectious, high-pitched giggles and squeals of the zany Neddie Seagoon. Lines like \"ying tong iddle I po\" were catch phrases in houses throughout Britain and devotees of the Goons, such as Prince Charles, remained loyal even after the programmes stopped running. From then on Charles would always refer to him as Ned of Wales. In the early days of his career Harry's own natural tenor voice was given free rein but in 1951, on the recommendation of a record company executive, he started attending voice training classes under Mario de Veroli. Soon he was coming to the public's attention as a singer. From 1956 to 1966 Harry appeared frequently at the London Palladium and from 1951 he became almost a regular feature of the Royal Command performances. His marriage to Myra kept him level headed, however. \"When he came home full of himself after signing a contract for \u00a31,000 a week at the London Palladium, she said: \"That's nice!\" Then sent him upstairs to see his eldest son Andrew who had measles. \"It put it all in perspective for me,\" Harry admitted later. In 1963 Harry achieved a professional ambition to appear in a musical play when he took the part of the lovable Mr Pickwick in Dickens' Pickwick Papers which ran for two years in the West End and toured the United States with a season on Broadway. That same year he was awarded the CBE for his work on behalf of the Army Benevolent Fund. In 1972, there was a special performance of the Goon Show to mark the 50th anniversary of the BBC. It revived memories for old fans but found a new following and in 1975 several of the shows were repeated and a televised version was also produced. Meanwhile, Harry appeared in a number of films, of which his portrayal of Mr Bumble in Oliver! was the best known. And he did not completely cast out his writing ambitions, contributing regularly to Punch magazine. His first novel, Twice Brightly, was published in 1974 and it was the start of a number of books which included other novels and autobiographical works. Though he had a natural talent for writing, it was his daughter Jennifer Stock who was also his agent who he said really encouraged him to write more. Throughout his career he was heavily involved in charity work for organisations such as the Army Benevolent Fund, the Stars Organisation for Spastics as well helping appeals for spina bifida and hyrocephalus (water on the brain). In 1981 he was further honoured with a knighthood for his services to entertainment and charity. Sir Harry was a programme consultant to Harlech Television, although he was not brought up as a Welsh speaker. Just a year before he started the Highway series he suffered a heart attack and collapsed during a tour of Australia. But far from holding him back it was the start of another important feature of his life. He had been a short 19 stone but after collapsing he slimmed down to 14 stone. His diet not only became an essential part of his life but he also turned it into a best-selling book. Sir Harry and his wife were now spending even more time together in their 104-year-old manor house in Surrey. Then early in 1999, the veteran comic was felled by a stroke which affected the left side of his body and badly impaired his speech.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The oldest, most radical and most neglected model for helping the poor in the cities is making a timely comeback. The Victorian \"settlement\" is proving an ideal partner in community renewal schemes. </p> <p>Launched mostly by Oxbridge colleges and public schools, a fleet of settlements docked in the pools of urban industrial poverty from the 1880s. As prototype community centres, they were equipped with classrooms, clinics, chapels, dining halls, gymnasiums - and, essentially, living quarters for the students who volunteered to work in them. </p> <p>Settlements had a mission to bring about social improvement through interaction between their young educated helpers - the future elite, who often became passionate reformers - and those in need. Over time, the approach fell from fashion, but the social ills they set out to tackle a century ago are still around, though in contemporary guises. </p> <p>Now, for the first time since the 1960s and 70s, when settlements lost direction, saw income shrink and were eclipsed by the trend for vociferous community action, there are plans for expansion. </p> <p>Two universities, Surrey and the London School of Economics, plan new graduate community work courses based on the settlement model. Although the courses would not be residential, Ben Hughes, chief executive of the British Association of Settlements and Community Action Centres (Bassac), says: \"Settlements currently have an important role informing students about the issues in community work\". </p> <p>Local councils, too, are taking a fresh look at partnership possibilities. \"They're interested because settlements do provide direct services, but they are also able to support small, emerging community groups,\" says Hughes. In Newcastle upon Tyne, there is interest in the settlement model as a means of delivering neighbourhood renewal plans; in Tower Hamlets, east London, it is seen as a way of meeting the needs of ethnic minority groups. </p> <p>Reflecting the renewed vigour of settlements - there are about 80 in Britain - Bassac is busy helping several of the century-old institutions to manage change, or secure sources of finance, and is acting as an exchange for ideas on training staff and sharing resources. \"We don't direct; we merely facilitate,\" says Hughes. </p> <p>That is tactful because, historically, settlements are autonomous foundations: how they have gone (and continue to go) about their work is for each one to decide. </p> <p>But there are common problems. Oxford House was set up in Bethnal Green, east London, in 1884 by staff and students from Oxford University, with much goodwill but no financial endowment. \"People say to us: 'You've got a big five-storey building: you must be rich,'\" says director Kim Adams. \"But we have no reserves. We live from year to year.\" </p> <p>Successive tides of immigrants have used Oxford House, which has always had strong arts and education programmes. After a period in the doldrums, it has brought these two strands together: it has become the community base for Somalis, many living locally, and it aims several programmes at them. The settlement has a \u00a31.8m project for a performance space, workshops, studios and conference facilities, to showcase the cultures of local ethnic minority communities. What it does not offer, says Adams, is \"heavy-end social day care\" provision. </p> <p>By contrast, the huge Birmingham Settlement has 23 separate projects, covering the full range of local authority services, and works in partnership with 224 local organisations. It has an annual turnover of \u00a32.9m and is one of the largest voluntary agencies in the city. </p> <p>But its survival and success is achieved despite a fragile financial structure. It was middle-class women in Edgbaston, rather than the university, who set it up at the end of the 19th century. These pioneers contributed time, thought and effort, rather than cash. Susan Spencer, chief executive, says: \"We've no reserves, a \u00a3200,000 overdraft, and 90% of our funds have to be renegotiated every year.\" </p> <p>However, continuing in the footsteps of their founders, women still make up more than 70% of the staff, and a majority live in the area served by the institution. In this, they are fulfilling another of the basic notions of the settlements ethic. </p> <p>Another common problem is that some localities where settlements were set up have been redeveloped. The poor parishes that the Birmingham Settlement served have been swept away and the area is mostly given over to light industry. Birmingham's solution was to buy three old ambulances to bring users to the premises. In Edinburgh, the settlement has extended into deprived parts of the city, away from the university campus. </p> <p>It is also true that links between old universities and their foundations have lapsed over the decades, though ways of reviving them are being discussed in many places. Sadly, Oxford seems to have forgotten about Oxford House and no longer sends it any students - a situation which Adams is working to change. </p> <p>Even when a settlement bears the name of the specific college which started it, the ties need to be rethought after a century. Just beyond the Elephant and Castle, in south London, is Pembroke College Mission, started by students and staff of the Cambridge college. The buildings look rather ecclesiastical, and the warden, the Rev Mark Williams, who is also a local vicar, has come up with an education project that would reinvolve its academic grandparent. As well as catering for pensioners and youth groups at the settlement, Williams is hoping to start a scheme to get more local boys and girls into higher education, using Pembroke students to coach and mentor them. </p> <p>However, the most ambitious plan to relaunch a settlement has been devised by possibly the movement's best known: though it's still going strong after a century, Toynbee Hall, in London's east end, not only wants to renew its old bonds with Oxford, but forge new ones with the City, which is on its doorstep. </p> <p>Toynbee, founded in 1884, is now a rambling, collegiate cluster of buildings. Many famous reformers - such as Clement Attlee and William Beveridge - were associated with it.

      "bodyText": "The oldest, most radical and most neglected model for helping the poor in the cities is making a timely comeback. The Victorian \"settlement\" is proving an ideal partner in community renewal schemes. Launched mostly by Oxbridge colleges and public schools, a fleet of settlements docked in the pools of urban industrial poverty from the 1880s. As prototype community centres, they were equipped with classrooms, clinics, chapels, dining halls, gymnasiums - and, essentially, living quarters for the students who volunteered to work in them. Settlements had a mission to bring about social improvement through interaction between their young educated helpers - the future elite, who often became passionate reformers - and those in need. Over time, the approach fell from fashion, but the social ills they set out to tackle a century ago are still around, though in contemporary guises. Now, for the first time since the 1960s and 70s, when settlements lost direction, saw income shrink and were eclipsed by the trend for vociferous community action, there are plans for expansion. Two universities, Surrey and the London School of Economics, plan new graduate community work courses based on the settlement model. Although the courses would not be residential, Ben Hughes, chief executive of the British Association of Settlements and Community Action Centres (Bassac), says: \"Settlements currently have an important role informing students about the issues in community work\". Local councils, too, are taking a fresh look at partnership possibilities. \"They're interested because settlements do provide direct services, but they are also able to support small, emerging community groups,\" says Hughes. In Newcastle upon Tyne, there is interest in the settlement model as a means of delivering neighbourhood renewal plans; in Tower Hamlets, east London, it is seen as a way of meeting the needs of ethnic minority groups. Reflecting the renewed vigour of settlements - there are about 80 in Britain - Bassac is busy helping several of the century-old institutions to manage change, or secure sources of finance, and is acting as an exchange for ideas on training staff and sharing resources. \"We don't direct; we merely facilitate,\" says Hughes. That is tactful because, historically, settlements are autonomous foundations: how they have gone (and continue to go) about their work is for each one to decide. But there are common problems. Oxford House was set up in Bethnal Green, east London, in 1884 by staff and students from Oxford University, with much goodwill but no financial endowment. \"People say to us: 'You've got a big five-storey building: you must be rich,'\" says director Kim Adams. \"But we have no reserves. We live from year to year.\" Successive tides of immigrants have used Oxford House, which has always had strong arts and education programmes. After a period in the doldrums, it has brought these two strands together: it has become the community base for Somalis, many living locally, and it aims several programmes at them. The settlement has a \u00a31.8m project for a performance space, workshops, studios and conference facilities, to showcase the cultures of local ethnic minority communities. What it does not offer, says Adams, is \"heavy-end social day care\" provision. By contrast, the huge Birmingham Settlement has 23 separate projects, covering the full range of local authority services, and works in partnership with 224 local organisations. It has an annual turnover of \u00a32.9m and is one of the largest voluntary agencies in the city. But its survival and success is achieved despite a fragile financial structure. It was middle-class women in Edgbaston, rather than the university, who set it up at the end of the 19th century. These pioneers contributed time, thought and effort, rather than cash. Susan Spencer, chief executive, says: \"We've no reserves, a \u00a3200,000 overdraft, and 90% of our funds have to be renegotiated every year.\" However, continuing in the footsteps of their founders, women still make up more than 70% of the staff, and a majority live in the area served by the institution. In this, they are fulfilling another of the basic notions of the settlements ethic. Another common problem is that some localities where settlements were set up have been redeveloped. The poor parishes that the Birmingham Settlement served have been swept away and the area is mostly given over to light industry. Birmingham's solution was to buy three old ambulances to bring users to the premises. In Edinburgh, the settlement has extended into deprived parts of the city, away from the university campus. It is also true that links between old universities and their foundations have lapsed over the decades, though ways of reviving them are being discussed in many places. Sadly, Oxford seems to have forgotten about Oxford House and no longer sends it any students - a situation which Adams is working to change. Even when a settlement bears the name of the specific college which started it, the ties need to be rethought after a century. Just beyond the Elephant and Castle, in south London, is Pembroke College Mission, started by students and staff of the Cambridge college. The buildings look rather ecclesiastical, and the warden, the Rev Mark Williams, who is also a local vicar, has come up with an education project that would reinvolve its academic grandparent. As well as catering for pensioners and youth groups at the settlement, Williams is hoping to start a scheme to get more local boys and girls into higher education, using Pembroke students to coach and mentor them. However, the most ambitious plan to relaunch a settlement has been devised by possibly the movement's best known: though it's still going strong after a century, Toynbee Hall, in London's east end, not only wants to renew its old bonds with Oxford, but forge new ones with the City, which is on its doorstep. Toynbee, founded in 1884, is now a rambling, collegiate cluster of buildings. Many famous reformers - such as Clement Attlee and William Beveridge - were associated with it. But the warden, the Rev Professor Luke Geoghegan, says its current appeal goes across the political - and religious - spectrum. \"We're going to recreate our original roots,\" he says. \"We're going to start a residential community for bright, young, talented people who want to go on and change the world.\" They will continue as students, or with their careers, but will live in. \"Evenings and weekends, they'll volunteer and get involved in developing new forms of work,\" he says. From September, the first batch of 15 will become residents. Their rooms are being refurbished as part of a grand redevelopment plan - IT sockets as well as TV sockets. Within three years, there will be 70 residents. Geoghegan is determined that Toynbee should recover its early reputation as a think-tank, but he prefers to call it a \"do-tank\", to develop innovative programmes and try them out locally. \"If they work in Tower Hamlets, they'll work anywhere,\" he says. \"And if they don't work, we should be able to say: 'Don't try this; it's a waste of time.'\" Volunteers could find themselves doing everything from helping local elderly Bengalis in their homes to befriending persistent young offenders - as well as spending time thinking. And Toynbee is already getting applications. \"A lot of young people come along with outstanding CVs and brilliant ideas and tell us: 'Nobody will give us space,'\" says Geoghegan. \"But we say: 'We will.' Settlements have to be open to that kind of creativity.\"",

We didn't encounter any problems there at all - the locals are very friendly and laid back about western travellers - after all, we are their source of income! Most of the time your main danger of theft is from monkeys, and even the mosquitos aren't that bad! You would get everything you say you want from your holiday on Tioman itself.</p> <p>The east coast is less adapted to tourists, so religious considerations would be a bit more important (covering up away from the beach etc), but in general I think you shouldn't worry at all about safety beyond the normal guidelines. Go and enjoy!</p> <p>Bridget Lingard, Edinburgh</p> <p>\u0095 I visited Peninsula Malaysia alone and had no trouble. Exercise the same caution you would anywhere else and you should be fine. One piece of advice I would give is that you should pack a long sleeved top and long trousers or skirt. You should try to cover up away from the beach, particularly along the east coast. Bear in mind that some Malaysian men have a very poor image of the morals of western women, and this is not helped if we walk about half-dressed (or so it seems to them!).</p> <p>I did not visit the jungle on my trip but if I had done so I would have tried to team up with other travellers and to go with a guide. You can probably organise this from a guesthouse/youth hostel fairly easily.<br>Katy Wynn</p> <p>\u0095 I have just returned from my second visit to Malaysia, both to the Peninsular and Borneo.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 I travelled to Tioman island via Singapore with my best friend last summer. Both of us, female, were only just 18 at the time. We didn't encounter any problems there at all - the locals are very friendly and laid back about western travellers - after all, we are their source of income! Most of the time your main danger of theft is from monkeys, and even the mosquitos aren't that bad! You would get everything you say you want from your holiday on Tioman itself. The east coast is less adapted to tourists, so religious considerations would be a bit more important (covering up away from the beach etc), but in general I think you shouldn't worry at all about safety beyond the normal guidelines. Go and enjoy! Bridget Lingard, Edinburgh \u0095 I visited Peninsula Malaysia alone and had no trouble. Exercise the same caution you would anywhere else and you should be fine. One piece of advice I would give is that you should pack a long sleeved top and long trousers or skirt. You should try to cover up away from the beach, particularly along the east coast. Bear in mind that some Malaysian men have a very poor image of the morals of western women, and this is not helped if we walk about half-dressed (or so it seems to them!). I did not visit the jungle on my trip but if I had done so I would have tried to team up with other travellers and to go with a guide. You can probably organise this from a guesthouse/youth hostel fairly easily. Katy Wynn \u0095 I have just returned from my second visit to Malaysia, both to the Peninsular and Borneo.

Hill, chairman of the National Farmers' Union (NFU) in Devon, said he would rather people broke the law by moving animals than let them suffer and die in confinement.</p> <p>The row over who is to

      "bodyText": "The foot and mouth outbreak is finally \"flattening out\", the government's chief scientific adviser said today. Professor David King said the latest figures on the crisis showed there was now a steady decrease in the average number of new cases being recorded each day. He said the average number for the week ending April 8 stood at 32 a day, compared with 43 for the previous week. The figures for yesterday and Monday - 41 and 29 respectively - were \"in line with the declining trend\", he said. \"The flattening out of the epidemic has now been confirmed, and the data even shows a possible downward trend since the end of March.\" Earlier today, the head of the rural task force, Michael Meacher, announced a \u00a315m package of short-term practical help for rural businesses in the areas hardest hit by the disease outbreak. Mr Meacher said it already complemented the \u00a38m pledged by the regional development agencies in these areas and built on the first package of short term aid for business launched on March 20, and the \u00a3120m extension of the small firms loan guarantee scheme announced on April 6. The prime minister, Tony Blair, today met farmers in Devon, and said vaccinations were an option still being looked at. However, Mr Blair said: \"It is something that would have to be done in the knowledge that it is not a substitute for the existing policy\". Faced with hostile questioning from one farmer over bureaucracy connected with disinfectant points, Mr Blair said he would address the problem tomorrow. He said he knew of the problems faced by all of the rural businesses in the area and added: \"The single most important thing is that we beat this disease.\" Mr Blair's visit comes as David Hill, chairman of the National Farmers' Union (NFU) in Devon, said he would rather people broke the law by moving animals than let them suffer and die in confinement. The row over who is to blame for the epidemic erupted after a leaked report, drafted for Mr Blair, showed farmers had taken part in hundreds of unlicensed livestock movements since the start of the outbreak. A few desperate farmers were even suspected of deliberately infecting their flocks with foot and mouth disease in order to claim compensation.

      "body": "<p>Symbols are enormously important in Northern Ireland. They help to identify communities and factions, and provide convenient targets for 'the other side' to attack.</p> <p>That is the context of the bizarre spat in the Northern Ireland assembly this week, in which hardliners of the Democratic Unionist Party DUP forced an emergency debate over - a display of Easter lilies.</p> <p>It was, many might think, a ridiculous waste of time and energy. But it is also possible to argue that the debate provided a telling insight into the current state of the peace process.</p> <p>The republicans of Sinn Fein knew exactly what mischief they would stir up when they persuaded the cross-party committee responsible for such things to bedeck the main hall of the Stormont assembly building with lilies. Lilies are the universally recognised symbol of mourning. For Christians, they have an especial significance at Easter. But for Irish republicans, they commemorate the dead of the 1916 Easter Rising, bloodily put down by British soldiers.</p> <p>Every year at Easter, there are republican marches and rallies in memory of the dead, and bellicose speeches pledging revenge. The lily features prominently on such occasions, usually in the form of a little oblong paper version, worn on the chest.</p> <p>One of the curiosities of the early years of the Troubles was that the emerging Provisional IRA and its supporters favoured fixing their paper lilies with pins, while the old Official IRA preferred a gummed version. In consequence, the latter group became universally known - and derided - as 'stickies'. For a short time the Provisionals were correspondingly called 'pinnies', but the term never, so to speak, stuck.</p> <p>So the lily is a powerful symbol of militant republicanism, certain to enrage the unionist members of the assembly. None more so than the perpetually enraged DUP, led by Northern Ireland's bellower-in-chief, Ian Paisley. Paisley knows a thing or two about symbolism: the bowler hats, furled umbrellas, and coloured sashes of the various loyalist marching orders, for example. His kind of unionists have no objection to lilies, so long as they are orange. They also venerate the red poppy which honours Britain's war dead. They know that Catholics find these symbols offensive, and that is exactly why they flaunt them.</p> <p>The DUP's action in demanding the recall of the assembly from its Easter recess was itself a symbolic action. Paisley's men actually won the vote, with the aid of several Ulster Unionists, only to see it effectively vetoed by nationalist and republican members - as the DUP must have known it would be.</p> <p>So tempers were frayed and sensibilities ruffled, and the lilies stay. No doubt there will be more of the same when Remembrance Day comes round in November, and members snarl at each other over the poppies.</p> <p>But the debate was not entirely sterile. David Ervine of the tiny Progressive Unionist Party made a remarkable intervention, ridiculing the DUP and recalling that he had done more than Paisley's ranters ever did to fight the IRA.

      "bodyText": "Symbols are enormously important in Northern Ireland. They help to identify communities and factions, and provide convenient targets for 'the other side' to attack. That is the context of the bizarre spat in the Northern Ireland assembly this week, in which hardliners of the Democratic Unionist Party DUP forced an emergency debate over - a display of Easter lilies. It was, many might think, a ridiculous waste of time and energy. But it is also possible to argue that the debate provided a telling insight into the current state of the peace process. The republicans of Sinn Fein knew exactly what mischief they would stir up when they persuaded the cross-party committee responsible for such things to bedeck the main hall of the Stormont assembly building with lilies. Lilies are the universally recognised symbol of mourning. For Christians, they have an especial significance at Easter. But for Irish republicans, they commemorate the dead of the 1916 Easter Rising, bloodily put down by British soldiers. Every year at Easter, there are republican marches and rallies in memory of the dead, and bellicose speeches pledging revenge. The lily features prominently on such occasions, usually in the form of a little oblong paper version, worn on the chest. One of the curiosities of the early years of the Troubles was that the emerging Provisional IRA and its supporters favoured fixing their paper lilies with pins, while the old Official IRA preferred a gummed version. In consequence, the latter group became universally known - and derided - as 'stickies'. For a short time the Provisionals were correspondingly called 'pinnies', but the term never, so to speak, stuck. So the lily is a powerful symbol of militant republicanism, certain to enrage the unionist members of the assembly. None more so than the perpetually enraged DUP, led by Northern Ireland's bellower-in-chief, Ian Paisley. Paisley knows a thing or two about symbolism: the bowler hats, furled umbrellas, and coloured sashes of the various loyalist marching orders, for example. His kind of unionists have no objection to lilies, so long as they are orange. They also venerate the red poppy which honours Britain's war dead. They know that Catholics find these symbols offensive, and that is exactly why they flaunt them. The DUP's action in demanding the recall of the assembly from its Easter recess was itself a symbolic action. Paisley's men actually won the vote, with the aid of several Ulster Unionists, only to see it effectively vetoed by nationalist and republican members - as the DUP must have known it would be. So tempers were frayed and sensibilities ruffled, and the lilies stay. No doubt there will be more of the same when Remembrance Day comes round in November, and members snarl at each other over the poppies. But the debate was not entirely sterile. David Ervine of the tiny Progressive Unionist Party made a remarkable intervention, ridiculing the DUP and recalling that he had done more than Paisley's ranters ever did to fight the IRA. (Ervine was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 1974 for transporting a bomb.) Ervine actually supported the display of lilies, but added: \"I have no particular desire to appreciate or venerate the republican dead other than perhaps myself and some of my colleagues might have liked to have added to the ranks of republican dead.\" On the face of it, that was a poisonous thing to say, and Sinn Fein members duly twittered with horror. But, as Ervine made clear after the debate, he was only underlining how far he and other former paramilitary activists have moved. He was, as he candidly acknowledged, once in the business of killing republicans; now he was supporting their right to commemorate their fallen heroes. If only the IRA could respond with similar candour and generosity, the peace process would look a lot healthier. In its current febrile condition, it can too easily be diverted by the forces of reaction and bluster into a debate about a floral display.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said: \"The Chinese government out of humanitarian considerations has decided to allow the crew members to leave China after completing necessary procedures.\" Mr Sun said it \"won't be long\" before the 21 men and three women of the US Navy EP-3E plane would be allowed to leave.

That's Australia for you drongos at the back. Now, on Monday we tonked the Tongans 22-0 to set a new record for an international victory. But were you cobbers impressed? Were you buggery! Today our boys did even better, whipping those whipping-boys of world football, American Samoa (ranked 203rd and last by Fifa) 31-0 to set a new and improved world record!</p> <p>With our star striker, Coventry reserve John Aloisi, having a little rest, it took us a while to get going. Eight minutes, if you want to be all English and precise about it. But with his replacement, Archie Thompson, flying faster than nectar from a shaken tinnie, it wasn't long before American Samoa had the cactus. They were 16-0 down at the break, and when Archie scored his 13th goal - which incidentally smashed the all-time individual scoring record in an international - they were flailing like a mozzie that's felt the back of my Aussie Times.</p> <p>But before thoughts turn to the crunch game against Samoa proper, let's spare a thought for the plucky American Samoan boys. OK, they may have been robbed of 19 of their 20-man senior squad after Fifa decided that Samoans without US passports were ineligible. And yes, it's true they couldn't even draft in their U-20 squad - as they were involved in end-of-term exams. And yes, you would have a point if you reminded me they were forced to play 15-year-olds, one appropriately named Baby Mulipola. But don't forget our victory was well deserved - and don't let the fact that our keeper only got his first touch in the 86th minute fool you otherwise.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ON GUARD</strong></p> <p>Poor old Barcelona. The minnows from that second-grade seaside resort have been having a tough time of it lately. Bored to sleep by Gerard Houllier's moving sandbags, miles off the lead in La Liga, set to lose Rivaldo for nowt when his contract expires, and condemned forever to speak some derivative of Spanish just to show how different they are, things were bad enough. But today events hit a new low when Barca were linked with signing David James. At the same time as their talismanic skipper announced he was slinging his hook.</p> <p>\"I'm going to see out my career abroad,\" Pep Guardiola told a news conference at the Nou Camp today. \"It's not an easy decision to make but after weighing things up I think it's for the best.\" The 30-year-old playmaker, who joined the club when he was 13, is off \"to get to know a new league, another culture, new friends and new rivals\". Which is very open-minded of him, although the Fiver imagines that driving to and from your mansion in a beamer to buy Gucci belts translates quite well across the continent.</p> <p>The venerable Robby Bobson has already gone on record to say that, if Pep was to leave Spain, Robby would \"have no doubt that he would be prepared to come to Newcastle\". Maybe for a nice day out at the Metro Centre, for example. He might also want to go to Birmingham of course, in order to help Barca prise James away from the Villa.</p> <p>The top keeper was linked with a move to Catalonia by the papers this morning, but came out straight away to confirm that he had higher ambitions. \"I am happy at Aston Villa,\" he said. \"I have just signed a long contract and can see the club going places.\" Again, the Metro Centre springs to mind. \"The fact I am learning Spanish is completely coincidental!\" Indeed, indeed.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It would have been interesting to see what they'd have been like if Terry Venables hadn't taken over, as he's come in and steadied the ship and they're still struggling.

      "bodyText": "Internet retailer Amazon.com has sealed a deal with arch-rival Borders to absorb its e-commerce operation and develop closer ties with the high street. Amazon will take over Borders.com, which had hitherto tried to compete against Amazon in the online book-selling arena. The deal means that Borders will opt out of the online book business and work to promote Amazon in its high-street stores across the world. The tie-up could also lead to Amazon using Borders stores for returns and book reservation and pick-up services. Likewise, the planned Amazon/Borders branded website will plug details of Borders in-store events. The existing Borders.com, a distant third in the US online book market after No 2 Barnesandnoble.com, is to be shut down with the loss of 70 jobs. Amazon founder and chief executive officer Jeff Bezos made the announcement this lunchtime at a press conference held in New York. \"Borders is best-of-breed in the physical world and a company that shares our passion for serving book, music and movie lovers everywhere,\" said Mr Bezos. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The deal with Borders is not the first alliance Amazon has made with a high-street retailer. Last year, it launched a similar joint venture with Toys R Us in which Amazon ran the website toysrus.com for a fee on each sale, and the toy store provided all the inventory. Amazon is also said to be working on a number of other \"real-world\" tie-ups with the likes of Wall-Mart and US firm Best Buy. The latest deal with Borders might go some way to restoring Amazon's credibility with investors, who have become increasingly worried about its mounting losses. This was calmed somewhat on Monday when Amazon reported stronger than expected results. Related story Apr 10: Amazon bounces back on better sales",

The paper has banned the advert promoting the Bank, a marketing consultancy whose clients include British Airways and Orange. The consultancy booked page three of tomorrow's FT for the advert, which features a topless woman next to the words: \"The art of selling in a bare market\". The company planned to get extra publicity out of the move by filming City workers' reaction to the advert. Stuart Bradbury, business development manager of the Bank, described the advert as \"tasteful\" and criticised the paper for setting itself up as a moral arbiter. \"We deliberately chose the FT to showcase our ad in order to demonstrate that our thinking incorporates placing the usual in the unusual,\" he claimed. \"Placing a Page Three girl in the FT - albeit tastefully - illustrates this perfectly,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>As Tony Blair faces the palms-and-concrete holiday camp that is Torbay to appease disgruntled teachers' unions, my own vague educational plans become ever more confused. As the mother of a 14-month-old, I am being cautioned to lubricate my way to a decent school place without further delay. Industrial action and other hiccoughs aside, it is never too early to marry house-moving plans with league tables, or to undergo a religious epiphany. In fact, since the lad is already one, we may have missed the boat. </p> <p>To my immense surprise, as I peep tentatively over the post-partum barricades at the real world, I am bombarded with dire warnings. It is, apparently, a jungle out there. A jostling, tussling, spitting cat fight featuring middle-class corruption and outrage over establishments with such names as \"Beacon schools\". An arcane and puzzling system of priestly favours and catchment-area gerrymandering. According to research published last week, we'll need to find at least an extra 20 grand to move to an area with a decent state school - and that'd be if we went to live in Coventry. Be it the building society or the church restoration fund, we're going to be in hock, it seems. </p> <p>The first indication of my new life came when an acquaintance started pretending her daughter was Catholic: she targeted a primary school for four years hence, and had the infant Baptised. I thought she was simply eccentric. Recently, however, perfectly sensible friends of a casually atheist bent have come over all happy-clappy. Yes, they tell me, to stand any chance of a primary school place half-way free of illiteracy and syringes, one must target some shiny centre of excellence, drag one's toddler to the adjacent church's Sunday school for three years, and assiduously drum one's presence into the vicar's consciousness. </p> <p>My God. </p> <p>Surely, surely there are other ways. Can't one just cheat, for instance? Be hit by a clap of religious conversion some time shortly before September 2004? Invite a headmistress round to dinner? Feebly brandish a press card? Shag a vicar? No. Apparently not. These churches have registers. Blair is investing more money in church schools. Other normal-to-neurotic types are prepared to buy overpriced flatlets with playground views in order to get their offspring into St Something's, the league table conqueror. </p> <p>I simply cannot do it. It would fill me with repulsion, horror, and, indeed, Catholic-style guilt. That the church - an institution I've rarely thought about since sobbing over The Nun's Story at the age of eight - towers thus over our secular age, affiliated with so many good schools, fills me with startled bewilderment. According to friends with four-year-olds, we have to move to the leafy, middle-class London suburb of Muswell Hill next month, measure the inches to the school with a ruler, leap on to a parish register, and, quite possibly, take a Discover Christianity course. </p> <p>So, the paths fork here: it's Muswell Hill or backpacking to Kathmandu and an innumerate hippie upbringing. You make a choice now about the next five years. In fact, about your whole life. It feels repulsively grown-up, as though a Baby on Board sticker and all those grim parenty tokens one so doggedly avoids are an inevitability. And yet, perhaps there really is no choice. That rather lively academy of head-butting and dyslexia round the corner may ultimately propel one, recanting, into the church. </p> <p>I feel as though I have entered a feudal system, a previously misunderstood fandango of fetlocks, boons and tithes. The staggering hypocrisy, so readily accepted, the rules and regulations, so meekly submitted to, seem reminiscent of earlier and more worrying eras. In a supposedly multi-cultural, inclusive society, what are parents of mixed religious backgrounds, or those who simply can't be arsed, supposed to do? Why should quality of education depend on how effectively parents can feign devotion? Is the church so desperate for bums on pews, even fraudulent bums will do? </p> <p>The alternative, of course, is to invest the last vestiges of savings reserved for the Eurostar and dining out at Yo! Sushi in some poncy little prep school, all boaters and under-aged oboe lessons, then call in the Eton prospectus. I'd rather take to the Nepalese foothills and be left with an idiot savant. </p> <p>My main problem now is that when I panic upon celebrating my son's second birthday and sign up for my Discover Christianity course, I, unlike my freshly-minted Catholic and Anglican friends, will be rumbled. At that trembling second before I become a Bride of Christ, someone might, Victorian novel-style, step forward and produce, instead of a bigamous marriage licence or a record of hotrodding, this very column. Clearly, then, I am damned. </p> <p>Um, do they sell Bibles at Waterstones?</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Tony Blair faces the palms-and-concrete holiday camp that is Torbay to appease disgruntled teachers' unions, my own vague educational plans become ever more confused. As the mother of a 14-month-old, I am being cautioned to lubricate my way to a decent school place without further delay. Industrial action and other hiccoughs aside, it is never too early to marry house-moving plans with league tables, or to undergo a religious epiphany. In fact, since the lad is already one, we may have missed the boat. To my immense surprise, as I peep tentatively over the post-partum barricades at the real world, I am bombarded with dire warnings. It is, apparently, a jungle out there. A jostling, tussling, spitting cat fight featuring middle-class corruption and outrage over establishments with such names as \"Beacon schools\". An arcane and puzzling system of priestly favours and catchment-area gerrymandering. According to research published last week, we'll need to find at least an extra 20 grand to move to an area with a decent state school - and that'd be if we went to live in Coventry. Be it the building society or the church restoration fund, we're going to be in hock, it seems. The first indication of my new life came when an acquaintance started pretending her daughter was Catholic: she targeted a primary school for four years hence, and had the infant Baptised. I thought she was simply eccentric. Recently, however, perfectly sensible friends of a casually atheist bent have come over all happy-clappy. Yes, they tell me, to stand any chance of a primary school place half-way free of illiteracy and syringes, one must target some shiny centre of excellence, drag one's toddler to the adjacent church's Sunday school for three years, and assiduously drum one's presence into the vicar's consciousness. My God. Surely, surely there are other ways. Can't one just cheat, for instance? Be hit by a clap of religious conversion some time shortly before September 2004? Invite a headmistress round to dinner? Feebly brandish a press card? Shag a vicar? No. Apparently not. These churches have registers. Blair is investing more money in church schools. Other normal-to-neurotic types are prepared to buy overpriced flatlets with playground views in order to get their offspring into St Something's, the league table conqueror. I simply cannot do it. It would fill me with repulsion, horror, and, indeed, Catholic-style guilt. That the church - an institution I've rarely thought about since sobbing over The Nun's Story at the age of eight - towers thus over our secular age, affiliated with so many good schools, fills me with startled bewilderment. According to friends with four-year-olds, we have to move to the leafy, middle-class London suburb of Muswell Hill next month, measure the inches to the school with a ruler, leap on to a parish register, and, quite possibly, take a Discover Christianity course. So, the paths fork here: it's Muswell Hill or backpacking to Kathmandu and an innumerate hippie upbringing. You make a choice now about the next five years. In fact, about your whole life. It feels repulsively grown-up, as though a Baby on Board sticker and all those grim parenty tokens one so doggedly avoids are an inevitability. And yet, perhaps there really is no choice. That rather lively academy of head-butting and dyslexia round the corner may ultimately propel one, recanting, into the church. I feel as though I have entered a feudal system, a previously misunderstood fandango of fetlocks, boons and tithes. The staggering hypocrisy, so readily accepted, the rules and regulations, so meekly submitted to, seem reminiscent of earlier and more worrying eras. In a supposedly multi-cultural, inclusive society, what are parents of mixed religious backgrounds, or those who simply can't be arsed, supposed to do? Why should quality of education depend on how effectively parents can feign devotion? Is the church so desperate for bums on pews, even fraudulent bums will do? The alternative, of course, is to invest the last vestiges of savings reserved for the Eurostar and dining out at Yo! Sushi in some poncy little prep school, all boaters and under-aged oboe lessons, then call in the Eton prospectus. I'd rather take to the Nepalese foothills and be left with an idiot savant. My main problem now is that when I panic upon celebrating my son's second birthday and sign up for my Discover Christianity course, I, unlike my freshly-minted Catholic and Anglican friends, will be rumbled. At that trembling second before I become a Bride of Christ, someone might, Victorian novel-style, step forward and produce, instead of a bigamous marriage licence or a record of hotrodding, this very column. Clearly, then, I am damned. Um, do they sell Bibles at Waterstones?",

But I know exactly how Farrah Fawcett feels when she accompanies her 16-year-old son Redmond to court in Santa Monica, California, where he has to sign in every week following a conviction for using cannabis. I know because my son, too, has recently been in trouble with the law. </p> <p>Here's the scenario: it is a Saturday morning, at 6am. The doorbell rings, followed by loud knocking. Denial turns into acceptance - I realise, with a sinking heart, that it's not the postman. I stumble downstairs and yes, it's the police. Our 17-year-old son Joe has been arrested, for the second time, for graffiti - criminal damage in the eyes of the law. He's still in the cell, they're just checking out his bail address. </p> <p>We veer between fury at him and desperate worry over what's going to happen next. Now that the old system of cautioning juveniles has been phased out because of its lack of deterrent effect - kids used to get six, seven or even more cautions, often for the same offence - ending up in court and getting a criminal record, even a custodial sentence, is frighteningly easy. These days, you get a reprimand for a first offence and a final warning, if you're lucky, for a second or more serious one. After that, it's see you in court, sonny Jim. And magistrates can no longer give conditional discharges. The government's plans to build at least five new young offenders' units suddenly seem horribly relevant. </p> <p>At about 8am, my husband, Don, rings the police station. Joe hasn't even been interviewed yet. He's been there since 1am, having been caught in the act of spray-painting some shop hoardings, but was too drunk to give a statement. Because he's 17, they treat him as an adult - parents don't have to be present. He's also been charged with possession of a small quantity of cannabis. At least it wasn't the much more heinous \"with intent to supply\", I say, adopting my \"always look on the bright side of life\" pose in opposition to Don's despair mode. These crises always result in us taking out our rage and sadness on each other. </p> <p>A few hours later, statement made, we learn from the sergeant, who is very polite and helpful, that Joe has been released on bail, to return three days later to learn his fate. In the meantime, the police will talk to the shopkeepers. We express our willingness to repair or pay for the damage. Surely that would be the most useful option, and might teach Joe a lesson. Though you'd think a night in the cells might have done that, too. </p> <p>But when Joe comes home he's in an angry mood: police are idiots and he's a sort of hero/victim because he was the only one that got caught or searched. He didn't grass on his mates, though they were all spraying too. As for the cannabis, it was such a small amount he doesn't consider it worth discussing. </p> <p>As he cooks himself a fry-up, he explains, after reasonably gentle cross-questioning from me, that boozing followed by graffiti is done in response to boredom. I try to refrain from telling him that he doesn't know what boredom means. Loads of friends, TV, PlayStation, clubbing, music, exciting Saturday job - at his age I would have killed for a life like that. Instead I concentrate on practicalities - how a criminal record would affect his future. Travel plans and job applications, for example. </p> <p>I don't know if any of it sinks in. He retires to bed; we go for a long walk and agree that grounding him wouldn't work. We don't know what will. Of course, these aren't terrible crimes, but his attitude is so negative. Is it all our fault for being too laid-back? Not laid-back enough? Who knows where, or if, we went wrong. </p> <p>A few days later, we're at the police station bright and early, prepared for the worst. The day before, I tried to extract information from a PC who told me a charge was more or less inevitable because Joe had been done before for the same offence. And this time, there's the drug possession as well. </p> <p>A solicitor meets us there, and we're relieved we decided, after a lot of agonising about whether it might count against us in some way, to make use of this free service. She takes Joe round a corner and coaches him on how to comport himself to best advantage. I catch the words \"appear fully remorseful\". She and the desk sergeant remark at the amazing sight of one, let alone two parents. </p> <p>\"Most parents just don't want to know,\" says the solicitor. </p> <p>Incredibly, after an interview with the inspector - what a lovely man - Joe gets a final warning with compulsory attendance at a youth offending team. They seem to have overlooked the cannabis possession. We try to contain our joy until we're out of the door. Joe goes to school, Don and I go for a coffee. \"Do you think he understands how lucky he's been?\" asks Don. I think the solicitor may have helped him take in that this really is his last chance. Next time - oh God, please let there not be one - without a doubt, he'd go to court. </p> <p>But it's not over yet. A week later, after school, Joe and I are with the youth offending team. </p> <p>\"So you're an artist?\" says Chris, the youth worker, affably. \"Do you just tag or do you spray as well?\" Obviously, he understands and is part of this world that Joe desires. If he'll listen to anyone, it's this guy. They talk about the recent tragedy in Camden, when a 16-year old stabbed an 18-year old to death over a dispute about lining out tags (crossing out graffiti signatures that mark territory). </p> <p>Chris asks if Joe offered to clean his own art work off and tuts in disappointment when he hears that no one followed this up. He feels that, if only \"artists\" like Joe were given the chance to make amends, graffiti need not reach the criminal justice system. But he's realistic. \"If you go on doing it, you will end up with a sentence,\" he says. He also mentions Jack Straw's enthusiam for locking up young offenders. </p> <p>As for the cannabis, he reminds Joe that tobacco in joints damages your lungs more than cigarettes, because of the lack of filters. </p> <p>\"Now I'm not going to tell you to eat it,\" he elaborates, \"because the trouble with that is you've no way of controlling how mashed you're going to get, as you can with a joint. Most people, like myself, have enough of it after a while and grow out of it.\" </p> <p>He treats Joe with respect, as an equal, a man of the streets. \"You seem very together,\" he tells him. I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry. \"You obviously know what you're doing.\" </p> <p>And although he doesn't feel the final warning programme on offer at the unit would be suitable for Joe - he'd be older than the other kids and it would bore him - he's very welcome to drop in at any time, or to paint the outside of the unit with some of his friends. I wonder if he will. Maybe this scheme is one part of the government's crackdown on crime that really might work. </p> <p>I make a note of Chris's direct line, and feel a glimmer of hope.

But four years ago she finally plunged into the dating whirlpool and started a romantic affair; after so many years alone, my sister and I secretly hoped that maybe she would meet The One. </p> <p>With just the three of us together, our upbringing had been cosy, the closeness of our family unit not fading as we moved away from home.

I know I'm doing something wrong - and I sympathised because I had been there myself. \"Testing the water in the first couple of relationships since my divorce was disastrous,\" she told me recently. \"But they were the beginning of a whole new chapter that had been denied me as a young woman thanks to my strict Victorian-style upbringing.\" With our roles reversed, I became the experienced \"parent\" able to offer wise counsel which, unlike a legitimate teenager, she was willing to take onboard. </p> <p>This change in roles is not restricted to mother-daughter relationships as Stephen O'Connell, 26, knows only too well. He counselled his mother continuously after his parents divorced when he was 19: \"The parent-child cross-over between my mother and I manifested with her not being aware of what to do in relationships.

While her mother, Caroline, was enjoying her new-found freedom after her divorce in 1986, Madeleine Greenhill, now 27, resented the changes to their relationship. She felt her mother was only interested in discussing her own relationships problems, forcing Greenhill into the role of unwilling advisor and sounding-board. </p> <p>\"Even when I had my own daughter in my early 20s there wasn't a granny around for her. Instead there was this 'teenager' in our lives who wasn't interested in becoming a grandmother yet.\" With time, the role changes returned back to their familiar, if somewhat altered, groove. \"My mother eventually settled down with her partner and five years on she's happily established in her grandmother role,\" says Greenhill. </p> <p>Dr Gill Dunne, senior research fellow in Sociology at the LSE, believes that these newly defined relationships reflect the gulf in generational experience between mother and child and reflect the breakdown in hierarchy between them. \"Within this new relationship one has to examine our own expectations and question how realistic they are in terms of what we want and expect from our mothers. It now requires negotiating a relationship between two people.\" </p> <p>Women of my mother's generation married for life just as their own parents had done. Living through two decades of social change, however, gave them the confidence to leave an unhappy marriage. </p> <p>After a few trial runs, my mother met her now long-term partner, and she found herself having to relearn the relationship rules, frequently turning to me for insider information. When our swapped roles coincided with a particularly trying time in my own life, I'd lament not having a mother's ear to bend over the phone. </p> <p>But as she relinquished her immediate mothering duties, I learned to acknowledge that she was a woman first, and then my mother. A month ago, as she drove me to the train station after a weekend visit - and an afternoon's heart-to-heart - my mother said softly, \"you know, you're more like a big sister to me, but I'm the one who's supposed to be the mother.\" And, thankfully, she still is. But for a short time I'd had to look after her as she had once done for me and a door has now opened between us that will always be kept ajar.</p>",

Dr Gill Dunne, senior research fellow in Sociology at the LSE, believes that these newly defined relationships reflect the gulf in generational experience between mother and child and reflect the breakdown in hierarchy between them. \"Within this new relationship one has to examine our own expectations and question how realistic they are in terms of what we want and expect from our mothers. It now requires negotiating a relationship between two people.\" Women of my mother's generation married for life just as their own parents had done. Living through two decades of social change, however, gave them the confidence to leave an unhappy marriage. After a few trial runs, my mother met her now long-term partner, and she found herself having to relearn the relationship rules, frequently turning to me for insider information. When our swapped roles coincided with a particularly trying time in my own life, I'd lament not having a mother's ear to bend over the phone. But as she relinquished her immediate mothering duties, I learned to acknowledge that she was a woman first, and then my mother. A month ago, as she drove me to the train station after a weekend visit - and an afternoon's heart-to-heart - my mother said softly, \"you know, you're more like a big sister to me, but I'm the one who's supposed to be the mother.\" And, thankfully, she still is. But for a short time I'd had to look after her as she had once done for me and a door has now opened between us that will always be kept ajar.",

Just as Buckingham Palace draws up new rules for royals in business, Prince Edward will reveal that Ardent TV has made a \"small operating profit\" for the year to December 2000. It is the first profit the company has made since it launched nine years ago. However, the company is still deep in the red with losses of \u00a31.9m accumulated over the previous eight years. Ardent struggles to maintain credibility, despite Prince Edward's confident prediction back in 1993 that the company would become \"one of the top 12\" British TV production companies by 2000. Ardent TV chairman Malcolm Cockren said today it was still an important milestone for the company. \"This is our first operating profit. It does not mean we are in the black, but it is an excellent situation. \"It is nothing to do with good fortune, it is to do with the sensible running of the business. It has taken us a lot longer than we anticipated because we wanted to concentrate on quality programming,\" said Mr Cockren. The company is holding its annual general meeting today at its headquarters in the earl's home, Bagshot Park in Surrey. Ardent has made substantial losses for eight years running - last year it recorded a deficit of \u00a3222,000, up from \u00a3122,000 last year. When he set up the company back in 1993, Prince Edward was determined to prove he could make an independent living. Despite his insistence that he is not using his family, the prince has been frequently accused of trading on the royal connections. His portfolio of programmes include a documentary on the restoration of Windsor Castle featuring interviews with his father and brother; a two-part documentary about his great-uncle which won critical acclaim; Crown &amp; Country, a six-part series on the monarchy's links with towns in Britain; and the A-Z of Royals for American TV. Attempts to diversify into non-royal programming making have had a mixed reception. Annie's Bar, a political soap, was dropped by Channel 4 after one series and ITV did not commission any more Inspector Pitt Mysteries despite a successful pilot of the drama. The company is now concentrating on non-heritage programming with plans for a new drama series about arranged marriages in Britain. A documentary about expatriates in Singapore made by Ardent will be screened by Channel 5 in June. Related story Apr 11: ITV in talks with prince",

Ambassador Prueher said in the letter that both President Bush and Secretary of State Powell have expressed their sincere regret over China's missing pilot and aircraft. He said on behalf of the U.S. Government that they were very sorry to the Chinese people and the family of pilot Wang Wei and that they were very sorry for the US plane entering China's airspace and landing without a verbal clearance. The US side also expressed its appreciation of China's efforts to see to the well-being of the American crew. Minister Tang pointed out that it is a serious incident that the U.S. military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane on the morning of 1 April off the coast of China's Hainan Province, leading to the missing of the Chinese pilot, and entered China's airspace and landed at the Chinese airfield without permission. The said US plane intruded into China's territorial airspace and encroached upon China's sovereignty in violation of international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China as well as the consensus that China and the US reached last May on avoiding dangerous maritime military activities. Its act has thus constituted a threat to China's national security. The US side must take full responsibility for the incident. It is entirely reasonable and legitimate for the Chinese side to ask for an apology to the Chinese people from the US side. Minister Tang emphasized that ever since the US military reconnaissance plane rammed into and destroyed a Chinese military plane, the Chinese side has all along handled this incident with calmness and restraint and in accordance with international law and the provisions of relevant laws of China. The competent departments in China have, out of humanitarian considerations, treated the 24 crew members of the US reconnaissance plane well and arranged for their meetings with US diplomatic and consular officers. He said he noted that the US side expressed in the letter its appreciation to the Chinese side for all this. He told Ambassador Prueher that the Chinese side understands the American people and the families of the crew are eagerly looking forward to an early return of the crew and a reunion with them. As the US government has already said \"very sorry\" to the Chinese people, the Chinese government has, out of humanitarian considerations, decided to allow the crew members to leave China after completing the necessary procedures. He also pointed out that this is not the conclusion of the case involving the US military plane ramming into a Chinese aircraft, causing the missing of the Chinese pilot, entering the Chinese airspace and landing at a Chinese airfield without permission. The two sides will continue with the negotiations on the matter and other related issues. The Chinese Government and people demand that the US side provide convincing explanations to the Chinese people on this incident, stop sending aircraft to the vicinity of the Chinese coast for reconnaissance activities and take effective measures to avert the recurrence of similar incidents. The US side must understand fully the seriousness of the incident, take seriously the solemn position of the Chinese side and properly handle this incident. It must not make an erroneous judgment and further damage the bilateral relations. Minister Tang finally stressed that China's sovereign independence, territorial integrity and national dignity brook no infringement. It is China's consistent position that state-to- state relations, including China-US relations, must be based on such basic norms governing international relations as mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non- aggression and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The Chinese side attaches importance to China-US relations. To develop friendly relations and cooperation between China and the US serves the interests of both countries and the world at large.

In an extraordinary diversification, the chain known the world over for burgers and fries is extending its range of food in Britain to include traditional Indian takeaway dishes. On the menu, alongside milkshakes and Big Macs, will be chicken tikka masala, lamb rogan josh, tandoori chicken, vegetable samosas, onion bhajis and banana and mango coolers. The indian menu will change weekly and \"The Spice of Life\" promotion is set to run from today until May 22. The move is a departure for McDonald's, which often themes its burgers, chicken nuggets and dips around different types of world cuisine, but until now has not sold the dishes themselves. An advertising campaign for the indian menu promotion breaks on TV tonight featuring a cast of \"ordinary\" people singing traditional British songs. As part of its attempt to bolster revenues, McDonald's is launching a chain of hotels, piloting American-style diners within its restaurants and is investing in companies such as Pret A Manger.

Four senior general reporters and the showbusiness editor have applied for the scheme, only to be told they will have to wait until the newspaper opens the book for voluntary redundancy. Dennis Rice, Adrian Lee and Anthony Mitchell, senior reporters on the Express, and showbusiness editor Shekhar Bhatia, have all put their names forward. David Dillon from the Sunday Express is also believed to have applied. Ms Cook, who was one of Lord Hollick's faithful lieutenants and is believed to have been one of those who received the \u00a340,000 farewell bonus that the former Express proprietor bequeathed on many senior staff after selling the paper to Richard Desmond. She will leave next month as part of the fast-track programme. Saturday magazine editor Sally Ferrari and her deputy David Allsop have also applied for the scheme. One senior journalist there said: \"The place is disintegrating before our eyes.\" Insiders say 130 reporters applied for fast-track redundancy before the full voluntary consultation period had begun. The latest planned departures plans threaten to leave the Express with only five general reporters, and sources say morale is \"rock bottom\". Related stories Click here for latest Express news",

      "bodyText": "Prince Edward's beleaguered TV company has won a timely morale boost after ITV expressed interest in a new project that does not trade on his royal connections. He is due to meet network chiefs in the next two weeks to discuss his company's idea for a new drama series about arranged marriages in Britain. The series, Honour Me, is already in the early stages of development and would be set in the UK and India. ITV network chiefs, who can barely squeeze new dramas into the schedule because of ongoing hits including Peak Practice and London's Burning, are already talking with excitement about the project. The diversification into such a sensitive cultural subject as arranged marriages and the Asian community in Britain will be seen as an unusual move for the Earl of Wessex, who has come under fire for using his status to drum up business. Last week the prince was accused of using a business trip to the Far East to further his television business. But sources say the earl cannot take personal credit for the drama project. That goes to Nigel McCrery, the man who created a string of TV hits including the BBC series Silent Witness starring Amanda Burton. He has been hired by the earl's company to develop new drama and is highly thought of in TV circles. Sources say he has caught the eye of ITV and BBC chiefs because of his unorthodox background. After leaving school he became a police officer, but quit the force to further his education at King's College, Cambridge. \"There are very few people in TV who aren't Tristans. Nigel simply doesn't do the TV circuit,\" said one TV executive who has worked with him. \"He doesn't live in London, keeps his feet on the ground in Nottingham and has no interest in the endless rounds of parties and networking in places like the Groucho or Soho House, He brings a fresh eye to things.\" Mr McCrery was executive producer on All the King's Men, a BBC1 drama about the first world war Norfolk regiment recruited from among Sandringham's royal servants, grooms and gardeners. Starring David Jason, it was also made by the earl's TV company, Ardent Television, but was based on an original book by Mr McCrery. Ardent Television chairman Malcolm Cockren confirmed Honour Me was being developed but said it was \"at early stages\". \"We are looking for a writer and beyond that I can't really say without giving away trade secrets,\" he said. If the deal comes off it will mark a significant boost for Prince Edward, who has struggled to gain credibility as a serious player in the television market. He has been frequently criticised for falling back on his royal connections to make programmes ranging from Edward on Edward, a documentary about his great-uncle King Edward VIII, to a current documentary for American television, the A-Z of Royalty.

      "bodyText": "For years Microsoft's pop-up office assistant has infuriated Word users with its helpful hints. So much so that the software giant has decided to kill him off and is launching a tongue-in-cheek campaign to promote the move. The \u00a3300,000 promotion forms part of the launch campaign for Microsoft's new Office XP programme, which will not include the offending tool. The pop-up paperclip, which goes by the nickname of \"Mr Clippy\", is one of the most unpopular features of Microsoft's software and his demise will be welcomed the world over. A new website devoted to Mr Clippy gives users the chance to vote on what should become of the anthropomorphic paperclip when Microsoft's new system is launched. A short film shows the character being killed by a furious Word user and the site includes an interactive game in which users can zap the paper clip with a staple gun. The site even has Mr Clippy's \"to do\" list, which includes a reminder to send out his CV and ask Bill Gates for a reference. The interfering paper clip's most common question, \"Are you writing a letter?\" is also tackled in a spoof version that shows him ask, \"Are you writing a letter? Is it a love letter? Can I read it?\". \"Clippy is a character that people feel very strongly about - they either love him or hate him,\" said a Microsoft spokeswoman. \"With Office XP's ease of use we don't think customers will need to use Clippy.\" Office XP launches at the end of May backed by a major global advertising and marketing campaign. Customers who want to use an office assistant will still be able to access Clippy if they want to, but he will no longer be as in-your-face as he once was.",

      "body": "<p>\"This is disgraceful,\" fumed San Francisco judge Marilyn Hall Patel yesterday, when faced with evidence of how business continues as usual on the court injunction-bound Napster song-swapping service.</p> <p>Business, of course, is not quite the word to use, given that Napster makes no money and that most of the songs swapped through it are pirated duplicates of copyright music.</p> <p>But, regardless, Napster's popularity remains strong and filtering procedures put in place are failing to put the brakes on the violations the website makes so simple to carry out. </p> <p>Logging on this morning, it was easy to find any tune from this week's chart. Even brand-new singles from well-known artists were there: the soundtrack album for Bridget Jones' Diary is all there for free, as is Janet Jackson's new single, All for You. The latter is on rotation at MTV and is pretty popular on Napster as well; I quickly found dozens of fellow users ready to share the file.</p> <p>How are they getting round Napster's filtering efforts? Quite easily. The song-swapping service is asking copyright holders to verify they own rights to songs before it puts a simple block on the name of the track. So, look up that Janet Jackson song as \"All For You\" and nothing will appear. But search for \"Janet Jackson\" and you'll find hundreds of available files, including lots called \"all4you\" or \"alll4u\", or some similar arrangement of characters which makes it quite clear to the human searcher what the file contains, but which foxes Napster's filter.</p> <p>As you might have guessed by now, Napster has hardly pulled out the technological stops to stop the illegal file-swaps. As Cary Sherman of the Recording Industry Association of America pointed out yesterday, \"There are so many things that they aren't doing right now that they could be doing tomorrow.\" Like applying blocks by artist name, rather than song title.</p> <p>\"Maybe the system needs to be shut down,\" said Judge Patel in conclusion, but that is essentially already what she is demanding Napster do to itself by blocking all those copyright songs. Of course this turkey is reluctant to vote for Christmas and surely now it is only a question of how - rather than if - Napster as we know it now will simply have the plug pulled on it.</p> <p>Will that be the end of Napster, or online music piracy? The answer to both questions is most likely: no. Napster's core song-swapping technology has done a great favour for the neanderthal record companies by showing what would work best for them online. Napster has already signed a deal with Bertellsman, the German media conglomerate, to launch a legal version of its service to paying customers. If it works as well as Napster does now (even under injunction), it will be very successful indeed, as the otherwise law-abiding majority of Napster users migrate to doing the honest thing, and others , put off by the moral conundrums of using Napster today, sign up too.</p> <p>And what of online music piracy? The record companies would be stupid to think that, by stopping Napster, they will stop the music pirates.

      "bodyText": "\"This is disgraceful,\" fumed San Francisco judge Marilyn Hall Patel yesterday, when faced with evidence of how business continues as usual on the court injunction-bound Napster song-swapping service. Business, of course, is not quite the word to use, given that Napster makes no money and that most of the songs swapped through it are pirated duplicates of copyright music. But, regardless, Napster's popularity remains strong and filtering procedures put in place are failing to put the brakes on the violations the website makes so simple to carry out. Logging on this morning, it was easy to find any tune from this week's chart. Even brand-new singles from well-known artists were there: the soundtrack album for Bridget Jones' Diary is all there for free, as is Janet Jackson's new single, All for You. The latter is on rotation at MTV and is pretty popular on Napster as well; I quickly found dozens of fellow users ready to share the file. How are they getting round Napster's filtering efforts? Quite easily. The song-swapping service is asking copyright holders to verify they own rights to songs before it puts a simple block on the name of the track. So, look up that Janet Jackson song as \"All For You\" and nothing will appear. But search for \"Janet Jackson\" and you'll find hundreds of available files, including lots called \"all4you\" or \"alll4u\", or some similar arrangement of characters which makes it quite clear to the human searcher what the file contains, but which foxes Napster's filter. As you might have guessed by now, Napster has hardly pulled out the technological stops to stop the illegal file-swaps. As Cary Sherman of the Recording Industry Association of America pointed out yesterday, \"There are so many things that they aren't doing right now that they could be doing tomorrow.\" Like applying blocks by artist name, rather than song title. \"Maybe the system needs to be shut down,\" said Judge Patel in conclusion, but that is essentially already what she is demanding Napster do to itself by blocking all those copyright songs. Of course this turkey is reluctant to vote for Christmas and surely now it is only a question of how - rather than if - Napster as we know it now will simply have the plug pulled on it. Will that be the end of Napster, or online music piracy? The answer to both questions is most likely: no. Napster's core song-swapping technology has done a great favour for the neanderthal record companies by showing what would work best for them online. Napster has already signed a deal with Bertellsman, the German media conglomerate, to launch a legal version of its service to paying customers. If it works as well as Napster does now (even under injunction), it will be very successful indeed, as the otherwise law-abiding majority of Napster users migrate to doing the honest thing, and others , put off by the moral conundrums of using Napster today, sign up too. And what of online music piracy? The record companies would be stupid to think that, by stopping Napster, they will stop the music pirates. There are several alternatives to Napster (none, it must be said, with quite the same functionality or ease of use - so far) and we can comfortably predict that songs will continue to be copied and distributed illegally just like, for instance, expensive bits of software like Word and PhotoShop are in various \"warez\" newsgroups. But the pirates will eventually return to being, once again, the minority, because most people accept that paying to be allowed to listen to music is a fair way of rewarding artists for their creativity. The only doubt is over exactly when the record companies will get round to allowing us to pay for digital music. Many online music fans will be wishing they would hurry things up by ending the pointless legal wranglings with Napster, and working instead to develop an effective, legal song swapping system.

      "bodyText": "Kelvin MacKenzie's observation that Janet Street-Porter's resignation from the Independent on Sunday was \"a great day for bus tickets\" is oddly inappropriate. When Ms Street-Porter joined the IoS, many doubted the woman famed for wearing wacky spectacles and dating \"yoof\" TV presenters was up to editing a broadsheet Sunday newspaper. Whether she took the former Sun editor's original jibe that she \"couldn't edit a bus ticket\" to heart is unclear. But an article last week by the former Observer editor Donald Trelford suggested that, if anything, Ms Street-Porter's crime was that she had not been wacky enough. Media watchers have speculated that Mr Trelford - a former boss of Independent editor-in-chief Simon Kelner - is likely to have had an inside track on Mr Kelner's motives. In the article, he claimed Ms Street-Porter had failed to provide enough \"fireworks\" in the paper. The IoS has struggled to keep up with its rival the Observer since Ms Street-Porter took the helm in 1999. If anything, Mr Trelford said, her sober, relatively gaffe-free reign is likely to have been a disappointment to those who wanted some of Ms Street-Porter's colour to seep into the pages. Mr Kelner is currently defending Ms Street-Porter's record at the paper, claiming she \"proved [her detractors] wrong\". Certainly, she didn't give any of her critics the chance to show she was incompetent. When she took over, Ms Street-Porter said she wanted to make the paper \"a polymorphous journal\" for a multicultural society. But beyond a launching the Reality magazine and executing a low-key redesign, she has not made radical changes to the IoS. The paper's circulation has not changed significantly since 1999. In spite of a general slump in Sunday newspaper sales, reader numbers at the IoS have risen slightly from 242,238 when Ms Street-Porter joined to 251,124 in February this year. But it is widely accepted that the growing use of bulk sales and price cutting hides a decline in sales. Ms Street-Porter's image is a strident one: she is known for her role in the creation of \"yoof\" TV show Network Seven, her tempestuous directorship of Live TV and her dalliance with former TV presenter Normski. But her technicolour personality has obscured some quieter and more considered interests, such as her interest in rambling, which manifested itself in a book and the TV series Coast to Coast. More recently, her interest in the countryside has drawn her to focus on the foot and mouth crisis and publish impassioned editorials on the plight of British farmers.

      "bodyText": "A cross-party committee of MPs yesterday launched an unprecedented campaign to persuade Coca-Cola's customers around the world to strongarm the global soft drinks company into backing the Kyoto protocols against global warming. They appealed to young customers to bombard both Coca-Cola - initially in Britain - and the White House directly. \"We turn not to the foes of President Bush, but to his friends, those whose wise counsels have influenced the president, those whose wide pockets have sustained him,\" said the former consumer affairs minister, Nigel Griffiths. The MPs are targeting Coca-Cola because it gave nearly $1m to George Bush's campaign for the presidency last year. They are also incensed that Coca-Cola has borrowed the environmentalists' slogan \"think globally, act locally\" but think it can be persuaded to act upon it. Though they are in touch with MEPs at Strasbourg, with French greens and with Joe Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate in November, the MPs believe that Coca-Cola's marketing image as a drink for young people makes it vulnerable to pressure from precisely that group of consumers. Tory backbenchers such as Peter Bottomley and Liberal Democrat Tom Brake have joined 30 Labour MPs in launching what they hope will turn into the global email campaign, directed at Coca-Cola's \"ear, not its wallet\" .

In its desire to appear in charge, it is now in danger of splitting its cosy alliance with leaders of the NFU by openly blaming farmers for illegal movements of livestock. The farm leaders respond by blaming ministers for not being in control of the situation, which is worsening in areas like Gloucestershire. Meanwhile, the NFU is itself starting to split with the grassroots beginning to blame the leadership for not consulting them over vaccination or giving them the full facts, and large farmers are calling for vaccination for the first time. At the same time, No 10 has infuriated us by taking over news management of the crisis and whipping away open government by refusing to allow briefings or question and answer sessions with the chief vet and ministers. Local councils are being slapped on wrist for not opening footpaths and are in turn being accused of insensitivity by some rural communities, Michael Meacher's rural task force is accused of doing nothing, and the treasury of being penny pinching and mean for charging interest on the tax breaks it has agreed to. The hoteliers are blaming everyone, the vets are split between those who think vaccination is a good idea and those who don't and the public does not know what is open or closed, where they can go, when it will end or what they should do. No one in authority has a real overview of what is happening any more because the government is censoring the facts, and admits it cannot be certain any more of its figures.

The drop below the \"magic million\" mark, which was trumpeted by the government in February, had been expected to provide a springboard for a May 3 election. Ministers will now be hoping that the 3,000 jobs under threat at Motorola's Bathgate plant and the difficulties faced by the Cammel Laird shipyard do not send the figure bouncing back above six figures before a June poll. The ONS figures published today show that the number of benefit claimants dropped by 5,500 in March to 995,200 and that average earnings increased by 5% in February, up 0.5% from the previous month. However, the other measure of joblessness - the International Labour Organisation count which Labour used as a true measure of unemployment whilst in opposition - placed the number of those without work at 1.53m, even with a drop of 42,000 between December and February. The employment minister, Tessa Jowell, welcomed the fall, but warned that foot and mouth may have an effect on future job figures.

M&amp;S has never been a big sponsorship player, whereas other brands reap valuable brand awareness and acceptance from sponsoring TV shows or sports and music events. Cadbury's sponsorship of Coronation Street, Carling's title sponsorship of the Premier League and Virgin's annual music festival are examples of the trend for brands to create a buzz among their target audience through sponsorship rather than traditional TV advertising. Last year, M&amp;S sponsored the British Olympic and Paralympic teams by providing the athletes' uniforms for the opening ceremonies. The retailer also sponsored the New Generation award for young designers at London Fashion Week. But sponsorship is to take a leading role in turning around M&amp;S's brand as part of a shakeup of the company's marketing strategy. \"We are definitely looking to increase our use of sponsorship,\" said an M&amp;S spokeswoman. \"We have always done bits and pieces but now we are looking at the big things that can make a difference.

They propose to increase rents on over 1,000 of the homes to full market rents of up to \u00a31,500 per month. The remaining 500 homes will be reserved for key workers but rents on these homes are still likely to rise. </p> <p>In particular, the Octavia Hill estate in Walworth, which was the largest and most complete realisation of her vision, will be completely commercialised with no homes allocated for key workers, and all future vacancies being let out at full market rents. </p> <p>The land on which these estates are built has been Church land for centuries, and by the 19th century most were leased out to landlords who were not particularly ethical or scrupulous in their dealings with their poorer tenants.

Highly influential in this debate was Octavia Hill. Heavily influenced by Christian Socialists, but with good political connections and wealthy friends, she had become a leading social campaigner in London for improved accommodation for the poor, open spaces, and improvements in public health and quality of life.</p> <p>She had already formed a number of small housing societies for the poor with financial backing from her contacts.

A 1904 report on the estates \"recognised the moral obligation imposed upon the commissioners by the possession of very large areas of land that the claims of the working classes to be provided with healthy homes in places convenient for their occupations and at reasonable rents should not be neglected\".</p> <p>The report acknowledged that this task could not be trusted to private landlords so the commissioners asked Ms Hill herself to redevelop and manage these estates.</p> <p>The 1904 report said that rents on the homes would be \"fixed with a view to their being within the means of the class of persons for whom the accommodation is designed\".</p> <p>Since the early 1900's these estates have been managed with that vision, and strong local communities of people on low incomes have developed in areas of considerable poverty.

In particular, MPs have latched onto a pledge by EU leaders to deploy the new force only \"where Nato as a whole is not engaged\". <p><b>Why should Nato be worried about the new force? </b><br>Nato as a whole isn't, but the Americans are. Washington fears that its influence over European strategic defence thinking may be diluted. The US is particularly concerned about French insistence that the EU should have an independent military planning apparatus, which could draw on military resources presently at the disposal of Nato. </p> <p><b>Is the new Commons report a Tory plot to subvert an EU initiative?</b><br> No. The committee is dominated by Labour members. </p> <p><b>Is the EU force really such a radical idea?</b><br> It's as old as the EU itself. After the European Community became a Union thanks to the Maastricht Treaty of December 1991, member states agreed to adopt a common foreign and security policy. It has been an uphill struggle: the formal decision to create a rapid reaction force (ERRF) was taken only in December 1999. </p> <p><b>Is it the start of a European army?</b><br>Yes, say the Eurosceptics. No, say the people actually doing it. Tory critics seem especially worried about the notion that troops in the force will be obliged to wear a common EU badge on their uniforms. Supporters of the ERRF point out that it is not a standing army, and that national governments will retain the power to decide if their forces will take part in any particular operation. </p> <p><b>Who will be in command?</b><br>The first director general of the small central headquarters will be a German, Lieutenant General Rainer Schuwirth. His deputy will be a Briton, Major-General Graham Messervy-Whiting. </p> <p><b>How big will it be?</b><br>Up to 60,000 soldiers will be contributed by member states, to come together for specific operations and for training. The biggest contingent will be from Germany, which has promised to make at least 13,500 troops available. France is offering around 12,000; Italy and Spain 6000; the Netherlands 5000; Greece 3000; Finland and Sweden 2000 each; Belgium, Ireland and Portugal 1000 each, and Luxembourg 500. </p> <p><b>And Britain?</b><br>The government is likely to offer up to 12,500 troops, plus a sizeable chunk of the Royal Navy and up to 72 combat aircraft. Some military analysts believe that a full scale commitment to the force would involve 24,000 personnel from all three services. </p> <p><b>What will the ERRF actually do?</b><br>It will have three main roles. One is to give assistance to civilians threatened by a crisis outside the EU. Another is to respond to UN calls for peacekeeping forces. The third is to intervene to separate warring factions. In all three scenarios the EU would deploy its forces only if Nato decides not to get involved. </p> <p><b>But isn't this precisely Nato's job?</b><br>Critics are worried that the creation of the ERRF will undermine Nato, discourage American involvement in European peacekeeping operations and that endanger Britain's special relationship with Washington. Supporters of the new force say exactly the same. That, they say, is why it's a good thing. </p> <p><b>And what is Washington saying? </b><br>There have been rumbles of unease in the State Department and in the military establishment, which, for more than half a century, has ruled the Nato roost. But there is also a widespread view in America that Europe should do more - and pay more - towards its own defence interests. The deployment of US forces in the Balkans is especially unpopular. </p> <p><b>Why should Europe be paying attention to Washington?</b><br>Nato is a huge element in European defences and America is a huge element in Nato. None but the most the most fervent Europhiles would want to drive the US out. But many think that Europe should indeed be forging a defence strategy based more on common European interests, and less on the transatlantic connection. </p> <p><b>Why the new urgency?</b><br>During the US presidential campaign, George Bush revived echoes of isolationism by suggesting that, if elected, he would make a priority of removing American forces from the Balkans. Though he has trimmed his position and reassured America's Nato allies that there will be no hasty decision, European defence planners have taken the hint.</p> <p> <b>Useful links:</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/\" target=\"_NEW\">NATO</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.europa.eu.int/\" target=\"_NEW\">The European Union</a> <br> <a href=\"http://ue.eu.int/pesc/pres.asp?lang=en\" target=\"_NEW\">The EU's common foreign and security policy</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eu/story/0,7369,400212,00.html\">Robin Cook's vision of the ERRF</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?ac=003278038040201&amp;rtmo=Lxybh3Gd&amp;atmo=FFFF  FFFX&amp;pg=/et/99/12/11/wsum311.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Helsinki agreement of December 1999</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.army.mod.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">British Army</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Royal Navy</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafhome.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Royal Air Force</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.georgebush.com/issues/foreignpolicy.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> George W.

Supporters of the ERRF point out that it is not a standing army, and that national governments will retain the power to decide if their forces will take part in any particular operation. Who will be in command? The first director general of the small central headquarters will be a German, Lieutenant General Rainer Schuwirth. His deputy will be a Briton, Major-General Graham Messervy-Whiting. How big will it be? Up to 60,000 soldiers will be contributed by member states, to come together for specific operations and for training. The biggest contingent will be from Germany, which has promised to make at least 13,500 troops available. France is offering around 12,000; Italy and Spain 6000; the Netherlands 5000; Greece 3000; Finland and Sweden 2000 each; Belgium, Ireland and Portugal 1000 each, and Luxembourg 500. And Britain? The government is likely to offer up to 12,500 troops, plus a sizeable chunk of the Royal Navy and up to 72 combat aircraft. Some military analysts believe that a full scale commitment to the force would involve 24,000 personnel from all three services. What will the ERRF actually do? It will have three main roles. One is to give assistance to civilians threatened by a crisis outside the EU. Another is to respond to UN calls for peacekeeping forces. The third is to intervene to separate warring factions. In all three scenarios the EU would deploy its forces only if Nato decides not to get involved. But isn't this precisely Nato's job? Critics are worried that the creation of the ERRF will undermine Nato, discourage American involvement in European peacekeeping operations and that endanger Britain's special relationship with Washington. Supporters of the new force say exactly the same. That, they say, is why it's a good thing. And what is Washington saying? There have been rumbles of unease in the State Department and in the military establishment, which, for more than half a century, has ruled the Nato roost. But there is also a widespread view in America that Europe should do more - and pay more - towards its own defence interests. The deployment of US forces in the Balkans is especially unpopular. Why should Europe be paying attention to Washington? Nato is a huge element in European defences and America is a huge element in Nato. None but the most the most fervent Europhiles would want to drive the US out. But many think that Europe should indeed be forging a defence strategy based more on common European interests, and less on the transatlantic connection. Why the new urgency? During the US presidential campaign, George Bush revived echoes of isolationism by suggesting that, if elected, he would make a priority of removing American forces from the Balkans. Though he has trimmed his position and reassured America's Nato allies that there will be no hasty decision, European defence planners have taken the hint.

The deal has enraged rival papers including the Daily Mail and the Mirror and could take the mid-market tabloid circulation wars to a new height. One baffled Guardian reader who contacted MediaGuardian.co.uk was flabbergasted when the cashier at the WH Smith till asked her if she would like a free copy of the paper. \"When I said okay, she charged me 35p for it and then gave me my money back. However on the receipt it was still listed as a sale,\" she said. In a week-long promotion starting on April 2, WH Smith is believed to have spent \u00a310,000 a day on copies of the Daily Express to give away as a promotion free with any magazine purchase. In an unprecedented promotion the paper was given away free with any magazine purchased. And because this falls within ABC rules, the sale will be recorded as a \"bulk sale\" figure and will be counted as part of the Express's overall sales. Martyn Gates, the ABC's director of newspapers and consumer press, said that technically the promotion was \"quite legitimate\". But he added that the WH Smith promotion would not be separated from other bulk newspaper sales in the published figures. This means newspapers, consumers, advertisers and agencies will have no way to tell how the promotion has boosted the paper's circulation. \"I think that the use of bulk sales will be more and more debated,\" said Mr Gates when asked whether the ABC thought this was a legitimate promotional tactic. \"If you want to start splitting bulk sales out so there's more transparency then that is certainly something we can do,\" he said. \"This promotion would certainly move the debate in that direction.\" The inclusion of \"bulk\" sales - sales to hotels, airlines and other companies - in a newspaper's circulation figure has proved controversial as critics claim they distort perceptions of the market. Sales of the Express fell below 1m in January for the first time since 1924. Mr Desmond is desperate to boost circulation to take on the Daily Mail, which had an audited circulation of 2,394,889 in March. WH Smith is understood to have mooted the deal in a bid to boost their end of month magazine sales. Mike Newman, director of circulation at Associated Newspapers, denied that Associated was annoyed that WH Smith had approached Express Newspapers first. \"These figures will be included in the bulks, but they will be short-term rises,\" he said. Asked whether Associated would be interested in running a similar promotion, he said \"the ball is definitely in Smith's court.\" WH Smith refused to comment.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Robert Rodriguez</strong>, director of From Dusk Till Dawn and the smash hit Spy Kids, talks to  Will Hodgkinson</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Discovering that Robert Rodriguez, director of such postmodern blood'n'guts classics as El Mariachi, Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn, has made a children's movie is rather like finding out that Sam Peckinpah once had an option on the sequel to Bambi. It just doesn't seem right. </p> <p>But after seeing Spy Kids, Rodriguez's Willy Wonka-meets-James Bond tale of the children of retired spies who follow in their parents' footsteps and end up saving their lives, it begins to make sense. All Rodriguez's films, even the ones where everyone dies at the end, suggest he's the sort of person who checks for secret doorways whenever entering someone's house. Spy Kids, now topping the charts in America and about to open in the UK, is simply that mind revealed in perfect clarity. </p> <p>\"This is the kind of movie I used to make before Mariachi for 10 years, from the age of 12,\" he explains. \"I'm from a family of 10 kids, and I always used to put my siblings in my movies because they were there. And the films would always win contests - people loved the combination of little kids doing action and comedy. The only reason Mariachi was an action movie was that the Spanish video market, which it was originally made for, wanted action. Even then we made it goofy - it was about a guitar guy, not an ex-cop or a road warrior type. If you watch this and then see the other movies, you can see how similar they are in tone, in the way that nobody could take them seriously.\" </p> <p>Rodriguez's career sounds a lot more fun than that of most Hollywood directors. Having rented his body for medical tests to fund El Mariachi while still at film school, Rodriguez shot the film in a Mexican border town with no crew and no professional actors and relied on a lot of favours to make it happen. </p> <p>For the opening sequence, set in a jail, the warders took all the prisoners outside so he could shoot inside the cells. (One prisoner made the most of the situation and bolted.) He says the whole thing cost $7,000. The Spanish never bought the film, but Columbia Studios did, and since then Rodriguez has resisted the lure of the big-budget movie to make films that cost next to nothing, on condition he has complete artistic freedom - almost unheard of in Hollywood. </p> <p>\"Even with Spy Kids, the same approach I took with Mariachi applies,\" says Rodriguez. \"Inspector Gadget cost $90m, 102 Dalmatians was $85m, and this was $36m, with more than a third of the movie being effects. The first person you usually hire on an effects-based movie like this is an effects supervisor. I didn't - I wanted to figure out how to do it myself. It's just a case of being more creative: it looks like an expensive movie, but it's all magic tricks. I edited it in my garage, and it had to feel personal or it would be like one of those studio-made kids' movies that are just awful. It's a big home movie, basically.\" </p> <p>Rodriguez is still determined to keep it personal. On his second movie, 1994's Roadracers, he got a crew, and didn't like it. \"I thought, why are all these guys standing around doing nothing? I'd rather have the money to buy more time and get rid of them. And even though I produce my pictures now, there's still too many people. But now the studio just gives me the money and I go make the movie, and I use so little of their money they don't gripe.\" </p> <p>When El Mariachi came out in 1992, Rodriguez was asked how on earth he could make an action film for $7,000; now all he's asked is how he could make Spy Kids for $36m. It all comes down, he says, to growing up in the kind of family where every cent was accounted for. \"We always figured out how to get around spending money in our house - it was in our blood. Now I can't even spend other people's money.\" </p> <p>When Columbia first signed up Rodriguez and gave him a $2,000 weekly allowance for a smart Hollywood hotel and expensive restaurants, he asked if he could sleep on his office floor, eat burgers and keep the money to put his brother through college. \"Film-makers screw themselves when they think they need to get as much money as they can,\" says Rodriguez. \"The studio starts changing things to make sure it gets its money back, the film-maker ends up compromising it so much that he hates it, and the audience thinks it sucks, so it's no good for anybody.\" </p> <p>Rodriguez has turned down a series of big-budget movies - X-Men, Superman Lives and Planet of the Apes - because \"they weren't going to be fun\", and gone back to his roots. El Mariachi was always intended as the first film in a series of three; Desperado was the second in 1995, but since then nothing has been heard from the music man. Finally he's coming back. \"We're making it - I was writing it in bed this morning. Antonio Banderas is in it, and it's kind of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of the Mariachi series, a big, sprawling movie called Once Upon a Time in Mexico. It's awesome. I can't wait.\" </p> <p>Even El Mariachi himself, Carlos Gallardo, is to return to star and direct in a film Rodriguez wrote for him. \"It's called Curandero, and he's a Mexican witch doctor. It goes into the bowels of black magic in Mexico City. Anything goes there - it's so cool.\" </p> <p>All this from the mind of a big kid, who admits freely that the little boy in Spy Kids - nervous, physically awkward, lost in his own world - was based on himself at that age.

      "bodyText": "Discovering that Robert Rodriguez, director of such postmodern blood'n'guts classics as El Mariachi, Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn, has made a children's movie is rather like finding out that Sam Peckinpah once had an option on the sequel to Bambi. It just doesn't seem right. But after seeing Spy Kids, Rodriguez's Willy Wonka-meets-James Bond tale of the children of retired spies who follow in their parents' footsteps and end up saving their lives, it begins to make sense. All Rodriguez's films, even the ones where everyone dies at the end, suggest he's the sort of person who checks for secret doorways whenever entering someone's house. Spy Kids, now topping the charts in America and about to open in the UK, is simply that mind revealed in perfect clarity. \"This is the kind of movie I used to make before Mariachi for 10 years, from the age of 12,\" he explains. \"I'm from a family of 10 kids, and I always used to put my siblings in my movies because they were there. And the films would always win contests - people loved the combination of little kids doing action and comedy. The only reason Mariachi was an action movie was that the Spanish video market, which it was originally made for, wanted action. Even then we made it goofy - it was about a guitar guy, not an ex-cop or a road warrior type. If you watch this and then see the other movies, you can see how similar they are in tone, in the way that nobody could take them seriously.\" Rodriguez's career sounds a lot more fun than that of most Hollywood directors. Having rented his body for medical tests to fund El Mariachi while still at film school, Rodriguez shot the film in a Mexican border town with no crew and no professional actors and relied on a lot of favours to make it happen. For the opening sequence, set in a jail, the warders took all the prisoners outside so he could shoot inside the cells. (One prisoner made the most of the situation and bolted.) He says the whole thing cost $7,000. The Spanish never bought the film, but Columbia Studios did, and since then Rodriguez has resisted the lure of the big-budget movie to make films that cost next to nothing, on condition he has complete artistic freedom - almost unheard of in Hollywood. \"Even with Spy Kids, the same approach I took with Mariachi applies,\" says Rodriguez. \"Inspector Gadget cost $90m, 102 Dalmatians was $85m, and this was $36m, with more than a third of the movie being effects. The first person you usually hire on an effects-based movie like this is an effects supervisor. I didn't - I wanted to figure out how to do it myself. It's just a case of being more creative: it looks like an expensive movie, but it's all magic tricks. I edited it in my garage, and it had to feel personal or it would be like one of those studio-made kids' movies that are just awful. It's a big home movie, basically.\" Rodriguez is still determined to keep it personal. On his second movie, 1994's Roadracers, he got a crew, and didn't like it. \"I thought, why are all these guys standing around doing nothing? I'd rather have the money to buy more time and get rid of them. And even though I produce my pictures now, there's still too many people. But now the studio just gives me the money and I go make the movie, and I use so little of their money they don't gripe.\" When El Mariachi came out in 1992, Rodriguez was asked how on earth he could make an action film for $7,000; now all he's asked is how he could make Spy Kids for $36m. It all comes down, he says, to growing up in the kind of family where every cent was accounted for. \"We always figured out how to get around spending money in our house - it was in our blood. Now I can't even spend other people's money.\" When Columbia first signed up Rodriguez and gave him a $2,000 weekly allowance for a smart Hollywood hotel and expensive restaurants, he asked if he could sleep on his office floor, eat burgers and keep the money to put his brother through college. \"Film-makers screw themselves when they think they need to get as much money as they can,\" says Rodriguez. \"The studio starts changing things to make sure it gets its money back, the film-maker ends up compromising it so much that he hates it, and the audience thinks it sucks, so it's no good for anybody.\" Rodriguez has turned down a series of big-budget movies - X-Men, Superman Lives and Planet of the Apes - because \"they weren't going to be fun\", and gone back to his roots. El Mariachi was always intended as the first film in a series of three; Desperado was the second in 1995, but since then nothing has been heard from the music man. Finally he's coming back. \"We're making it - I was writing it in bed this morning. Antonio Banderas is in it, and it's kind of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of the Mariachi series, a big, sprawling movie called Once Upon a Time in Mexico. It's awesome. I can't wait.\" Even El Mariachi himself, Carlos Gallardo, is to return to star and direct in a film Rodriguez wrote for him. \"It's called Curandero, and he's a Mexican witch doctor. It goes into the bowels of black magic in Mexico City. Anything goes there - it's so cool.\" All this from the mind of a big kid, who admits freely that the little boy in Spy Kids - nervous, physically awkward, lost in his own world - was based on himself at that age. Rodriguez is living proof that never growing up can have its advantages. \"I'm probably the only guy who really enjoys being in the business, because I get to make my own rules. I cut my own trailers, make my own ads, live and work at home in Texas... It's ridiculous. What did I do in a past life?\" \u0095 Spy Kids is released on Friday.",

The spokesman added farmers must observe the \"tightest possible precautions\".</p> <p>The row over who is to blame for the epidemic erupted after a leaked report, drafted for Mr Blair, showed farmers had taken part in hundreds of unlicensed livestock movements since the start of the outbreak.</p> <p>A few desperate farmers were even suspected of deliberately infecting their flocks with foot and mouth disease in order to claim compensation. Trading standards officers have investigated 309 cases of alleged illegal livestock movements since the outbreak began, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>West Mercia police also announced an inquiry into alleged fraudulent compensation claims involving unauthorised animal movements. The NFU south west regional director, Anthony Gibson, said there was no justification for blaming farmers and accused ministers of trying to \"take the heat off themselves\".</p> <p>He said: \"They have been making these insinuations almost from the start of the epidemic, suggesting it was farmers themselves who were responsible for spreading the disease rather than their own incompetence for not bringing it under control.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair was likely to face a similar message during his visit today, which comes as ministers launch an action plan to boost employment in stricken areas.</p> <p>With London's royal parks reopening to pedestrians and the culture secretary, Chris Smith, meeting tourism chiefs in London, Mr Blair was expected to say there were bright spots.</p> <p>But the Tory leader, William Hague, warned thousands of tourist firms face bankruptcy after the Easter break because of government inaction and he argued interest-free loans need to be made available now.</p> <p>There were 41 new outbreaks recorded across Britain yesterday bringing the total number throughout the UK to 1,205.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the organisers of Scotland's premier agricultural event, the Royal Highland Show which attracted 150,000 people last year, were today expected to decide whether or not it will go ahead as planned this year.</p> <p>Elsewhere, firefighters in County Durham who were called to a blazing municipal skip found it contained lambs which had been deliberately set alight, a brigade spokesman said today.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

The prime minister was expected to meet farmers' leaders, tourism bosses, vets and the army in Devon this afternoon to see how the fight against the disease had progressed since his visit last month. Mr Blair's visit comes as David Hill, chairman of the National Farmers' Union (NFU) in Devon, said he would rather people broke the law by moving animals than let them suffer and die in confinement. Mr Hill told this morning's edition of BBC Radio 4's Farming Today that he \"could not condemn\" farmers who moved animals illegally rather than see them dying in appalling conditions. \"I would rather they did that than let animals suffer,\" he said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) said today that while 50,000 licenses for movement had been granted and that there was sensitivity to welfare issues, farmers must desist from illegal moves. The spokesman added farmers must observe the \"tightest possible precautions\". The row over who is to blame for the epidemic erupted after a leaked report, drafted for Mr Blair, showed farmers had taken part in hundreds of unlicensed livestock movements since the start of the outbreak. A few desperate farmers were even suspected of deliberately infecting their flocks with foot and mouth disease in order to claim compensation. Trading standards officers have investigated 309 cases of alleged illegal livestock movements since the outbreak began, it emerged yesterday. West Mercia police also announced an inquiry into alleged fraudulent compensation claims involving unauthorised animal movements. The NFU south west regional director, Anthony Gibson, said there was no justification for blaming farmers and accused ministers of trying to \"take the heat off themselves\". He said: \"They have been making these insinuations almost from the start of the epidemic, suggesting it was farmers themselves who were responsible for spreading the disease rather than their own incompetence for not bringing it under control.\" Mr Blair was likely to face a similar message during his visit today, which comes as ministers launch an action plan to boost employment in stricken areas. With London's royal parks reopening to pedestrians and the culture secretary, Chris Smith, meeting tourism chiefs in London, Mr Blair was expected to say there were bright spots. But the Tory leader, William Hague, warned thousands of tourist firms face bankruptcy after the Easter break because of government inaction and he argued interest-free loans need to be made available now. There were 41 new outbreaks recorded across Britain yesterday bringing the total number throughout the UK to 1,205. Meanwhile, the organisers of Scotland's premier agricultural event, the Royal Highland Show which attracted 150,000 people last year, were today expected to decide whether or not it will go ahead as planned this year. Elsewhere, firefighters in County Durham who were called to a blazing municipal skip found it contained lambs which had been deliberately set alight, a brigade spokesman said today.

But is Howard Stern likely to change his ways? That would be a real shock.

      "body": "<p><strong> Lack of holiday affinity</strong><br> </p> <p>The good news is that the office of fair trading (OFT) has announced that it is prepared to start legal action against four major tour operators to force them to disclose details of their cancellation charges. (Currently travellers who change their holiday plans are charged the full price of their package regardless of whether the firm manages to sell it on.) </p> <p>Sadly, the OFT's wrath comes too late to help Molly Bordill, a widowed pensioner from Stockport. She was telephoned unexpectedly by a company called Affinity Holidays which offered her a 70% discount on a trip to Florida. Alas, when asked for her credit card details she relayed them (oh readers, when will you learn!) before being bombarded with possible holiday packages. </p> <p>Thrice, she says, she made clear that she had changed her mind and did not want the deal. Each time she was transferred to another salesman who renewed the hard sell and ignored her protests. As soon as the call was finished she rang her credit card company to express her concerns. Lo and behold, she discovered that in the intervening minutes her account had been debited to the tune of \u00a3340, a sum she insists was never mentioned on the phone. Two letters to Affinity have gone unanswered. </p> <p>\u0095 Affinity Holidays turns out to be based in Florida and calls to its customer services 0800 number connect to the US. Readers with long memories might think that all this sounds vaguely familiar. Exactly a year ago we reported on the plight of three householders cold-called by a Florida-based holiday firm, Bahamas and Florida Direct. They were told they could not receive a brochure about the packages described to them unless they paid there and then for a holiday. Refunds were promised if the brochure did not appeal, but these proved hard to come by. Trading standards has confirmed that it received dozens of complaints about the company. </p> <p>Could Affinity be our old friends under a new guise? \"We used to be Florida Direct,\" says the American who answers the 0800 line, \"but the UK firm of the same name who managed our reservations were unable to handle all the bookings, so things went wrong and we changed our name.\" Funny that. Last year Hounslow trading standards told us that the problems lay with the American firm, not its British associate. </p> <p>Meanwhile, we called MasterCard at Natwest to find out why Bordill was not offered a dispute form under the Consumer Credit Act since she had explained that the transaction was against her wishes. NatWest argues that it has no liability because American telesales firms are not subject to British law and are therefore not obliged to offer seven-day cooling off periods. Nonetheless, it has decided that it will refund Bordill as a goodwill gesture and mentions that it has received 10 complaints about Affinity. </p> <p>Now here is an odd thing: when NatWest calls Affinity in an attempt to recoup its goodwill gesture it is told there is no chance of a refund, but when Consumer rings Affinity the same afternoon we are told that Bordill's package has been cancelled - coincidentally around the same time that we first faxed the firm. \"We make it a rule to record all our telesales conversations and in this case the recording went wrong so we've no proof of what transpired,\" says a spokeswoman. \"A refund will be sent within 30 days.\"</p> <p><strong> Dial P for poor service</strong><br> </p> <p> How to fill your blank diary in four easy steps. Ring Dial-a-Phone and take up their offer of a free camera with every mobile phone sold. Give your address. Correct address when repeated wrongly due to misheard postcode. Pay extra for a Saturday delivery. Wait in. Try for three days to phone Dial-a-Phone to find out what happened to delivery. </p> <p>Discover package was sent to that wrong address. Take day off work for new delivery. Take call confirming correct address. Ring Dial-a-Phone to find out why second delivery failed and learn that it was sent to the same wrong address. Agree new delivery date and take second day off work. Ring Dial-a-Phone to discover whereabouts of delivery man. </p> <p>Given new date of December 27. Explain that purchase was intended as Christmas present. Cancel order. Write letter of complaint. Wait in vain for reply. Write to Consumer.

      "bodyText": "Lack of holiday affinity The good news is that the office of fair trading (OFT) has announced that it is prepared to start legal action against four major tour operators to force them to disclose details of their cancellation charges. (Currently travellers who change their holiday plans are charged the full price of their package regardless of whether the firm manages to sell it on.) Sadly, the OFT's wrath comes too late to help Molly Bordill, a widowed pensioner from Stockport. She was telephoned unexpectedly by a company called Affinity Holidays which offered her a 70% discount on a trip to Florida. Alas, when asked for her credit card details she relayed them (oh readers, when will you learn!) before being bombarded with possible holiday packages. Thrice, she says, she made clear that she had changed her mind and did not want the deal. Each time she was transferred to another salesman who renewed the hard sell and ignored her protests. As soon as the call was finished she rang her credit card company to express her concerns. Lo and behold, she discovered that in the intervening minutes her account had been debited to the tune of \u00a3340, a sum she insists was never mentioned on the phone. Two letters to Affinity have gone unanswered. \u0095 Affinity Holidays turns out to be based in Florida and calls to its customer services 0800 number connect to the US. Readers with long memories might think that all this sounds vaguely familiar. Exactly a year ago we reported on the plight of three householders cold-called by a Florida-based holiday firm, Bahamas and Florida Direct. They were told they could not receive a brochure about the packages described to them unless they paid there and then for a holiday. Refunds were promised if the brochure did not appeal, but these proved hard to come by. Trading standards has confirmed that it received dozens of complaints about the company. Could Affinity be our old friends under a new guise? \"We used to be Florida Direct,\" says the American who answers the 0800 line, \"but the UK firm of the same name who managed our reservations were unable to handle all the bookings, so things went wrong and we changed our name.\" Funny that. Last year Hounslow trading standards told us that the problems lay with the American firm, not its British associate. Meanwhile, we called MasterCard at Natwest to find out why Bordill was not offered a dispute form under the Consumer Credit Act since she had explained that the transaction was against her wishes. NatWest argues that it has no liability because American telesales firms are not subject to British law and are therefore not obliged to offer seven-day cooling off periods. Nonetheless, it has decided that it will refund Bordill as a goodwill gesture and mentions that it has received 10 complaints about Affinity. Now here is an odd thing: when NatWest calls Affinity in an attempt to recoup its goodwill gesture it is told there is no chance of a refund, but when Consumer rings Affinity the same afternoon we are told that Bordill's package has been cancelled - coincidentally around the same time that we first faxed the firm. \"We make it a rule to record all our telesales conversations and in this case the recording went wrong so we've no proof of what transpired,\" says a spokeswoman. \"A refund will be sent within 30 days.\" Dial P for poor service How to fill your blank diary in four easy steps. Ring Dial-a-Phone and take up their offer of a free camera with every mobile phone sold. Give your address. Correct address when repeated wrongly due to misheard postcode. Pay extra for a Saturday delivery. Wait in. Try for three days to phone Dial-a-Phone to find out what happened to delivery. Discover package was sent to that wrong address. Take day off work for new delivery. Take call confirming correct address. Ring Dial-a-Phone to find out why second delivery failed and learn that it was sent to the same wrong address. Agree new delivery date and take second day off work. Ring Dial-a-Phone to discover whereabouts of delivery man. Given new date of December 27. Explain that purchase was intended as Christmas present. Cancel order. Write letter of complaint. Wait in vain for reply. Write to Consumer. This was the sum of Martin Stansfield's social life in December after responding to a Dial-a-Phone ad. \u0095 Dial-a-Phone admits that Stansfield has not \"received an acceptable level of service\", although it points out that it sent him a free camera before Consumer contacted it. Stansfield never received it though, so presumably that too went to the wrong address. A startled Stansfield has now received three free cameras from the company as an energetic gesture of contrition and a \u00a325 goodwill cheque made out to Comic Relief.

The regulator has ruled against the broadcaster's request to bring 5 News forward by half-an-hour to 5.30pm. Channel 5 wanted to move the bulletin to accommodate Home and Away, which it planned to screen at 6pm when it launches in July. The broadcaster snatched the long-running soap from ITV last year and is banking on the show to help lift its ratings. However, the ITC has agreed to allow Channel 5 to run a 60-minute news and chat show, 5 News and Talk, from 5.30pm during the run-up to the general election. \"We have some sympathy with the arguments that Channel 5 put forward in favour of moving its news out of peaktime,\" an ITC spokeswoman said. \"But the commission was unwilling to see the requirement for Channel 5 to provide 20 minutes of news and 10 minutes of current affairs in peaktime being reduced.\" Channel 5 had proposed to replace its existing commitment with 15 minutes of peaktime news in the form of hourly updates.

They closed at 341p, up 31p. </p> <p>Restructuring is expected to cost Marconi \u00a3400m but chief executive George Simpson said: \"In a volatile sector, Marconi continues to deliver good top-line growth.\" </p> <p>The 1,500 job losses in Britain are likely to most affect plants in Liverpool and Coventry. Wherever possible, redundancies are to be made on a voluntary basis. </p> <p>Marconi stressed a commitment to proceed with plans to establish new, hi-tech plants on greenfield sites at Ansty, near Coventry, Nottingham and Northampton. Last May it received a \u00a325m regional assistance grant for Ansty, where 2,200 jobs could be created. </p> <p>The MSF union reacted angrily to the job losses and complained about a lack of consultation. Union officials are meeting local shop stewards today, and industrial action has not been ruled out. </p> <p>\"Marconi seems hellbent on rewarding their staff with the sack despite the profits they have made. Our members learned of Marconi's plans in Sunday newspapers; this is no way to reward loyal staff,\" said Glyn Thomas of the MSF. </p> <p>But John Mayo, deputy chief executive, said his company had sent out repeated offers to union officials to attend meetings which had not been taken up. Marconi is expected to cut a third of the jobs at its Edge Lane plant in Liverpool, located on the boundary of the Kensington \"new deal\" area that has received \u00a362.4m of public money. </p> <p>Electronics group Siemens is to cut 2,000 jobs at its mobile telecoms division in Germany - 25% of the workforce. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.motorola.com/home/\">Motorola</a><br><a href=\"http://www.marconi.com/html/homepage/home.htm\">Marconi</a><br><a href=\"http://www.aeeu.org.uk/indexj.htm\">Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union</a></p>",

Meanwhile Marconi, the telecoms equipment maker, confirmed it would axe 1,500 jobs in Britain and a similar number abroad, but said it would meet profit forecasts despite the slowdown. Scottish executive officials said the future of Motorola's Bathgate factory \"appeared to be bleak\". Motorola has already set in train plans to cut 22,000 jobs worldwide, including 700 in Swindon, partly because of slack demand for mobile phones. Shares in Marconi rose as investors breathed a sigh of relief that it would make operating profits of around \u00a3800m for the year ending March 31. They closed at 341p, up 31p. Restructuring is expected to cost Marconi \u00a3400m but chief executive George Simpson said: \"In a volatile sector, Marconi continues to deliver good top-line growth.\" The 1,500 job losses in Britain are likely to most affect plants in Liverpool and Coventry. Wherever possible, redundancies are to be made on a voluntary basis. Marconi stressed a commitment to proceed with plans to establish new, hi-tech plants on greenfield sites at Ansty, near Coventry, Nottingham and Northampton. Last May it received a \u00a325m regional assistance grant for Ansty, where 2,200 jobs could be created. The MSF union reacted angrily to the job losses and complained about a lack of consultation. Union officials are meeting local shop stewards today, and industrial action has not been ruled out. \"Marconi seems hellbent on rewarding their staff with the sack despite the profits they have made. Our members learned of Marconi's plans in Sunday newspapers; this is no way to reward loyal staff,\" said Glyn Thomas of the MSF. But John Mayo, deputy chief executive, said his company had sent out repeated offers to union officials to attend meetings which had not been taken up. Marconi is expected to cut a third of the jobs at its Edge Lane plant in Liverpool, located on the boundary of the Kensington \"new deal\" area that has received \u00a362.4m of public money. Electronics group Siemens is to cut 2,000 jobs at its mobile telecoms division in Germany - 25% of the workforce. Useful links Motorola Marconi Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union",

      "bodyText": "The marble-lined great hall of the Stormont assembly, built in the 1930s as a symbol of Northern Ireland's place at the heart of the British empire, is an austere place at the best of times. So when plans were drawn up to display Easter lilies in the hall this weekend, there were hopes that Stormont's imposing surroundings would for once be brightened up. Well-intentioned members of the Stormont commission, who run the assembly building, reckoned without the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists. The lilies would have to go, Dr Paisley's supporters thundered, because the flowers are a symbol of the republican movement and will be used at Easter to commemorate dead IRA terrorists. The assembly was hastily recalled from its holiday recess yesterday for an emergency debate on the Easter lilies. The Paisleyite motion was passed, after winning the support of members of David Trimble's Ulster Unionist party, but was thrown out because it failed to win cross community support. Jim Wells, a DUP member of the assembly who forced the emergency debate, was infuriated: \"For the first time in the history of the United Kingdom a government building will be used to display symbols which honour IRA terrorists.\" Nationalists and the non-sectarian Alliance party complained that the Northern Ireland assembly had been made to look ridiculous after it was recalled to discuss such a triv ial matter. \"What sort of lunacy has descended on this assembly that we have to be urgently reconvened over a bowl of lilies?\" asked the Social and Democratic Labour party's member Alban Maginness. The idea of allowing two displays of Easter lilies to be placed at Stormont was originally proposed as a compromise by the Alliance party member Eileen Bell, who sits on the assembly commission. She hoped that allowing lilies into Stormont would go some way to satisfying Sinn Fein - which wanted a full scale republican floral display - without upsetting Unionists. Sinn Fein, whose members will commemorate the IRA's dead on Easter Sunday by pinning paper lilies to their lapels, had wanted the floral displays to be placed next to a notice marking the work of the national graves association which tends IRA graves. Lilies became a republican symbol after the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin when 15 republicans were executed by British forces. Ms Bell said: \"We hoped that our compromise to allow floral displays of lilies, without the references to graves, would be a first step to addressing the issue of symbols. How wrong we were.\" Ms Bell had assumed that her compromise would be uncontroversial because lilies will be on display in churches throughout Ireland this weekend, including some Protestant churches. David Ervine, the former loyalist paramilitary who now sits in the assembly for the Progressive Unionist Party, ridiculed the DUP for recalling the assembly over \"a bunch of flowers when parliament wasn't recalled last summer when people were dying on our streets\". But Mr Ervine, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 1974 after being stopped with a bomb in his car, horrified Sinn Fein members when he expressed regret that he had not killed more republicans. \"I have no particular desire to appreciate or venerate the re publican dead other than perhaps myself and some of my colleagues might have liked to have added to the ranks of the republican dead,\" he said. Unionists will now insist that Orange lilies should be displayed at Stormont on July 12 when Orangemen mark the anniversary of the Battle of Boyne in 1690. At least there is one sign of hope. In the optimistic climate of the Good Friday agreement assembly members adopted a neutral logo - the six flowers of the flax plant to signify the six counties of Northern Ireland.",

London's mayor was yesterday given permission for a high court judicial review of the government's plans which are set to become an issue in the lead up to the election. London Underground did not oppose the granting of a four day hearing. Mr Livingstone and Bob Kiley, his transport commissioner, will argue that lives will be put at risk becaue tube maintenance and management will be separated under the PPP. The legal action follows the breakdown of talks between Mr Kiley and John Prescott, deputy prime minister, to settle the future funding and control of the tube. The mayor's transport authority, Transport for London, is seeking court orders prohibiting London Underground from entering PPP arrangements for \"provision, construction, renewal or maintenance of the tube\", or \"any other arrangements inconsistent with the mayor's transport strategy\". Its counsel, Richard Gordon QC, said that the important and urgent case raised significant issues over Mr Livingstone's transport strategy functions. Mr Justice Sullivan said he was satisfied that the mayor's statutory powers were \"novel, complex and untested in the courts\", and that the issue was \"of vital importance to Londoners generally\". He said the issue should be resolved as soon as possible so that Mr Livingstone knew whether to take the PPP into account when formulating his final transport strategy. The government yesterday released details of its plans for a 30 year lease to the private sector, in which it plans to invest \u00a32bn of the total \u00a313bn cost. New trains will have to display more information, with CCTV and emergency help points in every carriage. Cleaning and maintenance contractors will have to meet tough new standards on litter, graffiti, and wear and tear, and there will be spot checks to ensure that the work is being carried out. Passengers at 94 stations, more than a third of the network, will see significant improvements to their stations over the first half of the PPP contract. All stations will be refurbished every 7.5 years. New trains, coupled with new signalling, will allow the tube to carry even more than the current figure of 1bn passengers a year more quickly, while train service reliability is supposed to improve by 20%. The plan envisages 26.5% growth on the Piccadilly line by 2009, 20% on the Victoria line by 2010, 18.5% on the Jubilee line by 2005, 17% on the Metropolitan by 2012, and 11.8% on the District by 2016.",

It used to be a two-word salvo: President Thatcher. Or, depending on the audience, President Hattersley. Or President Kinnock.</p> <p>Yesterday the Daily Mail's front page updated the manoeuvre, by asking \"Would you want this lot to replace the monarchy?\" alongside a photomontage of Queen Cherie Blair, King Keith Vaz, Queen Margaret Jay and King Charles Falconer - all decked out in digitally doctored crowns and ermine. Radio 5 Live played a similar game, polling its listeners on a possible president: Jamie Oliver came in first, ahead of Mo Mowlam, Anne Robinson and Richard Branson. The Naked Chef promised longer pub opening hours and better food, with hospitals and schools all dishing out pukka tucker.</p> <p>It's all jolly good fun but the Mail's move, in particular, betrays an unexpected sense of panic in the monarchist camp. The President Beckham gambit is for use only in emergency, when the royalist fight is almost lost: it's designed to ridicule the republican case, divert attention from the absurdity of heredity and shame Britons into thinking that they could only ever make stupid democratic choices. The aim is to infantilise the British public, to reduce us to children who couldn't possibly be trusted with a vote: after all, we'd only waste it. The suffragettes had to endure the same condescension a century ago.</p> <p>But we should not be downcast by this latest assault; we should be cheered by it. For who would have foreseen that a fairly mild story of royal tittle-tattle would unleash the intense debate of the last week? A few off-colour remarks from Sophie, the \"Countess of Wessex\", and within 48 hours the debate had spiralled down to fundamentals. As the Sun put it last Wednesday, \"Is it time to ditch the monarchy?\"</p> <p>Contrast that with the recent bumpy rides for the palace. When Charles and Diana broke up in 1992, the revelations drove commentators into two rival camps - but they were Spencer v Windsor rather than republican v monarchist. The questions then were whether Charles could ever marry Camilla, whether she could become queen, whether the succession should skip to William. Only a fringe few debated the institution itself.</p> <p>Even the Firm's darkest hour - the aftermath of Diana's death in 1997 - saw the critics hesitate. When the Windsors refused to speak about, react to or even pay tribute to the dead princess, the public cry was not for abolition but for modernisation. Again, only a dedicated minority suggested the monarchy had to be scrapped, not saved.</p> <p>Yet this time, and with so much weaker a provocation, the response has been sharper and more radical. Where ministers kept silent in September 1997, they have been speaking out now - with no reprimand from the royals' one-time friend in No 10. The restraint of 1992 and 1997 seems to have eroded.</p> <p>The public are equally unbound. Tune in to any of the countless phone-ins generated by Sophiegate and two impressions quickly take root. First, those who still insist that monarchy and constitutional reform are dry topics of interest only to Charter 88 chatterers, are wrong: this is a switch-on subject that excites instant and enormous public debate. Second, arguments that were once the lonely preserve of conviction republicans have leaked into the national mainstream. For every old royalist canard, there's now a punter ready to phone in and defeat it. Britons are losing their fear, the old deference falling away as fast as the royal mystique. Now they feel free to attack the monarchy in a language that would once have barred them from the airwaves.</p> <p>No wonder the royalist camp is rattled. They hang by a frail thread when a nothing story like Sophiegate can unravel their cause so quickly. But how should republicans seize this moment? What should we do next?</p> <p>The first instinct is to demand nothing less than immediate abolition - on logical as well as emotional grounds. For it's clear that any of the current modernisation proposals are bound to fail, just as they always do. The \"lord chamberlain\", Richard Luce, can try to draw up guidelines for royal working practices, just as MPs can demand a register of royal interests. But neither will succeed because both are trying to square a circle, squeezing an ancient, feudal idea - royalty - into a modern, democratic world. The two just do not mix, for royalty rests on medieval concepts of bloodline and heredity while modernity seeks to reward merit and offer equal opportunity. Modern royalty is as silly an idea as a plastic crown or a Perspex sceptre. It is a contradiction.</p> <p>M oreover, for purists, modernisation means accepting a principle they regard as plain wrong. Committed republicans object to the very idea of selecting Britain's head of state not on merit or democratic will but by the accident of birth. Slimming down the number of HRHs does nothing to tackle the fundamental wrongness of that practice. Indeed, \"reform\" may even give heredity a new lease of life by covering it with the deceptive patina of legitimacy. Republican instinct opposes it.</p> <p>And yet perhaps we ought to learn the lessons of recent success. Making moderate, reasonable demands for change does seem to work. The purist would have dismissed calls to make the royals pay tax as a distraction from the main cause. Yet it established a precedent, making clear that the Windsors were not beyond the reach of politics or parliament. Equally, the Guardian's campaign to scrap the 1701 Act of Settlement - which bars non-Protestants from the succession - struck many hardcore republicans as missing the point: since hereditary succession is bad, who cares which aristocrats are included and which are shut out? Yet raising that issue wrongfooted monarchists, forcing them to admit that the foundations of their institution are archaic. How could they let a non-Protestant on the throne when the monarch doubles as head of the Church of England? Before long, the Guardian's simple plea had royalty's defenders tangled up in knots.</p> <p>So perhaps republicans need to adopt a twin strategy. We should continue to make the larger case for democracy, even as we support the current calls for a streamlined, transparent royal family. As the recent past has proved, by moving one step at a time we can build a consensus, piece by piece. And each advance steadily whittles away at the very foundations of the monarchy. It is not overnight revolution, but death by a thousand cuts.</p> <p>For now, we should back Labour MP Tony Wright's call for a commission to probe this central constitutional question. Republicans can argue their case there and, once we've won one reform, we can demand another. Eventually we might establish the consensus needed for the final push - due in the next two or three decades, as Britain finally prepares for the departure of its current, remarkable head of state.</p> <p>By then republicans should have won over their fellow Britons so that, when we finally bid farewell to the Queen with a full state funeral, the nation unites - to bury this fairytale institution once and for all.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,471306,00.html\">10.04.2001: Royals still court press associations</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,471096,00.html\">10.04.2001: Queen may decide to keep business guidelines private</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,471105,00.html\">10.04.2001: Clients shy away from PR disaster</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,471110,00.html\">10.04.2001: Prince Andrew: another royal accident waiting to happen?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,471167,00.html\">10.04.2001: New role for Andrew in doubt after royal fiasco</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,471168,00.html\">10.04.2001: Modernising monarchy</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,471099,00.html\">10.04.2001, Hugo Young: Blair and the Queen</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,471029,00.html\">10.04.2001, comment: Labour's oaths of loyalty</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/\">The future of the monarchy</a></p> <p><b>The issue explained</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,470825,00.html\">The indiscretion of Sophie Wessex</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,470628,00.html\">The royal statements</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">British monarchy</a><br><a href=\"http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Royal Insight magazine</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theprinceofwales.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">The Prince of Wales</a><br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/1793/Index.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Movement Against the Monarchy</a></p>",

Yet it established a precedent, making clear that the Windsors were not beyond the reach of politics or parliament. Equally, the Guardian's campaign to scrap the 1701 Act of Settlement - which bars non-Protestants from the succession - struck many hardcore republicans as missing the point: since hereditary succession is bad, who cares which aristocrats are included and which are shut out? Yet raising that issue wrongfooted monarchists, forcing them to admit that the foundations of their institution are archaic. How could they let a non-Protestant on the throne when the monarch doubles as head of the Church of England? Before long, the Guardian's simple plea had royalty's defenders tangled up in knots. So perhaps republicans need to adopt a twin strategy. We should continue to make the larger case for democracy, even as we support the current calls for a streamlined, transparent royal family. As the recent past has proved, by moving one step at a time we can build a consensus, piece by piece. And each advance steadily whittles away at the very foundations of the monarchy. It is not overnight revolution, but death by a thousand cuts. For now, we should back Labour MP Tony Wright's call for a commission to probe this central constitutional question. Republicans can argue their case there and, once we've won one reform, we can demand another. Eventually we might establish the consensus needed for the final push - due in the next two or three decades, as Britain finally prepares for the departure of its current, remarkable head of state. By then republicans should have won over their fellow Britons so that, when we finally bid farewell to the Queen with a full state funeral, the nation unites - to bury this fairytale institution once and for all.

In a report likely to fuel the debate about the plans, the Commons foreign affairs committee noted that while the Nice treaty stated that the EU's common foreign and security policy must be \"compatible\" with Nato, the status of the proposed force was dealt with in a separate annexe agreed by EU leaders. The treaty says moves towards a common EU defence policy \"shall respect the obligations of certain member states which see their common defence realised in Nato\". The annexe says the aim is to give the EU \"an autonomous capacity to take decisions and action in the security and defence field\". It adds: \"In developing this autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where Nato as a whole is not engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military operations in response to international crises, the EU will be able to carry out the full range of... humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking\". The Labour-dominated committee said in its report: \"It remains to be seen just how soon differing interpretations of the report's conclusions can be reconciled, and what the statement that the EU-led military operations will take place only 'where Nato as a whole is not engaged' will mean in practice.\" The US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, has expressed concern about the proposed European force, prompted in part by French insistence that the EU should have an independent military planning structure. Whitehall insisted that while EU political and military leaders will want to draw up their own strategic plans, operational plans will be drawn up with Nato or national capitals. The MPs said Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, told them \"how much we depend on Nato, how important it is for our defence policy... and we cannot do it without them\". This, the committee said, raised the question whether Turkey, a member of Nato but not of the EU, would be able to block operations by vetoing use of Nato assets. \u0095 Production of a new missile originally due to have been fitted to RAF and navy bombers in 1998 has been delayed indefinitely, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Ten hospitals in England were yesterday named and shamed as facing the biggest struggle to meet cleanliness targets by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, who is sending in professional support teams and delegating extra funds to clean up the poorest performers. The Department of Health claimed yesterday that standards had risen spectacularly in the last six months: the number of unacceptably dirty hospitals has dropped from 253 to 40. The drive to clean up hospitals was announced in the government's NHS plan last July, partly in response to patient complaints but also in an effort to reduce the number of infections in hospital, which affect 100,000 people a year, kill 5,000 and cost the NHS about \u00a31bn to treat. Hospitals have been designated red, yellow or green under a new traffic light scheme for performance measurement. Of the 40 labelled red, 10 are considered to be performing badly enough to require extra money and support teams to help them sort out their cleaning. One named and shamed hospital trust, the United Bristol Healthcare Trust, which runs the Bristol royal infirmary, complained yesterday that it was dealing with antiquated buildings. \"Parts of the BRI date from 1732, one of the very few 18th century hospital buildings in the UK still used for patient care,\" it said in a statement which spoke of the \"considerable challenge\" the trust faced in bringing standards up to the 21st century. Mr Milburn, visiting the Royal Free hospital in north London which has moved up from a red rating to green, took a tough stance. \"Despite this marked improvement, there is to be no let up in our drive to raise standards of hospital cleanliness,\" he said. \"The fundamentals of care are too important to be left to chance.\" But Mike Stone of the Patients' Association said he hoped there was not an electioneering element to the cleanliness drive. \"It is good that the government is doing something about cleanliness in hospitals, something we have been concerned about for years,\" he said. \"However, there is still a lot to do and the fact that there are still some 40 that are on a red light is worrying. I just hope this isn't a one-off initiative in the run-up to the general election. Cleanliness in hospitals needs to be at the top of the agenda.\" Naming the 10 hospitals, the Department of Health said they were not necessarily the dirtiest in England, but the ones facing the hardest struggle to improve. They are: Broadgreen hospital, Liverpool; Bristol royal infirmary; Russells Hall hospital, Dudley, West Midlands; Wordsley hospital, Dudley; Corbett hospital, Dudley; Guest hospital, Dudley; Mount Vernon hospital, Northwood, Middlesex; Watford hospital, Watford, Herts; Essex county hospital, Colchester, Essex; Pembury hospital, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Each will get between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3750,000 to help the clean-up effort. The government has already put in \u00a330m for cleaning, painting and refurbishing everything from wards to visitors' toilets. A further \u00a330m will, the government hopes, be enough to bring the rest of the hospitals up to scratch and implement new national hospital cleaning standards published yesterday. Mr Milburn's other secret weapon in the clean-up is the recently announced return of hospital matrons, who will have the \"authority to keep the wards clean\", said Mr Milburn. Competitive tendering for hospital cleaning contracts has also been scrapped, because low prices have resulted in lower standards. The public service union Unison yesterday said it was calling for sustained investment in cleaning and for cleaning staff to be part of the NHS. Unison representatives will meet the Department of Health on April 24 to push for a set of principles on the cleaner wards initiative. The union's secretary for health, Paul Marks, said: \"The destructive impact of contracting out is still evident by the fact that many of the services named are run by private contractors.\" The 40 hospitals and trusts named as having poor standards of cleanliness: Queen Elizabeth II hospital. Welwyn Garden City, Herts Colchester general hospital, Colchester, Essex Essex county hospital, Colchester Rochford hospital, Southend, Essex Watford hospital, Watford, Herts Royal London hospital BHB Community Healthcare NHS Trust, London City and Hackney Community Service NHS Trust Whipps Cross hospital, London Mount Vernon hospital, Northwood, Middlesex North Middlesex hospital Parkside Health NHS Trust, London South London and Maudsley NHS Trust Atkinson Morley hospital, London St Mary's hospital, London Western eye hospital, London Middlesex hospital, London West Middlesex University hospital, London Bury general hospital, Bury, Lancashire Broadgreen hospital, Liverpool Royal Liverpool University hospital Hope hospital, Salford, Greater Manchester Withington hospital, Manchester St Peter's hospital, Chertsey, Surrey Ashenhill and Southview hospital, Eastbourne, East Sussex All Saints hospital, Eastbourne St Annes Centre, Hastings, East Sussex Wexham Park hospital, Slough Pembury hospital, Tunbridge Wells, Kent Kent and Sussex hospital, Tunbridge Wells John Radcliffe hospital, Oxford Elms clinic, Potters Bar, Herts Park hospital, Oxford, Southlands hospital, Shoreham, West Sussex Bristol royal infirmary Leicester royal infirmary Corbett hospital, Dudley, West Midlands Russells Hall hospital, Dudley Guest hospital, Dudley Wordsley hospital, Dudley",

My closest friend, who died not long ago, is buried near Marx's grave in Highgate cemetery, so I see the gaggle of admirers laying roses at the foot of his tombstone regularly. I have never been tempted to leave flowers there myself. Great theories, shame about the practice. Marx did many things. But inventing class was not one of them. He produced theories aimed at creating a classless society, a desire we are led to believe is shared by Honest John [ Major ]. The royal family's existence is a constant reminder of the hollowness of Major's rhetoric, and idiotic statements by its leading members a constant boost to the republican cause. They're fine opening hospitals. It's when they open their mouths they get into trouble. Which is probably why I've never watched the Queen's Christmas broadcasts. Extracted from Today, February 24 1994 \u0095 Of course one doesn't wish to be offensive to one's future king, does one? But the day I need lessons on how to raise or educate children from someone who cannot hold his marriage together, does not see his own kids from day to day, delegates their upbringing to nannies and private school spankers, went to a spanking academy himself, needed the power of patronage to get into university, apparently wants to send his own sons to Eton, the spanking academy, whose advisers all come from similar establishments and are similarly ill-suited to speak about the real world, and who courts his mistress with lavatorial suggestions, is some way off. ... His \"Back to Basics\" offering was one piece of garbage too far. May 9 1994 \u0095 Prince Philip upsets the Hungarians with a little joke about their \"pot bellies\". Now, to show that insensitive and stupid comments are not generational, Lord Linley reveals himself to be as crass as Uncle Phil. Presumably he thought that as he was a royal, rather than a silly little boy, Heathrow security men would realise he was joking when he said he had a gun and a grenade in his bag, and nod him on with a chuckle, a tug of the forelock and a doff of the cap. Instead, they surrounded him, searched him and - apart from failing to get him arrested and banged up - treated him like a normal human being. There are many reasons for the decline in royal esteem. One is that so many of the royals are thick.

      "body": "<p>The neutrally painted walls and shiny clean floors of Broadgreen hospital's wards belie its status as one of the dirtiest hospitals in Britain. </p> <p>Yesterday both staff and patients at the hospital in Liverpool appeared to be slightly baffled by the Department of Health's decision to name it for having unacceptable hygiene standards. Broadgreen, which faced the threat of closure for many years, is in the middle of a rebuilding and demolition programme which has effectively turned it into a building site. </p> <p>It is one of 10 NHS hospitals across the country which have been given an autumn deadline to improve. </p> <p>Tony Sutton, a 28-year-old day patient on ward 27, said: \"This place is much better than the Royal Liverpool hospital in the city centre, which is a real pit in comparison. I think this is a good, clean hospital and there is nothing wrong with it. The ward is light and cheery and the staff make you feel really comfortable. I can't see what the problem is.\" </p> <p>When he arrived on the ward yesterday, Rodney Harrison, 34, said he thought it was really clean and he was surprised by how old the building was, as it appeared to be quite modern. </p> <p>Alison Jager, a staff nurse on the surgical day ward, said it was unfair that the problems with building work had been reflected in the criticisms of the hospital. \"The work is being done to improve the long term future of the hospital. I feel quite offended personally that we have been included because of this. The staff who work here are quite happy and confident about the cleanliness of the wards.\" </p> <p>Pearce Butler, chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, said it was obviously disappointed by the inspectors' report, but he said it was clear if you looked around the hospital what effect the rebuilding programme has had. </p> <p>\"We have effectively been working on a building site which has no doubt created real problems,\" he said. </p> <p>As if to emphasise his point, the constant din of a hydraulic breaking machine smashing up huge chunks of concrete echoed in the background. He said: \"It has been an unusual and difficult year for the hospital and we are confident that we will be able to hit the autumn deadline.\" </p> <p>He said he believed that staff morale was high, as they could now look forward to the future as money was being spent on refurbishing the hospital and rebuilding. \"The people of Liverpool understand and welcome the work being done,\" he added. </p> <p>In the past year, \u00a36.5m has been spent on the infrastructure - replacing car parks and roads circling the hospital and drains, pipes and electrical cables. A further \u00a315m has been earmarked for a new building for surgery. Mr Butler said the investment was being made to secure the long term future of the hospital, which had been in doubt. </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said a lot of the problems at Broadgreen related to the infrastructure of the hospital, rather than the specific cleanliness of wards and hygiene. It needed more artwork and car parks required renovation. In addition, furniture needed upgrading and landscaping was also highlighted as an area of concern. </p> <p>Broadgreen hospital will now be given between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3750,000 to lift standards and experts will be sent in over the next few months to help it improve.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The neutrally painted walls and shiny clean floors of Broadgreen hospital's wards belie its status as one of the dirtiest hospitals in Britain. Yesterday both staff and patients at the hospital in Liverpool appeared to be slightly baffled by the Department of Health's decision to name it for having unacceptable hygiene standards. Broadgreen, which faced the threat of closure for many years, is in the middle of a rebuilding and demolition programme which has effectively turned it into a building site. It is one of 10 NHS hospitals across the country which have been given an autumn deadline to improve. Tony Sutton, a 28-year-old day patient on ward 27, said: \"This place is much better than the Royal Liverpool hospital in the city centre, which is a real pit in comparison. I think this is a good, clean hospital and there is nothing wrong with it. The ward is light and cheery and the staff make you feel really comfortable. I can't see what the problem is.\" When he arrived on the ward yesterday, Rodney Harrison, 34, said he thought it was really clean and he was surprised by how old the building was, as it appeared to be quite modern. Alison Jager, a staff nurse on the surgical day ward, said it was unfair that the problems with building work had been reflected in the criticisms of the hospital. \"The work is being done to improve the long term future of the hospital. I feel quite offended personally that we have been included because of this. The staff who work here are quite happy and confident about the cleanliness of the wards.\" Pearce Butler, chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, said it was obviously disappointed by the inspectors' report, but he said it was clear if you looked around the hospital what effect the rebuilding programme has had. \"We have effectively been working on a building site which has no doubt created real problems,\" he said. As if to emphasise his point, the constant din of a hydraulic breaking machine smashing up huge chunks of concrete echoed in the background. He said: \"It has been an unusual and difficult year for the hospital and we are confident that we will be able to hit the autumn deadline.\" He said he believed that staff morale was high, as they could now look forward to the future as money was being spent on refurbishing the hospital and rebuilding. \"The people of Liverpool understand and welcome the work being done,\" he added. In the past year, \u00a36.5m has been spent on the infrastructure - replacing car parks and roads circling the hospital and drains, pipes and electrical cables. A further \u00a315m has been earmarked for a new building for surgery. Mr Butler said the investment was being made to secure the long term future of the hospital, which had been in doubt. A Department of Health spokeswoman said a lot of the problems at Broadgreen related to the infrastructure of the hospital, rather than the specific cleanliness of wards and hygiene. It needed more artwork and car parks required renovation. In addition, furniture needed upgrading and landscaping was also highlighted as an area of concern. Broadgreen hospital will now be given between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3750,000 to lift standards and experts will be sent in over the next few months to help it improve.",

It certainly had elements of both. Tony Blair, with a small but devoted band of special advisers, had decided in secret that if he was serious about coming to power, he needed to dump clause four, the party's historic commitment to public ownership. To avoid leaks (and the tedium of democratic debate) members of the shadow cabinet were being informed of this dramatic change at the last possible moment. </p> <p>Not consulted, just informed. One by one they trooped obediently into Blair's rooms in Blackpool to be told that in a few hours' time the leader would tell his party conference that clause four had to go. This was a bit like the disciples being told by Jesus that he'd had second thoughts about the sermon on the mount. Stunned members of the shadow cabinet (only John Prescott had been told in advance) reeled out of Blair's rooms wondering what had hit them. To avoid embarrassment, the policy wonks and spin doctors who had engineered the coup had been told to stay out of the way. </p> <p>Unfortunately, one of them, the focus-group expert Philip Gould, got his timing wrong and had to hide in a wardrobe. Hiding in wardrobes is, of course, the stuff of farce. </p> <p>On that particular day, I knew nothing of the goings-on at the Imperial Hotel. I was down at the conference centre, preparing to listen to Blair's conference speech before filing my nightly conference report for Radio 4. As in the previous few years, I had been asked by The World Tonight to attend all the party conferences that autumn, and each evening provide a satirical report on all that was most ridiculous, laughable or just plain mendacious about each day's events. </p> <p>So that's how I found myself in the Winter Gardens that day, not far from the troubling figures of Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, as Blair electrified conference with his most radical \"modernising\" measure to date. I found it difficult to decide which of the three men I wanted to observe most closely. </p> <p>Was it Blair, up there on the platform, with his false blokeyness, his flights of verbless rhetoric, his toe-curling attempts at being funny, and his rehearsed spontaneity? Was it Campbell, an intensely physical presence: brooding, thoughtful, yet always combative and primed for action? Or was it Mandelson, sinister, tight, controlled, unmoving, like a lizard basking on a rock, waiting for an unsuspecting lefty to pass within range of his tongue? And which of the three was really running the show? </p> <p>Much later, when I learned of the farcical comings and goings in the Imperial Hotel, I began to think about a comedy that could distil the synthetic drama of a party conference into the genuine drama of a stage play. With the spin doctors and the policy wonks as my protagonists, I was able to side-step the problem of asking actors to impersonate well-known politicians. <br>Going for the wonks had the added advantage of allowing me to harness the perception that power increasingly rests in the hands of unelected advisers. There remained the problem of the absurd. When real-life politics includes senior advisers hiding in prime ministers' wardrobes, where is the space for comic exaggeration? </p> <p>When working as a script editor on various radio and television programmes, I would often ask the writer to change something that I felt was lacking in truth, because without truth, there is no good comedy. With astonishing frequency the response was: \"Oh, but that really happened to me.\" I believed them. But what they had failed to do was make that reality as credible as fictional reality. </p> <p>To seduce the audience into believing, the writer has to create a remorseless logic of truth, which has everything to do with what is happening on the stage. This may or may not be more grotesque than what is happening in the real world, but it must be internally consistent; then it becomes possible to create all kinds of satirical grotesques that the audience will accept. This is the process that made our rehearsals as arduous as they were compelling. </p> <p>Is Feelgood a satire? Well, I suppose it is, but satire always sounds didactic to me. It conjures up images of earnest lefties pretending not to be bored as they sit watching turgid plays about the state of the nation.

I voted Labour in May 1997, and felt an overwhelming sense of relief to see Britain liberated from the bunch of second-raters who had been running it for so long. Despite the overwhelming attractions of William Hague, I shall again vote Labour in the next election. But I cannot deny that I feel cheated. This is not a left/right issue.

The Department of Health claimed yesterday that standards had risen spectacularly in the last six months: the number of unacceptably dirty hospitals has dropped from 253 to 40. The drive to clean up hospitals was announced in the government's NHS plan last July, partly in response to patient complaints but also in an effort to reduce the number of infections in hospital, which affect 100,000 people a year, kill 5,000 and cost the NHS about \u00a31bn to treat.

They are: Broadgreen hospital, Liverpool; Bristol royal infirmary; Russells Hall hospital, Dudley, West Midlands; Wordsley hospital, Dudley; Corbett hospital, Dudley; Guest hospital, Dudley; Mount Vernon hospital, Northwood, Middlesex; Watford hospital, Watford, Herts; Essex county hospital, Colchester, Essex; Pembury hospital, Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

A further \u00a330m will, the government hopes, be enough to bring the rest of the hospitals up to scratch and implement new national hospital cleaning standards published yesterday. Mr Milburn's other secret weapon in the clean-up is the recently announced return of hospital matrons, who will have the \"authority to keep the wards clean\", said Mr Milburn. Competitive tendering for hospital cleaning contracts has also been scrapped, because low prices have resulted in lower standards. The public service union Unison yesterday said it was calling for sustained investment in cleaning and for cleaning staff to be part of the NHS. Unison representatives will meet the Department of Health on April 24 to push for a set of principles on the cleaner wards initiative. The union's secretary for health, Paul Marks, said: \"The destructive impact of contracting out is still evident by the fact that many of the services named are run by private contractors.\"",

Both stars' agents refused to comment yesterday. But it may be worth bearing in mind that Evans's birthday, when Piper supposedly proposed, is also April Fool's Day.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You get a strange reaction when you ring marketing people to tell them that things aren't going so well for Sunny Delight. They express a certain glee at its decline, schadenfreude even. What is it about Sunny D, as it is known to thousands of schoolchildren in the playground, that provokes so much resentment among professionals for whom manipulation is bread-and-butter stuff? And why should so many of these people insist on hiding behind anonymity? </p> <p>The rise and fall of Sunny Delight is the story of how a brand became a lightning conductor for all the anxieties we have about the way we buy and sell things today. It is a tale of corporate power but also of consumer triumph; of a manufacturing giant having to come to terms with a new world in which the consumer is increasingly smart; and a tale with a moral: brands that overreach themselves will meet their Nemesis. </p> <p>Sunny Delight burst upon Britain with its sunshine logo in April 1998. By August 1999, it was the country's third-largest-selling soft drink. It was the only new consumer product of the decade to jump straight into the UK's league table of top brands. Ranked 12th in Marketing magazine's Biggest Brands Survey of 1999, with annual sales of \u00a3160m, it came close to challenging established soft drinks such as Pepsi, which had sales of \u00a3190m. The Grocer magazine named it a top product. </p> <p>Yet only three years later it appears to be in deep trouble. Figures from AC Nielson's independent retail audit show that sales are down 36% by value and 28% by volume (moving annual totals to February 2001), even though the brand's owner, Procter and Gamble, has been reducing the product's price steadily to sustain the volume of sales. \"That is a frightening situation. I'd say they have known they've been in trouble for a long time with this,\" says Andrew Seth, former chief executive of Lever Brothers and now chairman of The Added Value marketing consultancy. And yet the picture had looked so sunny. </p> <p>In a statement P&amp;G said that in a market as competitive, dynamic and diverse as the soft drinks one it expected to see a levelling off of Sunny Delight sales following the initial phenomenal success, and pointed out that Sunny Delight is still one of the top 10 brands. </p> <p>It was a textbook launch. Although Sunny Delight had been available in the US since 1964, it was sold there as a downmarket drink competing for space alongside squashes and long-life drinks on ordinary shelves. The approach in the UK was to be different. P&amp;G, one of the world's most powerful grocery manufacturers, had acquired it at the end of the 80s and in 1996 began a long and thorough process of test marketing it for the UK in Carlisle. </p> <p>Robert Moberly, a leading brand consultant, remembers its arrival. \"I hadn't even seen the ads but it appeared overnight as a phenomenon. It had an instore presence on a scale I have never seen before. I was very surprised, but when I found out it was P&amp;G my surprise lessened. Suddenly my eight-year-old was screaming for it. When I tasted it, it was disgusting. It reminded me of all those orange drinks after the war. I hadn't tasted that ersatz flavour for years. Then I looked at the ingredients.\" </p> <p>Here was the rub. Sunny Delight is 5% citrus juice, and a lot of sugar and water, with vegetable oil, thickeners, added vitamins and flavourings, colourings and other additives that make it look like fresh orange juice. \"It was put together with incredible care and skill, aimed at the immature tastebuds of young children. They managed to get a taste the kids adore and a message that gives mums the permission to buy it. It was an entirely manufactured brand which I felt should not succeed,\" Moberly recalls. </p> <p>The ingredients were cheap but the price was set at a premium. P&amp;G invested in a new filling plant costing about \u00a312m, according to industry estimates, so that the drink could be packaged in the sort of frosted plastic bottles that fresh orange juice is usually sold in. The stroke of genius, by general marketing consent, was to sell Sunny D in chiller cabinets, next to the fresh fruit juices, simultaneously reinforcing the impression that it shared their healthy qualities and opening up new space for a juice drink. \"That was a major coup,\" says Mick Williamson, head of the drinks unit at The Research Business International. \"It meant they weren't fighting against other brands and putting it in the chill cabinet suggested it was better for you.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G is one of the handful of companies that has the muscle to dictate where products are sold in supermarkets and to force blanket distribution on the retail trade. (This power is also one of the reasons why so few people want to comment openly - you never know when you are going to want to work for them.) </p> <p>The big chains obliged, impressed no doubt by the prospect of higher than usual profit margins, and a heavyweight promotion. A \u00a39.2m advertising campaign, with the slogan \"The great stuff kids go for\", featured children in energetic outdoor pursuits and showed Sunny D in a fridge next to less apparently healthy drinks such as cola. </p> <p>All this was backed up by a huge direct marketing campaign to get people to sample Sunny Delight. P&amp;G declined to discuss with us the details of these promotions, but one of the key factors was undoubtedly its ability to identify young families who could be leafleted with special offers. </p> <p>P&amp;G's brands include Pampers and it is thought to have built up a powerful database from offers over the years which tells the company who we are and how old our children are. It is also reported to have worked with retailers' data from loyalty cards to identify young, lower-income families. Teenagers were targeted with sponsorship of basketball and balls bearing the drink's logo. </p> <p>This combined onslaught led to instant success. But the backlash came equally fast. </p> <p>The health watchdog the food commission condemned Sunny Delight as a con, accusing P&amp;G of putting it in chill cabinets to mislead. Newspapers, the BBC's Watchdog programme and Radio 4 all carried attacks on the brand and dubbed it \"The unreal thing\". P&amp;G argued that the drink had to be chilled to maintain its integrity and vitamins. \"We had to go out to buy refrigerated lorries, refrigerated storage, the whole lot, we wouldn't have done that as a marketing ploy,\" says Sally Woodage, P&amp;G's external relations manager. The brand in the US might be \"ambient\" rather than chilled and have added vitamins, \"but it is not exactly the same product\". </p> <p>Then came the comic twist in the drama. In December 1999, a paediatrician, Dr Duncan Cameron, reported a new and alarming condition in the medical journals: Sunny Delight syndrome. A girl of five had turned bright yellow and orange after drinking 1.5 litres of the stuff a day. She was overdosing on betacarotene, the additive that gives the sugar-and-water drink its orange colour, and the pigment was being deposited in her hands and face. While the condition was not dangerous, the doctor warned that booming sales could lead to many other children turning \"a faint yellowy colour\". </p> <p>By a marketing man's nightmare of coincidence, the TV ads for the brand at the time showed two white snowmen raiding the fridge for Sunny Delight and turning bright orange. To add to the embarrassment, a leading consultant dermatologist, Professor John Hawk, said too much betacarotene could cause tummy upsets and farting. As if to confirm its status as spawn of the devil, P&amp;G was forced to join that happy band of cigarette manufacturers who put voluntary warnings on their products. Its bottles now carry the unprecedented message: \"Like all soft drinks, Sunny Delight should be consumed in moderation.\" </p> <p>P&amp;G has launched a low-sugar version, Light Sunny Delight, to meet some of the criticisms, as well as other flavours, but these do not seem to have made much impact on the downward trend of the sales graph. </p> <p>The mistake, according to rivals was to \"overclaim\". Andrew Marsden, marketing manager of Britvic soft drinks, says: \"If you overclaim, then you subsequently have to face the results. Customers are not thick.\" Children, moreover, are very fickle. </p> <p>Seth thinks the implications are broader. P&amp;G is a successful business with more than a century and a half of history and many of the world's best brands. Food and drink have been identified by the company as a key sector if it is to meet its ambitious targets for growth. Sunny Delight was a stalking horse, according to Seth, but does not measure up to the company's usual high, \"almost Calvinist\" values. </p> <p>A brand needs to have some genuine advantage over rivals and to inspire trust if it is to have legs. In an age when the link between producers and consumers is largely broken, where we buy not from a friendly local shopkeeper but from a faceless retailer, brands become our shorthand - they represent a substitute kind of trust. You can't check the label every time, so you buy the make you know. If it turns out to be not what you thought, you feel doubly betrayed. </p> <p>Last month, P&amp;G announced it would be hiving off Sunny D into a new joint venture company with Coca-Cola, which has suffered a similar slowdown in growth. It would not comment on its sales figures, nor on its current market share. \"That depends on how you define market - I mean if you take non-dilutables on a Monday in Wigan ... We are very pleased with Sunny Delight given that we're in a very competitive market,\" says Woodage. \"In hindsight we might have wanted to make it clearer that this is a different sort of drink, ie a non-carbonated fruit-flavoured beverage,\" she admits. </p> <p>Is this a turning point, where manufacturers ignore the new, sophisticated consumer at their peril? \"People have got smarter. They've never been stupid, but now they care more. They want authentic things,\" says Dick Powell, of the product designers Seymour Powell. </p> <p>And the next big thing? Water, according to the market researchers Mintel. </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/advertising/story/0,7492,423482,00.html\">Jan 17: Court backs ASA in Ribena Tooth Kind case</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/advertising/story/0,7492,413409,00.html\">Dec 19: Ribena goes to court over Tooth Kind claims</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/marketingandpr/story/0,7494,397579,00.html\">Nov 15: Rowland scoops Sunny Delight account</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "You get a strange reaction when you ring marketing people to tell them that things aren't going so well for Sunny Delight. They express a certain glee at its decline, schadenfreude even. What is it about Sunny D, as it is known to thousands of schoolchildren in the playground, that provokes so much resentment among professionals for whom manipulation is bread-and-butter stuff? And why should so many of these people insist on hiding behind anonymity? The rise and fall of Sunny Delight is the story of how a brand became a lightning conductor for all the anxieties we have about the way we buy and sell things today. It is a tale of corporate power but also of consumer triumph; of a manufacturing giant having to come to terms with a new world in which the consumer is increasingly smart; and a tale with a moral: brands that overreach themselves will meet their Nemesis. Sunny Delight burst upon Britain with its sunshine logo in April 1998. By August 1999, it was the country's third-largest-selling soft drink. It was the only new consumer product of the decade to jump straight into the UK's league table of top brands. Ranked 12th in Marketing magazine's Biggest Brands Survey of 1999, with annual sales of \u00a3160m, it came close to challenging established soft drinks such as Pepsi, which had sales of \u00a3190m. The Grocer magazine named it a top product. Yet only three years later it appears to be in deep trouble. Figures from AC Nielson's independent retail audit show that sales are down 36% by value and 28% by volume (moving annual totals to February 2001), even though the brand's owner, Procter and Gamble, has been reducing the product's price steadily to sustain the volume of sales. \"That is a frightening situation. I'd say they have known they've been in trouble for a long time with this,\" says Andrew Seth, former chief executive of Lever Brothers and now chairman of The Added Value marketing consultancy. And yet the picture had looked so sunny. In a statement P&amp;G said that in a market as competitive, dynamic and diverse as the soft drinks one it expected to see a levelling off of Sunny Delight sales following the initial phenomenal success, and pointed out that Sunny Delight is still one of the top 10 brands. It was a textbook launch. Although Sunny Delight had been available in the US since 1964, it was sold there as a downmarket drink competing for space alongside squashes and long-life drinks on ordinary shelves. The approach in the UK was to be different. P&amp;G, one of the world's most powerful grocery manufacturers, had acquired it at the end of the 80s and in 1996 began a long and thorough process of test marketing it for the UK in Carlisle. Robert Moberly, a leading brand consultant, remembers its arrival. \"I hadn't even seen the ads but it appeared overnight as a phenomenon. It had an instore presence on a scale I have never seen before. I was very surprised, but when I found out it was P&amp;G my surprise lessened. Suddenly my eight-year-old was screaming for it. When I tasted it, it was disgusting. It reminded me of all those orange drinks after the war. I hadn't tasted that ersatz flavour for years. Then I looked at the ingredients.\" Here was the rub. Sunny Delight is 5% citrus juice, and a lot of sugar and water, with vegetable oil, thickeners, added vitamins and flavourings, colourings and other additives that make it look like fresh orange juice. \"It was put together with incredible care and skill, aimed at the immature tastebuds of young children. They managed to get a taste the kids adore and a message that gives mums the permission to buy it. It was an entirely manufactured brand which I felt should not succeed,\" Moberly recalls. The ingredients were cheap but the price was set at a premium. P&amp;G invested in a new filling plant costing about \u00a312m, according to industry estimates, so that the drink could be packaged in the sort of frosted plastic bottles that fresh orange juice is usually sold in. The stroke of genius, by general marketing consent, was to sell Sunny D in chiller cabinets, next to the fresh fruit juices, simultaneously reinforcing the impression that it shared their healthy qualities and opening up new space for a juice drink. \"That was a major coup,\" says Mick Williamson, head of the drinks unit at The Research Business International. \"It meant they weren't fighting against other brands and putting it in the chill cabinet suggested it was better for you.\" P&amp;G is one of the handful of companies that has the muscle to dictate where products are sold in supermarkets and to force blanket distribution on the retail trade. (This power is also one of the reasons why so few people want to comment openly - you never know when you are going to want to work for them.) The big chains obliged, impressed no doubt by the prospect of higher than usual profit margins, and a heavyweight promotion. A \u00a39.2m advertising campaign, with the slogan \"The great stuff kids go for\", featured children in energetic outdoor pursuits and showed Sunny D in a fridge next to less apparently healthy drinks such as cola. All this was backed up by a huge direct marketing campaign to get people to sample Sunny Delight. P&amp;G declined to discuss with us the details of these promotions, but one of the key factors was undoubtedly its ability to identify young families who could be leafleted with special offers. P&amp;G's brands include Pampers and it is thought to have built up a powerful database from offers over the years which tells the company who we are and how old our children are. It is also reported to have worked with retailers' data from loyalty cards to identify young, lower-income families. Teenagers were targeted with sponsorship of basketball and balls bearing the drink's logo. This combined onslaught led to instant success. But the backlash came equally fast. The health watchdog the food commission condemned Sunny Delight as a con, accusing P&amp;G of putting it in chill cabinets to mislead. Newspapers, the BBC's Watchdog programme and Radio 4 all carried attacks on the brand and dubbed it \"The unreal thing\". P&amp;G argued that the drink had to be chilled to maintain its integrity and vitamins. \"We had to go out to buy refrigerated lorries, refrigerated storage, the whole lot, we wouldn't have done that as a marketing ploy,\" says Sally Woodage, P&amp;G's external relations manager. The brand in the US might be \"ambient\" rather than chilled and have added vitamins, \"but it is not exactly the same product\". Then came the comic twist in the drama. In December 1999, a paediatrician, Dr Duncan Cameron, reported a new and alarming condition in the medical journals: Sunny Delight syndrome. A girl of five had turned bright yellow and orange after drinking 1.5 litres of the stuff a day. She was overdosing on betacarotene, the additive that gives the sugar-and-water drink its orange colour, and the pigment was being deposited in her hands and face. While the condition was not dangerous, the doctor warned that booming sales could lead to many other children turning \"a faint yellowy colour\". By a marketing man's nightmare of coincidence, the TV ads for the brand at the time showed two white snowmen raiding the fridge for Sunny Delight and turning bright orange. To add to the embarrassment, a leading consultant dermatologist, Professor John Hawk, said too much betacarotene could cause tummy upsets and farting. As if to confirm its status as spawn of the devil, P&amp;G was forced to join that happy band of cigarette manufacturers who put voluntary warnings on their products. Its bottles now carry the unprecedented message: \"Like all soft drinks, Sunny Delight should be consumed in moderation.\" P&amp;G has launched a low-sugar version, Light Sunny Delight, to meet some of the criticisms, as well as other flavours, but these do not seem to have made much impact on the downward trend of the sales graph. The mistake, according to rivals was to \"overclaim\". Andrew Marsden, marketing manager of Britvic soft drinks, says: \"If you overclaim, then you subsequently have to face the results. Customers are not thick.\" Children, moreover, are very fickle. Seth thinks the implications are broader. P&amp;G is a successful business with more than a century and a half of history and many of the world's best brands. Food and drink have been identified by the company as a key sector if it is to meet its ambitious targets for growth. Sunny Delight was a stalking horse, according to Seth, but does not measure up to the company's usual high, \"almost Calvinist\" values. A brand needs to have some genuine advantage over rivals and to inspire trust if it is to have legs. In an age when the link between producers and consumers is largely broken, where we buy not from a friendly local shopkeeper but from a faceless retailer, brands become our shorthand - they represent a substitute kind of trust. You can't check the label every time, so you buy the make you know. If it turns out to be not what you thought, you feel doubly betrayed. Last month, P&amp;G announced it would be hiving off Sunny D into a new joint venture company with Coca-Cola, which has suffered a similar slowdown in growth. It would not comment on its sales figures, nor on its current market share. \"That depends on how you define market - I mean if you take non-dilutables on a Monday in Wigan ... We are very pleased with Sunny Delight given that we're in a very competitive market,\" says Woodage. \"In hindsight we might have wanted to make it clearer that this is a different sort of drink, ie a non-carbonated fruit-flavoured beverage,\" she admits. Is this a turning point, where manufacturers ignore the new, sophisticated consumer at their peril? \"People have got smarter. They've never been stupid, but now they care more. They want authentic things,\" says Dick Powell, of the product designers Seymour Powell. And the next big thing? Water, according to the market researchers Mintel.

The decision is part of the strategic review of ONdigital that has been conducted since Granada and Carlton bought United News &amp; Media out of ITV.",

Mr Blackhurst, who is working on the Independent as a political investigative journalist, was deputy editor of the Independent on Sunday under former editor Boycott. Other names in the frame are believed to include the Independent's executive editor Tristan Davies, deputy editor for the Independent on Sunday Mike Williams and Independent deputy editor Ian Birrell. Staff at the paper are believed to be taking bets on the above candidates. A statement to staff at the paper today confirmed that Ms Street-Porter, who has edited the newspaper since 1999, would stand down after the general election. Simon Kelner, editor-in-chief of the Independent and the Independent on Sunday, would not be drawn on her replacement. However, he refused to rule out any of the suggested internal favourites and added that external candidates were being considered. He denied Ms Street-Porter had been asked to resign. \"Janet intimated to me when she took this job on that she didn't want to do it until she took her pension,\" he said. \"Shortly after Christmas, she intimated that, come the spring, the time would be right for her to look around for something else.\" Asked whether Ms Street-Porter had proved former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie right when he claimed she couldn't edit a bus ticket, Mr Kelner said: \"She's proved them all wrong.\" Related story Apr 11: Street-Porter quits Independent on Sunday",

It is, he says, the result of an innovative drama course that the Geese Theatre Company - a touring company based at the Midlands Arts Centre in Birmingham - has extended to young offenders to help them examine their behaviour and develop more constructive ways of handling challenging situations. </p> <p>It works like this. Masks, representing a variety of \"fronts\", are worn by the actors, who then play out a scene according to the rationale of that behaviour. The mask for Cool (\"Listen, you're all making a lot of fuss about nothing - if you want the TV, just steal it\") is an ominous, green face with dark glasses; Target (\"I don't feel in control of this situation - it's everyone else's fault I'm doing this\") has an archery target on the forehead. At various points in the performance, the audience of young offenders calls out for the character to lift the mask and explain what he is really feeling - and how he might find ways to act on that feeling, rather than according to the front. The actor then tests out the consequences of that option. </p> <p>\"It's not about truth, but more about what is being withheld - highlighting hidden vulnerabilities and concealed thoughts and feelings,\" says Sally Brookes, the theatre company's programmes director. \"That's why we use 'fragment' masks because they display only a fragment of behaviour. Few people are The Joker, The Mouth, The Victim or any other front all the time.\" </p> <p>Through workshops, lasting one day, and \"residencies\", which last several, the mobile company focuses on the young offenders' motivation and ability to change. Brookes says: \"We recognise that wider social and economic factors have a major influence on crime - particularly when it comes to young offenders - but we work from the premise that he can nonetheless make active choices and has a responsibility for his actions.\" </p> <p>She admits that many of the 14 to 18-year-olds are sceptical about the idea of drama. \"They feel it's childish and silly,\" she says. \"But it's overcome fairly quickly - not only because there is a clear logic to what we're doing, but because they get to explore behaviour patterns one step removed through the medium of an actor. That means they themselves don't end up feeling judged or interrogated.\" </p> <p>Also popular among under-18s is the fact that there are no scripts, and no feeling of intimidation that can be associated with being asked to read aloud. There are simply events, scenarios, settings and masks. And humour is particularly important in working with this age group, Brookes says, because most have had negative experiences with adults in a learning environment. \"Our emphasis is on making the work both enjoyable and useful,\" she says. </p> <p>Geese believes that each workshop must be tailor-made to the needs of a particular group. One, for instance, may focus intensively on aggression, while another may explore a range of knee-jerk reactions and their ramifications. One may focus on behaviours outside prison, while another may include the experience of prison itself. </p> <p>Lou Heywood, the company's touring director, says: \"The objectives must be clear. One session we recently ran was for young offenders who had been in the institution less than a week. Many seemed confident, but you could tell that almost all of them were frightened, particularly if they didn't understand the system. </p> <p>\"The first part of the drama involved acting out a scene in which a lad went into his cell for the first time. Using the masks, we explored what he might be thinking. The aim was to let the group talk honestly about the kinds of feelings they might have, rather than letting them out through destructive behaviour.\" </p> <p>Like all the trainers at Geese - which expanded from the US to Britain in 1987 - Heywood comes from a background of drama training, with a strong interest in issue-based theatre. In addition, all staff receive six-month training in teamwork, the criminal justice system, probation services and aspects of offending behaviour. </p> <p>\"Young offenders are a difficult group to measure in terms of the effects of the course,\" admits Brookes. \"But the verbal feedback from prison workers and probation workers, as well as the young people themselves, is certainly positive enough for us to be booked up for months ahead.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Imagine how very different life might be for elderly residents of a care home if it was run jointly by a group of relatives and staff, within a framework provided by the management. Or if designated visitors had a swipe card for the front door, allowing them to drop in at any time to check or chat as freely as when their relatives were still fit enough to manage in their own homes. </p> <p>To managers and staff of many care homes, even to consider such initiatives might seem laughable; to implement them would involve high costs and higher risks. All too often, it seems, the overriding emphasis of residential care is on security and control. But some homes do little even to lighten the mix of communal living with activities and social events such as family teas, outings or special functions for Easter or Valentine's day. </p> <p>The reality of some homes is such that many relatives find their guilt over placing mum or dad in them is aggravated by a soulless routine and staff who refuse to let visitors do small, but meaningful, tasks: brushing hair, for instance, or making a cup of tea with just the right amount of milk. Many complaints about such care regimes are mumbled, but never brought to the attention of senior staff. Now, however, the Relatives and Residents Association (RRA), a charity working to improve the quality of life in care homes, has compiled common grievances and come up with a guide to good practice, intended for those who run residential and nursing homes in private, voluntary and local authority sectors. </p> <p>The guide, Involving Relatives and Friends, aims to achieve fuller and better partnership between residents, and their relatives, and the staff and managers of homes. That, too, was the aim of the RRA's founder, Dorothy White, who in 1997 won \u00a33,500 under the then Guardian Jerwood Award for excellence among smaller charities. Before her death the following year, she asked that the prize money be used to further her work - so the charity has put it towards the cost of publishing the book. </p> <p>Julia Burton-Jones, RRA's development worker who wrote the guide, recognises the difficulties of all parties: guilty relatives; residents with deteriorating memories; and staff faced with difficult demands. Although homes generally are now less paternalistic than they once were, she says that \"professionals have been taught to 'take over', however well meant, and family and friends, albeit reluctantly, expect to let them.\" Families are wary of rocking the boat, believing their relatives will get far better treatment if everyone conforms to the expectations of the home. </p> <p>Burton-Jones accepts that the regime in each home is different, so not all her suggestions will apply. The proposals, based on the experiences of RRA members, are practical. </p> <p>Brochures are often the starting point for a traumatic family decision. As well as giving a sunny picture of facilities, they must spell out the rules, and the charges for extras, and make clear whether fees are for a room alone, or for the level of dependency of its occupant. It sounds straightforward, but few information packs are said to give sufficient detail.

      "bodyText": "Imagine how very different life might be for elderly residents of a care home if it was run jointly by a group of relatives and staff, within a framework provided by the management. Or if designated visitors had a swipe card for the front door, allowing them to drop in at any time to check or chat as freely as when their relatives were still fit enough to manage in their own homes. To managers and staff of many care homes, even to consider such initiatives might seem laughable; to implement them would involve high costs and higher risks. All too often, it seems, the overriding emphasis of residential care is on security and control. But some homes do little even to lighten the mix of communal living with activities and social events such as family teas, outings or special functions for Easter or Valentine's day. The reality of some homes is such that many relatives find their guilt over placing mum or dad in them is aggravated by a soulless routine and staff who refuse to let visitors do small, but meaningful, tasks: brushing hair, for instance, or making a cup of tea with just the right amount of milk. Many complaints about such care regimes are mumbled, but never brought to the attention of senior staff. Now, however, the Relatives and Residents Association (RRA), a charity working to improve the quality of life in care homes, has compiled common grievances and come up with a guide to good practice, intended for those who run residential and nursing homes in private, voluntary and local authority sectors. The guide, Involving Relatives and Friends, aims to achieve fuller and better partnership between residents, and their relatives, and the staff and managers of homes. That, too, was the aim of the RRA's founder, Dorothy White, who in 1997 won \u00a33,500 under the then Guardian Jerwood Award for excellence among smaller charities. Before her death the following year, she asked that the prize money be used to further her work - so the charity has put it towards the cost of publishing the book. Julia Burton-Jones, RRA's development worker who wrote the guide, recognises the difficulties of all parties: guilty relatives; residents with deteriorating memories; and staff faced with difficult demands. Although homes generally are now less paternalistic than they once were, she says that \"professionals have been taught to 'take over', however well meant, and family and friends, albeit reluctantly, expect to let them.\" Families are wary of rocking the boat, believing their relatives will get far better treatment if everyone conforms to the expectations of the home. Burton-Jones accepts that the regime in each home is different, so not all her suggestions will apply. The proposals, based on the experiences of RRA members, are practical. Brochures are often the starting point for a traumatic family decision. As well as giving a sunny picture of facilities, they must spell out the rules, and the charges for extras, and make clear whether fees are for a room alone, or for the level of dependency of its occupant. It sounds straightforward, but few information packs are said to give sufficient detail. Contracts drawn up by care homes, moreover, are often vague about crucial issues such as the financial obligations of relatives when an elderly client dies. But there is also a need for much more cheerful documentation. In the best run homes, key staff help new arrivals to put together a \"life history book\" - a sort of structured personal album, not only to remind residents of milestones in their lives, but also to aid staff in getting to know (and remember details about) those in their care. Staff need to get to know the next of kin well, too. The guide recommends an induction programme to familiarise family members with the way a home functions - down to just who is responsible for laundry, which can be a frequent cause of friction. Jewish Care is cited as a good example: the charity runs a course of six weekly sessions to enable friends and relatives of a resident to familiarise themselves with the home. Regular \"relatives' forums\" are held at other homes and these, too, are commended as a way of building an on-going partnership, so that families do not feel excluded by staff.

He will take up the \u00a385,000-a-year chief executive post in September. </p> <p>Adebowale has been strongly identified with the housing cause. Neil Churchill, deputy chief executive of rival charity Crisis, says: \"Victor is the public face of homelessness - a very charismatic figure who will be a great loss to the sector.\" </p> <p>Adebowale, 38, has spent most of his career in the housing field, rising to become a key adviser to government and an outspoken champion of young people's rights. He was last year awarded a CBE for his services to the government's New Deal taskforce and for his work with unemployed and homeless people. </p> <p>During his five years at Centrepoint, the government has established the rough sleepers' unit with the aim of reducing by two-thirds the number of people sleeping on the streets. The role of homelessness tsar has been created and a homes bill is completing its passage through parliament. There was speculation that Adebowale would be appointed tsar, but it eventually went to Louise Casey. </p> <p>After establishing such a leading role, Adebowale's move to Turning Point - a charity with a lower profile - is puzzling some people. \"When I first heard about the move, it sounded like a sideways step,\" says James Tickell, deputy chief executive of the National Housing Federation. However, it is perhaps testament to Adebowale's leadership of Centrepoint that a charity with a staff of 200 and \u00a310m annual income has greater public recognition than does an older one with 1,300 staff and a turnover of \u00a320m. As Tickell says: \"Victor has made Centrepoint punch way beyond its weight.\" </p> <p>Turning Point runs drug and alcohol recovery services across the country, including rehabilitation and counselling. It recently appointed a high-profile chair in Lionel Joyce, formerly a leading NHS manager, but it still lacks prominence. Victoria Stark, chief executive of Look Ahead Housing and Care, says: \"Victor will be a big bonus to Turning Point in raising its low profile. He has a strong personality and a good media presence.\" </p> <p>Stark adds: \"It has been great to have someone at such a senior level in housing from the black and ethnic minority community.\" Adebowale is one of the few black chief executives in the voluntary sector - and he has often pointed out this lack of diversity to a sea of white faces at charity conferences. </p> <p>Eric Appleby, director of Alcohol Concern, says: \"Victor keeps issues in the limelight, but he isn't just a front person; he combines this with managing an organisation and providing good services. Turning Point will benefit enormously from his contribution.\" However, Churchill thinks Adebowale will \"have his work cut out\" pulling together a coherent response to the impact of drugs and alcohol on society. \"It is a huge agenda,\" he says. </p> <p>So Adebowale's in-tray will be stacked high by the time he arrives in his new post. However, the subject matter is not entirely new to him. Before joining Centrepoint in 1995, he had a brief spell as director of the Alcohol Recovery Project. </p> <p>He began his career as a volunteer for Newham Community Housing Cooperative, in east London, but soon gained employment as an estates officer for Newham council. He then moved to the Patchwork Community Housing Association, helping to provide special needs housing. His first senior role was regional director of Ujima Housing Association, Britain's largest black-led housing association. </p> <p>Adebowale will leave his latest post having recently introduced a new management structure and a five-year plan, giving Centrepoint a stronger training and employment remit. Income has also doubled during his time as chief executive. </p> <p>Although he is widely seen to be close to New Labour, he is not afraid of spats. Last November, he warned the government it was in danger of missing the point with its New Deal for young people by not targeting the most disadvantaged. He also hit out at its campaign to stop people giving to beggars, saying that \"giving should be the choice of every individual.\" He insisted that a long-term strategy was needed in consultation with drugs and health agencies, homelessness services and people on the street - perhaps a foretaste of his future career plans.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The government's drive for neighbourhood renewal is in danger of missing or misunderstanding one of the most powerful drivers of community development - the individuals and micro organisations that vastly outnumber official charities. </p> <p>This is the conclusion of new research that identifies a vast, but hidden, layer of community activity - dubbed \"micro social enterprises\" (MSEs). The ungainly term is applied to low-level community activity, usually carried on out of sight of established government and voluntary sector bodies. </p> <p>Keith Leech is one such micro social entrepreneur. He likes folk music and beer. And in one of those \"if only\" pub conversations, he dreamed up the idea of an annual May Day festival in his adopted home town of Hastings. </p> <p>Unlike most such pub ideas, Leech did not think better of it the next morning.

      "bodyText": "The government's drive for neighbourhood renewal is in danger of missing or misunderstanding one of the most powerful drivers of community development - the individuals and micro organisations that vastly outnumber official charities. This is the conclusion of new research that identifies a vast, but hidden, layer of community activity - dubbed \"micro social enterprises\" (MSEs). The ungainly term is applied to low-level community activity, usually carried on out of sight of established government and voluntary sector bodies. Keith Leech is one such micro social entrepreneur. He likes folk music and beer. And in one of those \"if only\" pub conversations, he dreamed up the idea of an annual May Day festival in his adopted home town of Hastings. Unlike most such pub ideas, Leech did not think better of it the next morning. He struggled for years to put on the Jack in the Green event, which he describes modestly as \"an excuse to get dressed up, make a noise and drink beer\". After 15 years it has become a national attraction, enticing folk music lovers from all over the country. And while the time invested by Leech and others remains unpaid, the council does chip in with a modest grant to cover costs. Researchers reckon that there are as many as 1m similar tiny organisations. They argue that they are vital to community health and the government's drive for neighbourhood renewal, but are either ignored or misunderstood. \"They are either invisible or irritating to most funders and policymakers,\" says Alex MacGillivray, one of the authors of the research study, Low Flying Heroes.

      "body": "<p>Dusk in Edgwick Park, Coventry, and the boys are coming out to play. Young teenagers for the most part, they will soon be hurtling around an all-weather, floodlit football pitch. But for the time being, they are standing around in huddles, hands in pockets, shoulders hunched against a chilly breeze. Some are talking to community policeman Eddie Massey, who confides later: \"Five years ago, this lot would have blanked me or run away and called me names.\" </p> <p>Others are gathered by a small electric buggy. They are chatting to Stuart Parker, 53, who was born with a mild form of spina bifida that has progressively worsened with age. \"I'm going to report you to that copper for speeding in this thing,\" jokes a young lad. \"You were going at eight miles an hour.\" Parker pulls on his cigarette and grins amiably. The irony is that he was once a Hell's Angel who bombed around Bristol on a 750cc Norton. </p> <p>These kids wouldn't know that. All they know is that Parker and his wife, Elaine, 54, have put themselves out on their behalf. Over the past five years, they have built up partnerships - with the city council, the police, business sponsors, youth workers and others - which have reclaimed this park from drug dealers and alcoholics. Apart from anything else, it now boasts the sort of facilities for football and basketball that many youngsters can only dream of. </p> <p>The Parkers are unlikely soccer enthusiasts. Elaine admits that she knew little about the game and Stuart was always a \"rugby man\". He was a front-row forward in his younger days, when he didn't have to rely on wheelchairs and electric buggies to get about. But, like his wife, he has come to appreciate the wide appeal of the round-ball game and the value of organised matches for channelling excess energy, harnessing aggression and providing a meaningful platform for hitherto hidden skills. </p> <p>It all started one afternoon in 1996, when a ball came flying through the Parkers' bathroom window. They have a small, ground-floor council flat which backs on to the park and fronts on to a terrace street in Foleshill, the most economically deprived and multi-racial area of Coventry. </p> <p>Faced with smashed glass and a broken extractor fan, some of us might feel a little frayed at the edges on hearing the time-honoured street cry: \"Can we have our ball back, mister?\" But even in his Hell's Angel days, Stuart was involved in youth work. \"The best way to talk to these kids is on their level,\" he says. \"Don't lecture them and patronise them. Listen to their opinions.\" </p> <p>So he pushed his wheelchair across the street and introduced himself to 10 morose-looking 14 and 15-year-olds. \"They were a bit suspicious at first,\" Elaine recalls. \"But one of them knew us and he acted as a go-between.\" Gradually, the Parkers wheedled out of the youths the reasons why they chose to play football in the street rather than in the park. The answers amounted to too many threatening drug-dealers, too many bullying gangs, too many \"winos\". </p> <p>The following evening, Stuart outlined his strategy to the Foleshill crime action group. He wanted to set up a five-a-side league, properly organised by qualified coaches. Letters were written and phone calls made. Cautiously encouraging responses were elicited. Coventry's leisure services department made available what was, at the time, a rather run-down \"multi-sports\" area. A Home Office initiative, community action against crime, put in \u00a31,200 initially in 1996 and has almost matched it every year since, to buy equipment and pay the coaches a modest weekly fee. Directors of Jaguar, a prominent local employer, were invited along to watch a Thursday evening session and, as a result, more money was made available through the Business in the Community scheme. </p> <p>Involving the police was considered vital, though initially it was fraught with problems. A match was arranged between some of the local youths and the Coventry constabulary. \"But we publicised it too widely,\" Elaine concedes. \"Half the drug barons in the city turned up. There was a lot of verbal abuse from the sidelines and bottles were thrown on to the pitch. We had to abandon the match. The police went away to put their uniforms on, came back and made eight arrests.\" </p> <p>In the meantime, Stuart had been leaned over by one drug dealer who threatened to carve open his stomach. But former front-row forwards and Hell's Angels don't frighten easily - even those in wheelchairs. \"My grandfather,\" he says, \"always told me to fear no man but to respect every man - until he loses it.\" </p> <p>Startled by Stuart's bloodcurdling response to his threats, the drug dealer was led away by one of his mates. They have been in retreat ever since after some rigorous policing. In fact, they have simply gone elsewhere to ply their trade. Crime in Edgwick Park officially fell by 38% over the following six months and has remained comparatively low. </p> <p>\"It's become a family park again,\" says Elaine, who has lived in Foleshill all her life. </p> <p>The Parkers have capitalised on this revived interest by running summer schemes during the long school vacation. Not only football and basketball, but trips out to swimming pools, bowling alleys and cricket grounds. Last summer, almost 500 youngsters took part. </p> <p>Heartened by the manifestation of community action in Edgwick Park, the local authority released \u00a396,000 from the single regeneration budget to transform the multi-sports area into an all-weather pitch with a felt surface and a robust high fence around it. The floodlights stay on until 10 most evenings and the fence takes a hell of a pounding from flying footballs. Never more so than on Thursdays, when a seemingly endless sequence of five-a-side games flow from end to end under the guidance of Football Association coaches John Robinson and Lincoln Libird. </p> <p>\"There were some difficulties at first because some characters wanted to run the show their way,\" Robinson admits. \"We had to make it fun and earn respect. Now the park's full of kids who just want to play football.\" </p> <p>That's all Ben Williams ever wanted to do. He's 15 now but was only 10 when the scheme started. \"I jumped at the chance to play,\" he says. \"This park used to feel really dangerous. It was full of people who were either drunk or on drugs. We don't see them now.\" </p> <p>It would be wrong to give the impression that Edgwick Park has become some kind of idyllic sylvan glade. There is still dog shit and shards of broken glass on some of the paths. And there is still some hideous racist graffiti on the shelter. But out on the all-weather pitch, there are 25 youngsters - Asian, Afro-Caribbean, mixed-race and white, plus a few asylum seekers from Somalia, Albania and the Congo. They all want to play football. Together.</p>",

Elaine admits that she knew little about the game and Stuart was always a \"rugby man\". He was a front-row forward in his younger days, when he didn't have to rely on wheelchairs and electric buggies to get about. But, like his wife, he has come to appreciate the wide appeal of the round-ball game and the value of organised matches for channelling excess energy, harnessing aggression and providing a meaningful platform for hitherto hidden skills. It all started one afternoon in 1996, when a ball came flying through the Parkers' bathroom window. They have a small, ground-floor council flat which backs on to the park and fronts on to a terrace street in Foleshill, the most economically deprived and multi-racial area of Coventry. Faced with smashed glass and a broken extractor fan, some of us might feel a little frayed at the edges on hearing the time-honoured street cry: \"Can we have our ball back, mister?\" But even in his Hell's Angel days, Stuart was involved in youth work. \"The best way to talk to these kids is on their level,\" he says. \"Don't lecture them and patronise them. Listen to their opinions.\" So he pushed his wheelchair across the street and introduced himself to 10 morose-looking 14 and 15-year-olds. \"They were a bit suspicious at first,\" Elaine recalls. \"But one of them knew us and he acted as a go-between.\" Gradually, the Parkers wheedled out of the youths the reasons why they chose to play football in the street rather than in the park. The answers amounted to too many threatening drug-dealers, too many bullying gangs, too many \"winos\". The following evening, Stuart outlined his strategy to the Foleshill crime action group. He wanted to set up a five-a-side league, properly organised by qualified coaches. Letters were written and phone calls made. Cautiously encouraging responses were elicited. Coventry's leisure services department made available what was, at the time, a rather run-down \"multi-sports\" area. A Home Office initiative, community action against crime, put in \u00a31,200 initially in 1996 and has almost matched it every year since, to buy equipment and pay the coaches a modest weekly fee. Directors of Jaguar, a prominent local employer, were invited along to watch a Thursday evening session and, as a result, more money was made available through the Business in the Community scheme. Involving the police was considered vital, though initially it was fraught with problems. A match was arranged between some of the local youths and the Coventry constabulary. \"But we publicised it too widely,\" Elaine concedes. \"Half the drug barons in the city turned up. There was a lot of verbal abuse from the sidelines and bottles were thrown on to the pitch. We had to abandon the match. The police went away to put their uniforms on, came back and made eight arrests.\" In the meantime, Stuart had been leaned over by one drug dealer who threatened to carve open his stomach. But former front-row forwards and Hell's Angels don't frighten easily - even those in wheelchairs. \"My grandfather,\" he says, \"always told me to fear no man but to respect every man - until he loses it.\" Startled by Stuart's bloodcurdling response to his threats, the drug dealer was led away by one of his mates. They have been in retreat ever since after some rigorous policing. In fact, they have simply gone elsewhere to ply their trade. Crime in Edgwick Park officially fell by 38% over the following six months and has remained comparatively low. \"It's become a family park again,\" says Elaine, who has lived in Foleshill all her life. The Parkers have capitalised on this revived interest by running summer schemes during the long school vacation. Not only football and basketball, but trips out to swimming pools, bowling alleys and cricket grounds. Last summer, almost 500 youngsters took part. Heartened by the manifestation of community action in Edgwick Park, the local authority released \u00a396,000 from the single regeneration budget to transform the multi-sports area into an all-weather pitch with a felt surface and a robust high fence around it. The floodlights stay on until 10 most evenings and the fence takes a hell of a pounding from flying footballs. Never more so than on Thursdays, when a seemingly endless sequence of five-a-side games flow from end to end under the guidance of Football Association coaches John Robinson and Lincoln Libird. \"There were some difficulties at first because some characters wanted to run the show their way,\" Robinson admits. \"We had to make it fun and earn respect. Now the park's full of kids who just want to play football.\" That's all Ben Williams ever wanted to do. He's 15 now but was only 10 when the scheme started. \"I jumped at the chance to play,\" he says. \"This park used to feel really dangerous. It was full of people who were either drunk or on drugs. We don't see them now.\" It would be wrong to give the impression that Edgwick Park has become some kind of idyllic sylvan glade. There is still dog shit and shards of broken glass on some of the paths. And there is still some hideous racist graffiti on the shelter. But out on the all-weather pitch, there are 25 youngsters - Asian, Afro-Caribbean, mixed-race and white, plus a few asylum seekers from Somalia, Albania and the Congo. They all want to play football.

Public expenditure is always high on any election agenda. Should we spend more or less on public services? This election all three major parties want more expenditure, but this will not end the disputes. </p> <p>There have been two defining spending events in our recent history. The first was Margaret Thatcher's first white paper published in her first year as prime minister in 1979. Its opening statement read: \"Public expenditure is at the heart of Britain's present economic difficulties.\" </p> <p>It was that white paper which led to 18 years of Tory squeeze. Of course, not all services and not at all times. The recession in the early 1990s, which they helped create, pushed up the cost of social security (via unemployment) from 10% of GDP in 1990 to 13.3% in 1993. But 1979 set the climate. </p> <p>The second defining event was last November, when Tony Blair acknowledged the unacceptably low level of public spending in Britain over the last 20 years: \"Who can seriously doubt that Britain has been chronically under-invested in for over 20 years? We have the fourth biggest economy in the world. Yet we do not have the fourth best public services.\" </p> <p>Public expenditure had already begun to rise by then, thanks to Gordon Brown's overlapping three-year spending programmes that followed two tough years of Labour squeeze.

      "bodyText": "Unpublicised and thus unreported, the one publication capable of resolving some of the forthcoming bitter election disputes over who spent what on whom was released last week. Public expenditure is always high on any election agenda. Should we spend more or less on public services? This election all three major parties want more expenditure, but this will not end the disputes. There have been two defining spending events in our recent history. The first was Margaret Thatcher's first white paper published in her first year as prime minister in 1979. Its opening statement read: \"Public expenditure is at the heart of Britain's present economic difficulties.\" It was that white paper which led to 18 years of Tory squeeze. Of course, not all services and not at all times. The recession in the early 1990s, which they helped create, pushed up the cost of social security (via unemployment) from 10% of GDP in 1990 to 13.3% in 1993. But 1979 set the climate. The second defining event was last November, when Tony Blair acknowledged the unacceptably low level of public spending in Britain over the last 20 years: \"Who can seriously doubt that Britain has been chronically under-invested in for over 20 years? We have the fourth biggest economy in the world. Yet we do not have the fourth best public services.\" Public expenditure had already begun to rise by then, thanks to Gordon Brown's overlapping three-year spending programmes that followed two tough years of Labour squeeze. But it was on November 22 that Labour clearly signalled it would go into this election restoring public spending as a public virtue - and the Tories recognised they too would have to support a more limited but real rise in spending. So what emerges from the 140 pages of figures in Public Expenditure: Statistical Analyses 2001-02 from HM Treasury? Hold on to three facts. Public spending as a proportion of national income at the end of the fourth year of a Blair government is the lowest for 27 years, averaging 38.7%, compared to Major's 41.4%, Thatcher's 43%, Wilson/Callaghan's 45.4%, Heath's 41.4% and Wilson's 39.9%.

      "body": "<p>When Rachel Carson published Silent Spring in 1962, she conjured up an image of spring bereft of birds caused by insidious, unchecked pollution and the profligate use of pesticides by agriculture. Such a simple yet terrifying idea inspired a generation and contributed to the rise of the modern environmental movement. In Britain this spring, a silence is is descending on agriculture itself. For a countryside which owes its character to farming, this silence is also terrifying.</p> <p> Out of the silence will emerge a debate about what shape the future countryside will take. It will be motivated by competing interests and cultural, political and economic agendas. Despite the feelings of despair surrounding the present countryside crisis, there are many options. </p> <p>One real possibility is that agriculture may regroup to become even more intensive, sacrificing the small farmers on uneconomic land. National Farmers' Union leaders in London will almost certainly pressurise the government to return to the same system as before foot and mouth. The supermarkets may press to be rid of livestock auctions so they can deal directly with farmers. However much environment minister Michael Meacher may want a return to small abattoirs, this may not happen. </p> <p>However, new forms of agriculture may emerge which are subsidised to produce environmental benefit rather than food production. By design or default, large areas of Britain may be left to the processes of wild nature. </p> <p>It could be argued that the present countryside crisis is the opposite of Silent Spring: as agriculture suffers, wildlife flourishes. It may also be argued that the decline in agriculture should be treated in the same way as mining, steel working and ship building. Many areas that lost their heavy industry have gained improved environments. Others haven't. Agriculture could go either way. However, political forces in the countryside, together with the cultural significance of our farmed landscapes, mean that significant change will be resisted. </p> <p>If the sheep and cattle are gone and the grip of agriculture which shaped out landscapes is wrested by one crisis too many, the wild will slowly reclaim the countryside. Seed and root, leaf and wing will push out from woods, stream banks and hedges, and the forest in waiting will make its return journey from obscure corners in the land. In many parts of the country, particularly the uplands, wild nature is gathering for an opportunity denied for generations. But such an opportunity is met by a fear of nature being out of control. </p> <p>In recent years much thinking, research and discussion among conservation bodies has circled around the idea of reforming agriculture, by getting rid of sheep. For a long time, conservationists have been campaigning against overgrazing to restore the ecology of the uplands, so well described by Chris Baines in these pages last week. Slowly, official attitudes are beginning to swing behind this fewer-sheep-is-better campaign. At the moment, any debate about this is tricky because of the terrible hardship being faced by many farmers. </p> <p>The National Trust is worried that, in the Lake District for example, it is not just the uniquely adapted breed of Herdwick sheep which are endangered, but the uniquely adapted breed of hill farmers too. David Riddle, assistant director of estates for the National Trust, says: \"Lower levels of grazing in the short term may not cause damage in the Lake District and will have ecological benefit. Losing sheep and the farmers may not be a disaster for wildlife habitats but it would be a cultural, social and economic disaster, and have a fundamental change on the landscape. The National Trust recognises that the value of landscape, the wildlife, and public access depends on farmers. As a society we have to decide what are the products we want from the countryside and there will be a readjusting about what we expect from it.\" </p> <p>It is possible to be sympathetic towards farmers and their families and still appreciate that nature is creating an opportunity for change far greater than any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. </p> <p>Mark Avery, director of conservation for the RSPB, says: \"In the short term we must have great sympathy with farmers. However, the prime minister's speech on March 6 pointed to a silver lining in the crisis, and this is a rethink on food and farming. While there is no pleasure to be taken in present difficulties, it is possible to think of a new start with new energy and to involve people in affected areas such as the Lake District, Wales and Devon in finding different ways of moving forward.\" </p> <p>In the Lake District, recent reports on the foot and mouth crisis have focused on the threat from scrub which, left unchecked by grazing sheep, would spread to ruin the beauty of the landscape and scare away the tourists. </p> <p>Scrub is often used as a derisory term but it really describes young or emerging woodland. According to environmental consultant Peter Taylor: \"There has been much scaremongering about the fear of scrub making the countryside look neglected.

      "bodyText": "When Rachel Carson published Silent Spring in 1962, she conjured up an image of spring bereft of birds caused by insidious, unchecked pollution and the profligate use of pesticides by agriculture. Such a simple yet terrifying idea inspired a generation and contributed to the rise of the modern environmental movement. In Britain this spring, a silence is is descending on agriculture itself. For a countryside which owes its character to farming, this silence is also terrifying. Out of the silence will emerge a debate about what shape the future countryside will take. It will be motivated by competing interests and cultural, political and economic agendas. Despite the feelings of despair surrounding the present countryside crisis, there are many options. One real possibility is that agriculture may regroup to become even more intensive, sacrificing the small farmers on uneconomic land. National Farmers' Union leaders in London will almost certainly pressurise the government to return to the same system as before foot and mouth. The supermarkets may press to be rid of livestock auctions so they can deal directly with farmers. However much environment minister Michael Meacher may want a return to small abattoirs, this may not happen. However, new forms of agriculture may emerge which are subsidised to produce environmental benefit rather than food production. By design or default, large areas of Britain may be left to the processes of wild nature. It could be argued that the present countryside crisis is the opposite of Silent Spring: as agriculture suffers, wildlife flourishes. It may also be argued that the decline in agriculture should be treated in the same way as mining, steel working and ship building. Many areas that lost their heavy industry have gained improved environments. Others haven't. Agriculture could go either way. However, political forces in the countryside, together with the cultural significance of our farmed landscapes, mean that significant change will be resisted. If the sheep and cattle are gone and the grip of agriculture which shaped out landscapes is wrested by one crisis too many, the wild will slowly reclaim the countryside. Seed and root, leaf and wing will push out from woods, stream banks and hedges, and the forest in waiting will make its return journey from obscure corners in the land. In many parts of the country, particularly the uplands, wild nature is gathering for an opportunity denied for generations. But such an opportunity is met by a fear of nature being out of control. In recent years much thinking, research and discussion among conservation bodies has circled around the idea of reforming agriculture, by getting rid of sheep. For a long time, conservationists have been campaigning against overgrazing to restore the ecology of the uplands, so well described by Chris Baines in these pages last week. Slowly, official attitudes are beginning to swing behind this fewer-sheep-is-better campaign. At the moment, any debate about this is tricky because of the terrible hardship being faced by many farmers. The National Trust is worried that, in the Lake District for example, it is not just the uniquely adapted breed of Herdwick sheep which are endangered, but the uniquely adapted breed of hill farmers too. David Riddle, assistant director of estates for the National Trust, says: \"Lower levels of grazing in the short term may not cause damage in the Lake District and will have ecological benefit. Losing sheep and the farmers may not be a disaster for wildlife habitats but it would be a cultural, social and economic disaster, and have a fundamental change on the landscape. The National Trust recognises that the value of landscape, the wildlife, and public access depends on farmers. As a society we have to decide what are the products we want from the countryside and there will be a readjusting about what we expect from it.\" It is possible to be sympathetic towards farmers and their families and still appreciate that nature is creating an opportunity for change far greater than any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Mark Avery, director of conservation for the RSPB, says: \"In the short term we must have great sympathy with farmers. However, the prime minister's speech on March 6 pointed to a silver lining in the crisis, and this is a rethink on food and farming. While there is no pleasure to be taken in present difficulties, it is possible to think of a new start with new energy and to involve people in affected areas such as the Lake District, Wales and Devon in finding different ways of moving forward.\" In the Lake District, recent reports on the foot and mouth crisis have focused on the threat from scrub which, left unchecked by grazing sheep, would spread to ruin the beauty of the landscape and scare away the tourists. Scrub is often used as a derisory term but it really describes young or emerging woodland. According to environmental consultant Peter Taylor: \"There has been much scaremongering about the fear of scrub making the countryside look neglected. But we can think of it instead as a rewilding of the uplands with a positive message about new trees, species reintroductions and sustaining communities through the kind of sylvo-pastoralism practised in parts of the continent.\" A kind of sylvo-pastoralism, grazing using woodland pasture instead of open fields or grassy moorland, has been practised in Britain for centuries, but only tiny fragments of it remain because of farming intensification. By using small suckler herds of cattle, ponies and deer instead of sheep, large areas of new woodland in the uplands could be ecologically enriched and reinvigorated. This sort of farming requires more space for animals to range and that too may be a consequence of foot and mouth. There are environmentalists who would dearly love to see an end to farming in upland areas of Britain and a return to wilderness exclusive of any human intervention. There are also those who favour a recolonisation of wilder areas by people seeking a lifestyle closer to nature's rhythms and further away from modern urban life. There are many who want to preserve the cultural landscape character of places like the Lake District, with its wide-open spaces maintained by sheep grazing, and find the prospect of new woodland an anathema. The story of Silent Spring not only helped to start the environmental movement, it also coincided with the intensification of agriculture. We may have come full circle in that environmental concerns will reshape agriculture and in so doing, reshape the countryside. But promoting the value and potential of scrub will require courage. \u0095 Paul Evans is a Guardian country diarist.",

      "bodyText": "A woman prison officer was last night taken hostage in a cell by a male prisoner. Police were called to Wakefield prison, West Yorkshire, after a member of staff was barricaded in a cell by a prisoner at 7.30pm, the prison service confirmed. \"We have one prisoner who has taken one member of staff hostage. The situation is contained, things are quite calm and there is no compromise to public safety,\" a spokeswoman said. \"At this stage we do not know anything about any demands. There is no evidence of the prisoner having any weapons or having harmed the member of staff,\" she added. It was at Wakefield prison that killer and kidnapper Michael Sams imprisoned Julia Flack, the wife of the Archdeacon of Pontefract, John Flack, in 1995. Sams, who was given four life sentences for murder, including the killing of Leeds teenager Julie Dart, and kidnapping Stephanie Slater, an estate agent, in 1993, was believed to have been trying to draw attention to his grievances as an inmate. He had eight years added to his four life sentences in 1997 for the false imprisonment of Mrs Flack, a probation officer, whom he tried to throttle with a key chain. The prison service recently announced that Wakefield would house a \u00a3500,000 special unit to hold some of the most dangerous men in Britain's prisons. Wakefield prison was designated a dispersal prison in 1966 and is now a \"lifer main centre\" with the focus on serious sex offenders. It accepts all suitable prisoners from within its catchment area. The prison service would not say how many women officers work at the unit, but some 15% of uniformed officers throughout the service are female. The decision to open the \"exceptional risk regime\" was made after \"serious flaws\" were discovered in a three-year-old experimental control unit at Woodhill prison, near Milton Keynes. An academic evaluation published in January of the segregation unit in Woodhill's D wing, which held up to 48 of the most dangerous and disruptive inmates, concluded that it was seriously flawed. The chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, condemned the regime's isolation of inmates for long periods as a risk to their mental health, and questioned its legality. The Wakefield unit, expected to open in the autumn, will allow prisoners televisions and computers in their cells, and they will be able to receive visits and telephone calls and have exercise daily. It is set to hold such men as Charles Bronson, the armed robber and hostage taker, and Robert Maudsley, nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for the way he murdered three fellow inmates.",

      "body": "<p>The pleasant young man with the rifle arrived shortly after breakfast yesterday, and it was all over by lunchtime, not that anyone had much appetite. The vet was close behind him. She pronounced the herd disease-free but, on the other hand, dead.</p> <p>And so, in a couple of hours on a cool spring morning, the Dukes Farm herd of 80 pedigree Limousin cattle were slaughtered, having been built up over the past 17 years by Ken and Ruth Watkins. Theirs was one of nine - nine! - farms wiped out over the past two days in the Herefordshire parish of Craswall, not because they had foot and mouth but because they all bordered Forest Farm, which did.</p> <p>These animals don't even turn up in the statistics on the news, the ones supposedly showing that the disease is slowing down. \"It's as though we're being buried in an unmarked grave,\" said Ruth.</p> <p>Craswall is a huge, beautiful, chilly place, nestling on the edge of the Black Mountains, just before England becomes Wales. It is about the size of Manhattan, but with barely 100 families, nearly all of whom had cattle and/or sheep. On Monday the army, the police and the men in overalls moved in.</p> <p>They had all gone by yesterday afternoon. In the corners of fields were those neat piles farmers love. Until you got close, it was hard to tell what was what. Some were just piles of straw; some were logs; some were piles of fodder beet, now redundant. Most comprised sheep, legs upwards, sometimes with their lambs alongside in a ghastly tableau. There was no sound, except muted birdsong and a barking dog.</p> <p>The Watkinses bred Limousins thoughtfully, carefully and with a quiet passion. I know because they are friends and neighbours. On special occasions, we might have roast beef from their herd, which helped us understand the difference between what you buy in supermarkets - and food.</p> <p>They got the news on Friday, after which slaughter was scheduled within two days. Maff time being what it is, that meant four days. It was an odd time for the family, their moods veering between optimism and depression, emotion and hard-headedness. Three weeks ago Ken had sat at our table and talked about how slaughter might be a good thing: it would force the decision he had contemplated but resisted for years. He is a craftsman in oak and does not need the aggravation all stock-farming has delivered lately.</p> <p>This echoes a widespread feeling among farmers. Those who get culled get paid; those still in the game get nothing but have to keep paying for feed. (As one put it to me: \"We can't buy. We can't sell. We can't shift 'em. We can't move on. We can't give up. We're stuck.\") This makes it impossible to believe that at least some of the 1,200 cases have not been deliberately self-inflicted.</p> <p>But economic theory sometimes gets overtaken by emotion. A small breeding herd is not normally just destined for the slaughterhouse. They have names; they have personalities. Each year's calves have names beginning with the same letter, like a car registration plate. The 2001 crop were all supposed to be S, yet until yesterday Ken was still feeding cows called Drusilla and Gazette. And he was very proud of his bull, Waindale Onthemove - nothing much to look at, especially after a hard winter's shagging - but a successful 132-stone patriarch.</p> <p>Yet the Watkinses supported the cull, as did the other Craswall farmers. There were two meetings over the weekend, attended by almost all those affected, and at neither was there serious opposition to the policy. The anger is directed at the implementation, and the perceived incompetence of the bureaucracy, even after two months of crisis. Maff is turning into a generic: \"You've made a right maff of that.\"</p> <p>In Herefordshire, the problems are doubled because a few miles away - across a border wandering sheep refuse to respect - the cull is controlled by the Welsh assembly. There is no evidence of contact between the sets of officials.</p> <p>Ken witnessed an example of the system's madness yesterday, after his herd were shot. The vet saw four unidentified sheep in the area to be culled. Under the rules, they had to go. But the rules also forced her to ring Maff in Worcester for permission. She did not even have a special number, but had to wait on the notorious helpline like everyone else.</p> <p>Anger was not, however, the predominant mood. As the slaughterman worked, Ken and Ruth sat inside with their elder son, Michael, listening to Mozart, which did not entirely drown out the shots. The younger children had been sent away so when the shooting stopped, the farm was quiet. \"There's a huge sense of relief,\" said Ken. \"I was afraid the cattle would be clutching the wall in terror, but they assured me they never get out of a state of bemusement.\"</p> <p>The next few days will be difficult. But he's looking beyond that. \"It's going to feel very strange not to spend every morning and evening of my life feeding and looking after cattle. At the moment I don't know what it means but I feel it's going to be a liberation. I don't intend to farm again.\"</p> <p>Michael, who at 17 has been rock-like while his parents' mood has shifted over the past few days, is more than ever convinced that he wants a less fraught career. It is Ruth who seems least certain: \"You can't have 70,000 square miles of theme park. My great-grandfather kept a milking herd in the heart of London. I don't think I can let it die.\"</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br> <br> <b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> <br> <b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471277,00.html\">10:04:2001: Illegal sheep movements being investigated</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471187,00.html\">10.4.2001: Virus spreads as calls for vaccination grow</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471050,00.html\">10.4.2001: Villages fight for pastoral sympathy</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,470556,00.html\">09.04.2001: Councils refusing to reopen footpaths</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,470612,00.html\">09.04.2001: Hopes raised as figures for new cases stay stable</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469559,00.html\">06.04.2001: \u00a3120m boost for tourism</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469518,00.html\">06.04.2001, comment: Pig in the middle</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469265,00.html\">06.04.2001: Burial mound suggested to cut west's surplus of carcasses</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469284,00.html\">06.04.2001: Man shot in head with bolt gun dies</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469370,00.html\">06.04.2001, analysis: No reason to be cheerful -

It is about the size of Manhattan, but with barely 100 families, nearly all of whom had cattle and/or sheep. On Monday the army, the police and the men in overalls moved in. They had all gone by yesterday afternoon. In the corners of fields were those neat piles farmers love. Until you got close, it was hard to tell what was what. Some were just piles of straw; some were logs; some were piles of fodder beet, now redundant. Most comprised sheep, legs upwards, sometimes with their lambs alongside in a ghastly tableau. There was no sound, except muted birdsong and a barking dog. The Watkinses bred Limousins thoughtfully, carefully and with a quiet passion. I know because they are friends and neighbours. On special occasions, we might have roast beef from their herd, which helped us understand the difference between what you buy in supermarkets - and food. They got the news on Friday, after which slaughter was scheduled within two days. Maff time being what it is, that meant four days. It was an odd time for the family, their moods veering between optimism and depression, emotion and hard-headedness. Three weeks ago Ken had sat at our table and talked about how slaughter might be a good thing: it would force the decision he had contemplated but resisted for years. He is a craftsman in oak and does not need the aggravation all stock-farming has delivered lately. This echoes a widespread feeling among farmers. Those who get culled get paid; those still in the game get nothing but have to keep paying for feed. (As one put it to me: \"We can't buy. We can't sell. We can't shift 'em. We can't move on. We can't give up. We're stuck.\") This makes it impossible to believe that at least some of the 1,200 cases have not been deliberately self-inflicted. But economic theory sometimes gets overtaken by emotion. A small breeding herd is not normally just destined for the slaughterhouse. They have names; they have personalities. Each year's calves have names beginning with the same letter, like a car registration plate. The 2001 crop were all supposed to be S, yet until yesterday Ken was still feeding cows called Drusilla and Gazette. And he was very proud of his bull, Waindale Onthemove - nothing much to look at, especially after a hard winter's shagging - but a successful 132-stone patriarch. Yet the Watkinses supported the cull, as did the other Craswall farmers. There were two meetings over the weekend, attended by almost all those affected, and at neither was there serious opposition to the policy. The anger is directed at the implementation, and the perceived incompetence of the bureaucracy, even after two months of crisis. Maff is turning into a generic: \"You've made a right maff of that.\" In Herefordshire, the problems are doubled because a few miles away - across a border wandering sheep refuse to respect - the cull is controlled by the Welsh assembly. There is no evidence of contact between the sets of officials. Ken witnessed an example of the system's madness yesterday, after his herd were shot. The vet saw four unidentified sheep in the area to be culled. Under the rules, they had to go. But the rules also forced her to ring Maff in Worcester for permission. She did not even have a special number, but had to wait on the notorious helpline like everyone else. Anger was not, however, the predominant mood. As the slaughterman worked, Ken and Ruth sat inside with their elder son, Michael, listening to Mozart, which did not entirely drown out the shots. The younger children had been sent away so when the shooting stopped, the farm was quiet. \"There's a huge sense of relief,\" said Ken. \"I was afraid the cattle would be clutching the wall in terror, but they assured me they never get out of a state of bemusement.\" The next few days will be difficult. But he's looking beyond that. \"It's going to feel very strange not to spend every morning and evening of my life feeding and looking after cattle. At the moment I don't know what it means but I feel it's going to be a liberation. I don't intend to farm again.\" Michael, who at 17 has been rock-like while his parents' mood has shifted over the past few days, is more than ever convinced that he wants a less fraught career. It is Ruth who seems least certain: \"You can't have 70,000 square miles of theme park. My great-grandfather kept a milking herd in the heart of London. I don't think I can let it die.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

As the number of daily outbreaks climbed to 41, the highest total for more than a week, bringing the overall total to 1,205, West Mercia police said they were launching an inquiry into illegal movements of animals. It follows increasing concern by the Ministry of Agriculture that the disease is still not under control in some places and that it is being spread into new areas by the transport of animals. Yesterday 10 new cases were confirmed in Gloucestershire. An official report commissioned by Tony Blair disclosed that trading standard officers had investigated 309 cases of alleged illegal livestock movements since the outbreak began and that many more were in the pipeline. Many of these are thought to have been in Powys where 62 allegations are being investigated. One farmer is reported to be close to being prosecuted and could face a fine of up to \u00a35,000 if found guilty. Many are being investigated as a result of anonymous tip-offs by members of the public. \"We have people calling us who notice that a field which was previously empty one day has animals in it the next,\" said a council spokesman. Police have also begun investigating allegations of fraudulent claims for compensation during the foot and mouth crisis. These were highlighted at the start of the epidemic and centre on the practice of a few farmers who \"bed and breakfast\" livestock, or lend them out to neighbouring farmers in order to claim EU subsidies. Maff yesterday would neither confirm nor deny reports that it had asked police to look into a possible incident of a farmer deliberately infecting his livestock to get compensation. But a retired Derbyshire sheep farmer suggested this week that the practice was common in the 1967 epidemic. He said: \"There were gangs doing it.

Acccusing ministers of trying to take the heat off themselves, he said: \"They have been mak ing these insinuations almost from the start, suggesting it was farmers who were responsible for spreading the disease, rather than recognising their own incompetence for not bringing it under control. Meanwhile, Maff was accused of suppressing some statistics on the numbers of animals affected by foot and mouth after rising embarrassment over the failure to reach slaughter targets. Although, over three weeks, there has been gradually increasing censorship, a daily total of animals to be killed and already slaughtered has always been given. But this stopped yesterday. The number of animals condemned because of infection or close proximity to the disease had reached 1,366,000 by Sunday night, but with only 888,000 killed, it was clear that Tony Blair's pledge to make sure the culling rate was kept up to halt the infection was not being kept.

No figures of total numbers to be killed, actually killed, or carcasses to be disposed off were available. \"We are worried they might not be accurate so we are not giving them any more, but we are having a meeting to see if we can update them accurately in the future.\" By contrast, the intervention board, a government agency which is charged with operating the animal welfare slaughter scheme, is completely open about its operations. Farmers who cannot cope with their stock because of movement restrictions imposed six weeks ago and whose animals are suffering as a result can apply to have them slaughtered and collect 90% of the market value from the government. Yesterday there had been 5,649 applications to have 1,769,633 animals killed, more than two thirds of them sheep and their lambs. So far only 85,132 had been killed but the capacity had been increased so 25,000 were slaughtered yesterday and the figure would increase to 300,000 a week. The board admitted it had run into difficulties with its plan to landfill most of the carcasses because local authorities wanted to impose restrictions - for example, only accepting animals from their own county.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If the scourge of foot and mouth spreads through the Lake District fell country, it will be the biggest disaster to hit the area during the 90 years of my lifetime - no, for even longer. Unless it is quickly checked, the disease will not only ruin the scenery of a million postcards, but shatter a long-established way of country life, wreck the tourist industry and destroy the area as we know it today.</p> <p>This is because the fell farmers and their sheep - particularly the hardy, indigenous Herdwicks - are really the architects of the scenery. If the sheep are slaughtered and the fells cleared, it will change everything. Rough scrubland and coarse grasses will quickly take over the landscape. Moss, bogs and marshes will proliferate. Gorse and juniper will spread. The close-cropped upland pastures will disappear. The old stone walls will crumble. The whole landscape will harshen and deteriorate. The Lake District will disappear.</p> <p>The disease reached the Lake District fell country for the first time the other day - at the lonely farm of Black Hall in the upper reaches of the Duddon valley. Two or three miles to the southwest, across the unfenced fells, are some of the Herdwick farms that Beatrix Potter bought from the proceeds of her little books. She had many, many thousands of them.</p> <p>The first Herdwick sheep probably came with Norse settlers in the 10th century, although they may have already been part of the flocks of the Cistercian monks of Furness Abbey, who first farmed the Lakeland dales. Either way, they have been indigenous to the area for 1,000 years: stolid, patient animals with sad, but rather noble, white faces, the \"little grey sheep\" of a hundred books and poems.</p> <p>Unlike lowland sheep or cattle, contained in their fields, Herdwicks roam the fells, seeking the sweetest grass. With their rather tough, oily wool, they live up in the mountains in all weathers - apart from lambing, dipping and shearing times, when they are briefly brought down to the \"inbye\" fields adjoining the farmstead. There are no fences on the high land and sheep pass freely from one farmer's grazing acres to the next farmer's sheep run. (Stray sheep are exchanged at the annual shepherds' meets, the farmers immediately identifying their own by the \"smit\" marks made by dye on the fleece of the sheep, and the \"lug\" marks on their ears.)</p> <p>But the most remarkable feature of the Herdwicks is their homing instinct. On the fell they are \"heafed\" to their own part of the mountain. That is to say, they and their families always graze that area, and if taken away for lambing, return there instinctively. This homing instinct, once destroyed through mass slaughter, may never be restored.</p> <p>They would be sorely missed at the dinner table, too. Their mutton, when slowly cooked in a Lakeland farmhouse oven and topped with a rich, golden crust, is superb; and Herdwick mutton is said to have been on the menu at Buckingham Palace on several ceremonial occasions.</p> <p>There are other mountain sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep most likely to be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland.</p> <p>If they and their shepherds go, that is the end of the Lakeland where I have climbed, walked, skied and skated for nearly 80 years; of the Lakeland I have written about nearly all my life.</p> <p>When I try to picture the Lakeland without the Herdwicks and the farmers, my thoughts go back to Grisedale - The Valley That Died, as it was called in a television film and a book about it. This is not one of the two Lakeland Grisedales but the Grisedale in the Yorkshire dales, above Garsdale.</p> <p>This lovely, lonely, upland valley was a favourite corner of mine, the homeland of a happy farming community of perhaps a dozen families until economic conditions drove all but one of them away.

      "bodyText": "If the scourge of foot and mouth spreads through the Lake District fell country, it will be the biggest disaster to hit the area during the 90 years of my lifetime - no, for even longer. Unless it is quickly checked, the disease will not only ruin the scenery of a million postcards, but shatter a long-established way of country life, wreck the tourist industry and destroy the area as we know it today. This is because the fell farmers and their sheep - particularly the hardy, indigenous Herdwicks - are really the architects of the scenery. If the sheep are slaughtered and the fells cleared, it will change everything. Rough scrubland and coarse grasses will quickly take over the landscape. Moss, bogs and marshes will proliferate. Gorse and juniper will spread. The close-cropped upland pastures will disappear. The old stone walls will crumble. The whole landscape will harshen and deteriorate. The Lake District will disappear. The disease reached the Lake District fell country for the first time the other day - at the lonely farm of Black Hall in the upper reaches of the Duddon valley. Two or three miles to the southwest, across the unfenced fells, are some of the Herdwick farms that Beatrix Potter bought from the proceeds of her little books. She had many, many thousands of them. The first Herdwick sheep probably came with Norse settlers in the 10th century, although they may have already been part of the flocks of the Cistercian monks of Furness Abbey, who first farmed the Lakeland dales. Either way, they have been indigenous to the area for 1,000 years: stolid, patient animals with sad, but rather noble, white faces, the \"little grey sheep\" of a hundred books and poems. Unlike lowland sheep or cattle, contained in their fields, Herdwicks roam the fells, seeking the sweetest grass. With their rather tough, oily wool, they live up in the mountains in all weathers - apart from lambing, dipping and shearing times, when they are briefly brought down to the \"inbye\" fields adjoining the farmstead. There are no fences on the high land and sheep pass freely from one farmer's grazing acres to the next farmer's sheep run. (Stray sheep are exchanged at the annual shepherds' meets, the farmers immediately identifying their own by the \"smit\" marks made by dye on the fleece of the sheep, and the \"lug\" marks on their ears.) But the most remarkable feature of the Herdwicks is their homing instinct. On the fell they are \"heafed\" to their own part of the mountain. That is to say, they and their families always graze that area, and if taken away for lambing, return there instinctively. This homing instinct, once destroyed through mass slaughter, may never be restored. They would be sorely missed at the dinner table, too. Their mutton, when slowly cooked in a Lakeland farmhouse oven and topped with a rich, golden crust, is superb; and Herdwick mutton is said to have been on the menu at Buckingham Palace on several ceremonial occasions. There are other mountain sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep most likely to be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland. If they and their shepherds go, that is the end of the Lakeland where I have climbed, walked, skied and skated for nearly 80 years; of the Lakeland I have written about nearly all my life. When I try to picture the Lakeland without the Herdwicks and the farmers, my thoughts go back to Grisedale - The Valley That Died, as it was called in a television film and a book about it. This is not one of the two Lakeland Grisedales but the Grisedale in the Yorkshire dales, above Garsdale. This lovely, lonely, upland valley was a favourite corner of mine, the homeland of a happy farming community of perhaps a dozen families until economic conditions drove all but one of them away. They left behind a graveyard of ruined farmhouses, with the roofs fallen in and bedsteads, cookers and armchairs abandoned; a child's toy here, a broken bicycle there. But it was the state of the valley that most hit me when I returned - soured pastures, overgrown paths, once-green meadows now full of swamps and rushes, field walls falling down and dereliction everywhere. In recent years the dale has recovered a little and the Forestry Commission has moved in, but the Grisedale of years ago - sparkling streams and new lambs leaping in the meadows - has gone for ever. Will the Lake District suffer the same sad fate? \u0095 A Harry Griffin has been writing a country diary for the Guardian from the Lake District for 50 years.

The decision was announced by the county's foot and mouth taskforce which has negotiated the openings to appeal to visitors eager to walk in the Lake District and beyond dur ing the Easter break. \"All the routes have been carefully considered on a risk assessment basis using guidelines agreed in the county between the taskforce and Maff,\" a spokesman said. Routes open include a newly fenced path to Shepherd's Crag in Borrowdale, a popular spot for climbers, and shore walks by Ullswater. The car park at Gowbarrow will also reopen. A route will be available down the western side of Thirlmere and the Lodore landing stage on Derwentwater will come back into use, enabling visitors to take cruises and to walk around the lake. Many routes are in areas on the west coast and on the fringes of the national park. Other paths are to be investigated. \"With new cases still being confirmed in the county, the utmost care is taken [over] each path or site to ensure it meets risk assessment criteria,\" the spokesman added.

His widow says they are afraid of her murdered husband's ghost. Still, many of the workers cling to the final hope of getting a share of Calgary. \"The idea of wanting land was always there. It is very important to many poor Zimbabweans. During this war veterans' campaign we thought we would have our own land but we haven't got it,\" said another farm hand. \"Now some of the workers are wondering if the farm is not being saved for someone else, someone important in the government. Otherwise why don't they just give us the land?\" Mr Wheeler has drawn comfort from the crisis on his farm. \"They have proved they don't know what they are doing. They will have to give us the land back or the country is finished,\" he said. But it is not that straightforward. Well over 100,000 Zimbabweans have signed up to receive a parcel of the two-thirds of white-owned land earmarked for redistribution. The government has yet to let them loose on the farms, but the presidential election looms - it must be held within a year - and it may suit President Robert Mugabe to entice voters and disrupt the opposition with a new and much larger round of land occupations. Some of the workers on Calgary are sceptical that they will benefit. The only winners there are Cpl Mapfumo and his followers living comfortably on the hill. \"They will all cling to the houses,\" said a farm hand. \"That is what they wanted all along. They were never interested in the land.\"",

The logic of this - not easy to achieve in real life - is that supermarkets ought to raise prices as long as the extra income goes to the producer rather than to the customer.

In the middle of the foot and mouth crisis the company that sells 25% of our food quietly published results which - to borrow a phrase from competitor Sainsbury's duff advertising campaign of 1999 - were really something to shout about. After a two-year competition commission investigation into whether the supermarkets make excessive profits and an off the cuff remark from the prime minister earlier this year about the supermarkets having their suppliers in \"an armlock\", it would not have been surprising to see the beleagured farmers' groups wading into battle against the grocer once again.

Among those celebrating were Steve Hoggett, Scott Graham and Vicki Coles of the physical theatre company Frantic Assembly. But they didn't know whether to laugh or cry. </p> <p>The trio were thrilled that BAC, their base, had been recognised for its work in encouraging experimental new work. But they were devastated that their own company appeared to have been passed over by the Arts Council's theatre review. </p> <p>If there is any company in Britain that seems to fulfil the Arts Council's desire to support a talented new generation of artists, it is Frantic Assembly. Yet they went away empty-handed from what was billed as the biggest bonanza in British theatre. \"It was the worst day of our lives,\" says Coles. \"We didn't just feel disappointed. We felt completely isolated, as if we weren't part of British theatre. We felt further down the scale than we've ever felt.\" </p> <p>They are not alone. Charlotte Jones of the Independent Theatre Council, an organisation that represents many small and medium-sized companies, points out that only 80 out of the 500 companies represented by the ITC benefited from the allocation of funding through the theatre review. </p> <p>Many of these companies feel betrayed and upset, and many are wary of talking about what has happened for fear of sounding like whingers. Some are also concerned that speaking out will jeopardise their chances of future funding. </p> <p>Others, such as Frantic and Nick Sweeting, the producer of a number of small companies including Improbable and Told By an Idiot, are rather braver. Like Frantic, Told by an Idiot was passed over in the theatre review; Improbable, which is already attracting international attention, was offered only a \u00a350,000 national touring contract starting in 2002/3. Sweeting is still looking for clarification from the Arts Council as to what strings, if any, are attached to this money. </p> <p>But all is not completely lost for companies that, after years of being told that they would be the next to get on the funding ladder, have come away from the review feeling poorer than ever. While most of the \u00a325m has gone to the regional repertory theatres, \u00a32m has been held back. This money will be distributed between the regional arts boards. The intention is that a limited number of companies will be invited to apply for these funds, which will be awarded as fixed-term contracts coming on tap in 2003/4. </p> <p>Unfortunately, nobody thought to tell the companies about the \u00a32m. The arts boards are now hurriedly putting in place mechanisms by which this can be distributed. </p> <p>Nicola Thorold, director of drama at the Arts Council, says that we should be celebrating the fact that this money, together with that already distributed, means that independent companies will be benefiting to the tune of over \u00a34.5m. Charlotte Jones thinks it is great too, but points out that \"all of the Arts Council strategy could have been met by the small-scale companies and for very much less than \u00a325m\". </p> <p>Jones has her own agenda, which places less emphasis on the role of the regional reps. But she speaks for many companies when she says how dissatisfied they are at the lack of consultation about the way the money was allocated. \"The actual recipients were not involved in the strategic process. The amounts given seem arbitrary,\" she says. </p> <p>Astonishingly, Jones says she knows companies that have been given more money than they may actually have wanted, or even know what to do with. \"If they had been asked what they needed, they might have requested less. But they were never given that responsibility.\" </p> <p>Even more worryingly, many independent companies feel that in the excitement of having secured the \u00a325m, the Arts Council has failed to deliver the shake-up in the funding system that The Next Step, the Arts Council's response to last year's Boyden report into the state of British theatre, appeared to promise. To put it bluntly, there is more money for the same old people while many young, innovative companies still find themselves going hungry. </p> <p>\"This was supposed to be a watershed but companies never got a chance to bid against the dinosaurs,\" says Sweeting. Frantic Assembly agree: \"The money may be new, but the system that allocates it hasn't changed and the beneficaries are the same old names.\" And, according to Jones, \"The Next Stage promised that there would be losers. Our sector was expecting to see some reps close, but actually there haven't been many losers. Lots of people have been left on the outside again.\" </p> <p>Thorold answers these criticisms by pointing out that \"we do have an appraisal process and the Arts Council is committed to looking at the best use of fixed-term agreements. As funds come to an end we will review them.\" But this is of little comfort to those who now find themselves with little or nothing. In fact, some feel their situation is worse than it was before, as funding is now tied up for the foreseeable future. As Scott Graham of Frantic puts it: \"This opportunity for change will never happen again to us or the Arts Council. We feel completely rejected.\" </p> <p>It would be a huge irony if what had been welcomed as the start of a golden age for British theatre should result in some companies leaving the country or throwing in the towel.

      "bodyText": "A team of bleary-eyed surgeons in Singapore yesterday completed a marathon 103-hour operation to separate a pair of conjoined twin sisters who were born sharing a brain cavity. Doctors said they were \"cautiously optimistic\" that Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha, from Nepal, would recover but admitted it was too early to say how much permanent brain damage they might have suffered. The girls were last night recovering - in separate rooms for the first time in their 11-month-long lives - in Singapore General Hospital's intensive care unit after more than four days on the surgeons' table. Keith Goh, the neurosurgeon who was instrumental in bringing the twins to Singapore and who led the surgical team, said: \"Happily we had no adverse events during the entire five days, so we are cautiously optimistic.\" However, he tempered the euphoria yesterday afternoon by adding: \"How they will survive only time will tell.\" Lee Seng Teik, the leading plastic surgeon in the team of 16 doctors who worked round the clock after the girls were placed under anaesthetic at 9am on Friday, doubted that everything would go smoothly in the future. \"We expect there to be problems that we will encounter as we go along, in the medium and long term,\" he said. There was some astonishment in medical circles at the length of the operation, which the Singapore surgeons said was due to the need for painstaking care in separating hundreds of tiny blood vessels which the babies' brains shared. Neurologists had to try to identify where each tangled vessel belonged before it was irrevocably cut. Other operations for craniopagus - as a join at the skull and brain is called - have lasted no more than 30 hours. The longest operation undertaken by the team of surgeons at Great Ormond Street hospital in London - one of the most experienced in the world at separating conjoined twins, although they have not separated fused brains - lasted just 18 hours. The risks are increased the longer the operation lasts. The girls, who come from Khalanga, a mountain village in Nepal, and are named after sacred rivers in India, are expected to stay in intensive care for at least two weeks, and in hospital for three months. They are still under sedation and will undergo a controlled wake-up process during the next few days. Separation occurred at about 9am (3am in Britain) yesterday, 88 hours after the actual surgery began. It took 52 hours longer than the doctors had predicted last week. Dr Goh said the mother, Sandhya Shrestha, her husband KC Bushan, and her father, Arjun Dev Shrestha, burst into tears when told the news. Dr Teik's team then began covering Jamuna's gaping brain. They first covered her head with the synthetic material Goretex to replace part of the dura, a fibrous tissue layer covering the brain. They then mixed bone material with polymer sheets to act as a base for new cells to grow. These cells are expected to become solid bone within a year. The mixture was then covered with skin taken primarily from Jamuna's back. She was wheeled out of the operating theatre at 11.10am. Ganga, whose head was \"not [looking] as nice\", according to Dr Teik, spent another five hours in surgery as the plastic surgeons completed a similar process, taking the grafted skin from her thighs. The girls were moved from a supine to a prone position and back several times during the prolonged operation. Claire Ang, one of the anaesthetists, said the team went through a whole gamut of emotions. \"It varied from hysterical to euphoric and involved light-headedness, frustration and mood swings - from being very emotional to not caring at all and just wanting to sleep,\" she said. Most of the doctors cat-napped for a couple of hours each day but said they could not sleep properly because they were constantly thinking about the unfolding drama on the operating table. Dr Goh said their after care would continue for years. \"Their brains are shaped like a tower,\" he said, using plastic models to demonstrate how the two brains were separated. \"They can't go through society with a head shaped like this.\" Even though he expects the girls to be transferred to a specialist in Nepal within months, Dr Goh promised the Singapore team would continue to monitor their progress. \"We hope to see them on a regular basis,\" he said. \"It's a lifelong commitment to look after these children.\" He expressed confidence that, as the girls' heads grew during the next 10 years, the disfiguration would diminish. \"The human body has an amazing capacity for correcting these sorts of things,\" he said. Explaining why the operation took so long, Dr Goh said the separation process was not as simple as making a straight-line cut. \"It was more like a tortuous route up the mountains,\" he said. With each of the hundreds of interwoven blood vessels the surgeons had to decide which girl it belonged to and what damage might be done by cutting it. He admitted there was bound to have been some brain damage, but that it was far too early to gauge the extent of it, or how much the girls' long-term ability to function would be impaired. Before the operation doctors said they had very distinct personalities. Ganga, who has a cleft palate, was much feistier and always hungry, while Jamuna was more shy. The girls' parents and grandfather, who had broken their vigil at the hospital only to pray at a local Hindu temple and to take an occasional shower, declined to speak publicly yesterday. But one of their uncles, Abhaya Shrestha, said from Khalanga that the whole family was delighted. \"We had only 50% hope that they would survive,\" Mr Shresta said. \"Now this is a miracle and we just can't describe how happy we all are to hear the news.\" Computer imaging made it all possible The operation to disentangle two babies' brains was only made possible by advanced computer technology devised in Singapore, writes Sarah Boseley, health editor, but it had never been used in the country before. Ben Carson, the American paediatric neurosurgeon who in 1987 was the first to separate a pair of craniopagus twins without causing brain damage, was the pioneer. Two years ago he used the imaging program to rehearse the operation on the Banda twins from Zambia, which he and his team carried out in South Africa. Dr Carson was an adviser to the Singapore surgeons in the lengthy preparation before the separation of Ganga and Jamuna. The imaging software combines a series of scans of the babies' brains to build a 3-D virtual model. The Singapore surgeons spent six months studying the brains and rehearsing. Wearing 3-D glasses, they manipulated the image by moving their hands, without buttons, keyboard or mouse. \"We made three scans of those poor babies, and then we let the surgeons see it and plan,\" researcher Luis Serra said.\"Ben Carson looked at the data, familiarised himself, then he and [neurosurgeon] Keith Goh talked about it.\" But computers could not have fully prepared the surgeons for the complexity of their task.",

They are three times the size of any cockroach I've ever seen but creepily realistic. And Fayyazi is more than fond of them: \"I'm obsessed with the creatures. I'm fascinated by them.\" </p> <p>Before the roaches it was dogs. Inspired by seeing animals run over, she sculpted 125 dead dogs for a project called Roadkill. \"I lived with the dogs, I cried over them ...\" Eventually she decided to dump them, then couldn't bear to. \"I thought, why should I get rid of them? They are part of my life. So I found an empty field, I dug a hole and I buried them.\" She filmed the burial and is now planning to make more dogs to exhibit, this time lifesize, with the film as backdrop. </p> <p>All Fayyazi's work is obsessive and very personal. \"The roaches are changing because I am changing,\" she says. \"They started out like caricatures but now they are becoming more real.\" And when she is confronted with a real cockroach she doesn't kill it. \"You know what's happened in our house?\" she muses. \"I don't see many roaches any more. Maybe they just became considerate towards us, like we are towards them. That's what I like to think.\" </p> <p>Fayyazi is in London for an exhibition of Iranian contemporary art at the Barbican, a show that should bridge the gap between the Persian carpets at the V&amp;A and shows from artists in exile such as Shirazeh Houshiary and Shirin Neshat. What is most surprising about the exhibition - at least for non-Iranians - is the prominent role played by women. </p> <p>Life has clearly become easier since the ayatollahs came to power and blacklisted artists, shut galleries and outlawed the depiction of female nudity. Since Mohammad Khatami became president in 1997, the ban on female singers performing in public has been relaxed; last year Googoosh, the \"queen of Persian pop\", got her passport back. Unveiled Lives, the film festival accompanying this exhibition, reminds us of the fine films made recently by women directors, including two shorts by Neshat, as well as a new film by Marzieh Meshkini, whose husband, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, is one of Iran's top film-makers, and whose daughter Samira Makhmalbaf made the claustrophobic allegory The Apple when she was only 17. </p> <p>But many women artists are still questioning the restrictions imposed on them. Shadi Ghadirian, at 27 the youngest artist in the show, re-creates pre-revolution Qajar-period studio portraits, posing her friends in traditional costume, sometimes veiled, sometimes with the veils lifted (a sign of protest in Qajar times), holding a ghetto blaster or a can of Pepsi. The anachronisms highlight just how strange it is that women are legally required to wear the veil today. </p> <p>Incongruity also drives the work of Ghazel, a 34-year-old video artist taking part in the exhibition. She writes, directs and stars in her Me films, a series of funny, piquant vignettes in which she sunbathes, boxes and even waterskis - all while wearing her unwieldy black chador. She says she has had all the artistic freedom she wanted, but adds: \"I never asked any permission. I don't know what would have happened if I had.\" And while she describes the veil as \"the reality of life in Iran\", she won't be drawn on whether she wore a chador before it became mandatory. </p> <p>Perhaps this obliqueness is a function of a culture of veiling: in a country where all women are veiled, it's no surprise to find work that is hidden, codified, obscured. And while Neshat's work is deeply critical of Islam, Ghazel seems to work within its traditions, however much she may question them. \"It's all about me and my paradoxes,\" she says. \"I live my parallel life with my camera.\" She went to an international school, speaking English at school and Farsi at home, and \"always felt like an outsider\". Now she divides her time between France and Iran. </p> <p>Her sense of cultural dislocation comes through most strongly in the scenes shot outside Iran. One, an ice-skating film, is a refracted reconstruction of a true story: \"I won a cup and no one came to take pictures of me.\" In the film she takes her own pictures. It's reminiscent of Tracey Emin's Turner Prize-nominated film about a disco-dancing contest in Margate, where boys yelled \"slag\" at her; in the film she goes back and dances how she wants to. There's some of that wish-fulfilment in Ghazel's film too, but it's a moment of sadness, years after the sullied victory. </p> <p>Perhaps most poignant are the films in which Ghazel tackles the big issues. Inevitably, revolution and war inspires many Iranian artists - not least soldier-turned-fruitseller Khosrow Hassanzadeh, whose paintings of white linen bodybags are the most haunting works in the show - but Ghazel's mode is humour. In her film People Had To Find Amazing Ways To Sneak Out (Of Our Country), she rolls herself up in a Persian carpet, then rolls off screen. </p> <p>It could be a magic carpet, or the carpet Cleopatra arrived in for her secret assignation with Antony, but people did actually escape Iran hidden in carpets, so the joke is tinged with sadness. \"It's the Iranian sense of humour,\" Ghazel says. \"If a bomb goes off today, tomorrow there will be 10 jokes about it.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Iranian Contemporary Art is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), from tomorrow until June 3.

With one senator absent, the upper house voted by 46 to 28 to introduce the law, a result that both opponents and supporters of mercy killing had agreed was a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>Parties in favour of euthanasia control 46 of the senate's 75 seats, over 90%of the Dutch population supports the bill, and the practice has been taking place informally for decades anyway.</p> <p>But that did not stop opponents of the new legislation protesting against the move yesterday in a vain attempt to persuade the senators to cause an upset by blocking the bill. Christian activists sang hymns in the senate courtyard while at least 5,000 people, many of them schoolchildren, staged a silent march from the railway station to the town's picturesque Plein Square.</p> <p>They listened with rapt attention as religious leaders and Calvinist politicians condemned euthanasia in Old Testament terms.</p> <p>Two protesters in black Balaclavas and white laboratory coats clutched oversized syringes supporting a banner proclaiming that \"euthanasia will always be murder\".</p> <p>One of the men, Oskar, said he was a Catholic historian and argued that the Dutch government had used a barrage of propaganda to \"brainwash\" the population into supporting euthanasia.

      "bodyText": "The Netherlands became the first country to legalise euthanasia last night in a move expected to encourage several other European countries to follow suit. As protesters gathered outside the wood-panelled chamber of the Dutch upper house of parliament, the country's 75 senators approved the bill to allow doctors to end the lives of terminally ill patients in certain highly prescribed circumstances. With one senator absent, the upper house voted by 46 to 28 to introduce the law, a result that both opponents and supporters of mercy killing had agreed was a foregone conclusion. Parties in favour of euthanasia control 46 of the senate's 75 seats, over 90%of the Dutch population supports the bill, and the practice has been taking place informally for decades anyway. But that did not stop opponents of the new legislation protesting against the move yesterday in a vain attempt to persuade the senators to cause an upset by blocking the bill. Christian activists sang hymns in the senate courtyard while at least 5,000 people, many of them schoolchildren, staged a silent march from the railway station to the town's picturesque Plein Square. They listened with rapt attention as religious leaders and Calvinist politicians condemned euthanasia in Old Testament terms. Two protesters in black Balaclavas and white laboratory coats clutched oversized syringes supporting a banner proclaiming that \"euthanasia will always be murder\". One of the men, Oskar, said he was a Catholic historian and argued that the Dutch government had used a barrage of propaganda to \"brainwash\" the population into supporting euthanasia. He told the Guardian: \"It was a propaganda war and they won. It was like Goebbels and the Nazis and that's how they brainwashed the population.. \"Thou shalt not kill is an essential commandment for every society. There are so many old people in this country and they want to get rid of them. I worry about it a lot.\" Pro-euthanasia activists, who have been campaigning since 1973 for legislation, were in buoyant mood last night, but they remained adamant that the debate had been a long and a fair one. Dr Rob Jonquiere, director of the country's main pro-euthanasia lobby, said: \"We've been discussing this issue for the past 25 years. It was an open debate and it is good that it took such a long time. . \"I think my life is my life. Dying is the only security I have in my life and the major ity of the Dutch population agree with me.\" Only 8%of the population is fiercely opposed to euthanasia. \"This is not about asking a doctor to commit a crime but about asking for help.\" Once the formalities are completed - a process expected to take two weeks - doctors will be able to perform euthanasia without fear of prosecution. In the past doctors have found themselves hauled before the courts for performing the practicedespite having the full consent of the dying patient. Under the law, euthanasia will administered only to patients who are in continuous, unbearable and incurable suffering. A second opinion will be required, the patient must be judged to be of sound mind, and their request to die must be made voluntarily, independently and persistently. The decision to decriminalise the practice in the Netherlands could prompt many other countries to adopt similar legislation. Deborah Annetts, of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society in Britain, said: \"It is of major significance to other countries. A psychological barrier has been broken.\" In Belgium a draft law is under consideration and Britain, France, Australia and Italy all have strong euthanasia movements. The Netherlands showed the rest of Europe the way when it came to tolerating soft drugs and the commercialisation of sex and it has now taken the lead on mercy killing. But a small committed section of the Dutch population will always feel betrayed by the liberal instincts of fellow countrymen. Senator Kars Veling, from the small Christian Union party, said last night: \"I am ashamed of this as a Dutchman. I think it is a terrible mistake.\" How the world legislates Belgium A law legalising euthanasia is expected to be approved later this year. Sweden \"Suicide assistance\" is a non-punishable offence. A doctor can, in extreme cases, unplug life support machines. Denmark Terminally ill patients can decide if and when they should abandon vital treatment. France Euthanasia is illegal but the law does not regard a doctor's considered decision to refuse life-saving medication as murder. Britain Euthanasia is a criminal offence carrying a mandatory life prison sentence. The BMA has always opposed euthanasia, but a minority of doctors would like the law changed. Germany Euthanasia is a highly sensitive issue. The administration of a deadly drug is regarded as murder. America Euthanasia is outlawed, although Oregon allows medically assisted suicide where a doctor gives a patient lethal drugs but does not administer them. Australia Northern Territory passed a law allowing euthanasia in 1996 but it was later repealed by the federal government. China The government authorises hospitals to practise euthanasia in the terminal phase of an illness if patients formally request it.

      "bodyText": "A fluid made from the blood of American cows will soon be running through the veins and arteries of patients in South Africa after the country became the first to sanction the use of non-human haemoglobin in blood transfusions. The fluid, christened Hemopure by its US makers, falls short of being artificial blood. But for a short time it can be infused into patients and pumped by the heart as a stand-in for blood's most vital function, carrying oxygen around the body. South Africa faces a critical shortage of blood for transfusions because of the high level of HIV infection among its population, 25% of which is thought to be HIV positive. Hemopure's makers, Biopure of Cambridge, Massachusetts, claim that the product is so intensively screened and processed - it goes through 22 stages of purification - that it cannot pass on viruses or the rogue proteins thought to be responsible for new variant CJD, the human form of BSE. It can be given to humans of any blood type. Donor blood has to be refrigerated and can only be stored forsix weeks, while Hemopure can be stored for two years at room temperature. There is a risk of side effects, including stomach pain, weakness, hypertension, jaundice and nausea, but Biopure says normal blood transfusions also have the samerisks. Hemopure has not yet been licensed in Europe or the US, where regulators await the results of clinical trials. Biopure spokesman Douglas Sales said yesterday that the South Africans had been satisfied with those trials' preliminary data. It is not known how much the fluid will cost, although the firm said it would charge developing countries less than they would affluent countries. Michael Thomas, the clinical director of Britain's Blood Care Foundation, said that despite Biopure's reassurances there were likely to be concerns in this country about the CJD risk, the danger of an immune reaction to cow molecules, and the potential side effects of artificial blood substitutes. But he added that bovine haemoglobin worked better than its pure human equivalent when it came to moving oxygen around the body. And artificial blood substitutes, he said, are likely to be adopted worldwide eventually.",

Their mass protest began last October over plans to transfer prisoners from dormitory wards into new jails with smaller cells.</p> <p>In an effort to break the hunger strike, Turkish security forces stormed 20 jails in December and transferred about 1,000 inmates to the new prisons. Thirty prisoners and two soldiers were killed in four days of clashes, but the enforced transfers did not end the \"death fasts\".</p> <p>The latest victim was Gulsuman Donmez, whose brother is on hunger strike in prison. Donmez died in a house in Istanbul on Monday night after an intermittent hunger strike which lasted 147 days. Several other inmates' relatives are reported to be in a critical condition.</p> <p>It is not known how many prisoners are still refusing food, or whether they are taking vitamins or any other supplements which could prolong their lives. According to official figures, about 300 inmates are taking part in the protest, but local human rights groups believe the number could be twice as high.</p> <p>More than 120 people have been taken to hospital with symptoms of advanced malnutrition, including memory loss, partial paralysis, vomiting, diarrhoea, badly blurred vision and deafness.</p> <p>Last week the international pressure group Human Rights Watch called on the Turkish government to take steps to bring the hunger strike to an end. It condemned the new \"F-Type prisons\", which it says contravene international standards.</p> <p>\"The isolation regime in F-type prisons is physically and psychologically damaging to prisoners and should never have been instituted in the first place,\" the group's spokeswoman, Holly Cartner, said.</p> <p>Four F-type prisons - with cells which hold up to three people - are now in operation. Inmates are only allowed out of their cells once a week if a close family member visits.</p> <p>The hunger strikers want the system to be abandoned.</p> <p>The ministry of justice, however, says it is not responsible for the protest, and that there is no question of giving in to the inmates' demands.</p> <p>The government insists that it had a duty to regain control of the prison system. In the old dormitory wards inmates used to run their own affairs, and indoctrinate new recruits.</p> <p>With Turkey immersed in an economic crisis, the hunger strike has received little attention. But observers warn that the death toll could rise dramatically if no action is taken.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Turkish prison system was approaching another crisis last night after a leading doctors' organisation warned that it appeared inevitable that more inmates would die soon from hunger strikes. \"We are expecting news of further deaths at any moment,\" the Ankara Medical Association said. \"There is no time to waste.\" The government had called on the hunger strikers to end their protest, but three people have starved to death since Saturday - two inmates and a young woman protesting in solidarity with her imprisoned brother. Another inmate died last month. The hunger strikers are members of extreme leftwing groups which want to overthrow the state. Their mass protest began last October over plans to transfer prisoners from dormitory wards into new jails with smaller cells. In an effort to break the hunger strike, Turkish security forces stormed 20 jails in December and transferred about 1,000 inmates to the new prisons. Thirty prisoners and two soldiers were killed in four days of clashes, but the enforced transfers did not end the \"death fasts\". The latest victim was Gulsuman Donmez, whose brother is on hunger strike in prison. Donmez died in a house in Istanbul on Monday night after an intermittent hunger strike which lasted 147 days. Several other inmates' relatives are reported to be in a critical condition. It is not known how many prisoners are still refusing food, or whether they are taking vitamins or any other supplements which could prolong their lives. According to official figures, about 300 inmates are taking part in the protest, but local human rights groups believe the number could be twice as high. More than 120 people have been taken to hospital with symptoms of advanced malnutrition, including memory loss, partial paralysis, vomiting, diarrhoea, badly blurred vision and deafness. Last week the international pressure group Human Rights Watch called on the Turkish government to take steps to bring the hunger strike to an end. It condemned the new \"F-Type prisons\", which it says contravene international standards. \"The isolation regime in F-type prisons is physically and psychologically damaging to prisoners and should never have been instituted in the first place,\" the group's spokeswoman, Holly Cartner, said. Four F-type prisons - with cells which hold up to three people - are now in operation. Inmates are only allowed out of their cells once a week if a close family member visits. The hunger strikers want the system to be abandoned. The ministry of justice, however, says it is not responsible for the protest, and that there is no question of giving in to the inmates' demands. The government insists that it had a duty to regain control of the prison system. In the old dormitory wards inmates used to run their own affairs, and indoctrinate new recruits. With Turkey immersed in an economic crisis, the hunger strike has received little attention. But observers warn that the death toll could rise dramatically if no action is taken.",

      "body": "<p>There is another team in Verona. I hoped to get through this season and this series of articles without ever mentioning them, without even thinking of them. I never used to think of them. But the time has come to confess the truth. The glorious Hellas Verona are in danger of being overtaken, of being replaced as the town's big team. </p> <p>The menace is called Chievo (pronounced Kyevo) or in the local dialect Ceo (pronounced Cheo). I hope that's clear. Chievo is a small and irretrievably nondescript suburb of 3,000 souls, \"cats and dogs included\", on the east side of Verona where the river Adige is dammed and divided before being allowed to cross the city. Their football club is often called la banda della diga, the boys from the dike. It hardly sounds like Champions League stuff, does it? But the amazing fact is that while Hellas look set to plunge into Serie B, tiny Chievo are on the brink of promotion to A. </p> <p>Towards the end of each game at Hellas's Bentegodi stadium, a corner of the collective eye anxiously checks the big screen opposite the curva sud. A huge shout of relief goes up when Napoli crash at Bologna, a pained sigh when Brescia equalise in Florence. These teams are Hellas's direct rivals in the relegation race. </p> <p>But the real groan is always reserved for our own Cinderella. Unbelievably they have done it again, the fourth away win in a row. People shake their heads. It can't be happening. With two-thirds of the season gone, Chievo are five points clear at the top of Serie B, ahead of teams of the mythical likes of Torino, Sampdoria and Genoa. Assuming they make it, they would be the first parochial club to be promoted to Serie A. And if Hellas stay up as well, Verona would become the first small town to have two teams among the 18 privileged players of il pi\u00f9 bel campionato del mondo. </p> <p>\"The cupola will never let that happen,\" writes someone on the Hellas chat line. Cupola - dome - is the word for the collective leadership of occult power. It's mafia vocabulary. \"The truth is, they want us down and Chievo up,\" somebody responds grimly. \" Chievo vaffanculo! Only Hellas in my heart. Everything else ... an international conspiracy!\" </p> <p>How has this state of affairs come about? And why would anyone pull strings to substitute Hellas with Chievo? Occasionally I go down to the stadium to check out what Chievo are up to. Ever since they made it into Serie C1 in 1986, they have been allowed to share the Bentegodi with Hellas. But how strange to see the terraces almost empty! I remember one game last year with only a few hundred people dotted here and there, mainly pensioners with a chunk of parmesan and a bottle of wine in their knapsacks for a half-time picnic, their radios jammed to their ears to pick up the news of the big game that really mattered to them: Inter and Juventus. \"Hey Gianni,\" someone shouts at a Chievo player falling over the ball. They call the players by their first names. \"Hey Gianni, I could do better than that!\" </p> <p>\" Chievo = vittorie e silenzio, \" a Hellas fan mocks on the chat-line. Victories and silence. He signs himself: Il bandito. When a Chievo fan responds irate, he comes back: \"Incredible, I didn't know Chievo had fans!\" </p> <p>But the Chievo management has played its cards astutely. They must have appreciated years ago that the gate is fast becoming an irrelevant part of an Italian club's income. All the teams in Serie B get the same big cash handout from TV via the football league. This is the money that counts. But unlike other clubs, Chievo haven't succumbed to TV's appetite for celebrity. In this sense it is an advantage not having vociferous fans clamouring for big names. While the dressing rooms of most Italian clubs are beginning to resemble airport lounges, Chievo have kept the same core team on medium low salaries for years. And finally it's paying off. They are playing good football. They're winning. All of a sudden, people are actually watching them. Five or six thousand. Far more than the population of Chievo. </p> <p>\"Everybody's Chievando \" - Chieving - comes another ironic voice over the net. Chiave means key, chiavare, to fuck. \"The mayor is Chievando, the football league are Chievando, traitors all over the world, Chievando! And they all SIT DOWN! In the mythical curva at our Bentegodi, can you believe it! They sit down, to Chievare!\" </p> <p>When Hellas play, no one in the central sections of the curva sud sits down. Like everything else in Italy in this election year, the Chievo phenomenon is taking on political overtones. Hence the suspicion of conspiracy. The \"correct\" press love Chievo. There is no racism. The team has two black players. The public doesn't even shout vaffanculo at the visiting fans and seems somewhat offended when the lads from Genoa or Turin shout fuck off at them. </p> <p>\"The decent side of Verona!\" announce the headlines, \"A lesson for Hellas\". Somehow, Sunday after Sunday, as we lose and they win, it is being insinuated that Chievo are getting the points because they are nice, good people. While we are yesterday's Nazis. Now the local leftwing publisher and lobbyist Giorgio Bertani has got in on the act, starting a Chievo supporters club. \"Our statute stipulates that we are a non-political group supporting ideals of non-violence, and showing friendship and respect towards all cultures and colours!\" </p> <p>How wearisome this rhetoric is. As if football were merely about watching 11 men kick the ball around on the field. I almost have more time for the person who wrote on the chat-line: \"Hellas, you're dead. You and all your racist supporters. Ignorant pigs. Roast in hell!\" There's political correctness for you. </p> <p>\"Only Hellas in my heart,\" comes the reply. \"Everything else ... politics and polenta.\" It's the bandito again. But things are looking bad for Hellas Verona. We stand on the terraces of San Siro watching the boys go down to Inter. They put up a good show, but what can you do when the referee's against you. \"Every game, 10 against 12,\" someone mutters. For the nth time this season we've had a player sent off. And the replays will show we were right, there was no penalty, Vieri dived. But how can that possibly help? </p> <p>Years ago, when people worried about relegation, I used to think that they were really concerned about having to watch poorer football, missing out on seeing the big teams. And of course that's part of it. But now I realise that what they're really scared of is that their community will dissolve and disappear. </p> <p>We're not just going down into B, someone's coming up to take our place, someone with a clean face, someone the world wants to see rather than us. The casual fans, who have no sense of pathos, will desert. Who will get on the bus and travel through the night to watch Hellas play miserable Crotone in the deepest south, when they could stay at home and see Chievo take on Juventus? </p> <p>Game over, we watch the big screen. The letters run across, right to left. Chievo 0 ... Has the tide turned? Ravenna ... 0. \"Well, they've only drawn.\" \"But all the closest rivals have lost!\" It's a nightmare. It's really happening. The police gather and block the exits with their riot shields. Could this be the last time we'll come to San Siro? The boys raise their ancient cry: \" Hellas, solo contro tutti.\" Alone against the world. What pathos, what delirium. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.timparks.com\">Tim Parks</a>'s column appears fortnightly, on Tuesdays. He is writing a book about following Hellas Verona.

Chiave means key, chiavare, to fuck. \"The mayor is Chievando, the football league are Chievando, traitors all over the world, Chievando! And they all SIT DOWN! In the mythical curva at our Bentegodi, can you believe it! They sit down, to Chievare!\" When Hellas play, no one in the central sections of the curva sud sits down. Like everything else in Italy in this election year, the Chievo phenomenon is taking on political overtones. Hence the suspicion of conspiracy. The \"correct\" press love Chievo. There is no racism. The team has two black players. The public doesn't even shout vaffanculo at the visiting fans and seems somewhat offended when the lads from Genoa or Turin shout fuck off at them. \"The decent side of Verona!\" announce the headlines, \"A lesson for Hellas\". Somehow, Sunday after Sunday, as we lose and they win, it is being insinuated that Chievo are getting the points because they are nice, good people. While we are yesterday's Nazis. Now the local leftwing publisher and lobbyist Giorgio Bertani has got in on the act, starting a Chievo supporters club. \"Our statute stipulates that we are a non-political group supporting ideals of non-violence, and showing friendship and respect towards all cultures and colours!\" How wearisome this rhetoric is. As if football were merely about watching 11 men kick the ball around on the field. I almost have more time for the person who wrote on the chat-line: \"Hellas, you're dead. You and all your racist supporters. Ignorant pigs. Roast in hell!\" There's political correctness for you. \"Only Hellas in my heart,\" comes the reply. \"Everything else ... politics and polenta.\" It's the bandito again. But things are looking bad for Hellas Verona. We stand on the terraces of San Siro watching the boys go down to Inter. They put up a good show, but what can you do when the referee's against you. \"Every game, 10 against 12,\" someone mutters. For the nth time this season we've had a player sent off. And the replays will show we were right, there was no penalty, Vieri dived. But how can that possibly help? Years ago, when people worried about relegation, I used to think that they were really concerned about having to watch poorer football, missing out on seeing the big teams. And of course that's part of it. But now I realise that what they're really scared of is that their community will dissolve and disappear. We're not just going down into B, someone's coming up to take our place, someone with a clean face, someone the world wants to see rather than us. The casual fans, who have no sense of pathos, will desert. Who will get on the bus and travel through the night to watch Hellas play miserable Crotone in the deepest south, when they could stay at home and see Chievo take on Juventus? Game over, we watch the big screen. The letters run across, right to left. Chievo 0 ... Has the tide turned? Ravenna ... 0. \"Well, they've only drawn.\" \"But all the closest rivals have lost!\" It's a nightmare. It's really happening. The police gather and block the exits with their riot shields. Could this be the last time we'll come to San Siro? The boys raise their ancient cry: \" Hellas, solo contro tutti.\" Alone against the world. What pathos, what delirium. \u0095 Tim Parks's column appears fortnightly, on Tuesdays. He is writing a book about following Hellas Verona. A Season with Verona will be published by Secker &amp; Warburg in March 2002.",

After a short, sweet shower, I came back down the steep lane and ran straight into a rainbow.</p> <p>From above, the arch seemed like the outer surface of a dome, with mostly blue and green bands of light. Once inside it, trees on the hill to the north were dark silhouettes against the coloured arc and the light underneath was golden. The dome of light covered a diameter of about a quarter of a mile across a wooded plateau. Even after passing through it, the rainbow could still be seen for 5 minutes before fading away as the dark clouds above drifted off.</p> <p>The evening light after the rain was crystal-clear, and even the far hills, lost in the murk for weeks, were now etched sharply against the sky. Looking out to the west, I thought I could see floodwater, but it was smoke. On flat land in the Severn Valley towards Shrewsbury, a white plume spread northwards from a long narrow fire: a beast burning. Apparently some animals may have come from Welshpool market, so they and every other sheep or pig they came into contact with had been slaughtered and were now on fire. This is getting bloody sick. The footpaths are closed and healthy animals are being burned.</p> <p>Then the most magnificent sunset began to form. Washes of silver-blue and gold light shot with scarlet spread across the sky with weird, indigo, eyebrow-shaped clouds. Shots rang out sickeningly. The Edge acts as a huge natural amphitheatre and it is impossible to pinpoint where the shots were coming from, but they sounded like rifle fire.</p>",

After a short, sweet shower, I came back down the steep lane and ran straight into a rainbow. From above, the arch seemed like the outer surface of a dome, with mostly blue and green bands of light. Once inside it, trees on the hill to the north were dark silhouettes against the coloured arc and the light underneath was golden. The dome of light covered a diameter of about a quarter of a mile across a wooded plateau. Even after passing through it, the rainbow could still be seen for 5 minutes before fading away as the dark clouds above drifted off. The evening light after the rain was crystal-clear, and even the far hills, lost in the murk for weeks, were now etched sharply against the sky. Looking out to the west, I thought I could see floodwater, but it was smoke. On flat land in the Severn Valley towards Shrewsbury, a white plume spread northwards from a long narrow fire: a beast burning. Apparently some animals may have come from Welshpool market, so they and every other sheep or pig they came into contact with had been slaughtered and were now on fire. This is getting bloody sick. The footpaths are closed and healthy animals are being burned. Then the most magnificent sunset began to form. Washes of silver-blue and gold light shot with scarlet spread across the sky with weird, indigo, eyebrow-shaped clouds. Shots rang out sickeningly. The Edge acts as a huge natural amphitheatre and it is impossible to pinpoint where the shots were coming from, but they sounded like rifle fire.",

To see such genuine, heartfelt emotion so coolly displayed - by Nicki, Emma and Sarah as well as their nearest and dearest - is quite a rarity. As an audience, we were incredibly lucky to be privy to that, particularly as Positive Women had not a trace of syrupy mawkishness. Instead, here was a heartfelt, mature, not to mention teary, 50 minutes of TV. </p> <p>When Russell the sperm donor remarked on the unsuitable-for-television nature of the reading material which aided him in making a deposit at the sperm bank, he was perhaps unaware that <strong> Sperm Donor Dads</strong> was being made for Channel 5. \"You probably won't want to look at these\", he said quickly of the (well-thumbed) porn mags provided by the clinic to hurry him on his way. </p> <p>Now, had Sperm Donor Dads been a normal Channel 5 programme, at this point there probably would have been a jumpcut to some pole dancers or to a woman with unfeasibly large breasts in a candy-pink bikini, but lo, there were no poles nor breast-filled bikinis. To be fair, its tabloid - and slightly unsuitable - title aside, Sperm Donor Dads was mercifully unsensational. </p> <p>To show its sensible credentials, it kicked off with some Hard Facts. There are some 50,000 people in the UK who were created through artificial insemination with anonymously donated sperm - and a further 1,500 are added to that number every day. Remarkably, up to 80 per cent of these people are unaware of their status. Actually, Sperm Donor Dads wasn't really about the dads at all, if sperm donors can even be counted as dads, which I don't think they can. </p> <p>Indeed, Russell was the only sperm donor featured, and his contribution - an explanation of the mechanics of sperm donation with only the hint of a bashful smile (\"Then you adjourn to masturbate...\") - wasn't half as important as those of other interviewees. That said, it would have been interesting to know more about his motives. </p> <p>Contributions from a psychologist and a no-nonsense clinician called Susan, who has handled more sperm than Annabel Chong, were similarly worthwhile, though it was the people who were the product of anonymous sperm donation that had the most engaging stories to tell. </p> <p>Given that they had no right to their biological fathers' details, frustration and bitterness were understandable, though some dealt with their situation better than others. One seemed quite angry that the only thing she knew about her father was that \"he was able to masturbate to order\", while another - who as a youth had imagined his father to be Prince Philip or Dirk Bogarde - had regarded his circumstances as a challenge and taken up his own investigations. </p> <p>If Sperm Donor Dads had any shortcomings, they were that there wasn't nearly enough background on those involved so we could understand these differing reactions.

      "body": "<p>I stopped eating meat a few weeks ago. All those burning animals, and the crocodile tears. It was the hypocrisy, operating at every level of the food industry - and most crucially at my level, the level of the consumer - which did the trick. Oh, and the piteous baa-ing of baa-lambs. The older I get, the more piteous they become. I know, it's meant to be the other way around. </p> <p>So, no more meat, probably. In all truth, I've been a vegetarian for 20 years, except at mealtimes. At mealtimes, the resolve always somehow slipped, the alternatives to meat being too awful to contemplate. They're still pretty awful, frankly. </p> <p>And there are other, associated, problems. </p> <p>At university, a friend of mine ate, in the end, nothing at all. Every item of food was rejected for some ethical reason. Slightly masochistic in his other lifestyle choices - member of the SWP, supporter of Port Vale - he took the ethical thing to its logical conclusion. Restricted to a diet of hideous, flatulent pulses, he would later discover that they'd been grown as a profitable sideline by Guatemalan death squads. Off the approved list they'd go. Along with the steamed legumes produced by female slave labour for huge agro-chemical concerns whose bosses all support Stoke City. My mate learned a useful lesson: no food is entirely \"ethical\", no matter how disgusting it tastes. </p> <p>So, he ate nothing. I assume that, by now, he's very, very hungry indeed, or dead. Which would be a shame, because he was a nice chap. </p> <p>An opinion poll for the Today programme showed that one third of vegetarians have become so very recently, which suggests to me that there are a lot of people out there experiencing the same desperate mid-life crisis of pious self-flagellation. There certainly seem to be a few more vegetarians working in this office than there were, say, five years ago. And I suspect that rather than it being a direct response to BSE or foot and mouth, it's a complex, cumulative process which has as much to do with politics and even fashion as either of those other diseases. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I need a structured regime to get me through. The Jewish dietary laws, for example. I understand that these strict rules can be relaxed, in certain extenuating circumstances. This is an excellent, common sense principle which I will be following. A \"threat to life\" is usually what's meant by extenuating circumstances, but let's not split hairs. Down the Red Lion last Sunday lunchtime, the veggie section of the menu board was obscured by a tall man in a hat. So I was forced to choose the roast beef. I wasn't happy about it, but there you are. Sometimes the real world intrudes and one needs to adapt. </p> <p>\u0095 Rod Liddle is the editor of Radio 4's Today programme.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I stopped eating meat a few weeks ago. All those burning animals, and the crocodile tears. It was the hypocrisy, operating at every level of the food industry - and most crucially at my level, the level of the consumer - which did the trick. Oh, and the piteous baa-ing of baa-lambs. The older I get, the more piteous they become. I know, it's meant to be the other way around. So, no more meat, probably. In all truth, I've been a vegetarian for 20 years, except at mealtimes. At mealtimes, the resolve always somehow slipped, the alternatives to meat being too awful to contemplate. They're still pretty awful, frankly. And there are other, associated, problems. At university, a friend of mine ate, in the end, nothing at all. Every item of food was rejected for some ethical reason. Slightly masochistic in his other lifestyle choices - member of the SWP, supporter of Port Vale - he took the ethical thing to its logical conclusion. Restricted to a diet of hideous, flatulent pulses, he would later discover that they'd been grown as a profitable sideline by Guatemalan death squads. Off the approved list they'd go. Along with the steamed legumes produced by female slave labour for huge agro-chemical concerns whose bosses all support Stoke City. My mate learned a useful lesson: no food is entirely \"ethical\", no matter how disgusting it tastes. So, he ate nothing. I assume that, by now, he's very, very hungry indeed, or dead. Which would be a shame, because he was a nice chap. An opinion poll for the Today programme showed that one third of vegetarians have become so very recently, which suggests to me that there are a lot of people out there experiencing the same desperate mid-life crisis of pious self-flagellation. There certainly seem to be a few more vegetarians working in this office than there were, say, five years ago. And I suspect that rather than it being a direct response to BSE or foot and mouth, it's a complex, cumulative process which has as much to do with politics and even fashion as either of those other diseases. Meanwhile, I need a structured regime to get me through. The Jewish dietary laws, for example. I understand that these strict rules can be relaxed, in certain extenuating circumstances. This is an excellent, common sense principle which I will be following. A \"threat to life\" is usually what's meant by extenuating circumstances, but let's not split hairs. Down the Red Lion last Sunday lunchtime, the veggie section of the menu board was obscured by a tall man in a hat. So I was forced to choose the roast beef. I wasn't happy about it, but there you are. Sometimes the real world intrudes and one needs to adapt. \u0095 Rod Liddle is the editor of Radio 4's Today programme.",

      "body": "<p>Graziella Sciutti, who has died at her home in Geneva at the age of 73, was one of the most delightful sopranos of the postwar era. She first made her name at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in the early 1950s, and enhanced it with her work at the Piccola Scala, Milan, and in Britain, at both Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. She also became a favourite at the Vienna State Opera, the Salzburg festival and the Metropolitan Opera, New York.</p> <p>Her m\u00e9tier consisted of roles calling for a vivacious stage personality, which she had in abundance, and a gift for soubrette characterisations. Her voice, though never large, was unerringly projected into the furthermost point of a theatre, so that she used her small resources to create an effect far beyond their size.</p> <p>Born in Turin, she studied in Rome at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia. While still a student, she sang the soprano part in Bach's St Matthew Passion under Karajan in Rome. Gabriel Dussurget, founder and for years leading light of the Aix Festival, spotted her talent and cast her in the one-woman opera, Menotti's The Telephone, quite a feat for a young, immature singer. That was in 1951, when she also undertook Carolina in Cimarosa's Il Matrimonio Segreto. In succeeding years at Aix, she won her Mozartian spurs singing Susanna, Despina and Zerlina, and in 1954 she created the title role in Sauget's Les Caprices de Marianne there.</p> <p>In the same year, Glyndebourne had its first encounter with the young Italian, as a pert Rosina in Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia. She followed that with an enchanting Nannetta in Verdi's Falstaff and as Susanna in 1958, both classic Glyndebourne stagings, and as Despina in 1959. She returned in 1970 as a witty Fiorilla in Rossini's Il Turco in Italia, and made a final appearance as late as 1977 as a deeply affecting Elle in Poulenc's one-hander La Voix Humaine, harbinger of her second career, since she directed it herself.</p> <p>Among the conductors with whom she particularly enjoyed working were Vittorio Gui and Carlo Maria Giulini. A period working in Rome on Figaro with Giulini and the director Luchino Visconti was one she remembered with special pleasure.</p> <p>Another feature of the early part of her career was a period in Paris working with Sacha Guitry on his and Hahn's hybrid work Mozart, and in the same city at the same time she appeared as Polly in Weill's The Threepenny Opera.</p> <p>In 1956, she first appeared at Covent Garden, as Oscar in Verdi's Un Ballo in Maschera, another part well suited to her mercurial voice and presence. She returned as Nannetta, Susanna and Despina in succeeding years.</p> <p>In Italy, she sang Carolina again, to inaugurate the Piccola Scala in Milan in 1955, and either there or in La Scala itself she sang a variety of roles including Countess Adele in Rossini's Le Comte Ory. Her American debut came as late as 1961, as Susanna in San Francisco, and she then took the same role at the Met. At the Vienna State Opera she sang many of her best roles, including Nannetta in a Visconti staging of Falstaff conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Her Mozart was sought after at Salzburg, where she made a final appearance as Norina in Donizetti's Don Pasquale, under Muti in 1972.</p> <p>In 1982 she returned to London, now as a recitalist, and gave a programme at the Wigmore Hall that reminded her listeners that her range stretched well beyond the works she had sung on stage.</p> <p>Sciutti's voice and art are preserved on a number of recordings. She appears as Carolina in a reading of Il Matrimonino Segreto (1956), committed to disc at La Scala under Nino Sonzogno; as an engagingly quick-witted Susanna in the famous Glyndebourne recording of Figaro conducted by Gui (1958); as Zerlina in Giulini's classic 1959 set of Don Giovanni; as Marzelline in Maazel's set of Fidelio (1964); and on a disc of French song.</p> <p>During the 1980s and 90s, Sciutti began to produce opera. She directed Figaro and L'Elisir d'Amore for Canadian Opera, then worked for opera companies in Germany and the US and at the summer festival of the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, where she specialised in 18th-century opera buffa. She also taught singing and interpretation at the University of Geneva.</p> <p>She also worked eagerly with students. She very much enjoyed producing Figaro at the school of Chicago's Lyric Opera, and in Britain she staged Puccini's Trittico at the Britten Theatre of the Royal College of Music (where she was a staff member for some years) in 1987, then Don Giovanni, at the Royal Academy of Music's Lyons Theatre in 1993, for the Royal Schools Faculty (combining the RAM's and RCM's opera schools). In these she ably passed on her own talents as regards the importance of welding words to music in a rhythmically vital manner.</p> <p>In all she achieved, Sciutti was a profound enthusiast for the art she so much loved, and to which she devoted her life. She sought perfection both in her own performance and in those of others, whether they were professionals or students. Typically Italian in personality, she enjoyed her life to the full.</p> <p>In 1955, she married an American singer, Robert Wahoske; they divorced in 1960. She leaves a daughter, Susanna, and a grandson.</p> <p>\u0095 Graziella Sciutti, soprano, born April 17 1927; died April 9 2001.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Graziella Sciutti, who has died at her home in Geneva at the age of 73, was one of the most delightful sopranos of the postwar era. She first made her name at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in the early 1950s, and enhanced it with her work at the Piccola Scala, Milan, and in Britain, at both Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. She also became a favourite at the Vienna State Opera, the Salzburg festival and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. Her m\u00e9tier consisted of roles calling for a vivacious stage personality, which she had in abundance, and a gift for soubrette characterisations. Her voice, though never large, was unerringly projected into the furthermost point of a theatre, so that she used her small resources to create an effect far beyond their size. Born in Turin, she studied in Rome at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia. While still a student, she sang the soprano part in Bach's St Matthew Passion under Karajan in Rome. Gabriel Dussurget, founder and for years leading light of the Aix Festival, spotted her talent and cast her in the one-woman opera, Menotti's The Telephone, quite a feat for a young, immature singer. That was in 1951, when she also undertook Carolina in Cimarosa's Il Matrimonio Segreto. In succeeding years at Aix, she won her Mozartian spurs singing Susanna, Despina and Zerlina, and in 1954 she created the title role in Sauget's Les Caprices de Marianne there. In the same year, Glyndebourne had its first encounter with the young Italian, as a pert Rosina in Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia. She followed that with an enchanting Nannetta in Verdi's Falstaff and as Susanna in 1958, both classic Glyndebourne stagings, and as Despina in 1959. She returned in 1970 as a witty Fiorilla in Rossini's Il Turco in Italia, and made a final appearance as late as 1977 as a deeply affecting Elle in Poulenc's one-hander La Voix Humaine, harbinger of her second career, since she directed it herself. Among the conductors with whom she particularly enjoyed working were Vittorio Gui and Carlo Maria Giulini. A period working in Rome on Figaro with Giulini and the director Luchino Visconti was one she remembered with special pleasure. Another feature of the early part of her career was a period in Paris working with Sacha Guitry on his and Hahn's hybrid work Mozart, and in the same city at the same time she appeared as Polly in Weill's The Threepenny Opera. In 1956, she first appeared at Covent Garden, as Oscar in Verdi's Un Ballo in Maschera, another part well suited to her mercurial voice and presence. She returned as Nannetta, Susanna and Despina in succeeding years. In Italy, she sang Carolina again, to inaugurate the Piccola Scala in Milan in 1955, and either there or in La Scala itself she sang a variety of roles including Countess Adele in Rossini's Le Comte Ory. Her American debut came as late as 1961, as Susanna in San Francisco, and she then took the same role at the Met. At the Vienna State Opera she sang many of her best roles, including Nannetta in a Visconti staging of Falstaff conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Her Mozart was sought after at Salzburg, where she made a final appearance as Norina in Donizetti's Don Pasquale, under Muti in 1972. In 1982 she returned to London, now as a recitalist, and gave a programme at the Wigmore Hall that reminded her listeners that her range stretched well beyond the works she had sung on stage. Sciutti's voice and art are preserved on a number of recordings. She appears as Carolina in a reading of Il Matrimonino Segreto (1956), committed to disc at La Scala under Nino Sonzogno; as an engagingly quick-witted Susanna in the famous Glyndebourne recording of Figaro conducted by Gui (1958); as Zerlina in Giulini's classic 1959 set of Don Giovanni; as Marzelline in Maazel's set of Fidelio (1964); and on a disc of French song. During the 1980s and 90s, Sciutti began to produce opera. She directed Figaro and L'Elisir d'Amore for Canadian Opera, then worked for opera companies in Germany and the US and at the summer festival of the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, where she specialised in 18th-century opera buffa. She also taught singing and interpretation at the University of Geneva. She also worked eagerly with students. She very much enjoyed producing Figaro at the school of Chicago's Lyric Opera, and in Britain she staged Puccini's Trittico at the Britten Theatre of the Royal College of Music (where she was a staff member for some years) in 1987, then Don Giovanni, at the Royal Academy of Music's Lyons Theatre in 1993, for the Royal Schools Faculty (combining the RAM's and RCM's opera schools). In these she ably passed on her own talents as regards the importance of welding words to music in a rhythmically vital manner. In all she achieved, Sciutti was a profound enthusiast for the art she so much loved, and to which she devoted her life. She sought perfection both in her own performance and in those of others, whether they were professionals or students. Typically Italian in personality, she enjoyed her life to the full. In 1955, she married an American singer, Robert Wahoske; they divorced in 1960. She leaves a daughter, Susanna, and a grandson. \u0095 Graziella Sciutti, soprano, born April 17 1927; died April 9 2001.",

His attacker was charged with grievous bodily harm and sentenced to only two years in jail.</p> <p>Wroe, 33, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, admitted manslaughter when he appeared at Manchester crown court last month. On Monday, he was ordered to do community service by the recorder of Manchester, Sir Rhys Davies, when he appeared for sentencing.</p> <p>Imposing an 80-hour community punishment order, the judge said the \"cowardly and brutal\" attack on Mr Wallwork had unfortunately triggered an undiagnosed medical condition which led to a brain haemorrhage.</p> <p>He said the judge who had originally jailed Wroe for two years in June 1997 had approached the case \"wholly correctly\".</p> <p>\"This therefore puts this court in an unusual situation because you now fall to be re-sentenced for the same course of action but on a different charge,\" the judge said.</p> <p>Wroe would probably have been jailed for longer than two years had he faced a man-slaughter charge in 1997, but the judge now had to consider whether the original sentence was \"excessively inadequate\".</p> <p>He said: \"There is argument for the imposition of a further custodial sentence, but against that there is the argument of double jeopardy, and it seems to me that it is not a matter of compulsion that this defendant should be returned to custody.\"</p> <p>The attack in July 1996 on Mr Wallwork, who lived in Ashton-under-Lyne, resulted from a minor feud with Wroe, who lived nearby at the time.</p> <p>Roderick Carus QC, defending, said Wroe had been thinking about being re-charged since 1997.</p>",

Paul Wroe became the first person to be charged over the death of a victim more than three years after the original assault. The prosecution was made possible by the abolition five years ago of the ancient legal rule that a person could not be charged with murder or manslaughter if the victim died more than a year and a day after the assault. At least four other defendants have been prosecuted for murder or manslaughter since the rule was abolished but Wroe was the first whose prosecution needed the attorney general's consent because the death happened more than three years after the assault. He was originally jailed for two years for battering 67-year-old Thomas Wallwork, who was left needing constant care after a blood vessel ruptured in his brain. Mr Wallwork survived for almost four years in a permanent vegetative state, but in March 2000 the high court ruled that life support could be withdrawn and he died a few days later. The old law was abolished in June 1996 by a private mem ber's bill backed by the crown prosecution service, which became the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act. The act followed a campaign by Pat Gibson, whose son Michael was attacked on a night out in Darlington in 1992 and spent 16 months in a coma before he died. His attacker was charged with grievous bodily harm and sentenced to only two years in jail. Wroe, 33, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, admitted manslaughter when he appeared at Manchester crown court last month. On Monday, he was ordered to do community service by the recorder of Manchester, Sir Rhys Davies, when he appeared for sentencing. Imposing an 80-hour community punishment order, the judge said the \"cowardly and brutal\" attack on Mr Wallwork had unfortunately triggered an undiagnosed medical condition which led to a brain haemorrhage. He said the judge who had originally jailed Wroe for two years in June 1997 had approached the case \"wholly correctly\". \"This therefore puts this court in an unusual situation because you now fall to be re-sentenced for the same course of action but on a different charge,\" the judge said. Wroe would probably have been jailed for longer than two years had he faced a man-slaughter charge in 1997, but the judge now had to consider whether the original sentence was \"excessively inadequate\". He said: \"There is argument for the imposition of a further custodial sentence, but against that there is the argument of double jeopardy, and it seems to me that it is not a matter of compulsion that this defendant should be returned to custody.\" The attack in July 1996 on Mr Wallwork, who lived in Ashton-under-Lyne, resulted from a minor feud with Wroe, who lived nearby at the time. Roderick Carus QC, defending, said Wroe had been thinking about being re-charged since 1997.",

      "bodyText": "The prime suspect in the case of the murdered schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson, has been found to have DNA that \"closely\" matches that found at the scene of the crime, French officials revealed last night. The news meant Caroline's family faced the prospect of the five year hunt for her killer finally ending within the next 48 hours. The breakthrough came after Miami police realised a Spanish waiter being held in their jail on a separate offence, had been named as the man French police \"particularly\" wanted to question in connection with the murder. Preliminary analysis of a DNA sample from Francisco Arce Montez, aged 51, has revealed many similarities to forensic evidence found at the hostel in Pleine-Foug\u00e8res, Brittany, where Caroline, aged 13, was raped and murdered during a school trip. A second comparison is expected to be completed in France to see if there is an incontrovertible link. Last night, Henri Bertrand, the press attach\u00e9 at the French consulate in Miami, said the second test - which will not require the suspect to be taken to France - was being conducted because of differences between the French and US methods of DNA testing. \"The DNA samples are close but are not the same. There are many similarities but we need to make sure,\" he said. Olivier Pascal, the genetics expert at Nantes, who is expected to make the second analysis, said the proof needed by the French authorities was on its way from the US and the result was expected imminently. \"The actual analysis will be done swiftly and the result will be known, at the maximum, within 48 hours,\" he said.

Researchers who visited eight Tesco stores across Britain compared a shopping basket of goods with other chains and found that Tesco shipped in 24% of its produce. Sainsbury imported 23% and Asda 22%, according to an unpublished survey conducted for the food policy charity Sustain, and obtained by the Guardian. The survey found that 5% of Tesco's food was produced locally and 14% regionally, while the rest was unlabelled and assumed to be produced in the UK.
