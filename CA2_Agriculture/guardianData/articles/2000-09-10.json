Greenfield is, after all, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University, a key figure in the international field of neuroscience, author, broadcaster and the first woman in the past two centuries to be director of the Royal Institution. </p> <p>And who works for a boss like this? Answer: the charming and self-effacing Viv Pearson, 51, who has spent the past 18 months as Greenfield's PA. \"You need a lot of stamina to keep up with her,\" she says. \"She is very fair but she works at 110% all the time and hasn't got a free evening until December.\" </p> <p>Hardly surprising, as Greenfield effectively has two day jobs - the professorial role in Oxford and the Royal Institution directorship in London. \"Most of my work is managing her diary and correspondence, booking flights, making sure she has transport and checking that the people she is going to see will look after her properly,\" confirms Pearson. </p> <p>She claims to have no scientific background whatsoever, and says the most daunting aspect of her job is dictation. \"When I first arrived, some of the words Susan was using, like acetylcholinesterace - which I now know is an enzyme - I couldn't even get my tongue round. But she is very patient.\" </p> <p>As for her working environment, any of us conjuring up visions of Hammer Horror flicks, with devilish white-coated technicians sawing up brain tissue, will be disappointed. \"This is a totally brain-free zone. The work on the tissue is done in the labs, and if they are working on something unsavoury, I don't go in,\" Pearson insists. </p> <p>The work carried out in the pharmacology department focuses on a particular group of brain conditions - Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease - all of which are treated by different drugs. \"However, my department is exploring the idea that there is something common to all three conditions. The idea is that they are all triggered by progressive damage to groups of neurons,\" says Pearson, who recalls the time when she came into slightly more contact with the human brain than she would have wished for. </p> <p>\"When the BBC was working on the brain programme, I had to go to collect a brain in formaldehyde. As I was carrying it down the corridor, it leaked all over my dress and drenched my feet. I thought... hmm, interesting.\" </p> <p>Although Pearson is not directly involved in the media spin-off from Greenfield's TV work, she does find herself on the frontline with the general public. \"Since the programme went out, there have been at least two or three calls a day from people who have had something wrong with their brains, or in some cases are terminally ill. They offer to come up to the labs and be used as guinea pigs, or they think Susan is a medic and can cure them. I have to be really sensitive and listen. You can't turn round and say, 'I am sorry, I have to stop you there.' Sometimes I feel really useless. It would be lovely to make them better.\" </p> <p>Although new to the world of neuroscience, Pearson has a solid work track-record, albeit on a part-time basis for many years, while she brought up her two children. And since she is married to a professor she is no stranger to the workings of the academic mind. </p> <p>During her professional life she has worked as a PA in Cyprus, emigrated to South Africa, worked as a secretary to a finance company, and done time as a long-haul air stewardess. Before her present post she was a part-time PA in a firm of surveyors in Oxford. </p> <p>\"By the time I was 48, I felt I was ready for the challenge of a fulltime job,\" she says.

During the 1885 Serbian invasion of Bulgaria the operatically inclined Raina Petkoff gives shelter to a fugitive Swiss mercenary, Captain Bluntschli. He is the kind of practical working soldier who admits to fear and regards chocolate as more useful than cartridges in the heat of battle. Against him Shaw sets Raina's fiance, Major Sergius Saranoff, a dashing exhibitionist who leads heroic cavalry charges against machine guns. When peace is declared and Bluntschli returns to the Petkoff household, it doesn't take much effort to see that the quiet professional will win out over the posturing paladin. </p> <p>Since we no longer believe in romantic military heroism, you could say the play has dated. What keeps it alive, paradoxically, is Shaw's own passion. Amid all the farcical carryings-on about a borrowed greatcoat, Bluntschli suddenly reveals that a Serb colleague was pointlessly burned to death in a woodyard fire; in that moment alone you hear Shaw's hatred of the futile cruelty that underlies the sham heroics of war. </p> <p>Even more revealingly, the Byronic Sergius defines the truly brave man as one \"who will defy to the death any power on earth or in heaven that sets itself up against his own will and conscience\". You could hardly have a clearer statement of Shaw's belief that courage is a moral rather than a physical quality. It is worth sitting through the earlier whimsy for such moments of untrammelled feeling. </p> <p>Howard Saddler is outstanding as Bluntschli, lending him just the right quality of shrewd omniscient sanity, while Susan Salmon and Tim Weekes extract what fun they can from the idea of a pair of mismatched servants. Two other actors also make impressive professional debuts: Leah Muller, swooning to the remembered sounds of Verdi's Ernani, is a suitably rhapsodic Raina and Ben Warwick is all fire and fervour as Sergius.

      "body": "<p>Bored with lining your boss's pockets? Want to work for a company you feel is doing some good in the world? Join the club. According to the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE), support staff are joining the rapidly swelling ranks of UK workers who are turning their backs on employers with no sense of moral responsibility. </p> <p>\"With last week's news that the government is to drop its ethical foreign policy, there are likely to be even more of them taking it into their own hands to ensure that employers lacking values are employers lacking loyal staff,\" says Simon Webley, IBE research director. But if the foreign office finds it too difficult to stick to its commitments, how easy is it for the support worker to find a truly ethical employer? </p> <p>The voluntary sector is perhaps the most obvious port of call - and one of the most popular. Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) has just announced a record number of applications, an indication that workers are looking for a job that does more than just pay the bills. \"The most common reasons given were the wish to give something back and a need for personal fulfilment,\" explains Matthew Bell, VSO's director of communications. But bills do need to be paid, and the financial rewards in the voluntary sector will barely cover your weekly groceries, let alone your rent or mortgage. The VSO's national recruitment campaign, launched earlier this year, was upfront about job prospects: \"Lawyers wanted. Salary \u00a3400 per annum. And yes, you did read that correctly.\" </p> <p>Even paid posts within charities - and indeed the public sector - can offer far lower salaries than average. That's why, says Webley, it's good news that more and more private businesses are introducing a \"code of business ethics\" - something that shows staff and prospective staff just how seriously they are taking their moral responsibilities. </p> <p>A typical code will address corporate policy towards its various stakeholders: employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers and the wider public. Standards relating to suppliers, for example, are likely to include a commitment to ensuring that there is no child labour at any stage of its supply chain, and that wages and working hours are reasonable. Meanwhile, standards relating to staff might include policies on what to do if you are offered products - such as stationery - that you suspect have been made by exploiting workers in developing countries. </p> <p>As part of their code, some companies, such as C&amp;A, have set up a trust to send inspectors on regular visits to check the ethical standards and practices of all suppliers - whether in east London or the Far East. Other employers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, and Monsoon, have joined the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), \"a membership body that focuses purely on setting standards for labour within supply chains,\" explains David Steele, its information officer. </p> <p>Nevertheless, research shows that a few employers do write a code of ethics simply to look good. Upon closer inspection, there may be little real commitment. </p> <p>\"That's why it's so important for values-driven secretaries to ask at the interview stage not only whether there is a code, but whether you can see it,\" advises Rachel Ormond, an academic researcher in ethics and employment. \"It will always exist in document form, and increasingly it is included on the company website and in the annual report. </p> <p>\"You might also want to ask whether your prospective employer encourages staff to get involved in giving something back to society,\" she adds. Employees may do voluntary work, for example, either wholly or partly in company time, and usually on projects initiated by the company. Allied Dunbar sends staff on one-month secondments to help with projects in India. And at M&amp;S, 100-hour part-time secondments are set up for staff to help with local community projects, which are carried out over three-month periods. </p> <p>So important are employers' ethics becoming to today's jobseeker that research shows that they are often the deciding factor when a candidate opts for a particular post. \"In reality, pay and training tend to be a higher priority for support staff,\" says a spokesperson for recruitment consultancy Manpower. \"But because it's a jobseekers' market at the moment, they can often take those two for granted.\" </p> <p>The ETI's David Steele claims that media coverage has encouraged workers to take a broader interest in the companies for which they work. \"There has been a recent influx of documentaries and features highlighting conditions in factories overseas, as well as on issues like child labour in this country,\" he says. \"The fact that the internet has created a global economy is also significant. We no longer think of a sweatshop in Korea as being so far away.\" </p> <p>A spokesperson for recruitment agency Adecco adds a further reason: job-seekers have a greater choice in selecting companies they respect and share common values with. \"More employers are 'going ethical' every day. The result is that if you're a secretary who wants to work in, say, the City, you can now pick a company that you know invests in environmental projects.\" </p> <p> Robert Weston, founder of Groundswell, an ethical business consultancy, explains, \"Organisations approach us not only asking, 'How do we become more values driven?' but 'How can we be seen to be values-driven?' The second question comes from employers' knowledge that to sell their product and to attract the best recruits, they have got to have clear-cut values.\" </p> <p>Shell is one company that has had to work particularly hard at reassessing its approach following past controversies concerning the disposal of the Brent Spar oil platform and the company's activities in Nigeria. Last year, the company unveiled a new ethical advertising campaign - in part aimed at improving its image among prospective employees. \"We want to be seen as a company willing to confront these often difficult issues, not sweep them under the carpet,\" a company spokeswoman explains. </p> <p>Sue Jenkins, PR manager at Triodos - a Bristol-based bank which invests exclusively in organisations with social and environmental objectives - believes that after the greed-oriented 80s, there has been an inevitable move towards \"giving\". \"Most of our candidates now apply because of our values,\" she says. </p> <p>Jane de Bude, PA to the managing director at Triodos, is one such person. She left her last position as a legal secretary for a large solicitors' firm after she became disheartened by their lack of ethics. \"I work hard here,\" she admits. \"But I believe wholeheartedly in what I do. I feel I'm putting something back into society rather than just concentrating on how much money I - or my employers - make. It has made a huge difference to my level of job satisfaction.\" </p> <p>In the end, predicts Alex MacGillivray, deputy director of the New Economics Foundation, ethical issues will become so crucial in the recruitment process that instead of a bunch of well-known \"good\" companies, there will be a blacklist of notoriously \"bad\" ones. Few will want to be listed among the latter. Already, according to the IBE, 83 of the FTSE 100 companies have a code of business ethics. </p> <p>\u0095 Further information: <br>The Institute of Business Ethics: <a href=\"http://www.ibe.org.uk\">www.ibe.org.uk</a> 020-7798 6040;<br> Ethical Trading Initiative: <a href=\"http://www.ethicaltrade.org\">www.ethicaltrade.org</a> 020-7796 0515; <br>Voluntary Services Overseas: <a href=\"http://www.vso.org.uk\">www.vso.org.uk</a> 020-8780 7200; <br>Triodos: <a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.triodos.co.uk</a> 0500 008270</p>",

And yes, you did read that correctly.\" Even paid posts within charities - and indeed the public sector - can offer far lower salaries than average. That's why, says Webley, it's good news that more and more private businesses are introducing a \"code of business ethics\" - something that shows staff and prospective staff just how seriously they are taking their moral responsibilities. A typical code will address corporate policy towards its various stakeholders: employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers and the wider public. Standards relating to suppliers, for example, are likely to include a commitment to ensuring that there is no child labour at any stage of its supply chain, and that wages and working hours are reasonable. Meanwhile, standards relating to staff might include policies on what to do if you are offered products - such as stationery - that you suspect have been made by exploiting workers in developing countries. As part of their code, some companies, such as C&amp;A, have set up a trust to send inspectors on regular visits to check the ethical standards and practices of all suppliers - whether in east London or the Far East. Other employers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, and Monsoon, have joined the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), \"a membership body that focuses purely on setting standards for labour within supply chains,\" explains David Steele, its information officer. Nevertheless, research shows that a few employers do write a code of ethics simply to look good. Upon closer inspection, there may be little real commitment. \"That's why it's so important for values-driven secretaries to ask at the interview stage not only whether there is a code, but whether you can see it,\" advises Rachel Ormond, an academic researcher in ethics and employment. \"It will always exist in document form, and increasingly it is included on the company website and in the annual report. \"You might also want to ask whether your prospective employer encourages staff to get involved in giving something back to society,\" she adds. Employees may do voluntary work, for example, either wholly or partly in company time, and usually on projects initiated by the company. Allied Dunbar sends staff on one-month secondments to help with projects in India. And at M&amp;S, 100-hour part-time secondments are set up for staff to help with local community projects, which are carried out over three-month periods. So important are employers' ethics becoming to today's jobseeker that research shows that they are often the deciding factor when a candidate opts for a particular post. \"In reality, pay and training tend to be a higher priority for support staff,\" says a spokesperson for recruitment consultancy Manpower. \"But because it's a jobseekers' market at the moment, they can often take those two for granted.\" The ETI's David Steele claims that media coverage has encouraged workers to take a broader interest in the companies for which they work. \"There has been a recent influx of documentaries and features highlighting conditions in factories overseas, as well as on issues like child labour in this country,\" he says. \"The fact that the internet has created a global economy is also significant. We no longer think of a sweatshop in Korea as being so far away.\" A spokesperson for recruitment agency Adecco adds a further reason: job-seekers have a greater choice in selecting companies they respect and share common values with. \"More employers are 'going ethical' every day. The result is that if you're a secretary who wants to work in, say, the City, you can now pick a company that you know invests in environmental projects.\" Robert Weston, founder of Groundswell, an ethical business consultancy, explains, \"Organisations approach us not only asking, 'How do we become more values driven?' but 'How can we be seen to be values-driven?' The second question comes from employers' knowledge that to sell their product and to attract the best recruits, they have got to have clear-cut values.\" Shell is one company that has had to work particularly hard at reassessing its approach following past controversies concerning the disposal of the Brent Spar oil platform and the company's activities in Nigeria. Last year, the company unveiled a new ethical advertising campaign - in part aimed at improving its image among prospective employees. \"We want to be seen as a company willing to confront these often difficult issues, not sweep them under the carpet,\" a company spokeswoman explains. Sue Jenkins, PR manager at Triodos - a Bristol-based bank which invests exclusively in organisations with social and environmental objectives - believes that after the greed-oriented 80s, there has been an inevitable move towards \"giving\". \"Most of our candidates now apply because of our values,\" she says. Jane de Bude, PA to the managing director at Triodos, is one such person. She left her last position as a legal secretary for a large solicitors' firm after she became disheartened by their lack of ethics. \"I work hard here,\" she admits. \"But I believe wholeheartedly in what I do. I feel I'm putting something back into society rather than just concentrating on how much money I - or my employers - make. It has made a huge difference to my level of job satisfaction.\" In the end, predicts Alex MacGillivray, deputy director of the New Economics Foundation, ethical issues will become so crucial in the recruitment process that instead of a bunch of well-known \"good\" companies, there will be a blacklist of notoriously \"bad\" ones. Few will want to be listed among the latter. Already, according to the IBE, 83 of the FTSE 100 companies have a code of business ethics. \u0095 Further information: The Institute of Business Ethics: www.ibe.org.uk 020-7798 6040; Ethical Trading Initiative: www.ethicaltrade.org 020-7796 0515; Voluntary Services Overseas: www.vso.org.uk 020-8780 7200; Triodos: www.triodos.co.uk 0500 008270",

Ten years ago that same fish would have fetched a price of \u00a324 - and probably gone into a tin of catfood. </p> <p>The price of tuna is soaring as the species itself seems destined for extinction. </p> <p>Environmental campaigners may soon urge consumers to boycott the latest British fad for Japanese food here as burgeoning sushi sales in the UK are helping to turn the tuna into an endangered species. </p> <p>The demand for sushi has grown so rapidly that the raw fish dish is now available on almost every high street in the UK. Coupled with an increase in popularity for fresh tuna - once found only in the Far East - world tuna catches have doubled in the past 10 years. </p> <p>The 1993 catch of 3.2 million tonnes of tuna is predicted to exceed 4 million tonnes this year. </p> <p>The result is that stocks in all the world's oceans except one are dangerously low. The tuna could disappear. </p> <p>Last week, even the Pacific tuna population was under threat after an emergency conference of 24 fishing nations failed to reach agreement on setting up a body to regulate catches. </p> <p>The South Pacific has already seen a seven-fold increase in catches since 1972 and supports the world's largest tuna fishery. But now that the Japanese, the world's biggest consumer of the most endangered tuna species, have refused to curtail fishing, conservation efforts are unlikely to succeed. </p> <p>The first species to disappear will be the bluefin tuna and is among the top five on the list of fish breeds targeted as needing immediate action to prevent extinction by the World Wildlife Fund's Endangered Seas Campaign. Yet when The Observer called round sushi restaurants in London, bluefin was on most menus as toro - the fatty underbelly of the fish which has become Japan's caviar - commanding prices of up to \u00a350 a plate. </p> <p>'I wouldn't dream of eating tuna, especially bluefin tuna. It would be like eating a rhinoceros: it's just as endangered,' said Michael Gianni, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace International. </p> <p>'There comes a time when consumers are going to have to cut back on the amount of fish they eat and this may well be that time.' </p> <p>Five tuna species, bluefin, albacore, yellowfin, bigeye and skipjack are the most sought-after by the world's fishing fleets. Illegal and unregulated 'pirate' fishing fleets are also taking advantage of the spiralling prices to be had for tuna in Japan. </p> <p>Cheap and convenient, a can of tuna has become a regular stand-by in every kitchen, but the future of tuna fisheries is limited. The 'chicken of the sea' outsells any other type of canned fish or meat with 3.3 billion cans sold worldwide. </p> <p>Skipjack tuna is the most commonly canned. The smallest of the tunas fished commercially, it makes up 40 per cent by weight of the world catch, more than any other species. Marine scientists have little idea how long they will be able to withstand rising catches. </p> <p>'Assuring healthy fish populations is essential to protecting the web of life in our oceans. Fish are a vital food source, especially in the developing world where it is often the major source of protein in coastal communities. Fish are also economically beneficial with nearly 200 million people dependent upon them for their livelihood,' said a spokesman for the Endangered Seas Campaign.</p>",

Environmental campaigners may soon urge consumers to boycott the latest British fad for Japanese food here as burgeoning sushi sales in the UK are helping to turn the tuna into an endangered species. The demand for sushi has grown so rapidly that the raw fish dish is now available on almost every high street in the UK. Coupled with an increase in popularity for fresh tuna - once found only in the Far East - world tuna catches have doubled in the past 10 years. The 1993 catch of 3.2 million tonnes of tuna is predicted to exceed 4 million tonnes this year. The result is that stocks in all the world's oceans except one are dangerously low. The tuna could disappear. Last week, even the Pacific tuna population was under threat after an emergency conference of 24 fishing nations failed to reach agreement on setting up a body to regulate catches. The South Pacific has already seen a seven-fold increase in catches since 1972 and supports the world's largest tuna fishery. But now that the Japanese, the world's biggest consumer of the most endangered tuna species, have refused to curtail fishing, conservation efforts are unlikely to succeed. The first species to disappear will be the bluefin tuna and is among the top five on the list of fish breeds targeted as needing immediate action to prevent extinction by the World Wildlife Fund's Endangered Seas Campaign. Yet when The Observer called round sushi restaurants in London, bluefin was on most menus as toro - the fatty underbelly of the fish which has become Japan's caviar - commanding prices of up to \u00a350 a plate. 'I wouldn't dream of eating tuna, especially bluefin tuna. It would be like eating a rhinoceros: it's just as endangered,' said Michael Gianni, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace International. 'There comes a time when consumers are going to have to cut back on the amount of fish they eat and this may well be that time.' Five tuna species, bluefin, albacore, yellowfin, bigeye and skipjack are the most sought-after by the world's fishing fleets. Illegal and unregulated 'pirate' fishing fleets are also taking advantage of the spiralling prices to be had for tuna in Japan. Cheap and convenient, a can of tuna has become a regular stand-by in every kitchen, but the future of tuna fisheries is limited. The 'chicken of the sea' outsells any other type of canned fish or meat with 3.3 billion cans sold worldwide. Skipjack tuna is the most commonly canned. The smallest of the tunas fished commercially, it makes up 40 per cent by weight of the world catch, more than any other species. Marine scientists have little idea how long they will be able to withstand rising catches. 'Assuring healthy fish populations is essential to protecting the web of life in our oceans. Fish are a vital food source, especially in the developing world where it is often the major source of protein in coastal communities. Fish are also economically beneficial with nearly 200 million people dependent upon them for their livelihood,' said a spokesman for the Endangered Seas Campaign.",

      "body": "<p>Late on the Sunday afternoon after the election, Gordon Brown left his new domain at the Treasury to be driven to the Blairs' home in Richmond Crescent. Stepping through the clutter of cases, crates and boxes of a family preparing to move, they talked together in the front room, the location of so many of their internal debates in Opposition. The difference now was that their words could be made into the flesh of change. They were the two most powerful men in Britain. From the street outside came the chatter of police radios.</p> <p>The Chancellor had come to get a decision from the Prime Minister about handing control over interest rates to the Bank of England. This audacious stroke had been the subject of conversations between the two men for some time. Brown had decided that he wanted to announce Bank independence immediately they came to power, but he had deliberately waited until polling day to bounce that element of the plan on Blair.</p> <p>This was partly tactics: it would give Blair little time to consult others who might be cool about the idea. It was partly temperament. Brown dealt with issues by brooding, alone or within his tight ring of trustees, before crashing his decision on colleagues. Blair circled and circled around subjects, like a plane endlessly orbiting a runway, more often casting widely for advice, before descending on a conclusion. While warm to the boldness of the Bank plan in principle, and enthused by the political dividend of winning the City's instant approval, Blair had mildly irritated Brown by not going snap at once.</p> <p>Brown urged: 'If we're going to do it, we've got to do it immediately.' To postpone would expose them to the accusation that they had been forced into it because they weren't competent to run the economy. Brown showed Blair the letter he proposed to give to the Bank's Governor, the product of a frenzied weekend of work at the Treasury. When Blair agreed to Brown's plan to make the announcement that Tuesday, the Chancellor departed a satisfied man.</p> <p>It was a beaming Eddie George who emerged from his audience at the Treasury with Gordon Brown on Bank Holiday Monday. He told Brown he was 'delighted' with this 'wonderful news'. This was a 'historic moment' for the Bank to which George had been devoted all his working life. But his joy was not unconfined. The Chancellor had also revealed to George an intention to examine the Bank's powers of supervision over financial institutions and the management of government debt.</p> <p>George sought from Brown a promise that he would have the opportunity 'to argue the Bank's case' before a decision was made. The Governor left the meeting with a second letter, not to be published on Bank independence day, containing guarantees from Brown of consultation. Anxious to make sense of this extraordinary event, the Governor sought out his old friend at the Treasury, the Permanent Secretary, Sir Terry Burns. Burns reassured him that nothing was likely to happen about the Bank's other powers in the near future.</p> <p>Both men were seriously misreading the nature of the new Chancellor, and neither had grasped Brown's hidden agenda concerning them both. 'Gordon wanted an independent Bank of England,' says another senior Minister. 'But he didn't want a Governor independent of Gordon Brown.'</p> <p>The Chancellor, possessed of an almost pathological urge to be in control of everything and everyone around him, had long before determined to be rid of Eddie George, the stout, chain-smoking incumbent at Threadneedle Street. Ed Balls, Brown's economic adviser, had been at a pre-election lunch in the Commons at which George had been fiercely critical of Kenneth Clarke's reluctance to raise interest rates. When this was reported back to him, Brown hardened in his conviction against George. 'If he attacks a Tory Chancellor like that, what's he going to do to us?'</p> <p>Blair was aware of Brown's animosity, though not attuned to the scale and determination of it. When the Governor again angered Brown by criticising aspects of his policies in a pre-election interview, Blair dispatched Peter Mandelson to give George a private friendly warning about the perils of provoking the wrath of Brown.</p> <p>'Eddie has to go,' Brown would fume, and he wanted Burns gone with him. A monetarist appointee of Thatcherite vintage, Burns was politically, economically and temperamentally uncongenial to Brown. The Chancellor and his acolytes would refer to the Governor and Permanent Secretary as 'The Manchester Mafia'. A third man in their sights was an alumnus of Manchester Grammar School, the deputy at the Bank, Howard Davies. In his previous incarnation as director-general of the CBI, Davies had sharply attacked some of Brown's policies, criticism which had never been forgotten by the new Chancellor, a man with an elephantine capacity for remembering slights.</p> <p>The moment of combustion was delayed while the covert preparations for the Bank announcement were completed. On Tuesday, 6 May, at a press conference the like of which had never before been organised at the Treasury, Brown revealed his 'revolution at the Bank'. The Prime Minister was not over-guilty of hyperbole when he described it as 'the biggest step in economic policy-making since World War II'. The City celebrated with spree-buying of shares, gilts and sterling. The FT-SE 100 soared to a new record, and the pound reached its highest level against the mark since sterling's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p> <p>Brown was ominously silent about whether George would be reappointed as Governor when his term expired in 1998. As for the plan to strip the Bank of its supervisory powers, that remained a secret to a tiny number within Whitehall.</p> <p>A fortnight after their first meeting, Brown summoned George for another audience. The surprise he now sprang on the Governor was an entirely unwelcome one. As they sat facing each other in his study at No 11, Brown told a pole-axed George that the following day he would be announcing to MPs his plan to transfer the Bank's supervisory powers over financial institutions to a Securities and Investment Board. The Chancellor had already settled on a chief for this 'super-SIB', as it would become known. The job had already been accepted by Howard Davies. As a former head of the Audit Commission, among other qualifications, he had the right pedigree. His CV wasn't Brown's paramount consideration. By appointing Davies, Brown would remove one of the Manchester Mafia from the Bank, and George would be deprived of an ally in resisting the Chancellor.</p> <p>Brown had good cause. A series of scandals had undermined confidence in the Bank's regulatory abilities. His presentation of this to George as a fait accompli was, however, brusque to the point of brutality. The Governor listened with reddening rage. George, a bridge-player, felt that Brown had been dealing from the bottom of the deck. The promises of consultation had been broken. He had been deceived. This, he told Brown, was 'a betrayal, an intolerable betrayal'.</p> <p>As he was driven back to the City, George concluded that his position was untenable. He rang his private office back at the Bank. Between lungfuls of Rothmans cigarettes, he began to dictate a letter of resignation. By the time his car had returned him to Threadneedle Street, George was still boiling, but the temperature of his anger had dropped sufficiently for him to discuss what he should do with senior colleagues at the Bank, and his ally at the Treasury, Sir Terry Burns.</p> <p>Burns urged George not to take a knife to his veins until he had raised the alarm with Sir Robin Butler at No 10. The news that Eddie George had been driven to the brink of resignation was rapidly conveyed to the Prime Minister. 'Jesus,' gasped Blair. 'What has Gordon done?' The resignation of the Governor of the Bank of England, barely a fortnight into the Government's life, would ignite precisely the crisis with the City that he and Brown were supposed to be dedicated to avoiding at any cost. This would be catastrophic, thought Blair.</p> <p>He got hold of the Chancellor. He said: 'There will have to be a negotiation, Gordon.' The Prime Minister also made a personal call to George and - as one witness to this episode puts it - 'poured some balm on his wounds'.</p> <p>Brown never reacted well to being thwarted. This displeasure he expressed by delegating the task of the detailed bargaining with George to his deputy, the Chief Treasury Secretary, Alistair Darling. With Burns acting as the go-between, a concordat would eventually be negotiated which left the Bank with sufficient responsibilities for the overall stability of the financial system to satisfy Eddie George's honour and save his face at the Bank.</p> <p>George attempted to play down rumours that he had been close to resignation. 'All sorts of things go through your mind,' he replied to a question about it, but the thought of resigning 'went away very quickly'. For 'Steady Eddie' even to hint that he had been wobbling was enough to send a tremor through the markets.</p> <p>Was this simply an exhibition of Brown's insensitive approach to relationships? Or had the Chancellor deliberately set out to provoke into resignation a Governor he wanted to be rid of? There is no question, according to one confidant of Brown, that had George gone through with his resignation 'Gordon would have jumped at it'. At the time, one anonymous ministerial associate gloated that the Governor had 'played into our hands'.</p> <p>When Darling presented the agreement he had come to with George for Brown's inspection, the Chancellor indicated his continuing fury by approving it with little more than a grunt.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair was in the top-floor flat of No 11 on Thursday 16 October 1997 when the phone began to ring, irritatingly. He had given instructions that he was not to be interrupted except in an emergency. A small nightmare already sat in front of him. Clare Short had embarrassed herself at the party conference in Brighton a fortnight earlier. Returning to the secure cordon around the conference area after an evening on the party circuit, the International Development Secretary had objected to being searched and had become involved in an emotional altercation with the security staff and the police. Had she been arrested, it would have been terrible for her and the Government. The worst had been averted: party officials intervened. The 'men in the dark' she once savaged were conducting an operation to keep this damaging story out of the newspapers. Blair was discussing with Short how she would handle herself if it did become public.</p> <p>Then, the phone rang. At the other end of the line was Brown, anxious to resume an argument that had been flaring between them for much of the week. With fatiguing intensity, Brown was pressing to make a statement clarifying the Government's attitude towards the European single currency. Since the beginning of autumn, there had been mounting media speculation about a split between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. All of their argument was not re-rehearsed in this brief phone conversation. Distracted by Short and bludgeoned by Brown, Blair agreed to the Chancellor's plan to give a newspaper interview. 'But talk to Alastair first,' said Blair before putting down the phone. This five-minute call had consequences for Britain that would last for years.</p> <p>Brown kept his promise to ring Campbell and told him he would calm the speculation by fulfilling a long-standing request for an interview from Philip Webster, the political editor of the Times . On the assumption that Blair and Brown had reached an agreed position, and wrung out at the end of an exhausting week, Campbell agreed a text with Ed Balls, the Chancellor's economics adviser. Campbell, who does not appear to have discussed it further with Blair, would later confess that this was the scene of one of his greatest mistakes.</p> <p>The media, in common with most of the Cabinet, had presumed that this was a repeat of the drama, familiar from the Conservative years, of a Euro-enthusiastic Chancellor trying to drive a Euro-cautious Prime Minister towards the single currency. What this obscured was the role reversal between the two men. Blair, always temperamentally inclined to leave every option open, wanted to keep alive the possibility of entering the single currency before the election, at the very least as a signal to the rest of Europe of his good intent. But treating the euro as a political gesture was regarded as a nonsense by Brown who saw it as an issue of economics. A man compulsively inclined to close down debates he did not want to have, Brown wanted to shut off the option altogether. Not the least of the many extraordinary features of this episode is that the two most powerful men in government had not settled such a critical difference.</p> <p>Brown had been moving towards a view that the economies of Britain and the continent were not sufficiently synchronised to make early entry desirable or practical. He and Balls were horrified to discover how little preparatory work had been done at the Treasury. Brown brooded over the problem with Balls. If Britain could never be ready to join before the next election, the Government should say so clearly. Constant speculation about their intentions would be damaging, not least to Brown himself. A fixation with leading members of the Blair government was the fear of being stranded on the wrong side of an argument. Brown was not going to charge the guns of the Europhobic press while Blair observed the battle from a safe distance. Personal and economic calculation combined in the Chancellor's mind to produce the conclusion that he should unequivocally declare that Britain would not join the single currency before the next election.</p> <p>It was against this background that Webster of the Times was rung to be told that he had got his interview and was about 'to make history'. This was not an interview in the sense that an innocent newspaper reader might imagine, but a device that had become common practice between politicians with a message to get out and lobby correspondents eager for a story. The crucial passage about the single currency was provided to Webster by fax. It restated the Government's position with a sceptical flavour.</p> <p>The sensation was the headline that the Times printed over it: 'Brown rules out single currency for lifetime of this Parliament'. Though this was probably a little harder than had been intended by the Chancellor, it was the interpretation that Webster had been guided to put on his story during phone conversations with Brown, Balls and, most of all, Campbell who gave the journalist a very strong steer that the Government was ruling out the euro. This was also the line that Charlie Whelan, the Chancellor's devoted and roguish mouthpiece, spun out to other journalists. Brown wanted his change in policy trumpeted in a Europhobic tabloid. 'I'll get on to Higgy,' said Whelan. He suggested to the editor of the Sun that he should headline his version of the story: 'Brown Saves Pound'. Stuart Higgins would run a variation of that tune: 'Brown Says No to the Euro.'</p> <p>To spin such bold headlines over an ambiguous text on an issue of massive consequence was living dangerously. Not quite riskily enough, though, for Whelan. By the time other journalists were alert to the U-turn being announced in the Times , Whelan had repaired to the Red Lion pub to celebrate what he regarded as a great coup. He confirmed the story to BBC Newsnight and ITN. Two Liberal Democrat press officers observed Whelan repeatedly leaving the bar and shouting into his mobile phone: 'Yes, Gordon is ruling out British membership_ No, it doesn't say it in the interview, but Gordon is effectively ruling out joining in this parliament.' Rapidly the word spread that not only was the Government executing a massive change in policy, briefings on what Brown called 'the most important question the country is likely to face in a generation' were being conducted down a mobile phone from the pavement outside a pub.</p> <p>Someone haad been sliced out of the loop: Peter Mandelson. Knowing that he would fight the shift, Brown had left the self-styled 'Minister for Looking Ahead' blindsided. The first Mandelson knew about it was when Millbank faxed a copy of the front page of the Times to him at home in Hartlepool. A little after 10 o'clock, a palpitating Mandelson rang Chequers. Someone even more important had been left in the dark: Tony Blair. The Prime Minister had retired to his Buckinghamshire retreat on Friday evening, entirely oblivious to what was being perpetrated back in London. 'Did you authorise this?' asked Mandelson. 'I don't know,' replied Blair. 'What's going on?' Mandelson read from his faxed copy of the Times . What Brown had done was disastrous, he argued with Blair. Unequivocally ruling out entry would cause untold damage to Britain's relations with Europe and the Government's reputation among pro-European businesses. Now Blair began to fathom the magnitude of what was happening. He ended the call by telling Mandelson that he would immediately speak to the Chancellor. But Brown, who had disappeared to his Scottish constituency for the weekend, was incommunicado. Even the opera tors of the Downing Street switchboard, fabled for its ability to connect the Prime Minister to anyone in the world at any time of day or night, couldn't reach the Chancellor. Nor, even more remarkably, could Blair get hold of Campbell. He had all of his press secretary's phone numbers wired in his head. As he punched the phone, from none of them could the Prime Minister raise an answer. Campbell had gone missing just when Blair vitally needed him. Isolated at Chequers, marooned in the Chilterns, cut off from both Chancellor and press secretary, Tony Blair had one last desperate option. He phoned Char lie Whelan. The Prime Minister had been reduced to asking the man he never wanted in government what government policy was supposed to be tonight. When Blair came on the line, Whelan dived out of the bar of the Red Lion to find a discreet corner.</p> <p>'What the hell is all this stuff in the Times ?' Blair demanded. 'It's our policy,' replied an insouciant Whelan, still revelling in what he took to be a magnificent triumph. 'What's the problem? It's in the Times because it's our policy.' 'Who says it's our policy?' inquired a stunned Prime Minister. He had never authorised this. 'The headline - it's far too hard. You've got to row back.' 'Sorry, Tony,' replied Whelan. 'It's too late.'</p> <p>Had Blair turned on Newsnight , he would have seen the presenter also demanding to know what the hell was government policy on the single currency. Was it, as the official spokesmen for the Treasury were still insisting because Brown had left them in the dark as well, to keep the option open? Was it, as both Campbell and Whelan had been spinning, to rule out entry? The confusion extended to Britain's two most senior civil servants. On Saturday morning, the Cabinet Secretary rang the Treasury's Permanent Secretary. 'What on earth is going on, Terry?' asked Sir Robin Butler. 'I've no more idea than you, Robin,' Terry Burns had to admit.</p> <p>This was turning into an exhibition of New Labour's worst traits. Manoeuvring between its two leading men, exacerbated by the mutual loathing and paranoia of their entourages, and further aggravated by the Government's haphazard forms of decision-making, was creating mayhem in the most fundamental area of foreign and economic affairs.</p> <p>By Saturday morning, the media was savagely questioning the competence of the Government. 'That's done it,' Brown told Whelan. 'They'll crucify us for this.' Whelan offered to resign 'if it will help'. Brown instantly dismissed the idea: it would make him look weak.</p> <p>The spinners went into damage-limitation mode, and not entirely unsuccessfully. Some of the Sunday newspapers carried apparently authoritative reports that the new policy had been meticulously agreed by Blair and Brown the previous week when, in fact, the farrago had flowed from a five-minute phone call. This fiction had been manufactured by Whelan for the consumption of the media to try to dress up the chaos as a well-ordered decision. Campbell and Mandelson both knew this to be mendacious, but felt compelled to fall in with the deception. To do otherwise would be to expose the rupture between Prime Minister and Chancellor.</p> <p>There was a brittle conference call between Blair, Brown, Mandelson, Campbell, Balls and Whelan. Mandelson made plain that he thought they had blundered because they had failed to consult him. But there was not time for involved recriminations. Those would have to wait. It was agreed that the Chancellor would give interviews sticking to the opaque line that he would say no more than that the Government would be making a statement in due course. This was an attempt to put a straight face on this twisted farce.</p> <p>Monday's press was the worst for New Labour since it had come to office. The media tempest was accompanied by turbulent markets when the City opened for the new working week. By excruciatingly unfortunate timing, Brown was due to inaugurate the new electronic trading system at the Stock Exchange. As the Chancellor's gnawed finger activated the system, the screens behind him began to glow red. In 20 minutes \u00a320 billion was wiped off share values.</p> <p>Blair called the principal players together on Tuesday for a post-mortem. The two tribes lined up, Brown, Balls and Whelan on one side of the table; Blair, Mandelson, Campbell and Jonathan Powell on the other. Blair delivered an acidic commentary on the debacle of the previous 96 hours, finding it convenient to assign most culpability to the frictions between his entourage and the Chancellor's retinue. 'The feuding must end,' the Prime Minister declared. Though he rarely ventured even implicit criticism of his Chancellor in the presence of large numbers of witnesses, at one point Blair looked directly across at Brown: 'Everyone is to blame, Gordon, but you have chief responsibility for making sure that something like this never happens again. Our credibility is at stake.'</p> <p>Campbell, as complicit in the disaster as Whelan, was hardly in a position to demand, much as he might have liked to, that the other man be sacrificed. Mandelson was not so constrained. In the absence of the Brown team, Mandelson urged Blair to seize this opportunity to get the head of Whelan. 'We are all to blame,' sighed the Prime Minister. 'It wouldn't be fair.' 'Life's not fair,' snapped back Mandelson. 'Look,' said Blair. 'I'll get rid of him by Christmas.' Whelan had cast himself into the role of villain of this piece. The image of him - fag in mouth, drink in hand, mobile wedged into his neck, spinning economic policy from a pub - was indelibly burned into the episode. But Blair was right: to heap all the blame on a press officer would not be fair. Whelan was the Chancellor's creature following Brown's instructions. Whelan's methods were an application, albeit a crude one, from the New Labour textbook of spin. His most heinous sin against the New Labour commandments was to get caught. Campbell had been an accomplice to the briefings, and then went Awol at exactly the moment when Blair needed him. Brown was guilty of attempting a clumsily executed bounce on Blair who had failed to keep control of an area of policy so important to him.</p> <p>When Blair flew to Scotland for the Commonwealth Summit at the end of that week, still there was no policy. Mandelson was fighting to reverse Brown. Though unwilling to go that far, Blair was not ready to agree to closing off entry altogether. The Chancellor wanted the door slammed; the Prime Minister wanted it left ajar. Drafts of the statement banged back and forth between London and Edinburgh. Down from Scotland from the Prime Minister came his desired text which left the option of joining semi-open by qualifying Brown's policy of closing it off with the phrase 'barring a change in economic circumstances'. Back to Edinburgh went the Brownian version with that phrase removed. They played ping-pong. Each time Blair put the words in, Brown struck them out.</p> <p>Campbell, thinking an apology might draw some of the sting of the criticism, wrote an opening paragraph for Brown's speech expressing regret about the shambles. That Brown also flatly rejected. He was not going to admit failure. He declared he would use his statement to take 'the high ground'. With the negotiations deadlocked, Blair issued a nuclear threat. He told Brown he would make the statement to the Commons himself. Brown was fissile with fury, raging that this would undermine his authority as Chancellor and expose the division between them to the world. Brown did not know it, but he had an unfamiliar ally in Mandelson. 'It would be better,' he separately told Blair, 'to get Gordon to announce your policy.' There was some foundation to Brown's suspicions about being used by Blair.</p> <p>Eventually they ground out a compromise. Britain would not join the single currency before the next election 'barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances'. The door had been left open but only by a crack which time would turn into a victory for the Chancellor.</p> <p>Late on Friday afternoon, it was finally announced from the Treasury that the Chancellor would be making a statement to the Commons on the Monday. He framed his new policy within an overall intent to join the single currency at some point. 'We are the first British government to declare for the principle of monetary union, the first to state that there is no overriding constitutional bar to membership.' If the tests were met and the single currency proved 'successful' then 'Britain should be part of it'. Blair, sitting beside him, had been particularly insistent on this gloss. The new policy was announced as 'prepare and decide'.</p> <p>Euro-enthusiasts believed an opportunity had been missed. Roy Jenkins rang the Prime Minister that evening to tell him he had made a 'grave mistake'. Blair replied: 'Well, maybe.'</p> <p>His predicament over Europe, the conflict between strategy and tactics, the vacillation and indecision, was not over. The reckoning had only been delayed.</p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley.

'I don't know,' replied Blair. 'What's going on?' Mandelson read from his faxed copy of the Times . What Brown had done was disastrous, he argued with Blair. Unequivocally ruling out entry would cause untold damage to Britain's relations with Europe and the Government's reputation among pro-European businesses. Now Blair began to fathom the magnitude of what was happening. He ended the call by telling Mandelson that he would immediately speak to the Chancellor. But Brown, who had disappeared to his Scottish constituency for the weekend, was incommunicado. Even the opera tors of the Downing Street switchboard, fabled for its ability to connect the Prime Minister to anyone in the world at any time of day or night, couldn't reach the Chancellor. Nor, even more remarkably, could Blair get hold of Campbell. He had all of his press secretary's phone numbers wired in his head. As he punched the phone, from none of them could the Prime Minister raise an answer. Campbell had gone missing just when Blair vitally needed him. Isolated at Chequers, marooned in the Chilterns, cut off from both Chancellor and press secretary, Tony Blair had one last desperate option. He phoned Char lie Whelan. The Prime Minister had been reduced to asking the man he never wanted in government what government policy was supposed to be tonight. When Blair came on the line, Whelan dived out of the bar of the Red Lion to find a discreet corner. 'What the hell is all this stuff in the Times ?' Blair demanded. 'It's our policy,' replied an insouciant Whelan, still revelling in what he took to be a magnificent triumph. 'What's the problem? It's in the Times because it's our policy.' 'Who says it's our policy?' inquired a stunned Prime Minister. He had never authorised this. 'The headline - it's far too hard. You've got to row back.' 'Sorry, Tony,' replied Whelan. 'It's too late.' Had Blair turned on Newsnight , he would have seen the presenter also demanding to know what the hell was government policy on the single currency. Was it, as the official spokesmen for the Treasury were still insisting because Brown had left them in the dark as well, to keep the option open? Was it, as both Campbell and Whelan had been spinning, to rule out entry? The confusion extended to Britain's two most senior civil servants. On Saturday morning, the Cabinet Secretary rang the Treasury's Permanent Secretary. 'What on earth is going on, Terry?' asked Sir Robin Butler. 'I've no more idea than you, Robin,' Terry Burns had to admit. This was turning into an exhibition of New Labour's worst traits. Manoeuvring between its two leading men, exacerbated by the mutual loathing and paranoia of their entourages, and further aggravated by the Government's haphazard forms of decision-making, was creating mayhem in the most fundamental area of foreign and economic affairs. By Saturday morning, the media was savagely questioning the competence of the Government. 'That's done it,' Brown told Whelan. 'They'll crucify us for this.' Whelan offered to resign 'if it will help'. Brown instantly dismissed the idea: it would make him look weak. The spinners went into damage-limitation mode, and not entirely unsuccessfully. Some of the Sunday newspapers carried apparently authoritative reports that the new policy had been meticulously agreed by Blair and Brown the previous week when, in fact, the farrago had flowed from a five-minute phone call. This fiction had been manufactured by Whelan for the consumption of the media to try to dress up the chaos as a well-ordered decision. Campbell and Mandelson both knew this to be mendacious, but felt compelled to fall in with the deception. To do otherwise would be to expose the rupture between Prime Minister and Chancellor. There was a brittle conference call between Blair, Brown, Mandelson, Campbell, Balls and Whelan. Mandelson made plain that he thought they had blundered because they had failed to consult him. But there was not time for involved recriminations. Those would have to wait. It was agreed that the Chancellor would give interviews sticking to the opaque line that he would say no more than that the Government would be making a statement in due course. This was an attempt to put a straight face on this twisted farce. Monday's press was the worst for New Labour since it had come to office. The media tempest was accompanied by turbulent markets when the City opened for the new working week. By excruciatingly unfortunate timing, Brown was due to inaugurate the new electronic trading system at the Stock Exchange. As the Chancellor's gnawed finger activated the system, the screens behind him began to glow red. In 20 minutes \u00a320 billion was wiped off share values. Blair called the principal players together on Tuesday for a post-mortem. The two tribes lined up, Brown, Balls and Whelan on one side of the table; Blair, Mandelson, Campbell and Jonathan Powell on the other. Blair delivered an acidic commentary on the debacle of the previous 96 hours, finding it convenient to assign most culpability to the frictions between his entourage and the Chancellor's retinue. 'The feuding must end,' the Prime Minister declared. Though he rarely ventured even implicit criticism of his Chancellor in the presence of large numbers of witnesses, at one point Blair looked directly across at Brown: 'Everyone is to blame, Gordon, but you have chief responsibility for making sure that something like this never happens again. Our credibility is at stake.' Campbell, as complicit in the disaster as Whelan, was hardly in a position to demand, much as he might have liked to, that the other man be sacrificed. Mandelson was not so constrained. In the absence of the Brown team, Mandelson urged Blair to seize this opportunity to get the head of Whelan. 'We are all to blame,' sighed the Prime Minister. 'It wouldn't be fair.' 'Life's not fair,' snapped back Mandelson. 'Look,' said Blair. 'I'll get rid of him by Christmas.' Whelan had cast himself into the role of villain of this piece. The image of him - fag in mouth, drink in hand, mobile wedged into his neck, spinning economic policy from a pub - was indelibly burned into the episode. But Blair was right: to heap all the blame on a press officer would not be fair. Whelan was the Chancellor's creature following Brown's instructions. Whelan's methods were an application, albeit a crude one, from the New Labour textbook of spin. His most heinous sin against the New Labour commandments was to get caught. Campbell had been an accomplice to the briefings, and then went Awol at exactly the moment when Blair needed him. Brown was guilty of attempting a clumsily executed bounce on Blair who had failed to keep control of an area of policy so important to him. When Blair flew to Scotland for the Commonwealth Summit at the end of that week, still there was no policy. Mandelson was fighting to reverse Brown. Though unwilling to go that far, Blair was not ready to agree to closing off entry altogether. The Chancellor wanted the door slammed; the Prime Minister wanted it left ajar. Drafts of the statement banged back and forth between London and Edinburgh. Down from Scotland from the Prime Minister came his desired text which left the option of joining semi-open by qualifying Brown's policy of closing it off with the phrase 'barring a change in economic circumstances'. Back to Edinburgh went the Brownian version with that phrase removed. They played ping-pong. Each time Blair put the words in, Brown struck them out. Campbell, thinking an apology might draw some of the sting of the criticism, wrote an opening paragraph for Brown's speech expressing regret about the shambles. That Brown also flatly rejected. He was not going to admit failure. He declared he would use his statement to take 'the high ground'. With the negotiations deadlocked, Blair issued a nuclear threat. He told Brown he would make the statement to the Commons himself. Brown was fissile with fury, raging that this would undermine his authority as Chancellor and expose the division between them to the world. Brown did not know it, but he had an unfamiliar ally in Mandelson. 'It would be better,' he separately told Blair, 'to get Gordon to announce your policy.' There was some foundation to Brown's suspicions about being used by Blair. Eventually they ground out a compromise. Britain would not join the single currency before the next election 'barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances'. The door had been left open but only by a crack which time would turn into a victory for the Chancellor. Late on Friday afternoon, it was finally announced from the Treasury that the Chancellor would be making a statement to the Commons on the Monday. He framed his new policy within an overall intent to join the single currency at some point. 'We are the first British government to declare for the principle of monetary union, the first to state that there is no overriding constitutional bar to membership.' If the tests were met and the single currency proved 'successful' then 'Britain should be part of it'. Blair, sitting beside him, had been particularly insistent on this gloss. The new policy was announced as 'prepare and decide'. Euro-enthusiasts believed an opportunity had been missed. Roy Jenkins rang the Prime Minister that evening to tell him he had made a 'grave mistake'. Blair replied: 'Well, maybe.' His predicament over Europe, the conflict between strategy and tactics, the vacillation and indecision, was not over. The reckoning had only been delayed. \u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley.

The Irish government is angry over the Secretary of State's warning against 'absolutist' demands on the implementation of the Patten report - a clear swipe at nationalist politicians who claim the reforms are being diluted in favour of unionists. Irish officials said yesterday that if the report is not implemented in full then Sinn Fein and the IRA would renege on further decommissioning of republican arsenals. A senior Irish government source said: 'The Policing Bill as it stands now before the House of Lords is not only unacceptable to Sinn Fein but also to the SDLP and this government.

      "byline": "Andrew Rawnsley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It had become a persistent theme of media commentary that, in New Labour plc, Blair was the chairman and Brown the chief executive. The Prime Minister giddied around the globe from summit to summit; the Chancellor was the colossus who bestrode the peaks at home. The implication was that while the Prime Minister was the grinning, travelling salesman of the Government, the man of substance and action was the Chancellor.</p> <p>Blair was initially sanguine about all this. To one aide who worried that the Chancellor was becoming over-mighty, Blair expressed himself unbothered: 'When I sit in the garden of Chequers, and the sun is on my face, I know who is the Prime Minister.' Others around nagged him about the markedly more comradely noises in Brown's speeches which seemed designed to pitch himself to Labour MPs as a more radical substitute for Blair. The Prime Minister again appeared unfazed. 'If Gordon uses a bit of left-wing rhetoric, so what? It keeps the party happy.'</p> <p>A civil servant remarked to Blair that when Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson were together it was like 'watching two strangers talking'. Blair replied that his relationship with his Chancellor was like 'a marriage'.</p> <p>Lurking in the recesses of any argument between Prime Minister and Chancellor was Brown's belief that he had been the making of Blair. The Prime Minister couldn't entirely subscribe to that, but he did acknowledge his debts to Brown. 'It's always there when Gordon is arguing with Tony - \"you owe me\" - even if it's not very often expressed,' says a Cabinet Minister.</p> <p>Officials marvelled as they were also shocked at the open disdain with which Brown would sometimes treat Blair. Aides and colleagues remarked upon the extraordinary efforts Blair devoted to managing Brown. 'He mediates, he negotiates, he defuses, he cajoles, he rails, he shouts, he hugs, he flatters,' said a close observer of the relationship.</p> <p>The 'normality' of Blair was an act, but it was more than a performance. It was his self-conceit that 'I do not think of myself as a politician'. Of course, he was a politician, a most extraordinary politician. What he meant was that he had not been born and bred by the machine; his every breath was not politics. The same was not true of Brown, a man consumed by the political since an early age. 'Gordon's problem is that he hasn't got a family,' Blair told one confidant, which he also believed to be the central explanation for what was wrong with Peter Mandelson.</p> <p>Blair thought that he had a unique capacity for dealing with his turbulent and talented friends. Ministers, aides and civil servants who brought him complaints about the Chancellor's uncollegiate behaviour were told by Blair: 'I can handle Gordon,' in the manner of a psychotherapist talking about a brilliant but temperamental child.</p> <p>Gordon went through 'unco-operative' stretches, the Prime Minister explained to one close friend, but 'he always comes back in the end'. A senior civil servant who has observed them at close quarters confirms: 'It is like a marriage, a tempestuous marriage. The rows can be terrible. But if you're on the outside and you interfere, you won't be thanked for it afterwards. You come between them at your peril. When it comes to make-up time, everyone else is to blame, rather than they themselves.</p> <p>By the New Year of 1998, the marriage was increasingly strained by stretches of crockery-throwing. Blair's ambition to turn No 10 into the corporate headquarters of his government had been frustrated. While his energies were dissipated, the design to turn the Cabinet Office into a Department of the Prime Minister, imposing his writ across Whitehall, was not realised. Brown saw the vacuum and rushed to impose himself in it. The Chancellor's comprehensive spending review was an opportunity to delve deep into every department which he further exploited by binding Ministers to his will through 'public service agreements' with the Treasury. The good reason for this - ensuring that money was efficiently spent - was allied to a manipulative motive. It was an attempt to make the rest of the Cabinet agree to serve the Treasury.</p> <p>Regular, and from a variety of Ministers, were the protests to Blair that Brown's idea of consultation was to pick up the phone and bark his decisions at them. David Blunkett complained that Brown would block his ideas and then repackage them as the Chancellor's own under the New Deal label. 'Blunkett would go bananas,' says a civil servant. So provoked was Blunkett by Brown on one occasion that the Education Secretary stormed from his ministerial suite shouting 'the mendacious sod', demanded his car, and told the driver to take him straight round to Blair. His alarmed officials rang No 10 to warn them of the imminent arrival of an incendiary Secretary of State.</p> <p>Blair began to tire of dousing colleagues inflamed by Brown. Expressions of his exasperation with the Chancellor became more frequent. 'Jesus,' Blair despaired to officials and aides. 'What has Gordon done now?'</p> <p>At moments of extreme exasperation, Blair would cry: 'God! Gordon can be impossible.' The surface tension manifested itself in increasingly demented infighting between the rival entourages at Downing Street and the Treasury. Alastair Campbell made time in his frantic schedule to compile a bulging file of cuttings of newspaper stories inspired, or so he believed, by Charlie Whelan to promote the Chancellor at the expense of the rest of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister.</p> <p>The relationship was so fissiparous that something as apparently innocuous as a friendly biography of Brown provoked mounting agitation at No 10. In early January, Campbell demanded of Whelan that he let him have a pre-publication copy of Paul Routledge's life of Gordon Brown. Campbell called him a liar and smashed down the phone when Whelan replied that he couldn't, because he had lent the only copy in his possession to John Brown, the Chancellor's older brother. It was long beyond the point of mattering whether or not Whelan was telling the truth: he probably was in this case. The relationship between him and Campbell had collapsed.</p> <p>This grudge match between the spinners was amplification and aggravation of the stress lines between Prime Minister and Chancellor. It also served as a proxy for the battle for ascendancy between them. It suited both Blair and Brown to pretend to each other, even to themselves, that vicious briefing by their rival coteries was not of their making. Whelan's excesses occasionally made Brown wince; some of Campbell's activities caused Blair to flinch. Yet both gun dogs were broadly following their masters' wishes. Otherwise, they would have been muzzled or put down. On one of the many occasions when Mandelson demanded of the Prime Minister that he force the Chancellor to dispose of Whelan, Blair replied: 'How can I sack Charlie when he's only doing what Gordon's telling him to do?'</p> <p>The biography of Brown - written with 'his full co-operation' - was an admiring account of a man about whom there was much to admire. Routledge accurately depicted the Chancellor as a man scarred by the way in which he had been denied the crown by Blair. Picking the scab off this wound presented Brown, a picture that was not as kindly as the biographer intended, as a man eaten by past wrongs. Calculated to infuriate Blair was the book's tendentious suggestion that he was a cheat and a charlatan who broke a blood promise to his oldest political ally and robbed of his birthright the man who was supposed to be his closest friend.</p> <p>The nature of the Blair-Brown relationship was a subject I thought worth exploring in my column for The Observer. Of many conversations I had that week, the most significant was with a person I described at the time as 'someone who has an extremely good claim to know the mind of the Prime Minister'. I would describe them that way today.</p> <p>For the first five minutes of a long conversation with this person, I was spun the familiar line that no political coupling was more blissful than that between Blair and Brown. The Prime Minister esteemed the Chancellor as 'a great talent' and 'a great force'. But, after a little prodding, an entirely different account began to tumble out. Brown's self-promoting biography was 'a classic piece of misjudgment'. The Government could not afford 'any more lapses into this sort of nonsense'.</p> <p>Why, I wondered, did Brown behave like this? 'You know Gordon, he feels so vulnerable and so insecure. He has these psychological flaws.' Warming to the theme, the other person poured out a litany of complaint about how all the Government's afflictions had been caused by the Treasury. 'If you go through the real disasters of our time in government - EMU, the Geoffrey Robinson affair, ISAs, single parents - I'm afraid there is a common thread to them all. They are coming out of the Treasury.' This was not entirely just: chief responsibility for the Ecclestone Affair lay at the door of No 10. The complaint continued: 'What Gordon has done is cut out the civil service, and that just leads to trouble.' Blair was obliged to take control of the committee on welfare because other members of the Cabinet 'just don't trust Gordon. There's so much venom against him.'</p> <p>The highlights of the insight this offered into the nature of the relationship between Prime Minister and Chancellor formed the basis of the column I wrote that weekend.

      "bodyText": "It had become a persistent theme of media commentary that, in New Labour plc, Blair was the chairman and Brown the chief executive. The Prime Minister giddied around the globe from summit to summit; the Chancellor was the colossus who bestrode the peaks at home. The implication was that while the Prime Minister was the grinning, travelling salesman of the Government, the man of substance and action was the Chancellor. Blair was initially sanguine about all this. To one aide who worried that the Chancellor was becoming over-mighty, Blair expressed himself unbothered: 'When I sit in the garden of Chequers, and the sun is on my face, I know who is the Prime Minister.' Others around nagged him about the markedly more comradely noises in Brown's speeches which seemed designed to pitch himself to Labour MPs as a more radical substitute for Blair. The Prime Minister again appeared unfazed. 'If Gordon uses a bit of left-wing rhetoric, so what? It keeps the party happy.' A civil servant remarked to Blair that when Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson were together it was like 'watching two strangers talking'. Blair replied that his relationship with his Chancellor was like 'a marriage'. Lurking in the recesses of any argument between Prime Minister and Chancellor was Brown's belief that he had been the making of Blair. The Prime Minister couldn't entirely subscribe to that, but he did acknowledge his debts to Brown. 'It's always there when Gordon is arguing with Tony - \"you owe me\" - even if it's not very often expressed,' says a Cabinet Minister. Officials marvelled as they were also shocked at the open disdain with which Brown would sometimes treat Blair. Aides and colleagues remarked upon the extraordinary efforts Blair devoted to managing Brown. 'He mediates, he negotiates, he defuses, he cajoles, he rails, he shouts, he hugs, he flatters,' said a close observer of the relationship. The 'normality' of Blair was an act, but it was more than a performance. It was his self-conceit that 'I do not think of myself as a politician'. Of course, he was a politician, a most extraordinary politician. What he meant was that he had not been born and bred by the machine; his every breath was not politics. The same was not true of Brown, a man consumed by the political since an early age. 'Gordon's problem is that he hasn't got a family,' Blair told one confidant, which he also believed to be the central explanation for what was wrong with Peter Mandelson. Blair thought that he had a unique capacity for dealing with his turbulent and talented friends. Ministers, aides and civil servants who brought him complaints about the Chancellor's uncollegiate behaviour were told by Blair: 'I can handle Gordon,' in the manner of a psychotherapist talking about a brilliant but temperamental child. Gordon went through 'unco-operative' stretches, the Prime Minister explained to one close friend, but 'he always comes back in the end'. A senior civil servant who has observed them at close quarters confirms: 'It is like a marriage, a tempestuous marriage. The rows can be terrible. But if you're on the outside and you interfere, you won't be thanked for it afterwards. You come between them at your peril. When it comes to make-up time, everyone else is to blame, rather than they themselves. By the New Year of 1998, the marriage was increasingly strained by stretches of crockery-throwing. Blair's ambition to turn No 10 into the corporate headquarters of his government had been frustrated. While his energies were dissipated, the design to turn the Cabinet Office into a Department of the Prime Minister, imposing his writ across Whitehall, was not realised. Brown saw the vacuum and rushed to impose himself in it. The Chancellor's comprehensive spending review was an opportunity to delve deep into every department which he further exploited by binding Ministers to his will through 'public service agreements' with the Treasury. The good reason for this - ensuring that money was efficiently spent - was allied to a manipulative motive. It was an attempt to make the rest of the Cabinet agree to serve the Treasury. Regular, and from a variety of Ministers, were the protests to Blair that Brown's idea of consultation was to pick up the phone and bark his decisions at them. David Blunkett complained that Brown would block his ideas and then repackage them as the Chancellor's own under the New Deal label. 'Blunkett would go bananas,' says a civil servant. So provoked was Blunkett by Brown on one occasion that the Education Secretary stormed from his ministerial suite shouting 'the mendacious sod', demanded his car, and told the driver to take him straight round to Blair. His alarmed officials rang No 10 to warn them of the imminent arrival of an incendiary Secretary of State. Blair began to tire of dousing colleagues inflamed by Brown. Expressions of his exasperation with the Chancellor became more frequent. 'Jesus,' Blair despaired to officials and aides. 'What has Gordon done now?' At moments of extreme exasperation, Blair would cry: 'God! Gordon can be impossible.' The surface tension manifested itself in increasingly demented infighting between the rival entourages at Downing Street and the Treasury. Alastair Campbell made time in his frantic schedule to compile a bulging file of cuttings of newspaper stories inspired, or so he believed, by Charlie Whelan to promote the Chancellor at the expense of the rest of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. The relationship was so fissiparous that something as apparently innocuous as a friendly biography of Brown provoked mounting agitation at No 10. In early January, Campbell demanded of Whelan that he let him have a pre-publication copy of Paul Routledge's life of Gordon Brown. Campbell called him a liar and smashed down the phone when Whelan replied that he couldn't, because he had lent the only copy in his possession to John Brown, the Chancellor's older brother. It was long beyond the point of mattering whether or not Whelan was telling the truth: he probably was in this case. The relationship between him and Campbell had collapsed. This grudge match between the spinners was amplification and aggravation of the stress lines between Prime Minister and Chancellor. It also served as a proxy for the battle for ascendancy between them. It suited both Blair and Brown to pretend to each other, even to themselves, that vicious briefing by their rival coteries was not of their making. Whelan's excesses occasionally made Brown wince; some of Campbell's activities caused Blair to flinch. Yet both gun dogs were broadly following their masters' wishes. Otherwise, they would have been muzzled or put down. On one of the many occasions when Mandelson demanded of the Prime Minister that he force the Chancellor to dispose of Whelan, Blair replied: 'How can I sack Charlie when he's only doing what Gordon's telling him to do?' The biography of Brown - written with 'his full co-operation' - was an admiring account of a man about whom there was much to admire. Routledge accurately depicted the Chancellor as a man scarred by the way in which he had been denied the crown by Blair. Picking the scab off this wound presented Brown, a picture that was not as kindly as the biographer intended, as a man eaten by past wrongs. Calculated to infuriate Blair was the book's tendentious suggestion that he was a cheat and a charlatan who broke a blood promise to his oldest political ally and robbed of his birthright the man who was supposed to be his closest friend. The nature of the Blair-Brown relationship was a subject I thought worth exploring in my column for The Observer. Of many conversations I had that week, the most significant was with a person I described at the time as 'someone who has an extremely good claim to know the mind of the Prime Minister'. I would describe them that way today. For the first five minutes of a long conversation with this person, I was spun the familiar line that no political coupling was more blissful than that between Blair and Brown. The Prime Minister esteemed the Chancellor as 'a great talent' and 'a great force'. But, after a little prodding, an entirely different account began to tumble out. Brown's self-promoting biography was 'a classic piece of misjudgment'. The Government could not afford 'any more lapses into this sort of nonsense'. Why, I wondered, did Brown behave like this? 'You know Gordon, he feels so vulnerable and so insecure. He has these psychological flaws.' Warming to the theme, the other person poured out a litany of complaint about how all the Government's afflictions had been caused by the Treasury. 'If you go through the real disasters of our time in government - EMU, the Geoffrey Robinson affair, ISAs, single parents - I'm afraid there is a common thread to them all. They are coming out of the Treasury.' This was not entirely just: chief responsibility for the Ecclestone Affair lay at the door of No 10. The complaint continued: 'What Gordon has done is cut out the civil service, and that just leads to trouble.' Blair was obliged to take control of the committee on welfare because other members of the Cabinet 'just don't trust Gordon. There's so much venom against him.' The highlights of the insight this offered into the nature of the relationship between Prime Minister and Chancellor formed the basis of the column I wrote that weekend. The vivid phrase 'psychological flaws' was projected on to the front page of The Observer. There was a media excitement. Peter Mandelson spoke truthfully when he denied authorship of 'psychological flaws'. Many, though, thought they heard the voice of Mandelson, who had been depicted as a treacherous Iago in the Brown biography, speaking later that Sunday.

      "bodyText": "Mo Mowlam, the darling of all but the senior members of her own political party, is to lay bare her pet hates in a television show on Friday night. The former Northern Ireland Secretary is the guest of comedian Paul Merton in BBC2's Room 101, in which she will confess her loathing for lawyers. The entire legal profession, represented by a model of a shark, is number two on her list of items selected for annihilation. Avoiding any reference to the fact that Tony Blair and his wife are both trained barristers, Mowlam argues that lawyers should be wiped off the face of the planet,and complains most of them think they rule it. 'They are difficult, arrogant, self-opinionated and they earn too much money,' she tells Merton. The Cabinet Minister, who announced last week that she is to step down from parliament at the next general election, adds that the worst types of lawyers tend to have gone to both Eton and Oxford, where they quickly pick up 'a degree of confidence' that other people have to learn later through hard graft in the real world. Mowlam also consigns Clause 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act to the fiery furnace. Arguing strongly for the repeal of Conservative legislation that banned the 'promotion' of homosexuality in schools, she indicates that the issue is one which she will continue to campaign about. She claims there is no reason why young people should not be offered full information on homosexuality and on sexuality generally. 'People are what they are. Nobody can tell you that you have to be one way or the other. People should have the right to learn for themselves what they are.' Mowlam, MP for Redcar, was recently chosen to welcome publicly the gay Conservative businessman Ivan Massow over to the Labour Party. She also rails against no smoking signs which, she says, are an infringement of civil liberties. Although she has given up the habit since her treatment for a brain tumour, she confesses that she still enjoys the 'odd passive moment'. In a return to childhood passions, Mowlam speaks of her dislike of cooked apple and of the 'green slime' found on open-air statues. As a schoolgirl in Coventry, the young Mo and her friends made news in the local paper by volunteering to clean the verdigris from the municipal statue of the nude Lady Godiva. Golf is also savaged by Mowlam, but the first choice for her personal Room 101 is the wig that she wore for six months during her chemotherapy treatment. She says she had two identical wigs, one of which she has auctioned off for charity. She denies that she ever took it off during negotiations to gain political advantage. 'I just took it off when I was hot, although that may sometimes have coincided with difficult moments,' she says.",

      "body": "<p>Speculation about a Cabinet reshuffle swelled to a feverish pitch in July 1999. Frank Dobson suffered endless rumour-mongering that he was to be ejected from Health and forced to run for Mayor of London. The speculation that he had a short life left in government provoked an understandably aggrieved reaction. Like a bear that has been prodded with sticks, Dobson lashed out at the 'fancy Nancies' and 'anonymous liars' predicting that he was for 'the chop' and growled: 'I intend remaining the Secretary of State for Health.'</p> <p>Dobson's mutiny was followed by that of another victim of reshuffle fever, Mo Mowlam. She declared: 'I haven't had my fill of Northern Ireland', and said she wanted to stay 'long enough' to see the peace process to fruition. Less than a year previously, at the 1998 conference, she was the star of the Prime Minister's speech. When he referred to 'our one and only Mo', the entire conference sprang cheering to its feet, conferring on Mowlam the unique distinction of winning a standing ovation in the middle of the leader's address. The moment of public glory concealed private decline. The Unionists - and crucially their leader, David Trimble - had never taken to her. By now, relations between the spontaneous Mowlam and the rigid Trimble had collapsed. During the abortive attempt to implement the Good Friday agreement at Hillsborough Castle in June, Mowlam sat doing letters from her red box while Blair conducted the negotiations with Trimble. The Unionist leader was lobbying Blair to send Peter Mandelson to Belfast.</p> <p>Blair floated the idea with Mowlam. Misunderstanding him, at first she reacted quite positively, saying 'it will do Peter good' to begin his rehabilitation as a Minister of State in the province. With horror, she learnt that Blair was actually thinking about giving her job to him. The heat was further turned up on her pressure-cooker temper by incessant media chatter that Mandelson was bound for Belfast. He phoned Mowlam to deny all responsibility for planting these stories, telling her: 'I'm not angling for your job.' She answered his protestations of innocence with a hail of scornful expletives, and slammed down the phone. That evening, Mandelson rang Blair. 'I told her it wasn't me. She wouldn't believe me.' Blair replied: 'Well, she wouldn't. Would you?'</p> <p>The Prime Minister was in an agonising quandary. He did not desire to humiliate the most popular member of the Cabinet; he would much rather exploit her public appeal. After more than two years in Belfast, Mowlam was actually ready to leave. But all the speculation that she was to be dragged away contrived to make her more determined to dig in her heels when she discussed her prospects with Blair in mid-July. She bluntly spurned his entreaties to become the anti-Livingstone candidate for London. She wanted to be Foreign Secretary. 'My strength is people,' she put it to Blair. The Foreign Office was 'the best chance' for her to use that skill. Blair reckoned there was rather more to being Foreign Secretary than that, though he tried to rebuff her tactfully. He responded: 'You're not ready.' This unhappy argument concluded without agreement.</p> <p>In the autumn, she said to him: 'I know you won't give me the Foreign Office now because you think I'm not ready.' As a step towards her goal, how about giving her the departing George Robertson's job at Defence? Blair refused. He offered Health Secretary. To his surprise, she turned him down. All the Prime Minister had left for Mowlam was a scraping from the bottom of the barrel: Minister at the Cabinet Office. The fate of the outgoing 'Enforcer', Jack Cunningham, who lasted there barely more than a year, was a warning not to sup at that poisoned chalice. Mowlam didn't want to be 'Minister for the Today programme'. 'She's been put in the parking lot,' derisively commented a senior member of the Cabinet.</p> <p>Miserable and miscast at the Cabinet Office, within a few weeks of the reshuffle, she let Blair know that she would now run for London, after all. What she wouldn't do was compete against Frank Dobson. He would have to be persuaded to step aside. Blair tried and failed. Margaret McDonagh approached Dobson and suggested he should pull out. Dobson, who regarded that as a humiliating request which would make him look completely ridiculous, was now determined to stay in the race. If Dobson had not mind-flipped at the conference, and if Mowlam had decided she wanted London just a few weeks earlier, the entire outcome could have been so much happier for New Labour.

      "bodyText": "American officials in Kosovo are being accused of interfering with an investigation into a senior Kosovo Albanian politician implicated in murder, drug-trafficking and war crimes. Ramush Haradinaj, a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), was the key US military and intelligence asset in Kosovo during the civil war and the Nato bombing campaign that followed. In the latest twist in the saga of an increasingly flawed electoral process, United Nations police in the province complain that US personnel withheld evidence about a gunfight involving Haradinaj, who is now head of one of the province's leading political groups. UN investigators leading the case say US officials based at their main base, Camp Bondsteel, removed forensic evidence from the scene of the gun battle, including bullets retrieved from walls. The incident, which took place in the village of Strellc in the west of Kosovo, is well out of the US Army's area of responsibility, which lies in the south-east of the province. Following the shooting Haradinaj, known almost universally in the province as simply Ramush, was flown by helicopter to Camp Bondsteel and then onto Germany to be treated in an US Army hospital for shrapnel wounds. UN investigators were denied access to him during that time. Evidence from the incident was eventually handed over after angry phone calls from Fred Pascoe, the American policeman heading the UN investigation. The news of American reluctance to co-operate with the investigation comes amid a catalogue of accusations linking Haradinaj to murder, drugs trafficking and war crimes. The shooting revolved around a dispute between Haradinaj and members of the Musaj family, who accuse him of ordering the murder of their brother and three other men shortly after the arrival of Nato troops in Kosovo in June 1999. The men were all part of FARK (Armed Force of the Republic of Kosovo ), a rival group to the Kosovo Liberation Army. Three Musaj brothers had visited Haradinaj's father to demand the bones of their brother, a right they had according to Albanian custom. Haradinaj admits he went to the Musaj family home at around one in the morning to stop the brothers from visiting his father again. This is the second time this year Haradinaj has been caught up in violence. He was injured in a fight with Russian soldiers at a K-For checkpoint in the spring. Western diplomats say he has damaged his party's prospects in UN-organised local elections due this October. This latest incident does not appear to have damaged his contacts with US military or political figures. His party officials were invited to a discussion on the future of Kosovo at a meeting organised by the US state department. He himself is currently in Washington on a fund-raising trip and as the guest of a US Congressman, Benjamin Gillman. His standing with the international community is summed up by British officials who describe him as 'one of the few former commanders of the KLA who can deliver'. They say he was crucial in smoothing over the transition of the KLA from a guerrilla army to a civilian-based national guard. But British military personnel who liaised with Haradinaj before and during the Nato bombing campaign paint a different picture. One former soldier, who served with the Kosovo Verification Mission, described him as 'a psychopath' and accused him of terrorising his own men and the local population into loyalty to him. 'He would beat his own men to maintain a kind of military discipline,' he said. 'Someone would pass him some information and he would disappear for two hours. The end result would be several bodies in a ditch,' he added The man said he was also present when Ramush 'went to deal with' an Albanian family who had let Serb police into their house. The incident matches a human rights report issued by the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe) last year in which seven masked men entered a house in the village of Gornja Lucka. Two men were beaten and a third was taken to a nearby canal and never seen again. During this time the same former soldier says Haradinaj was maintaining daily contact with American military personnel in the US and that these links were then taken over by Nato at the beginning of the bombing campaign in Kosovo. Another alleged victim of Ramush's men was Suad Qorraj, who had operated a satellite telephone for a rival KLA commander during the war. His family say he went missing from the town of Decani on 23 June 1999, two weeks after the end of the war. On 1 August Suad's charred remains were found in a nearby forest. The burial notice said he had been 'killed by Serbs'. A year on from Suad's death, Haradinaj still wields considerable power in western Kosovo. 'He can very easily bring the area to a halt,' says Robert Charmbury, UN administrator of the biggest town in the region, Pec, citing as evidence the fight against Russian peace keepers in which the town was 'blockaded in minutes'. The Alliance party has strong representation on local municipal boards and is discussing the possibility of a pact with the Kosovan Democratic Party (PDK), led by Hashim Thaci, former political leader of the KLA. Such a deal might squeeze out the favourites to win in the region, the Democratic League of Kosovo, in October's elections. Whatever the outcome of the polls, senior UN officials are concerned about Haradinaj's long-term impact on the province.

His jaunt to Australia would include a stop-off in New Zealand. Plans for a white paper on broadcasting had to be considered afresh; the party conference was just around the corner.</p> <p>But on the top of his in-tray was something which would cause his eyebrows to knit with quiet anger. PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked by the company which runs the Millennium Dome to put together a report on the financial management of the Greenwich attraction, had come up with a bleak assessment: if the Dome was to operate until the end of the year it would need an extra \u00a347 million. Immediately.</p> <p>The Government knew the Dome would need another bail-out on top of the \u00a343m it had received in July. But this amount? For something already controversial, it was political suicide.</p> <p>The accountants' report said closure would be more expensive and more damaging than giving the Dome more lottery money. The Government was not convinced and told the firm to go away and do some more sums. Another accountancy firm, Deloitte &amp; Touche, was asked to pore over the figures. They all came back with the same answer. Closure was legally problematic, financially expensive and politically impossible. A meeting of the lottery commissioners, who would have to give out the money, was scheduled for 5 September. Smith, their chairman, knew he would have to argue for more cash. The commissioners reluctantly agreed, made the announcement and waited for the political fallout. It was negative, with a capital N.</p> <p>One man is being held responsible. Charlie Falconer, the friend of the Prime Minister who is the Minister with responsibility for the Dome. If Peter Mandelson, his predecessor, had not been sacked after the home-loan row in December 1998, Falconer would still be largely unknown to the public.</p> <p>Falconer is a man under pressure. Revelations in today's Observer cast light on the tension at the very top of the management of the Dome. The New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the Dome, says Falconer knew the Dome was facing financial problems as early as last November but put off agreeing cash handouts for fear of a political backlash.</p> <p>'In November last year everybody on the NMEC board was alerted that it would need additional funding,' said a senior source close to NMEC. 'Advanced ticket sales were just not happening. The Millennium Commission recognised the need. NMEC just had to ask for it, but Falconer was saying, \"No, I don't want this done.\"</p> <p>'No allocation was made, so by January you've got a mounting cash-flow crisis. He just kept postponing demands for more cash for political reasons so they wouldn't coincide with his appearances in the House of Lords. And Jennie Page [then the Dome's chief executive] is worrying about cash flow rather than running the Dome.'</p> <p>Falconer told The Observer: 'There were certainly discussions in November about advance ticket sales but I don't recall any suggestion at that stage that that was anything other than a time problem which might affect cash flow.'</p> <p>He said he was not aware of being told that NMEC would need more money as early as last November. '[The request] wouldn't be made to me,' he said. 'It is for NMEC to approach the commission. I wasn't at all NMEC board meetings. 'Sources close to the commission say that by January there was friction between Page and Falconer over money. Eventually an emergency application for funds was made in February.

'We started with 12m, that quickly came down to 10, then seven. Now it's 4.5m.'</p> <p>The question is, will Falconer survive? Most government sources say yes, despite demands for his head. One official said Falconer's survival was underpinned by two facts. First, the seeds of this problem - poor financial planning in the late 1990s and ridiculously high visitor estimates - go back far further than the time he arrived.</p> <p>But it is the second reason that is more important. If Falconer goes, it will undermine the two original government flagwavers for the Dome - Blair and Mandelson.</p> <p>Both have remained silent, hoping to duck the shrapnel flying around Falconer's head. But the Prime Minister has made a number of private phone calls to his friend to assure him of his support.</p> <p>Blair and Mandelson know their reputations are partially tied up with the fortunes of the Dome. Indeed, the whole New Labour project is linked in many people's minds with the millennium celebration.</p> <p>Soon after the general election Blair asked his then Minister without Portfolio if he backed the Dome. Blair was in two minds and knew Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, his deputy, Alistair Darling, and Smith were sceptical. Mandelson said yes, the Dome should go ahead. John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, also backed the scheme and Blair decided he would stake his personal reputation on it. His present silence speaks volumes.</p> <p>She was worn out by an emotional round of interviews confirming the end of her political career and, no doubt, hardly looking forward to what lay ahead of her.</p> <p>But Mo Mowlam at least managed to raise a grin when, as she hurried into the Millennium Commission's gleaming high-rise headquarters in central London last week, someone joked that she now had something in common with Michael Heseltine: they had both announced their resignation on the radio.</p> <p>It is not the only doubtful distinction the Tarzan of the Tory jungle and Labour's favourite pin-up share. This week they both sanctioned the extra lottery money for the Dome, barely a month after the last loan, the one meant to see it through until New Year's Eve. And that was no joking matter.</p> <p>The mood of the seven commissioners in the meeting room on the 26th floor last Tuesday was 'appalled and angry', said one insider, although hardly surprised: after all, the board had known for two weeks that the Dome was technically insolvent.</p> <p>But the commissioners' real dismay was not just that they were being held to ransom once more, but that this time they were trapped. The lifeboat they had quietly been testing, in case they had to abandon ship, was holed below the waterline.</p> <p>As a condition of their handout in July, the commissioners had demanded that the cost of closure be calculated by independent analysts.

James, called in to save the Dome, has assured all involved that there will be no more cap-in-hand approaches to the commission. But nobody who knows the state of the Dome's finances is ruling out another loan. 'He is very confident with all this experience that this is sufficient to see them through,' said one insider. 'But no one would ever say never.'",

      "body": "<p>Who says that Tony Blair has a care for nothing but popularity? The curtain falls on Mo Mowlam, the one member of his Cabinet whom it does not sound ridiculous to describe as loved. Compare and contrast with Charlie Falconer, ringmaster of the damned Dome, who hangs on to his job. The world knows what to make of these double-jointed scandals. The sainted Mo, National Treasure, has been hounded into premature retirement by the misogynist West Side Boys around Tony Blair. The right Charlie, National Disgrace, clings to his unelected office only because he is one of the Prime Minister's chums.</p> <p>The truth is more complicated, and more interesting. I don't believe that Tony Blair was corrupted with envy by the public adoration for 'our one-and-only Mo', still less is he stupid enough to have wanted to martyr her. He has actually shown himself to be pretty indulgent of Mo - or perhaps that should be scared - by allowing her to remain in the Cabinet after she has served her notice to quit. The same cannot be said of all of his retinue. Courtiers will ever be wary of any Cabinet Minister who threatens to overshadow the Sun King. There certainly was sustained whispering that she was a loose cannon on the ship of state, who would have to be thrown overboard if she could not be lashed down, and it was not just confined to Number 10. A senior member of the Cabinet - and no, this is not Peter Mandelson speaking - told me some months ago, with a brutality that rather took my breath away: 'She's ill, of course.'</p> <p>The traffic was not all one-way. Understandably aggrieved that her massive contribution in Northern Ireland was not given all the credit it deserved, Mo and some of her friends did not help by fuelling chatter about a campaign to get her. At the beginning of the year, she told myself and a fellow journalist that her security arrangements were being reviewed, and suggested that she would be happy to live without the inconvenience of being manacled to bodyguards. After a discussion with my colleague, we decided not to write this up. Neither of us thought it a good idea to increase the risk of making her a target for a terrorist. A couple of weeks later, the withdrawal of her Special Branch protection was splashed up in another paper, with the interpretation that this was a deliberate humiliation of Mo by Number 10.</p> <p>So you can see why she has been the cause of flinching at Downing Street as you can also understand why her provocative unpredictability was as unpopular with some Cabinet colleagues as it was adored by the public. When she took part in a TV comedy show's dog wedding or told clitoris jokes or admitted she had inhaled or (horror!) talked about moving the Royals into modernised digs, her more buttock-clenched colleagues shuddered with distaste.

      "bodyText": "Who says that Tony Blair has a care for nothing but popularity? The curtain falls on Mo Mowlam, the one member of his Cabinet whom it does not sound ridiculous to describe as loved. Compare and contrast with Charlie Falconer, ringmaster of the damned Dome, who hangs on to his job. The world knows what to make of these double-jointed scandals. The sainted Mo, National Treasure, has been hounded into premature retirement by the misogynist West Side Boys around Tony Blair. The right Charlie, National Disgrace, clings to his unelected office only because he is one of the Prime Minister's chums. The truth is more complicated, and more interesting. I don't believe that Tony Blair was corrupted with envy by the public adoration for 'our one-and-only Mo', still less is he stupid enough to have wanted to martyr her. He has actually shown himself to be pretty indulgent of Mo - or perhaps that should be scared - by allowing her to remain in the Cabinet after she has served her notice to quit. The same cannot be said of all of his retinue. Courtiers will ever be wary of any Cabinet Minister who threatens to overshadow the Sun King. There certainly was sustained whispering that she was a loose cannon on the ship of state, who would have to be thrown overboard if she could not be lashed down, and it was not just confined to Number 10. A senior member of the Cabinet - and no, this is not Peter Mandelson speaking - told me some months ago, with a brutality that rather took my breath away: 'She's ill, of course.' The traffic was not all one-way. Understandably aggrieved that her massive contribution in Northern Ireland was not given all the credit it deserved, Mo and some of her friends did not help by fuelling chatter about a campaign to get her. At the beginning of the year, she told myself and a fellow journalist that her security arrangements were being reviewed, and suggested that she would be happy to live without the inconvenience of being manacled to bodyguards. After a discussion with my colleague, we decided not to write this up. Neither of us thought it a good idea to increase the risk of making her a target for a terrorist. A couple of weeks later, the withdrawal of her Special Branch protection was splashed up in another paper, with the interpretation that this was a deliberate humiliation of Mo by Number 10. So you can see why she has been the cause of flinching at Downing Street as you can also understand why her provocative unpredictability was as unpopular with some Cabinet colleagues as it was adored by the public. When she took part in a TV comedy show's dog wedding or told clitoris jokes or admitted she had inhaled or (horror!) talked about moving the Royals into modernised digs, her more buttock-clenched colleagues shuddered with distaste. The unbiddability which irritated the suits and spinmeisters was, of course, the other side of the coin of her public appeal. Blair wanted to exploit it. His mismanagement was not to find a way of harnessing her talents for the good of the Government. As I reveal in today's Review section, when he made it clear he wanted her to leave Belfast, she asked for the Foreign Office and, when he refused her that, she sought to be Defence Secretary as a step towards that goal.

Half-a-dozen nations have been disgraced before the Sydney Olympics have even begun. Yet the soul of sport - the human race's second greatest source of pleasure - can still be saved from the clutches of the drug cheats. The world must, at last, treat doping as an urgent priority, not an irritating burden. Sydney-style blood tests should be the norm in every sport. One strike and a star, any star, should be out - forever. A new, independent global body should be set up to conduct tests 'anytime, anyplace', paid for by a drugs levy on the earnings of sportspeople and governing bodies. Countries defying a new code should be banned from international competition. Britain, not just China, could suffer. It may sound extreme, but the restoration of sport's original purpose demands such action. The alternative is every sport becoming the pharmacological pantomime that is American wrestling.",

It is less than a month since the controversial acquisition of Baan, the Dutch software-systems company, was finally clinched. Nowhere in the endless briefings and presentations about that deal was there the slightest hint that the rest of the business might be doing less well than expected. </p> <p>Indeed, the company says that chief executive Allen Yurko had his first indication things were going wrong at the start of August. He went on holiday for two weeks, came back and found his worst fears realised. Apart from the obvious issue of how he could enjoy a holiday when his company was heading for the rocks, it also raises the question of why Yurko did not spot trouble earlier. </p> <p>It may be that management's attention was distracted by the protracted fight to win control of Baan. That is a poor excuse. There is no point making any acquisition, and especially not one that carries the risks Baan does, if it jeopardises strategy elsewhere. </p> <p>The City has clearly decided that the problem is more serious.

But even the biggest fans of the acquisition accept that it will take longer than that to prove a success. </p> <p>Six weeks ago, Throg Street suggested that Yurko's record meant he could be trusted to make a success of Baan.

No sooner has Barclays forked out \u00a35.5 billion for Woolwich, largely on the strength of its Open financial services product, than Abbey National shells out \u00a31.8bn for Scottish Provident, principally to get its hands on the life company's Self Assurance product. </p> <p>You may think that Self Assurance is something your mother should have taught you but, apparently, it is the coming thing in financial services, offering all those essentials such as health cover, term assurance and accident insurance. There is, of course, no shortage of people trying to flog us these things, but Scottish Provident's unique selling point is that it does it all through one computer system. The result is a million different combinations of product that can be tailored to the customer's - or at least their adviser's - needs, yet is difficult for any rival, Abbey included, to replicate. </p> <p>Scottish Provident has 30 per cent of the market, giving it \u00a340 million in annual premiums. That, as Graham Pottinger, chief executive of Abbey's existing life assurance arm, Scottish Mutual Assurance, says, may be a lot in relation to total annual premium income. But in relation to the \u00a31.8bn consideration, it is tiny. </p> <p>Abbey's justification for the price is, first, that it is getting some other interesting business - such as an international business - too. Second, and more important, pushing Self Assurance through its much larger customer base should dramatically accelerate sales. </p> <p>It has made a decent job of doing that for products of Scottish Mutual, which it bought in 1992. New business has jumped from about \u00a3120m a year to \u00a33.5bn, while the number employed has risen threefold to 2,000. </p> <p>If it can achieve similar growth from Scottish Provident, the deal will be a resounding success. </p> <p>But the market is much more competitive, and Abbey already has a life insurance brand, so will be flogging two life products instead of just one to its long-suffering customers. This makes it far more difficult for it to earn a decent return from the deal. </p> <p>It may well do so, but the City will need evidence - and that will not emerge until 2002 at the earliest. Abbey's shares are cheap, but this acquisition is unlikely to change that. </p> <p><strong> Strange brew</strong><br> </p> <p>Why has Sir Ian Prosser chosen to split his role at the head of Bass now?

Pop did not burn through quite as much money (most supplied by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen) as Boo, but it suffered the indignity of never actually launching at all. </p> <p>The idea behind the company - to broadcast a mix of animated and live-action short films on the internet - was greeted with much excitement last October, before the dot.com shake-out took hold. Founders Howard, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg trumpeted their new venture as one of the firms that would revolutionise the way films were made and distributed. As soon as the technology allowed, they believed, Pop.com would transform from showcase for talented young film makers into fully fledged production and distribution company. </p> <p>Announcing the new company, Katzenberg said: 'Just as MTV introduced a new entertainment forum for music videos, we think this new enterprise will offer a new form of entertainment for the rapidly growing population of internet users. Pop.com has the capability not only to offer a variety of entertainment options, but to tap into an as yet undiscovered talent pool that is as global as the internet itself.' </p> <p>Pop was supposed to act as a platform for experienced movie makers to experiment with the emerging medium and, when it was launched last autumn, its founders spoke of using the web as a seed bed for new projects for film and television. However, despite agreements with Mike Myers, Will Smith, Julia Roberts, Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin and others to create programming, nothing ever appeared on Pop.com besides press releases. Instead, it became a place for DreamWorks to store its talent when the studio had nothing else for staff to work on. </p> <p>Then, on 1 August, the Los Angeles Times ran a story questioning the site's finances, the commitment of its backers and its prospects for success. Rumours circulated that Allen had grown tired of funding it: the daily frustrations stemmed 'from too many egos in the kitchen', according to one employee. </p> <p>Insiders pointed to Pop CEO Ken Wong's lack of experience either as a manager or in the internet world: 'We needed someone with film or dotcom experience, not someone with neither.' Before Pop, Wong was in semi-retirement, and before that he was president of Disney's Imagineering division. Moreover, observers said that of all online entertainment sites, Pop was the most bureaucratic and disorganised. </p> <p>'It was put together in the days when people thought if you put enough big names and big money together, things will work themselves out,' says Sanjay Malhorta of BandWidth Capital. 'As the market caught up with the expectations of business plans and good management, those weaknesses became glaringly evident.' </p> <p>None of Pop's high-profile principals were present at last week's meeting to all but shut the company. When asked why neither Katzenberg, Spielberg nor Howard had attended, Wong had no real answer: 'We believe this space is not yet a business. We're not clairvoyants or geniuses, but we think it's going to take years.' </p> <p>Pop's first major acquisition, last autumn, was an acclaimed short film called The Dancing Cow. It sat on the shelves waiting for the site's launch. Excerpts from DreamWorks' Chicken Run were also scheduled to be released but never materialised. 'It's sad that all these filmmakers got tied up for so long with nothing to show for it,' said Randy Greenberg, vice president of independent film company Always. </p> <p>But the closure of the firm is more than just the failure of yet another web company without a viable business model. It has shown how hard it is for even the biggest names in entertainment to make sense of the web at a time when the medium itself is rocking the industry's foundations. Not only is the music business fighting for what may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory against copyright troublemakers such as Napster and Gnutella; there are also signs that mass piracy is about to afflict the movie industry as well. </p> <p>Since the demise of the Digital Entertainment Network last spring, problems with the internet have scared away investors. The decision to fold Pop was related to failed merger talks with iFilm, which were terminated 10 days ago. Sources say iFilm had balked at Pop's valuation, which is said to have been $200 million. </p> <p>Others have suffered, too. 'Digital entertainment universe' Scour.com has laid off 56 of 62 employees, saying it ran out of money. A dozen employees were laid off at Shockwave.com, the entertainment site from Flash technology maker Macromedia in San Francisco. That site carries between 700 and 1,000 pieces of content and relies on banner advertising for income. Shockwave is believed to have made expensive deals with the likes of South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker and director David Lynch, but the shows have failed to materialise. The company's planned IPO for late this year now looks doubtful. </p> <p>Efforts by Microsoft and America Online, among others, to translate TV-style shows to the internet foundered a couple of years ago. Neither have multi-media websites devoted to women fared well. The much trumpeted Oxygen site has experienced an exodus of key editors and staff; and shares in iVillage have plummeted from $95.88 to around $7. Several executives have left during this year, and in late July Candace Carpenter stepped down as CEO. </p> <p>Despite all this gloom, webcasters are planning to roll out dozens of new online entertainment programs as the new television season starts this autumn. </p> <p>The subject matter, aimed largely at university students with access to high-speed campus internet connections, pushes the limits of taste. The offerings still have to overcome technical limitations and the fact that the audience for online entertainment is still tiny. Romp.com is launching a new game called 'Avoid Commitment', where players have to hurl a martini at a temptress and then seduce her; another, called 'Panty Raid,' involves retrieving underwear from a girl's dormitory. </p> <p>'This is like the 1940s in television,' David Wertheimer, chairman of WireBreak Networks, a firm that creates and syndicates web programmes for other sites, told the Wall Street Journal . 'There's no standard for what works and doesn't work.' </p> <p>And viewers are growing. Despite its problems, Shockwave.com drew 5.7 million users in July, up from 207,000 a year ago, while AtomFilms had 749,000, up from 247,000 a year ago. </p> <p>But the technical limitations of broadcasting over the web remain the biggest problem for most users. 'People don't think of the internet yet as entertaining them the way television or a movie does,' says Kristen Harmeling of Yankelovich Partners, a US marketing research firm. </p> <p>Whatever the future of internet broadcasting, Pop.com is unlikely to play a part.

Richard Madeley impersonates Ali G on This Morning 2. Dexy's Midnight Runners play Jackie Wilson Said on Top of The Pops in front of a photograph of darts player Jocky Wilson 3. Streaker Mark Roberts surprises This Morning 's weatherman 4. L!ve TV - News Bunny, topless darts and bouncing dwarves 5. Welsh Secretary John Redwood fluffs the Welsh national anthem. 6. Arthur Mullard and Hylda Baker perform a Grease hit on TOTP 7. Shakin' Stevens attacks Madeley for comparing him to Elvis 8. Late-night 'yoof' show The Word and its disgusting 'Hopefuls' 9. Yippies take over The Frost Report 10. The Brits presented by Mick Fleetwood and Samantha Fox",

Though they looked less than threatening, during the night police had been forced to intervene after a tanker's windscreen was smashed in scuffles and one protestor was arrested. Earlier in the week a tanker driver was arrested when he mounted the pavement in an attempt to drive round demonstrators.</p> <p>Shell admitted yesterday that 20 to 30 stations in the North-west were running out of petrol and that, unless supplies were brought in from elsewhere, the number would rise. Five BP stations, also supplied by the Stanlow refinery, had run out too. A BP spokeswoman said that their staff had been reporting panic-buying of petrol in Liverpool. 'We have made contingency plans to obtain fuel from other depots. But if the blockade continues, it is inevitable [that] will have an effect,' she said.</p> <p>And yesterday evening it looked as if the 'battle of the refineries' would intensify, raising the possibility of more widespread fuel shortages this week.

'For as long as it takes.'</p> <p>If the protestors succeed in halting distribution from the 15 main refineries in the UK that supply 80 per cent of our petrol and diesel fuel, then stations everywhere could start running out of fuel. There are signs already that the crisis is deepening. In west Wales yesterday, lorry drivers blocked the main entrance to the Texaco refinery in Milford Haven and sent trucks to cut off a nearby Elf Aquitaine installation. Two important depots at Bristol's Avonmouth docks - one used by Texaco and Total Fina, the other by Esso - were also picketed.</p> <p>Supermarket fuel outlets have also been hit. Sainsbury's said that three outlets in Scotland had been forced to shut and that 15 of its stations in the rest of the country were 'running out'of fuel. Asda warned that its petrol stations in Bristol would be affected within days if protests continue.</p> <p>Truckers say that high fuel prices are forcing them out of business. The cost of British petrol jumped more than 40 per cent from January 1999 to June 2000 and is currently the highest in Europe. Tax and duties make up about 75 per cent of the price of a litre of premium unleaded petrol, currently about 85p, but recent crude oil price rises have put even more pressure on drivers.</p> <p>Filling up their car costs the average family more than \u00a31,000 a year, experts calculate, but fuel taxes put more than \u00a323billion a year into government coffers. The price rise, if sustained, will add at least two billion to the total. Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has frequently ruled out fuel tax cuts, saying the money is needed for health and education.</p> <p>The forecourt cost rise is largely due to a surge in crude, unrefined oil prices over the last 18 months. A barrel of crude now costs more than $33, a ten-year high. Oil companies have fed this rise through to their customers. Prices have also been driven up by speculation that restricted supply combined with the booming world economy's growing demand for oil-based products would trigger a severe shortage. Some analysts have predicted a peak of $50 per barrel.</p> <p>There is still plenty of feverish buying by oil traders, in the same spirit as the people of Merseyside this weekend, driving up the cost of fuel. The widespread protests in France, and now Britain, are also helping to keep the price high.</p> <p>Opec (the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) is meeting later today in Vienna.</p> <p>It has been under heavy pressure from President Clinton and other Western leaders to increase in oil production to ease the market squeeze and get prices down to around $28 a barrel. European finance ministers met in Versailles yesterday to plan their strategy. However, any production increase will take at least several weeks to feed through to the market.</p> <p>Yesterday, French road hauliers and farmers reluctantly began lifting their own blockade of oil refineries and fuel depots. Their six-day fuel price protest had brought much of France to a standstill, with some four-fifths of the country's petrol stations empty, regional airports closed and school buses and postal deliveries suspended. Thousands of British holidaymakers were also stranded as they tried to return to the UK after summer breaks.</p> <p>'Carrying on would have risked turning the whole thing sour,' said Christian Rose, national secretary of the French hauliers' federation. 'We cannot ignore what the government has offered ... This was a dignified protest and it was important to show that the road haulage companies did not do it for nothing.'</p> <p>The French Interior Ministry said that some 95 blockades of refineries and depots were still in place yesterday, 65 fewer than at the end of last week. A further 50 barricades and go-slow operations were still severely disrupting traffic around the country, but a ministry spokesman said 'a clear retreat' had begun. It is now unlikely that troops and police will be sent in to forcibly clear blockades as previously feared.</p> <p>French agricultural unions have also urged their members - albeit 'with a heavy heart' in the case of one - to end their part in the demonstrations. Their retreat is good news to the Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin and his British counterpart.</p> <p>Whether an improvement in the situation will come as a relief to Anders and his colleagues remains to be seen. 'All the cashiers just want to go to the pub,' he said.</p> <p>Additional reporting by Nick Paton Walsh and Jon Henley in Paris</p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.unostra.com\" target=\"_new\">French haulier's association</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.eurotunnel.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Eurotunnel</a></p>",

The forecourt cost rise is largely due to a surge in crude, unrefined oil prices over the last 18 months. A barrel of crude now costs more than $33, a ten-year high. Oil companies have fed this rise through to their customers. Prices have also been driven up by speculation that restricted supply combined with the booming world economy's growing demand for oil-based products would trigger a severe shortage. Some analysts have predicted a peak of $50 per barrel. There is still plenty of feverish buying by oil traders, in the same spirit as the people of Merseyside this weekend, driving up the cost of fuel. The widespread protests in France, and now Britain, are also helping to keep the price high. Opec (the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) is meeting later today in Vienna. It has been under heavy pressure from President Clinton and other Western leaders to increase in oil production to ease the market squeeze and get prices down to around $28 a barrel. European finance ministers met in Versailles yesterday to plan their strategy. However, any production increase will take at least several weeks to feed through to the market. Yesterday, French road hauliers and farmers reluctantly began lifting their own blockade of oil refineries and fuel depots. Their six-day fuel price protest had brought much of France to a standstill, with some four-fifths of the country's petrol stations empty, regional airports closed and school buses and postal deliveries suspended. Thousands of British holidaymakers were also stranded as they tried to return to the UK after summer breaks. 'Carrying on would have risked turning the whole thing sour,' said Christian Rose, national secretary of the French hauliers' federation. 'We cannot ignore what the government has offered ... This was a dignified protest and it was important to show that the road haulage companies did not do it for nothing.' The French Interior Ministry said that some 95 blockades of refineries and depots were still in place yesterday, 65 fewer than at the end of last week. A further 50 barricades and go-slow operations were still severely disrupting traffic around the country, but a ministry spokesman said 'a clear retreat' had begun. It is now unlikely that troops and police will be sent in to forcibly clear blockades as previously feared. French agricultural unions have also urged their members - albeit 'with a heavy heart' in the case of one - to end their part in the demonstrations. Their retreat is good news to the Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin and his British counterpart. Whether an improvement in the situation will come as a relief to Anders and his colleagues remains to be seen. 'All the cashiers just want to go to the pub,' he said.

Over the past 18 months Chavez has rekindled Opec unity, reinvigorating the cartel as a force on the world stage. The fruits of his labour are apparent in a quadrupling of the oil price since his arrival in power in 1998. Last month Chavez toured all 10 of Venezuela's fellow Opec members.

The West is hoping for an increase of at least 700,000 barrels a day. Any thing less is likely to see the oil price shoot up, and stock markets dive. But Chavez's real moment will come at the end of the month when he hosts the first Opec heads of state meeting for 25 years in Caracas. It is a remarkable coup considering Venezuela is a relatively minor producer of oil and pre-Chavez was barely engaged in Opec's affairs. When he came to office, the price of a barrel was in the region of $8 and Venezuela was heading for a devastating recession. Around 70 per cent of exports and 60 per cent of tax income is generated by oil, and the price is now $33. But before Chavez's presidency, Venezuela had consistently sabotaged Opec's attempts to raise prices, by deliberately producing more than its official quota. Chavez was determined to change that. He joined forces with the world's biggest producer - Saudi Arabia - and non-Opec Mexico in agreeing production cuts that helped turn the tide. Arguing for a 'multi polar' world, and against the scourge of 'savage neoliberalism', Chavez is not the first Venezuelan leader to seek to parlay oil wealth into influence on the world stage. At last week's UN world leader's summit he offered to supply oil 'on favourable terms' to cash-strapped Central American nations. Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez first came to the world's attention in February of 1992, when he tried - and failed - to overthrow the elected government of Venezuela in a military coup. Arrested and brought before the TV cameras, Chavez turned defeat into a kind of victory with the briefest political speech of his life. 'Chavez's appearance on television lasted for just over a minute,' notes Richard Gott, author of a recent book on the Venezuelan president. 'Its unexpected result was to turn him from a wholly unknown colonel into a national figure.' A tough-talking, leftist populist, Chavez comes from humble origins in the rural hinterland. He looks and talks like ordinary Venezuelans. He brought the military back into politics, lambasted the media, the church hierarchy and the 'oligarchs'. And he tackled the issue of the low oil price. He considers any return to such low prices as 'passing a death sentence' on Opec countries. But even as Chavez was addressing the UN summit, a local newspaper headline summed up the challenge: 'Oil rises to $35 a barrel,' it read, 'and poverty reaches 81 per cent.'

If you haven't got enemies your life may not be complete.</p> <p>According to a new book by the celebrated psychologist Dorothy Rowe, we don't just need friends, we also need enemies. She counted 24 different benefits brought by having enemies, including making you feel more important, making you feel more virtuous, and simply making life more exciting.</p> <p>'Having an enemy could be an advantage,' she concluded after research for Friends and Enemies which took her to Bosnia, Northern Ireland, South Africa and Lebanon. It's only in the long term that the drawbacks become clear.</p> <p>The national hysteria over Big Brother's Nasty Nick shows not just how much we all love to have a hate-figure, but how effective it can be in bringing a country closer together. 'If a group has an enemy, that enemy brings the group together - we saw that in this country in World War II' said Rowe. 'You see it in business organisations - if the boss is seen as an enemy, the workers get very close.'</p> <p>'First, get a common enemy' could be the opening of any leader's rulebook. 'Rulers have always invented an enemy to keep people together. Rulers who want to stay in power always have a war,' said Rowe (think of General Galtieri's decision to invade the Falklands) and it even applies to democracies (think of Thatcher's electoral triumph after defending the Falklands).</p> <p>It even explains much of geo-politics. 'The US is a very diverse group of people, and the way the government held the country together was by having an enemy. But when the Berlin wall came down, the US no longer had an enemy,' explained Rowe. 'So President Bush immediately announced a war on drugs.' The Colombian drug barons, such as Pablo Escobar, have done their bit to keep the US united. Hatred towards Islamic fundamentalists - and public enemy number one Osama Bin Laden - also keeps Americans appreciative of their president.</p> <p>Having enemies can also help combat boredom. Rowe was puzzled by one family where all the members were constantly at war with each other until she realised they actually enjoyed it. 'It made their otherwise dull lives more exciting,' she said.</p> <p>Enemies also have the advantage of being more exciting than friends. 'The enemy is always doing something, or you can always imagine them doing something.' Enemies can also make people feel that they matter. Rowe worked in a psychiatric hospital, where old people knew no one was thinking of them, and found that frightening. They would get enemies, so at least they knew someone was thinking of them. 'Imagine being so insignificant that no one could be bothered to hate you.'</p> <p>Having a hate-figure can also make us feel better about ourselves. People give their enemies all the characteristics that they have trouble with themselves - whether it's being sadistic, aggressive or manipulative. For example, if you're feeling guilty about having some malicious thoughts, it's comforting to believe Saddam Hussein is the embodiment of pure evil and that we are less cunning than Peter Mandelson.</p> <p>A good enemy can also help people cope with their failings in life, by simply taking the blame for everything. At work, people often blame the boss.</p> <p>'You don't have to take responsibility, and it means you can avoid the really complex questions.' This can also dominate a political culture, such as Hitler blaming the Jews for much of Weimar Germany's problems, or unemployed people blaming immigrants. But Rowe thinks that some of the hatred that many people feel for migrants may be even more primitive. 'When our species first appeared on the planet, there were very few of us and we lived in little bands, and the concept of stranger was the same as the concept of enemy,' she said 'Echoes of that are still with us.'</p> <p>Ultimately, like almost everything in psychology, it seems, it all goes back to childhood. 'The need for enemies is very directly linked to the amount of punishment you had as a child. Most chil dren are hit, or they're made to stay in their room, or spoken to in horrible ways. You need enemies to put your hatred onto,' said Rowe.</p> <p>Enemies allow adults to simply act out the frustrations of childhood. 'If, as a child, we had a bad relationship with our father, you project your idea of father onto any authority figures, and behave towards them as you would have towards your father, but wouldn't dare.'</p> <p>But before we all rush out to get an enemy, or upset a few people to acquire a few more, Rowe warns that all the advantages are simply short term. 'If you devote a lot of your energy to hating some one, you don't have the energy to enlarge your life.' When you scapegoat and blame others, you fail to get to grips with the real causes of your problems.</p> <p>Rowe now sees getting rid of the need for enemies as essential for the future of humanity: 'Having enemies is now a luxury our species can no longer afford. It's led to the degradation of the planet, with industries competing to death. We need to learn to live without enemies to ensure the survival of the planet.'</p> <p>Friends and Enemies is published tomorrow by HarperCollins, price \u00a319.99</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a>.</p>",

'You see it in business organisations - if the boss is seen as an enemy, the workers get very close.' 'First, get a common enemy' could be the opening of any leader's rulebook. 'Rulers have always invented an enemy to keep people together. Rulers who want to stay in power always have a war,' said Rowe (think of General Galtieri's decision to invade the Falklands) and it even applies to democracies (think of Thatcher's electoral triumph after defending the Falklands). It even explains much of geo-politics. 'The US is a very diverse group of people, and the way the government held the country together was by having an enemy. But when the Berlin wall came down, the US no longer had an enemy,' explained Rowe. 'So President Bush immediately announced a war on drugs.' The Colombian drug barons, such as Pablo Escobar, have done their bit to keep the US united. Hatred towards Islamic fundamentalists - and public enemy number one Osama Bin Laden - also keeps Americans appreciative of their president. Having enemies can also help combat boredom. Rowe was puzzled by one family where all the members were constantly at war with each other until she realised they actually enjoyed it. 'It made their otherwise dull lives more exciting,' she said. Enemies also have the advantage of being more exciting than friends. 'The enemy is always doing something, or you can always imagine them doing something.' Enemies can also make people feel that they matter. Rowe worked in a psychiatric hospital, where old people knew no one was thinking of them, and found that frightening. They would get enemies, so at least they knew someone was thinking of them. 'Imagine being so insignificant that no one could be bothered to hate you.' Having a hate-figure can also make us feel better about ourselves. People give their enemies all the characteristics that they have trouble with themselves - whether it's being sadistic, aggressive or manipulative. For example, if you're feeling guilty about having some malicious thoughts, it's comforting to believe Saddam Hussein is the embodiment of pure evil and that we are less cunning than Peter Mandelson. A good enemy can also help people cope with their failings in life, by simply taking the blame for everything. At work, people often blame the boss. 'You don't have to take responsibility, and it means you can avoid the really complex questions.' This can also dominate a political culture, such as Hitler blaming the Jews for much of Weimar Germany's problems, or unemployed people blaming immigrants. But Rowe thinks that some of the hatred that many people feel for migrants may be even more primitive. 'When our species first appeared on the planet, there were very few of us and we lived in little bands, and the concept of stranger was the same as the concept of enemy,' she said 'Echoes of that are still with us.' Ultimately, like almost everything in psychology, it seems, it all goes back to childhood. 'The need for enemies is very directly linked to the amount of punishment you had as a child. Most chil dren are hit, or they're made to stay in their room, or spoken to in horrible ways. You need enemies to put your hatred onto,' said Rowe. Enemies allow adults to simply act out the frustrations of childhood. 'If, as a child, we had a bad relationship with our father, you project your idea of father onto any authority figures, and behave towards them as you would have towards your father, but wouldn't dare.' But before we all rush out to get an enemy, or upset a few people to acquire a few more, Rowe warns that all the advantages are simply short term. 'If you devote a lot of your energy to hating some one, you don't have the energy to enlarge your life.' When you scapegoat and blame others, you fail to get to grips with the real causes of your problems. Rowe now sees getting rid of the need for enemies as essential for the future of humanity: 'Having enemies is now a luxury our species can no longer afford. It's led to the degradation of the planet, with industries competing to death. We need to learn to live without enemies to ensure the survival of the planet.'

Two new units are being built and more should follow. The problem is particularly acute for mothers from the South and West - the nearest unit for mothers from Cornwall is in Cheshire. Lawyers have suggested that the current practice of splitting jailed mothers from their babies could be challenged from October when the Human Rights Act, which guarantees a right to family life, comes into force. Earlier this month Martin Narey, director-general of the Prison Service, stunned reformers by announcing that he was considering increasing the total amount of time children could spend with their mothers to four years. As the majority of mothers in jail are the primary carers of their children, they often emerge homeless, poor and unable to maintain family life.

      "bodyText": "Britain has been hit by a huge rise in the number of very young children and adolescents seeking treatment from psychiatrists for serious mental health problems, new research has revealed. Of particular concern is a surge in the number of very young children with suspected mental health problems being referred to psychiatrists. They include hundreds less than two years old. One psychiatrist told The Observer that his clinic was now seeing more than four times as many under-fives than in 1997. Another spoke of six-year-olds who attempted to harm themselves, seven-year-olds with compulsive behaviour problems, and nine-year-olds with suicidal tendencies. Many psychiatrists have had dozens of toddlers aged one, two and three referred to them for treatment. The figures, compiled by Young Minds, a leading children's mental health charity, show that in some instances psychiatrists' adolescent caseloads have nearly doubled in the past year alone. The increase has accelerated over the past three years. Young people are coming to psychiatrists with a huge range of serious mental health problems. They include schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, attention deficit disorder (ADD) and dozens of other behavioural problems. Many are caused by drug or alcohol abuse. The research raises fears that Britain's stretched mental health care services will not be able to cope with the huge new demands placed upon them. 'We are reaping the legacy of decades of underfunding of provision for mental healthcare,' said Peter Wilson, director of Young Minds. 'It is a very serious situation and we need radical action quickly.' Child and adolescent psychiatrists say they feel 'inundated' and 'overwhelmed'. Dr Kedar Dwivedi, working in Northampton, said that when he started his career 20 years ago he had 200 referrals annually. Now the total was around 1,200. He said that in 1997 only 13 children aged five or less had been referred to him. Since then the total had gone up 10 times . In the past year, he has seen more than 130 under-fives, including 27 aged three, six two-year-olds and four one-year-olds. Another psychiatrist in the South-west said that the number of children visiting clinic had gone up by nearly three times in the past five years. Dr Jonathan Dare, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and director of south London's Maudsley NHS Trust, said he treated four-, five- or six-year-olds who often showed signs of severe emotional deprivation. Dare said his clinic had treated a nine-year-old boy last year who had threatened to throw himself from a window on several occasions and a six-year-old who had stuck a needle into himself. Obsessive disorders were commonly seen in seven- or eight-year-olds, Dare said. One nine-year-old changed clothes as often as seven times a day for fear of being dirty. All the 80 people questioned in the survey, including consultant psychiatrists, paediatricians and social services directors, reported significant increases in their caseloads during the past year. The sample included nearly a tenth of practising child and adolescent psychologists in England and Wales. Many point out that the crisis is likely to worsen if radical action is not taken. 'Child mental health problems have an impact on health later as mature adults and thus, as parents, on future generations,' said Dwivedi. The Young Minds report also highlights a significant lack of staff trained in working with children and adolescents and a lack of facilities to deal with the more serious cases. Far too often, the report says, young people are placed in adult or paediatric wards. The huge number of referrals, combined with staff shortages, has also led to long waiting lists, the Young Minds report discloses. Of 24 clinics examined by Young Minds, only 10 were able to meet the government target of three months. In addition, sometimes clinics took up to three weeks to respond to 'life-threatening emergencies' because of the weight of work. 'We should not underestimate the sheer intensity, emotional or otherwise, of dealing with these very complex and distressing cases,' Wilson said. 'The cumulative impact on people working in the field is very severe.' There is controversy over the exact size of the increase and the reasons for it. Some say that more awareness of children's problems has boosted the figures. There is also fierce debate over whether attention deficit disorder is as widespread as thought. Other factors - such as the closure of some social services facilities - are also thought to have contributed. A larger number of referrals of young people by health visitors would be one more reason for the increased figures for children. However, a government report last year said that around one in 10 young people suffer from a mental disorder, more than previously thought. Experts say that a number of initiatives could improve the current situation. Many depend on broad multi-agency approaches involving teachers, community workers and other professionals working together within the community. A Department of Health spokeswoman said that it recognised there was strong and increasing pressure on children and adolescent mental health services. She said that around \u00a330million was being invested this year in a range of projects designed to tackle the problem. Additional reporting: Nick Paton Walsh",

But Tony Blair and his German counterpart, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, yesterday agreed on one thing: that scrapping multi-million pound transfer fees for big-name footballers would be disastrous for the people's game.</p> <p>In a joint offensive against the European Commission's controversial plan to abolish transfer fees for players switching clubs, the British and German Prime Ministers warned that the scheme could severely damage the game.</p> <p>The two leaders acknowledged that the current system 'is not perfect', but added: 'We fear, however, that a radical reform could have a negative impact on the structures of football in Europe. We share concerns that many smaller professional clubs would struggle to survive.'</p> <p>The EC has declared that the existing transfer system, under which stars have switch clubs for as much as \u00a337 million, is illegal because it breaks European law on freedom of movement. It has given football until the end of October to come up with an alternative way of handling players' movements.</p> <p>Football has condemned the EC's move as disastrous. It warns that without the 'trickle-down' effect of transfer fees from selling players to big clubs, scores of lower division sides in Britain could disappear.</p> <p>The Professional Footballers Association has warned that 'clubs will become like Euston station', with players staying only for a few months, that players' wages will spiral as high as \u00a3250,000-a-week and that fans will find it harder to identify with their local team.</p> <p>'Professional football has a proud history in both our countries', said Blair and Schr\u00f6der in a joint statement released by Downing Street.

      "bodyText": "Their countries are sworn enemies on the football pitch, they both aspire to be 'the leader of Europe' and they argue about the benefits of the euro. But Tony Blair and his German counterpart, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, yesterday agreed on one thing: that scrapping multi-million pound transfer fees for big-name footballers would be disastrous for the people's game. In a joint offensive against the European Commission's controversial plan to abolish transfer fees for players switching clubs, the British and German Prime Ministers warned that the scheme could severely damage the game. The two leaders acknowledged that the current system 'is not perfect', but added: 'We fear, however, that a radical reform could have a negative impact on the structures of football in Europe. We share concerns that many smaller professional clubs would struggle to survive.' The EC has declared that the existing transfer system, under which stars have switch clubs for as much as \u00a337 million, is illegal because it breaks European law on freedom of movement. It has given football until the end of October to come up with an alternative way of handling players' movements. Football has condemned the EC's move as disastrous. It warns that without the 'trickle-down' effect of transfer fees from selling players to big clubs, scores of lower division sides in Britain could disappear. The Professional Footballers Association has warned that 'clubs will become like Euston station', with players staying only for a few months, that players' wages will spiral as high as \u00a3250,000-a-week and that fans will find it harder to identify with their local team. 'Professional football has a proud history in both our countries', said Blair and Schr\u00f6der in a joint statement released by Downing Street. 'All our clubs are deeply rooted in the life of their towns and cities and provide a rich source of civic pride. Football fans are enthusiastic about their sport and feel a close loyalty to their clubs. We want it to stay this way.' Blair and Schr\u00f6der backed football's concern that the plan could discourage clubs from investing in development, saying: 'The clubs must be able to rely on a system that gives them sufficient opportunity to train young players, build up their teams and keep the game healthy at all levels.' A spokesman for the Cental Council of Physical Recreation, which represents sports such as rugby, cricket and soccer, said: 'This complicated legal and political issue affects other sports, not just football.

The Football Association said the two leaders' support was 'hugely pleasing'.

      "body": "<p>The climbers were faced with a stark choice. Having risked their lives on some of the most challenging mountains in the world, where only their skill and courage had kept them going, the four-strong American group seized by kidnappers during an expedition in a remote part of former Soviet-controlled Asia contemplated the ultimate dilemma: kill their guard or face being killed themselves.</p> <p>In an epic real-life adventure story that has prompted a frenzied bidding war between Hollywood film studios and New York publishers, the real story of the mountaineers and the guard they pushed off a cliff to certain death is only now beginning to emerge.</p> <p>The expedition had begun well enough. When Jason 'Singer' Smith, 22, and his friends set off to climb in the Pamir mountains in Kyrgyzstan they thought they knew what they were getting into. The Karavashin region, 10,000ft up in the mountains, has become a Mecca for adventurous mountaineers and the four Americans planned to grab their own share of climbing glory by conquering a number of new climbs.</p> <p>The drama that engulfed the young team began while Smith and his three companions were bivouacking hundreds of feet up a vertical rock face. After days of climbing, they planned to spend their first night on a cramped platform they had carried up with them, an aluminium-framed 'portaledge' - a campsite hanging in the sky.</p> <p>Hanging from ropes far above the ground, they slotted together the alloy poles, discussed the next day's route up the unclimbed face and looked forward to a simple dinner and an unnerving night's rest above the black void. With Smith were John Dickey, at 25 the oldest member of the group, and two Californians, Tommy Caldwell, 22, and Beth Rodden, 20, at 5ft and six stone, a tiny but brilliant woman who had quickly become one of world's most famous female climbers.</p> <p>The expedition had been sold as a big deal in the lucrative world of US outdoor marketing. It had been backed by the leading outdoor designer label The North Face, and Dickey and Smith were there to photograph the two 'stars' of the climb, Caldwell and Rodden, as they inched up the face. Rodden was a recent recruit to The North Face. For all of them, a lot was riding on a successful climb.</p> <p>What happened next turned their adventure into a nightmare. As they rested on cramped ledges, they were startled by the sound of guns being fired in their direction from the valley below. They were sitting targets in the middle of a blank granite wall high above the ground, and any thought of ignoring the shooting and continuing to the summit disappeared when bullets started hitting the rock around them.</p> <p>Terrified, the team agreed that one of them should abseil down to negotiate with the gunmen, and it was Dickey who was elected to do the talking. According to friends who spoke to The Observer last week, he abseiled down to the foot of the cliff where he was immediately surrounded by three armed Uzbeks, members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is fighting for the creation of an independent Muslim state where the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan converge. The group regularly kidnaps westerners and has plunged the area into political chaos.</p> <p>Confronted by the gunmen, Dickey knew they were in deep trouble. Their base camp was in ruins and the Uzbeks, with barely any English, were in no mood to negotiate. The kidnappers had already destroyed most of their tents and spare equipment and Dickey quickly complied with the gunmen's hand-signalled orders, telling his friends over their radio to descend to the certainty of captivity and the possibility that they would die.</p> <p>According to friends, the gunmen ordered the four to gather what food they could and go with them. Grabbing a few energy bars, the climbers endured a six-day ordeal, being moved at night by two of the guerrillas and being forced to hide during the day under brush or rocks from the view of Kyrgyz army helicopters. If they did not understand the risks of non-compliance, it was made abundantly clear five hours into their captivity. To their horror, a Kyrgyz soldier whom the guerrillas had kidnapped earlier was taken away and shot.</p> <p>Smith was forced to sit on the body for 40 minutes before the group continued. Continuously hungry, forced to drink foul water from puddles and in constant fear for their lives, the four stumbled by night under the watchful gaze of their captors and froze during the day, unable to move in their shadowy hideouts. 'I thought about everything,' Caldwell said afterwards, 'I thought about the meaning of life, what these people were after.'</p> <p>On the sixth day, one of their guards returned to base to collect fresh batteries for the radios taken from the climbers. The hostages found themselves on top of a high granite cliff with one man watching over them. It was then that they hatched their escape plan.</p> <p>No one knows who acted first and the climbers are not saying - yet. But at a press conference in her hometown of Davis, California, Rodden gave the briefest outline of what happened: 'While moving at night and guarded by only one rebel, we at last saw a chance to escape by pushing our guard off the cliff. It is so hard to think of that now, but we were afraid we would not survive.'</p> <p>The tight-knit climbing community in the US has speculated that it was the charismatic Smith, a natural leader, who would have had the courage to rush an armed man, but friends of the climbers told The Observer that all four had acted together to push the Uzbek over the edge. After the guard fell to what the climbers assume was certain death, the four immediately started running 'like Forrest Gump', as Smith described it to his mother, covering 18 miles to a Kyrgyz army outpost.</p> <p>But their ordeal was not yet over. As they approached the post they were shot at again, this time by Kyrgyz troops mistaking them for guerrillas. Caldwell, Dickey and Rodden dived for cover behind rocks but Smith kept running, finding himself surrounded by soldiers. He shouted: 'We're Americans! We're Americans!'</p> <p>'You'd never believe how good tinned sardines can taste,' Caldwell said of their first meal in almost a week. They were given army fatigues and were met at Batken by the Kyrgyz president, Askar Akayev, who flew the four climbers to Bishkek in his personal jet before they were transferred to the US Embassy.</p> <p>Since returning to the US at the end of August the four have been besieged by American and foreign media eager to buy up their story. After signing an exclusive contract with Outside magazine, the team have been auctioning a book about their adventure and several studios are bidding for the film rights. Smith is also believed to have given an interview to Playboy magazine.</p> <p>Not all of the interest has been friendly.

      "bodyText": "The climbers were faced with a stark choice. Having risked their lives on some of the most challenging mountains in the world, where only their skill and courage had kept them going, the four-strong American group seized by kidnappers during an expedition in a remote part of former Soviet-controlled Asia contemplated the ultimate dilemma: kill their guard or face being killed themselves. In an epic real-life adventure story that has prompted a frenzied bidding war between Hollywood film studios and New York publishers, the real story of the mountaineers and the guard they pushed off a cliff to certain death is only now beginning to emerge. The expedition had begun well enough. When Jason 'Singer' Smith, 22, and his friends set off to climb in the Pamir mountains in Kyrgyzstan they thought they knew what they were getting into. The Karavashin region, 10,000ft up in the mountains, has become a Mecca for adventurous mountaineers and the four Americans planned to grab their own share of climbing glory by conquering a number of new climbs. The drama that engulfed the young team began while Smith and his three companions were bivouacking hundreds of feet up a vertical rock face. After days of climbing, they planned to spend their first night on a cramped platform they had carried up with them, an aluminium-framed 'portaledge' - a campsite hanging in the sky. Hanging from ropes far above the ground, they slotted together the alloy poles, discussed the next day's route up the unclimbed face and looked forward to a simple dinner and an unnerving night's rest above the black void. With Smith were John Dickey, at 25 the oldest member of the group, and two Californians, Tommy Caldwell, 22, and Beth Rodden, 20, at 5ft and six stone, a tiny but brilliant woman who had quickly become one of world's most famous female climbers. The expedition had been sold as a big deal in the lucrative world of US outdoor marketing. It had been backed by the leading outdoor designer label The North Face, and Dickey and Smith were there to photograph the two 'stars' of the climb, Caldwell and Rodden, as they inched up the face. Rodden was a recent recruit to The North Face. For all of them, a lot was riding on a successful climb. What happened next turned their adventure into a nightmare. As they rested on cramped ledges, they were startled by the sound of guns being fired in their direction from the valley below. They were sitting targets in the middle of a blank granite wall high above the ground, and any thought of ignoring the shooting and continuing to the summit disappeared when bullets started hitting the rock around them. Terrified, the team agreed that one of them should abseil down to negotiate with the gunmen, and it was Dickey who was elected to do the talking. According to friends who spoke to The Observer last week, he abseiled down to the foot of the cliff where he was immediately surrounded by three armed Uzbeks, members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is fighting for the creation of an independent Muslim state where the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan converge. The group regularly kidnaps westerners and has plunged the area into political chaos. Confronted by the gunmen, Dickey knew they were in deep trouble. Their base camp was in ruins and the Uzbeks, with barely any English, were in no mood to negotiate. The kidnappers had already destroyed most of their tents and spare equipment and Dickey quickly complied with the gunmen's hand-signalled orders, telling his friends over their radio to descend to the certainty of captivity and the possibility that they would die. According to friends, the gunmen ordered the four to gather what food they could and go with them. Grabbing a few energy bars, the climbers endured a six-day ordeal, being moved at night by two of the guerrillas and being forced to hide during the day under brush or rocks from the view of Kyrgyz army helicopters. If they did not understand the risks of non-compliance, it was made abundantly clear five hours into their captivity. To their horror, a Kyrgyz soldier whom the guerrillas had kidnapped earlier was taken away and shot. Smith was forced to sit on the body for 40 minutes before the group continued. Continuously hungry, forced to drink foul water from puddles and in constant fear for their lives, the four stumbled by night under the watchful gaze of their captors and froze during the day, unable to move in their shadowy hideouts. 'I thought about everything,' Caldwell said afterwards, 'I thought about the meaning of life, what these people were after.' On the sixth day, one of their guards returned to base to collect fresh batteries for the radios taken from the climbers. The hostages found themselves on top of a high granite cliff with one man watching over them. It was then that they hatched their escape plan. No one knows who acted first and the climbers are not saying - yet. But at a press conference in her hometown of Davis, California, Rodden gave the briefest outline of what happened: 'While moving at night and guarded by only one rebel, we at last saw a chance to escape by pushing our guard off the cliff. It is so hard to think of that now, but we were afraid we would not survive.' The tight-knit climbing community in the US has speculated that it was the charismatic Smith, a natural leader, who would have had the courage to rush an armed man, but friends of the climbers told The Observer that all four had acted together to push the Uzbek over the edge. After the guard fell to what the climbers assume was certain death, the four immediately started running 'like Forrest Gump', as Smith described it to his mother, covering 18 miles to a Kyrgyz army outpost. But their ordeal was not yet over. As they approached the post they were shot at again, this time by Kyrgyz troops mistaking them for guerrillas. Caldwell, Dickey and Rodden dived for cover behind rocks but Smith kept running, finding himself surrounded by soldiers. He shouted: 'We're Americans! We're Americans!' 'You'd never believe how good tinned sardines can taste,' Caldwell said of their first meal in almost a week. They were given army fatigues and were met at Batken by the Kyrgyz president, Askar Akayev, who flew the four climbers to Bishkek in his personal jet before they were transferred to the US Embassy. Since returning to the US at the end of August the four have been besieged by American and foreign media eager to buy up their story. After signing an exclusive contract with Outside magazine, the team have been auctioning a book about their adventure and several studios are bidding for the film rights. Smith is also believed to have given an interview to Playboy magazine. Not all of the interest has been friendly. Rejecting criticism that the climbers had been foolhardy in going to such a politically unstable area in the first place, Rodden's father told reporters that she was 'doing remarkably well under the circumstances'. He said advice found by the team on the internet suggested that the risk was minimal. The US State Department, however, has been warning Americans to stay away from the region for more than a year.",

In Venezuela, where the Ford replaced faulty Firestones a month before the US recall, regulators have accused Ford and Firestone of conspiracy after 46 died in Firestone-equipped Explorers. Ford maintains its vehicle is sound and only Firestone's tyres are defective. Firestone, a division of Japan's Bridgestone Corp, counters that a factor beyond its control - namely a lower tyre pressure recommended by the auto giant - is to blame. Without admitting liability, both companies now acknowledge they might have appreciated the magnitude of the problem earlier. Whatever the truth, warning signs that the Explorer-Firestone combination was a danger were easily missed - or obscured. 'Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral obligation to make sure that the products they sell are safe,' said Senator Richard C. Shelby. 'And yet they both failed to bring this issue to consumers' and the federal government's attention, at the cost of dozens of lives.' If Ford and Firestone knew of problems and did nothing, federal regulators could impose up to $925,000 in fines. The companies could also face criminal charges. The biggest potential damage is that the image of the companies will become so tarnished that customers avoid their products. Both say their August sales showed little effect from the recall but some independent dealers say customers are now avoiding Firestone tyres. Many safety experts believe that long after tempers have cooled it will be discovered that no single factor is to blame for the crashes. 'You've got a vehicle on the margin of stability and a tyre on the margins,' says accident investigator Dick Baumgardner. 'Put them together and you've got a disaster.'",

But, really, never the twain. </p> <p>Sylvia was snappily petulant and occasionally rather fierce. 'I was never a star let. I was an act ress!' she corrected the interviewer peevishly. But later she said that though her own career has been solid (and judged by the industry norm, quite madly successful), she had really 'always wanted to be Judi Dench. Or Prunella Scales.

Judi in (and out) of love! </p> <p>Interestingly, in Alan Plater's one-off drama, <strong>Last of the Blonde Bombshells</strong>, Judi could easily have played alongside either Joan or Sylvia (and, in fact, the girl who played the young Judi looked just like the Ice Cold -era Syms). Instead, she found herself with mature co-stars as diverse as Cleo Laine, Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, June Whitfield, Billie Whitelaw (whom I mistook, briefly and bizarrely, for Sue Johnston: good news for Sue, less so for Billie) and Joan Sims; obviously, there had to be a Sims, or a Syms, in there somewhere. </p> <p>Dame Judi's character, Elizabeth, was a feisty, freshly widowed mother of some desperately dull adult children and a sweet grandchild - played, rather shockingly, by a child actor who spoke with received pronunciation - whom she liked to scare by using the F-word.

By contrast, the fact that it was a concert performance freed it of the gruesome, Grailish paraphernalia that can clog Wagner's 'stage consecration play'. Here, the drama was played out on a large but always human scale. </p> <p>Elming's Parsifal was a man first, humanity's redeemer second. The voice may not have shaken the rafters, but there was a vulnerable lyricism that meant more than sheer power. His Act Two encounter with Kundry surged with sexual energy, mostly hers. There was something rather overblown about Petra Lang's performance, but then for Wagner, Kundry was indeed a slut, desperately seeking salvation. Lang has a formidable vocal apparatus and the natural intensity to back it up, even in Act Three, when she had almost nothing to sing. </p> <p>The other singers displayed equal authority. Robert Lloyd had a slightly nasal tone, but held superbly the narrative line that runs through Gurnemanz's mighty orations. There may not be many jokes in Parsifal, but Lloyd located scraps of humour to leaven the drama while also suggesting Gurnemanz's burden of awful knowledge. If Sergei Leiferkus's Klingsor had too Slavic an accent, that simply underlined the character's alien nature, while Sch\u00f6ne caught the pained dignity that afflicts Amfortas. </p> <p>With smaller parts exquisitely cast and the excellent choruses, attention nevertheless focused on Rattle's way with the orchestra. In the main, the Rotterdam Phil proved equal to the task. The strings played with lustrous colour, from the tiniest whisper in the violins to the organ-like underpinning of the nine double basses. From the winds, there were moments of unsurprising, perhaps even welcome unevenness - high gloss is not always what's needed in Wagner. This was not Parsifal in overdrive but a nuanced account that never lost its narrative momentum. I hope our opera houses are queuing up to have Rattle do it in the theatre. </p> <p>There are quasi-Wagnerian elements in Robert Schumann's only opera, <b> Genoveva</b>: a saucy sorceress, Germanic knights (one called Siegfried), a holy cause, streams of endless melody holding things together when the narrative falters.

Chorus members milled about as if still learning their positions, soloists behaved as if a moment's stillness carried a serious penalty. Yet the story, so complicated in synopsis, came across clearly.

      "body": "<p><strong> Irek Mukhamedov &amp; Company</strong> Sadler's Wells, London EC1 </p> <p><strong> La Danse du Temps</strong> Ballet Atlantique, Barbican Theatre, London EC2 </p> <p><strong> Arcimboldo 2000</strong> NDT, Edinburgh Festival Theatre </p> <p>The Dance of Time (the English title of Regine Chopinot's work at the Barbican) is an apt description of last week's offerings in London and Edinburgh. All incorporated older dancers; choreographers love to make an issue of of ageing, equating the passage of time with mortality. </p> <p>How to defy that convention without denying the inevitable loss of physical prowess? One option is modern dance - think Baryshnikov, 52, and his White Oak Project. <strong> Irek Mukhamedov</strong>, 40, is testing that route with his own ad-hoc group. Underused by the Royal Ballet, he wants to carry on doing what he can still do well: witness the Class Concert at the start of his Wells programme. He and his guest star, Altynai Asylmuratova, 39, outclassed the younger dancers in the routine academic exercises they have done all their lives. </p> <p>Yet as soon as the two of them moved away from ballet, they looked clumsy, inexpressive. They had lost their physical history without gaining insights into alternative ways of using the body. Darshan Singh Bhuller devised a duet for them, Sita , that deliberately made them earthbound instead of airborne. Named after the Indian goddess of agriculture, it is a contemporary take on a fertility ritual. </p> <p>Farmer Mukhamedov fructifies the soil by coupling with Asylmuratova, who spends most of the time on her back. Sensual and spiritual are supposedly intertwined. She flexes her feet and he tries to balance himself on her toes, sowing the furrow. Bhuller's ideas have always been more imaginative than their realisation. A fine contemporary dancer during the past two decades, he lacks a choreographer's craft. Powerful subject matter can carry him through, but Sita managed to reduce two of the most articulate performers to banal rutting. </p> <p>They should have danced William Tuckett's duet, Unobtrusive Detail, which was witty and original (and sharply carried off by Nichola Davies and Martin Harvey). Other pas de deux were familiar party pieces for Russian and Royal Ballet dancers, with a jazzy Gershwin finale by Gillian Lynne. Called Some You Win, it lost Asylmuratova as a Cyd Charisse hoofer in Armani. She can do better, as can the token dancing girls. Mukhamedov was an unlikely Gene Kelly Still, they looked delicious, as did Lynne, 74, in her curtain calls. </p> <p>Regine Chopinot uses dancers in their seventies for <strong> La Danse du Temps</strong>, in a stagescape by Andy Goldsworthy, sculptor of time. The backdrop is a film record of Goldsworthy's Earth River, in which a wall of clay dries to reveal the serpentine path of a water course. Watching clay crack, speeded up, is preferable to watching dancers slowly piling stones, branches and leaves, as they did in Chopinot's time-consuming Vegetal at a previous Edinburgh Festival. </p> <p>At the Barbican, the dancers dominated the foreground, often linked in swirling currents of movement. Theirs was a simple rite of passage, to Vietnamese composer Ton-That Tiet's mesmerising music. Standing out among them were Francoise and Dominique Dupuy, veteran contemporary dancers, married for half a century. Elders rather than oldies, each was tenderly transported by a band of acolytes.

      "bodyText": "Irek Mukhamedov &amp; Company Sadler's Wells, London EC1 La Danse du Temps Ballet Atlantique, Barbican Theatre, London EC2 Arcimboldo 2000 NDT, Edinburgh Festival Theatre The Dance of Time (the English title of Regine Chopinot's work at the Barbican) is an apt description of last week's offerings in London and Edinburgh. All incorporated older dancers; choreographers love to make an issue of of ageing, equating the passage of time with mortality. How to defy that convention without denying the inevitable loss of physical prowess? One option is modern dance - think Baryshnikov, 52, and his White Oak Project. Irek Mukhamedov, 40, is testing that route with his own ad-hoc group. Underused by the Royal Ballet, he wants to carry on doing what he can still do well: witness the Class Concert at the start of his Wells programme. He and his guest star, Altynai Asylmuratova, 39, outclassed the younger dancers in the routine academic exercises they have done all their lives. Yet as soon as the two of them moved away from ballet, they looked clumsy, inexpressive. They had lost their physical history without gaining insights into alternative ways of using the body. Darshan Singh Bhuller devised a duet for them, Sita , that deliberately made them earthbound instead of airborne. Named after the Indian goddess of agriculture, it is a contemporary take on a fertility ritual. Farmer Mukhamedov fructifies the soil by coupling with Asylmuratova, who spends most of the time on her back. Sensual and spiritual are supposedly intertwined. She flexes her feet and he tries to balance himself on her toes, sowing the furrow. Bhuller's ideas have always been more imaginative than their realisation. A fine contemporary dancer during the past two decades, he lacks a choreographer's craft. Powerful subject matter can carry him through, but Sita managed to reduce two of the most articulate performers to banal rutting. They should have danced William Tuckett's duet, Unobtrusive Detail, which was witty and original (and sharply carried off by Nichola Davies and Martin Harvey). Other pas de deux were familiar party pieces for Russian and Royal Ballet dancers, with a jazzy Gershwin finale by Gillian Lynne. Called Some You Win, it lost Asylmuratova as a Cyd Charisse hoofer in Armani. She can do better, as can the token dancing girls. Mukhamedov was an unlikely Gene Kelly Still, they looked delicious, as did Lynne, 74, in her curtain calls. Regine Chopinot uses dancers in their seventies for La Danse du Temps, in a stagescape by Andy Goldsworthy, sculptor of time. The backdrop is a film record of Goldsworthy's Earth River, in which a wall of clay dries to reveal the serpentine path of a water course. Watching clay crack, speeded up, is preferable to watching dancers slowly piling stones, branches and leaves, as they did in Chopinot's time-consuming Vegetal at a previous Edinburgh Festival. At the Barbican, the dancers dominated the foreground, often linked in swirling currents of movement. Theirs was a simple rite of passage, to Vietnamese composer Ton-That Tiet's mesmerising music. Standing out among them were Francoise and Dominique Dupuy, veteran contemporary dancers, married for half a century. Elders rather than oldies, each was tenderly transported by a band of acolytes. He, sturdy, mouthed words, presumably of wisdom; she, slight, seemed a sybil, a snake goddess. Chopinot's intention, like Goldsworthy's, is to show alteration, loss and renewal. There is plenty of time to reflect and to ponder on how and when a body reveals signs of ageing. The paradox in 'natural' work like this is that, apart from the Dupuys, treated as seers, older dancers in the company were unremarkable, unless you knew they were there. Chopinot makes the case, as does Jir\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n for his Nederlands Dans Theater 3 group, that older dancers enrich the company, as well as the audience's experience. In that case, they need no apology. In Arcimboldo 2000, Kyli\u00e1n's extravaganza at the end of the Edinburgh Festival, NDT3 members were, for once, part of the whole. Some just danced; others had to do the silly bits, like contestants in a TV game show.

Ironic, heartfelt, spoken with exemplary clarity, this is a performance which radiates intelligence. It confirms Russell Beale's position as one of the foremost actors of his generation. </p> <p>But he's acting in a limited production. John Caird's conception of the play is imposing - in both good and bad senses. He has boldly cut the last scene and the character of Fortinbras, stripping the play of its public, martial dimensions. He has floated the action on a raft of religious sounds and images. He produces something impressive, grand and monolithic; he suggests that the core of Hamlet is to do, not with the doubts that any human being is likely to be heir to, but with sin and redemption. </p> <p>Waves of holy music sweep over the stage: bells peal; choirs soar, at times threatening to interfere with the speech. Tim Hatley's design makes Elsinore into the bare dark lofty space of an Orthodox cathedral. Dozens of golden baskets burning with candles are lowered from the ceiling; when Ophelia is mad, she sets these swaying like censers. At the back of the stage, a wooden screen opens from time to time to admit actors and glimpses of a world outside. In the closing moments, this splits in two directions to show light in the shape of a massive cross. All this makes Hamlet more cohesive, but what's missing is the jangling uncertainty, the sense of impending chaos which turns the rottenness of Denmark into a matter of metaphysics as well as politics. </p> <p>There are gaps in the acting, too. As Ophelia, Cathryn Bradshaw squeaks; Guy Lankester is a stolid Laertes; Denis Quilley's Polonius is efficient but routinely plummy. Only Sara Kestelman as a poised Gertrude can command the stage with Russell Beale. Shaken from his desolation, Russell Beale lets off a firecracker of a mad laugh to frighten Polonius; as he talks of hawks, he sug gests, without exact mimicry, the bright eye and cocked head of a bird of prey; when he instructs the Players, he hunkers down among them, as if he were one of the company. And when he comes to die, you believe - what you rarely believe - that the readiness is all. </p> <p>Peter Zadek's more blatantly radical approach to the play supplies the note that's missing from Russell Beale's compassionate performance: that of snarling anarchy. In a wonderful opening scene, two guards in great coats and ear-flapped helmets pace round the corrugated railway truck from which all entrances and exits are made, while very slowly a piece of waste-paper is blown across the empty stage. </p> <p>Zadek's Hamlet was famous before it opened for casting a woman in the title role. It's likely to be remem bered for its portrait of the Dane as waif. From the moment the celebrated German actor Angela Winkler appears - with ragamuffin locks and legs looking spindly in dark tights under a tunic - she has the air of a changeling among the opulently upholstered courtiers. She has none of their stateliness, but an unguarded affection: she jumps for joy when the Players appear. She delivers the soliloquies with an extreme candour, looking straight into the audience. She hardly moves as she does so. Once - not a good idea - in 'to be or not to be', she sniffs. This is an endearing Hamlet - too much so. But it could only be thought of as feminised by someone who thinks that women are more childlike than men. </p> <p>Charlotte Jones's <strong> In Flame</strong> has arrived at the New Ambassadors after opening at the Bush last year. It features vivacious dialogue and a series of inspired performances by Marcia Warren, who plays a sour early-twentieth-century matron as well as a foul-mouthed late-twentieth-century victim of Alzheimer's. It's Warren who provides the high point of the evening when, in hospital nightie, with a rubber-tipped walking-stick tilted at a jaunty angle like a cane, and her frozen features shaken by knowing nods and winks, she patters across the floor in a scarlet-shod tap-dance. </p> <p>Jones is a talented writer: her play has a lot of sparks. But it doesn't catch fire. Its use of the familiar feminist structure by which two women's lives are seen in parallel too often means that both are reduced to sketchiness. Kerry Fox ismuted, while the bigger stage has forced Rosie Cava liero's creation of two accident-prone young women into gawping, goggling, by-goom caricature. </p> <p>There's no mystery in <strong> The Mystery of Charles Dickens</strong>. But there is an attempt to make a straightforward one-man show look complicated. Christopher Woods's design ponderously emphasises the fact that what's on stage is not simply a piece of impersonation. Under Patrick Garland's direction, Simon Callow appears at the Comedy in front of slanted and square-on picture frames: this is Callow presenting Dickens presenting his characters. No real mystery here. </p> <p>The script, culled by Peter Ackroyd from his biography of the author, concentrates on the overlap, and the contradictions, between Dickens's life and his novels: it's interesting but not revelatory to hear about the discrepan cies between Dickens's sweetness on the page and brutality on the hearth. It's glancingly proposed that the real secret of the writer's life had to do with his liaison in middle age with the young actress Ellen Ternan: if that's so, why isn't there a show about Ternan? </p> <p>Callow is skilful, and no fan of Dickens will come away without some thrill. He can strike off a grotesque - a lisping Fagin, a cringing Uriah Heep, a terrifying Mrs Gamp - as if he were simply shifting his weight from one foot to another. But his fruitily delivered narrative raises a real mystery about Dickens. Why is this least middle-class of English novelists routinely represented as if he was the plummiest of Establishment figures?

Its central dramatic spine, combining the plots of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer , has a group of stereotypical high school seniors stalked by a serial killer in cowl and death mask and menaced by phone calls over a death they'd concealed the previous year. The problem is that unlike such po-faced pictures as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure that the Zucker Brothers were sending up in Airplane , the Scream series are post-modern jokes that have self-mockery built in like smoke-activated sprays. </p> <p>The result is that the laughter raised by references to Scream, The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense, as well as to other recent movies (Titanic, Amistad and The Usual Suspects are mildly lampooned in a TV sketch style), is occasioned less by witty invention than by mere recognition. There is also an all too prevalent notion, popularised by Cheech and Chong, that drugs and the antics of those under the influence of drugs are funny in themselves. </p> <p>As I've implied, however, the pastiches of horror flicks are a minor part of the film's appeal. What makes Scary Movie distinctive (for the next few months at least) are the number and intensity of the gross-outs or moments of bad taste calculated to induce groans and simulated (or actual) vomiting in the audience. </p> <p>The most traditional of these are fart jokes, starting in the pre-credit scene and all involving women. Then there are homosexual jokes, mostly emanating from the fact that a handsome black student (Shawn Wayans) is attracted to other men but doesn't realise he's gay. The third, now almost traditional, source of humour involves previously taboo subjects like oral sex, masturbation and orgasms. A mentally retarded policeman masturbates using a vacuum cleaner; a boy comes so violently that his girlfriend is plastered to the ceiling with his semen. </p> <p>These are, as Neil Armstrong might put it, small steps for a man, compared with the larger, exponential steps Scary Movie takes for mankind. Early on in the picture a boy receives a terrible electric shock from the barbed wire defences on a virgin's loins. So far, so bad. Then, when she finally makes herself available to him, he discovers that her public hair has proliferated to such a degree that he has to take an electric hedgecutter to it before they can have sex. </p> <p>The biggest breakthrough occurs when the latent homosexual puts his head to a hole in a lavatory cubicle from which an erect penis penetrates his ear and reappears on the other side of his head. Now this is the stuff of sexual nightmares, urban legends, Krafft-Ebing case histories. Pathological? Certainly. Therapeutic? Possibly. </p> <p>Thomas Wolfe said that you can't go home again, an admonition disregarded by writer-director Barry Levinson, who after Diner, Tin Men and Avalon, returns once more to the Baltimore of his youth with <strong> Liberty Heights</strong>. This schematic exercise in nostalgia starts in the autumn of 1954, a time of social change in America. The Supreme Court has overturned the 'separate but equal' education policies of Southern states; McCarthyism runs high despite the censuring of McCarthy himself; rock'n'roll is starting to attract white youth; TV is becoming the dominant medium of entertainment. </p> <p>At the centre is the Kurtzman family, middle-class, quite well-off, semi-orthodox Jews living in a predominantly Jewish area. Dad (Joe Mantegna) is subsidising his money-losing burlesque house by engaging in the numbers racket which brings him into dangerous contact with drug-dealing blacks. His younger son, a high school senior, secretly dates a pretty black girl, the only one in his newly integrated school, and her doctor father disapproves. His older son, an undergraduate, becomes obsessed with a beautiful blonde WASP heiress, and is mocked by her virulently anti-semitic friends. </p> <p>It's attractively performed, but all a little too neat. Levinson's ear for the speech of the time isn't entirely convincing and I find it hard to believe that a country club in 1954 Maryland would carry the sign 'No Jews, Dogs or Coloured Allowed'.

He's supposedly investigating the brutal murder of an 11-year-old girl, but evinces not the slightest knowledge of standard police procedure.

A more obvious one is that chess provides a series of immediately understood metaphors - for life and death in the Bergman movie, for a crafty move by the Raj in Ray's film, and for the dialectics of gang warfare in Losing Isaiah. The game is also highly photogenic. </p> <p>The Dutch director Marleen Gorris (whose last film was a version of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway) adds to this list of distinguished chess movies with The Luzhin Defence. A work of considerable intellectual and physical elegance, it's rather cleverly adapted by a British writer Peter Berry from Vladimir Nabokov's 1930 novel. </p> <p>In this book, Nabokov discovered his mature style and established himself at the age of 30 as the pre-eminent Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 author, though it wasn't translated into English for 33 years. </p> <p>For more than a decade, John Turturro has been specialising in characters whose awkward bodies contain flashing minds, troubled spirits and pure hearts. </p> <p>In Marleen Gorris's film, he's utterly convincing as the 30-ish Alexander Luzhin, a Russian chess master whose life comes into dangerously combustible focus in 1929 when he comes to a hotel beside Lake Como to take part in a tournament. </p> <p>The shambling, unkempt Luzhin has been bound up with chess all his life, and flashbacks to his childhood, part hell, part idyll in Tsarist St Petersburg, reveal how this obsession was shaped by his haut-bourgeois parents' loveless marriage and his relationship with the beautiful aunt who introduced him to the game. </p> <p>After destroying his father at the chess board, he beats his former schoolmaster, the demonic Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), who becomes his exploitative 'chess father', taking him around Europe as a prodigy for 14 years, before dropping him when his game begins to falter. </p> <p>At Lake Como, Luzhin meets a possible redeemer in the form of Natalia (Emily Watson), an unconventional beauty, daughter of rich aristocratic Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. A rebel against her rigid background, she sees beneath the unprepossessing surface, beyond the lack of small talk and social graces, to the beauty of his soul. </p> <p>Natalia is attracted rather than repelled by the intensity of his feelings, and when he suddenly proposes marriage, she accepts. Watson with her radiant smile and blue eyes and Turturro with his twitching grimaces and brown eyes make this curious, precipitate courtship ring affectingly true. </p> <p>But in addition to being a love story, The Luzhin Defence is a thriller about rivalry, power and destruction. Ranged against Luzhin are Natalia's parents, who have understandable reservations, the immaculately groomed Italian grandmaster he must face, and the suave, vindictive Valentinov, who has returned to abet the fall of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. </p> <p>A deadly endgame faces him, on and off the board. As he stands on the brink of total collapse, his mind as fragile as the glass king he's carried since learning chess as a child, there emerges the alternative of abandoning chess for Natalia.

      "body": "<p>At the Saatchi Gallery's Ant Noises 2 exhibition stands a curious series of glass cages. The innermost cage contains an easel, a smock and a roll of toilet paper and the outer box two tables, painter's palettes and brushes. This is Contemplating A Self Portrait (As A Pharmacist) by Damien Hirst, his take on the artist's studio. The only sign of recent life is the faint smell of white spirit emanating from the gaps between the glass plates of the cage. </p> <p>Hirst didn't want to talk about his piece; he is very busy in New York. But as an artist who has already exerted a huge influence on the art world, might this piece herald a new fashion for giving the public a glimpse into the inner sanctum? </p> <p>For many, the studio is a sensitive issue; Tracey Emin also didn't want to talk about hers let alone allow a stranger near such a 'private place'. Lucian Freud has painted his studio with its sagging sofa and pile of paint rags into his pictures for years. Picasso once referred to his workplace as the 'scaffold', hinting that each time he approached the canvas it was like meeting the hangman; that any public execution of him as an artist would begin at the canvas. Last year the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi transported a replica of his entire studio to the Dean Gallery in Edinburgh. </p> <p>So is the studio the hub of all creation? Or is it as relevant as the printing press where a novel becomes a bound set of papers? </p> <p>Just off a busy main road in south London lies a near-condemned warehouse, home to the Chapman brothers, Jake and Dinos. On the second floor, above a busy furniture workshop, they rent two rooms. The roof leaks. The floor is covered in dust. There is a big gap in the larger of the two rooms where a wall should be, along with a table-tennis table and their latest work - destined for the Royal Academy's forthcoming Apocalypse exhibition - the sprawling vision of a gruesome battlefield that is Hell . The fumes from the resin glue and spray paint they use for their work are strong enough to make visitors squint. When they first moved in to the building, four years ago, Jake and Dinos could smell the fumes. Now they are immune. </p> <p>'It's a depressant,' says Dinos. I point to the half-finished sculpture of Siamese twin boys with penises for ears, and ask if the fumes have influenced their work. 'Oh no,' he grins 'those are our happy things.' </p> <p>This studio is a mess, one that suggests its two occupants don't pay much heed to the consequences of their work. </p> <p>'The mess is the consequence of us working,' says Dinos. 'We could fill this with rubbish in a week.' The pair talk incessantly as they work. 'When you work on your own, you work for an imagined audience,' says Jake, 'and they present the work and receive feedback. But, working together, we're constantly viewing each other's work and hence have constant feedback. In some sense that writes out the audience and makes us quite indifferent to them.' </p> <p>Jake finds the fascination that buyers and critics have with the Chapmans' studio now palls. He recalls how a group of buyers once came to their old premises in Brick Lane. They were delighted to find that the lights didn't work and that they had to trample down a steep drop to get to some of the pieces. </p> <p>'They loved it,' he says, disapprovingly.

      "bodyText": "At the Saatchi Gallery's Ant Noises 2 exhibition stands a curious series of glass cages. The innermost cage contains an easel, a smock and a roll of toilet paper and the outer box two tables, painter's palettes and brushes. This is Contemplating A Self Portrait (As A Pharmacist) by Damien Hirst, his take on the artist's studio. The only sign of recent life is the faint smell of white spirit emanating from the gaps between the glass plates of the cage. Hirst didn't want to talk about his piece; he is very busy in New York. But as an artist who has already exerted a huge influence on the art world, might this piece herald a new fashion for giving the public a glimpse into the inner sanctum? For many, the studio is a sensitive issue; Tracey Emin also didn't want to talk about hers let alone allow a stranger near such a 'private place'. Lucian Freud has painted his studio with its sagging sofa and pile of paint rags into his pictures for years. Picasso once referred to his workplace as the 'scaffold', hinting that each time he approached the canvas it was like meeting the hangman; that any public execution of him as an artist would begin at the canvas. Last year the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi transported a replica of his entire studio to the Dean Gallery in Edinburgh. So is the studio the hub of all creation? Or is it as relevant as the printing press where a novel becomes a bound set of papers? Just off a busy main road in south London lies a near-condemned warehouse, home to the Chapman brothers, Jake and Dinos. On the second floor, above a busy furniture workshop, they rent two rooms. The roof leaks. The floor is covered in dust. There is a big gap in the larger of the two rooms where a wall should be, along with a table-tennis table and their latest work - destined for the Royal Academy's forthcoming Apocalypse exhibition - the sprawling vision of a gruesome battlefield that is Hell . The fumes from the resin glue and spray paint they use for their work are strong enough to make visitors squint. When they first moved in to the building, four years ago, Jake and Dinos could smell the fumes. Now they are immune. 'It's a depressant,' says Dinos. I point to the half-finished sculpture of Siamese twin boys with penises for ears, and ask if the fumes have influenced their work. 'Oh no,' he grins 'those are our happy things.' This studio is a mess, one that suggests its two occupants don't pay much heed to the consequences of their work. 'The mess is the consequence of us working,' says Dinos. 'We could fill this with rubbish in a week.' The pair talk incessantly as they work. 'When you work on your own, you work for an imagined audience,' says Jake, 'and they present the work and receive feedback. But, working together, we're constantly viewing each other's work and hence have constant feedback. In some sense that writes out the audience and makes us quite indifferent to them.' Jake finds the fascination that buyers and critics have with the Chapmans' studio now palls. He recalls how a group of buyers once came to their old premises in Brick Lane. They were delighted to find that the lights didn't work and that they had to trample down a steep drop to get to some of the pieces. 'They loved it,' he says, disapprovingly. 'But it's like going to Tesco, buying some beans and wanting to go to the factory to see where they are made. Mess, in some naff analogy, equals toil, which buyers find attractive.' The McDonald's just down the road has, for them, been the biggest geographical influence on their work. This is the 'McOffice', where most of their business gets done; where a rich buyer once approached the counter, ordered a coffee and then asked where he should sit to be served; and where they find 'the shallow end of the gene pool' that inspires the physiology of much of their work. Jake insists that a 'geographical psychoanalysis' of their warehouse as an influence on them won't wash, and that their studio is just a place like any other, irrelevant to their work. 'If I could buy a machine, press a button on it and have the work come out, that would suit me down to the ground,' says Dinos. Neither of them shows any emotion when they say that within months the whole block will be knocked down to make way for a massive Asda supermarket. They'll move on. 'We'll just have less space and higher bills,' grumbles Dinos. Insouciance is something of a calling card for Young British Artists, so I approached some of art's more senior figures.

Why shouldn't this rule apply to the consumption of contemporary art? </p> <p>Take, for example, the Sensation show, visited by hundreds of thousands.

Barely a season goes by without another showing of Sarah Lucas's fags, kebabs, vests or fried eggs and two more fat ladies from Jenny Saville. </p> <p>Damien Hirst's spot paintings have become the expensive wallpaper they always were, available by the yard through selected outlets. Nobody needs to wait a whole year for this art to reappear - what you see in one city gallery will soon be shown again in another. </p> <p>Tracey Emin's bed, so recently dismantled at Tate Britain, has been remade at the Saatchi Gallery. If you aren't one of the hundreds of thousands who have already seen it, then you have another chance to witness the stained knickers (the blood still looking suspiciously new) and wonder how all those types of oral contraceptive stockpiled round the bed could possibly have failed for Emin to need so many condoms. </p> <p>At the Tate, where it was theatrically lit in its own private room, the bed performed as a dramatised memoir. In the null, white warehouse of Boundary Road, all its contrivances and implausibilities are exposed - does she really chain up her luggage? </p> <p>From Sarah Lucas's spring exhibition at the Freud Museum come a couple of sexual fetishes - a shot of her nipple protruding through a strategic hole in her shirt; a chair dressed in underpants lunging a fluorescent pole at another chair wearing a bra stuffed with glowing light bulbs. They got a lot from the Freudian context, coming over like visual pathology. Here, they just wink and nudge like her latest reprise - more underpants sprouting a giant salami. </p> <p>Goya's Disasters of War , as customised in the manner of Viz by the Chapman Brothers, have paused a few months before arriving from the White Cube Gallery. From the summer opening of White Cube 2 comes Gavin Turk's preposterous waxwork of himself as the corpse of Che Guevara. </p> <p>At least Ant Noises 1 polarised around one long-awaited new work - Damien Hirst's massive bronze titan. Ant Noises 2 actually feels more like a premature repeat than an exciting new autumn schedule. </p> <p>Still, it was good to see one of Richard Patterson's paintings from the Sensation show again. Culture Station: Zipper collages Patterson's trademark photorealism - always a bit off, a bit blurred - with Philip Guston's stitchmarks and Barnett Newman's zips, somewhat in the style of Robert Rauschenberg. American art unzipped, if you like, but fully absorbing in its own right. It's a pity that most of Patterson's work these days is shown on the other side of the Atlantic. </p> <p>Instead, we have Jenny Saville's sow - a shift of species but no change of body-as-landscape idea - and a suite of Damien Hirst's recent screenprints. Perfect pastiches of the packaging used for prescription drugs - in this case Sandwich, Liver and Cornish Pasties from HirstDamien Co - they make a spectacle of that austere, high-science aesthetic that doesn't have to entice or promote. Except that in this case they advertise the artist himself - once, twice, 13 times along the gallery wall, packaging incessantly repackaged. </p> <p>When Dead Dad stole the show at Sensation , barely anybody had heard of <strong> Ron Mueck</strong>. Now he is artist in residence at the National Gallery and some think he has over-extended himself.

One hand raised across his heart, he could be an orator about to pronounce; at a distance, he has that sage and universal look, some sort of nobility in his bareboned crown.

The buddha in the next room is far larger than life, a colossal naked man huddled on the floor, his head resent fully averted in anticipation of your arrival. This is not how any stranger would wish to be seen; more than that, this man has palpable standing. His physique is shockingly enlarged, scaled to the size of his humiliated pride. </p> <p>Two of the figures in this show are sleeping, one of them hungrily, desperately, as if to shut out the world, the other worn out by life. Even in this withdrawn and dreaming state, they seem conscious, not about to breathe or just turned to stone, but actively present in character. </p> <p>No sense of artifice disrupts the feelings they stir in you.

      "body": "<p><strong> Melanie C</strong> <br>Derby Assembly Rooms </p> <p>Sporty was, I admit, always my least favourite Spice Girl. But the last time I gave the matter serious consideration was in 1997, and things have changed. Atomised into their various solo careers, the five Girls have revealed sides to their personalities that are simply not catered for by those single-adjective nicknames. We need a new Spice lexicology for a new Spice era... </p> <p>So, in place of (in order of my '97 preference) Ginger, Posh, Scary, Baby and Sporty, we now have: Desperate and Annoying Spice, Married to Someone More Famous and Talented Spice, Emotionally Troubled and Unsuccessful Spice, The Mysterious Case of the Vanishing Spice, and Hasn't She Done Well? Spice. </p> <p>Yes, it's true: Melanie Chisholm, the Spice who, despite possessing the most powerful set of lungs in the group, always came bottom of the popularity polls, is now the biggest-selling, most credible of all. Her debut album, Northern Star , has been in the Top 20 since last October, and now, while Posh is signing plaster casts in the Rochdale branch of Our Price, Melanie C has embarked on a proper, 22-date tour of the UK: small venues, real band, no lip-synching. All this with a broken foot! Posh would definitely have cancelled. </p> <p>Starting your tour in Derby, however, suggests not merely strength of purpose but outright masochism. It's well-known that audiences in the Midlands are the most boring and cold in the world, and - for the first couple of songs here - the crowd are as blank and stupefied as a net of bludgeoned carp. Truly, if you can make it here, New York would be a cinch. </p> <p>Ms C, though, has the dauntless positivity of a Club Med holiday rep. Wearing a black 'I love Derby' vest and faded jeans, she keeps reassuring the crowd that they are 'mental' until, eventually, they are. Her charm is unfocused but relentless: punching the air, sticking her tongue out, wiggling her bum, fondling her left breast...she does the lot. </p> <p>Same with the music. The secret of her success, I think, is that she is a one-woman compilation album. She does rock ('Goin' Down'), ballads ('Northern Star'), modern R&amp;B ('Never Be the Same Again') and trance ('I Turn to You'). Melanie C reaches multiple demographics, as they say in the music industry. In other words, even people who hated the Spice Girls like her. </p> <p>This variety helps her live show, which benefits from avoiding the big solo-pop-star-tour clich\u00e9s - the long-haired, show-off lead guitarist, the earnest, introspective soliloquy. Instead, we have a short-haired female guitarist and bassist who do their jobs enthusiastically but with the minimum of fuss. </p> <p>As a performer Melanie C is somewhere between Tina Turner and Bruce Springsteen (especially her biceps). As a singer she's not in that class, but there are at least no embarrassing vocal glitches, none of the atonal shrieking that we heard on that awful Bryan Adams duet. By the end, the crowd are leaping like salmon on Red Bull. Melanie C is pleased: 'Fuckin' 'ell, look at this... aaarrrggghhh!!!' she squeals. It may not be saying much these days, but Sporty is my new favourite Spice Girl.</p>",

But the last time I gave the matter serious consideration was in 1997, and things have changed. Atomised into their various solo careers, the five Girls have revealed sides to their personalities that are simply not catered for by those single-adjective nicknames. We need a new Spice lexicology for a new Spice era... So, in place of (in order of my '97 preference) Ginger, Posh, Scary, Baby and Sporty, we now have: Desperate and Annoying Spice, Married to Someone More Famous and Talented Spice, Emotionally Troubled and Unsuccessful Spice, The Mysterious Case of the Vanishing Spice, and Hasn't She Done Well? Spice. Yes, it's true: Melanie Chisholm, the Spice who, despite possessing the most powerful set of lungs in the group, always came bottom of the popularity polls, is now the biggest-selling, most credible of all. Her debut album, Northern Star , has been in the Top 20 since last October, and now, while Posh is signing plaster casts in the Rochdale branch of Our Price, Melanie C has embarked on a proper, 22-date tour of the UK: small venues, real band, no lip-synching. All this with a broken foot! Posh would definitely have cancelled. Starting your tour in Derby, however, suggests not merely strength of purpose but outright masochism. It's well-known that audiences in the Midlands are the most boring and cold in the world, and - for the first couple of songs here - the crowd are as blank and stupefied as a net of bludgeoned carp. Truly, if you can make it here, New York would be a cinch. Ms C, though, has the dauntless positivity of a Club Med holiday rep. Wearing a black 'I love Derby' vest and faded jeans, she keeps reassuring the crowd that they are 'mental' until, eventually, they are. Her charm is unfocused but relentless: punching the air, sticking her tongue out, wiggling her bum, fondling her left breast...she does the lot. Same with the music. The secret of her success, I think, is that she is a one-woman compilation album. She does rock ('Goin' Down'), ballads ('Northern Star'), modern R&amp;B ('Never Be the Same Again') and trance ('I Turn to You'). Melanie C reaches multiple demographics, as they say in the music industry. In other words, even people who hated the Spice Girls like her. This variety helps her live show, which benefits from avoiding the big solo-pop-star-tour clich\u00e9s - the long-haired, show-off lead guitarist, the earnest, introspective soliloquy. Instead, we have a short-haired female guitarist and bassist who do their jobs enthusiastically but with the minimum of fuss. As a performer Melanie C is somewhere between Tina Turner and Bruce Springsteen (especially her biceps). As a singer she's not in that class, but there are at least no embarrassing vocal glitches, none of the atonal shrieking that we heard on that awful Bryan Adams duet. By the end, the crowd are leaping like salmon on Red Bull. Melanie C is pleased: 'Fuckin' 'ell, look at this... aaarrrggghhh!!!' she squeals. It may not be saying much these days, but Sporty is my new favourite Spice Girl.",

To my astonishment, one of the men asked me to dance. His name, so he told me, was Baron Pierre Cervello, and he was engaged, he later told me, to Mandy Rice-Davies, who was involved in the then breaking Profumo scandal. Over the next few months Pierre would introduce me to an underlife in London which was both breathtakingly sordid and wondrous at the same time. Orgies with film stars and nobility and layers of willing girls. I was an innocent 18-year-old, fresh out of virginity, and I assumed that as I was at what appeared to be the epicentre of fashionable London, then it was absolutely the fashionable thing to do - to swing.

I know this because I saw her doing it on Nigella Bites, her wouldn't-you-like-to-be-me? slot on Channel 4. The guests arrived in their day clothes and sat in a gallery off the kitchen while Nigella chucked some help-yourself starters at them. There were both men and women present, but the numbers did not quite balance and it was not clear who belonged to whom, if anyone at all. In my home this would have meant that something had gone terribly wrong. In Nigella's it just seemed fresh, pleasant and exactly right for the way we live now. </p> <p>The dinner party qua dinner party is stone cold dead, suffocated by its own formality and pretension. Sometime around 1997 people stopped enjoying the palaver of playing restaurants in their own home. </p> <p>Suzie Carpenter, a 38-year-old fund manager, reckons that in the early to mid-Nineties two of her Saturdays each month were taken up either attending or hosting dinner parties. 'These days,' she says, 'I have nothing to do with either.' Carpenter has a point. There was always something effortful about the whole business of eating food with friends. Inviting eight people to your house for four hours on a Saturday night was as nerve-racking as staging the Mikado for one night only in Regent's Park. What about the costumes and the set? Would people remember their lines? </p> <p>'It was the whole performance element which wore me out in the end,' says Mary Oliver, 36, a publisher, who also doesn't do dinner any more. 'Not just worrying about whether the food was grand enough, but whether the chat was sufficiently clever. I felt as if I was being asked to record an edition of Start the Week in my own dining room. You'd have to book the key guests - the funny, clever, important ones - weeks in advance. Then you had to shuffle your Beta friends - the pretty ones, the good listeners - around them and hope that there was some kind of spark.' </p> <p>And if the spark turned into a house fire, so much the better. Carpenter admits that in the mid-Nineties she did not consider her dinner parties a success unless voices had been raised and tempers roused. 'It didn't really matter if the subject was politics, economics or a new movie, I was trying to create an event. If people spent the whole evening smiling quietly at each other I worried that the proceedings had lapsed into suburban banality.' </p> <p>The fall-back option was to whip up an atmosphere of competitive sexual frankness. 'It became a contest as to who could be the rudest. By the end of the evening you'd have the primmest people claiming to have given blow jobs on the way over. Anything so as not to feel left out.' </p> <p>Not feeling left out was always the main preoccupation of the dinner party guest. 'It was like being part of a therapy group,' remembers Sarah Sanders, 32. 'The roles were established very early in the proceedings. If you didn't leap in right at the beginning, over drinks, and show yourself to be a fun person, a player, then you were doomed to be the one who helped the hostess hand round the dishes. You couldn't get back into the game after the first course was over.' </p> <p>There was a sense, too, of being bound by a contract, all the stricter for being unspoken. As a guest you were expected to bring your particular gift - wit, beauty, kindness - in return for a meal in which your hosts had invested up to \u00a3200 and the whole of Saturday. 'On one occasion the hostess thanked me at the end of the evening for being \"on such great form\",' remembers Carpenter. 'Far from feeling flattered I realised that she'd spent the evening totting up whether I was giving sufficient value for money.' </p> <p>Being expected to sing for your supper is one thing. Being expected to do it over five hours is another. 'Dinner parties went on for too long, it was simple as that,' says Sanders, 'the first two and a half hours were fun, but after that it was like being trapped in an endless and increasingly exhausting repeat. By 11pm I'd used up my sparkle dust and was aching to go home.' </p> <p>There was always the added torture of being stuck next to other people's husbands. You might start off chirpy and charming, nodding away as some man you were never going to meet again talked about telecommunications in eastern Europe (his speciality, naturally, not yours). By the end of the evening you'd have found it impossible to register interest if he'd suddenly announced that he was a KGB colonel. </p> <p>Dinner parties have always flourished when the middle-class felt that it was doing well and wanted everyone to know. Aristocrats and royalty had their banqueting halls and state rooms, those semi-public spaces dedicated to entertaining outsiders. But it wasn't until the nineteenth century that the middle-class family decided to put itself on display by asking other people to come into its private space and watch it performing the everyday task of eating. </p> <p>By playing on the ambiguity that this was how they always ate, complete with the best china and the finest food, the middle-class host and hostess (the job of entertaining having recently switched to women) were making a statement about how much they were worth. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861) , aimed at aspiring middle-class families, thought nothing of suggesting a six-course menu plan for 30 guests which included larded partridges and ginger ice-cream. </p> <p>Dinner parties flourished again from the late Sixties and into the Seventies, when the middle-classes were once again on the up. As in Mrs Beeton's day, social origins were less important than how you performed in the social moment. Chairs from Habitat or a recipe from Elizabeth David went a long way towards erasing the humblest of beginnings. That's why, in the Eighties and Nineties, with the meritocracy of materialism dissolving any remaining class allegiances (what kind of olive oil you served was more important than whether you said 'toilet'), the dinner party once again reigned supreme. </p> <p>'It was about showing off, really,' says Carpenter, 'it was about saying \"look how much I'm worth, socially, financially, culturally.\" And I think, in the end, we all got tired of it'. Certainly, once it got so easy to fake good food - thanks to a library of TV chef cookbooks and the resources of St Michael - there was little point in sweating over a menu plan. Suddenly, trying so hard started to seem not only pointless but pass\u00e9. And then there's the fact that in recent years 'home' has been elevated into a state of mind as well as bricks and mortar. </p> <p>'I look on my home as a kind of sanctuary,' says Sanders, 'and I don't want to turn it into an arena for social display. I don't want it tainted by that kind of competitive vibe. These days the only people who visit me in my domestic space are very close friends and family who genuinely want to talk and listen - and they're happy with a bowl of spaghetti round the kitchen table.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, the economy is booming and people want to play. There are still friendships to be cemented and contacts to be nurtured and, if not at dinner parties, then where? The cocktail party is making a comeback, its drop-in, drop-out format perfectly suited to those who can't bear talking to strangers for more than an hour. It also has the advantage of allowing you to move in on interesting people and shake off bores. And for those occasions when only a proper sit-down dinner will do, the new trend is to follow the Americans and meet friends in a restaurant. That way you split the cost, avoid the washing up and, unless you are Nigella Lawson, the chances are the food will be better than anything you could have made yourself.</p>",

You'd have to book the key guests - the funny, clever, important ones - weeks in advance. Then you had to shuffle your Beta friends - the pretty ones, the good listeners - around them and hope that there was some kind of spark.' And if the spark turned into a house fire, so much the better. Carpenter admits that in the mid-Nineties she did not consider her dinner parties a success unless voices had been raised and tempers roused. 'It didn't really matter if the subject was politics, economics or a new movie, I was trying to create an event. If people spent the whole evening smiling quietly at each other I worried that the proceedings had lapsed into suburban banality.' The fall-back option was to whip up an atmosphere of competitive sexual frankness. 'It became a contest as to who could be the rudest. By the end of the evening you'd have the primmest people claiming to have given blow jobs on the way over. Anything so as not to feel left out.' Not feeling left out was always the main preoccupation of the dinner party guest. 'It was like being part of a therapy group,' remembers Sarah Sanders, 32. 'The roles were established very early in the proceedings. If you didn't leap in right at the beginning, over drinks, and show yourself to be a fun person, a player, then you were doomed to be the one who helped the hostess hand round the dishes. You couldn't get back into the game after the first course was over.' There was a sense, too, of being bound by a contract, all the stricter for being unspoken. As a guest you were expected to bring your particular gift - wit, beauty, kindness - in return for a meal in which your hosts had invested up to \u00a3200 and the whole of Saturday. 'On one occasion the hostess thanked me at the end of the evening for being \"on such great form\",' remembers Carpenter. 'Far from feeling flattered I realised that she'd spent the evening totting up whether I was giving sufficient value for money.' Being expected to sing for your supper is one thing. Being expected to do it over five hours is another. 'Dinner parties went on for too long, it was simple as that,' says Sanders, 'the first two and a half hours were fun, but after that it was like being trapped in an endless and increasingly exhausting repeat. By 11pm I'd used up my sparkle dust and was aching to go home.' There was always the added torture of being stuck next to other people's husbands. You might start off chirpy and charming, nodding away as some man you were never going to meet again talked about telecommunications in eastern Europe (his speciality, naturally, not yours). By the end of the evening you'd have found it impossible to register interest if he'd suddenly announced that he was a KGB colonel. Dinner parties have always flourished when the middle-class felt that it was doing well and wanted everyone to know. Aristocrats and royalty had their banqueting halls and state rooms, those semi-public spaces dedicated to entertaining outsiders. But it wasn't until the nineteenth century that the middle-class family decided to put itself on display by asking other people to come into its private space and watch it performing the everyday task of eating. By playing on the ambiguity that this was how they always ate, complete with the best china and the finest food, the middle-class host and hostess (the job of entertaining having recently switched to women) were making a statement about how much they were worth. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (1861) , aimed at aspiring middle-class families, thought nothing of suggesting a six-course menu plan for 30 guests which included larded partridges and ginger ice-cream. Dinner parties flourished again from the late Sixties and into the Seventies, when the middle-classes were once again on the up. As in Mrs Beeton's day, social origins were less important than how you performed in the social moment. Chairs from Habitat or a recipe from Elizabeth David went a long way towards erasing the humblest of beginnings. That's why, in the Eighties and Nineties, with the meritocracy of materialism dissolving any remaining class allegiances (what kind of olive oil you served was more important than whether you said 'toilet'), the dinner party once again reigned supreme. 'It was about showing off, really,' says Carpenter, 'it was about saying \"look how much I'm worth, socially, financially, culturally.\" And I think, in the end, we all got tired of it'. Certainly, once it got so easy to fake good food - thanks to a library of TV chef cookbooks and the resources of St Michael - there was little point in sweating over a menu plan. Suddenly, trying so hard started to seem not only pointless but pass\u00e9. And then there's the fact that in recent years 'home' has been elevated into a state of mind as well as bricks and mortar. 'I look on my home as a kind of sanctuary,' says Sanders, 'and I don't want to turn it into an arena for social display. I don't want it tainted by that kind of competitive vibe. These days the only people who visit me in my domestic space are very close friends and family who genuinely want to talk and listen - and they're happy with a bowl of spaghetti round the kitchen table.' Nevertheless, the economy is booming and people want to play. There are still friendships to be cemented and contacts to be nurtured and, if not at dinner parties, then where? The cocktail party is making a comeback, its drop-in, drop-out format perfectly suited to those who can't bear talking to strangers for more than an hour. It also has the advantage of allowing you to move in on interesting people and shake off bores. And for those occasions when only a proper sit-down dinner will do, the new trend is to follow the Americans and meet friends in a restaurant. That way you split the cost, avoid the washing up and, unless you are Nigella Lawson, the chances are the food will be better than anything you could have made yourself.",

      "body": "<p>Armistead Maupin lives on a mountain, vertiginously overseeing a city of the plain. The steep height is in San Francisco, and the city beneath his glazed, suspended chalet used to be Sodom. He can glimpse the red span of the Golden Gate Bridge which triumphally subjugates the Pacific, and the pyramidal Transamerica skyscraper which optimistically straddles the San Andreas fault. In the distance is Macondray Lane on Russian Hill, a tunnel of regressive greenery straggling back into the secret garden of our shared childhood: here Maupin located the happy, communal Eden which he calls Barbary Steps in Tales of the City , his six-volume chronicle of frisky San Francisco in the Seventies and Eighties. </p> <p>Tucked away directly below his home, as if secreted in a bodily cleft, is Castro Valley, once the city's gay ghetto, now - as Maupin acidly observes in his new novel The Night Listener - a slick, commercialised 'theme park for homos'. Maupin sometimes ventures down to Castro at lunchtime, passing a juice bar where his name is inscribed on a fresco of queer celebrities, and dodging tour guides who point to him as a mobile monument, like a greying, pudgy statue on leave from his plinth. Then he puffs back up the slope, armed with some food for dinner and a hard-core video for dessert. 'These days,' he told me with a grimace, 'my sex life consists of me and the VCR.' </p> <p>This is the shock of California, where complete strangers insist on being psychologically intimate with you. Maupin is relentlessly 'in your face' even if what he presses into one's face is his private parts. All writers are confidential in print, although most of them turn opaque or evasive when you confront them in person. Not Maupin, whose sense of moral rectitude makes frankness mandatory. 'Sex,' as he commented to me, 'is the last area of human experience where people think it's OK to lie. And when gay people lie about their sexuality, they condemn others - who are oppressed, or maybe sick - to death. This is just who I am. Everything I've ever written is based on something in my life.' Discussing his books, he is only too eager to hand over the key with which you can unlock the roman \u00e0 clef . 'It's my own memories, preserved like dragon-fly in amber,' he said as he looked back on Tales of the City . </p> <p>Maupin grew up in conservative North Carolina: the family's background, and its grimmest, guiltiest secrets, are aired in The Night Listener . He pleased his mother by dating local girls and half-heartedly petting on the way home. He obediently followed his starchy father into the navy. Then, after serving in Vietnam, he moved to San Francisco where - on a timid sortie to a gay bathhouse - he experienced a convulsive sexual awakening. Because sex changed his life, he speaks of it with the zeal of the spiritual convert, to which, when the issue is the oppressive force of hypocrisy, he adds the angry militancy of the political radical. </p> <p>His fiction emerged from a journalistic study of his new home town. In 1977, investigating urban courtship rites, he watched yuppies exchanging molten glances over the papayas in a San Francisco supermarket. His subjects refused to be interviewed, so he turned his report into a short story for a local newspaper. The characters he created - the na\u00efve provincial new arrival Mary Ann, and the gay man she ineffectually targets, Michael Tolliver - were still around in the last volume of the Tales, 13 years later. Maupin's comedy of manners documented what he calls 'the invention of a culture': a social experiment in which people who had fled to San Francisco from their stuffy Midwestern homes, or had been rejected by parents intolerant of their sexual dissidence, assembled new families consisting of friends and transitory bed-partners. 'It was this perfect thing that stopped,' Maupin said, referring both to the Tales and to the society it portrayed. It stopped because he gave up writing the books, but also because the world it described ceased to exist. By the last book, the ingenuous Mary Ann is a glossy, ruthless television personality, and Michael, once happily feckless, is incubating a case of Aids. Paradise has been lost. </p> <p>People loved the Tales because they adhered to an old-fashioned formula, disdained by modernists with their contempt for straightforward storytelling. Maupin revived the Dickensian serial novel, which makes you laugh, makes you cry, and makes you wait for the next episode. Contributing weekly instalments to the San Francisco Chronicle , Maupin devised cliffhanging crises to tease his readers: Hitchcock's Vertigo , that great film about the vertical excitements of hilly San Francisco, is alluded to throughout the Tales (and is even more ingeniously imitated by a plot twist in The Night Listener). As those laughing, crying, breathlessly waiting readers began to talk back to him in letters, he allowed their desires to help dictate the way characters evolved. You could enjoy imaginary dangers because the continuity of the narrative guaranteed safe landings. Is Mary Ann a murderess? Are the night sweats of her adulterous husband Brian a symptom of Aids? No, of course not. This structure, with its tantalising postponements and its cosy pacification of change, effortlessly mutated into soap opera when Channel 4 began filming the Tales . </p> <p>But their success proved burdensome. One sequel after another - More Tales, Further Tales and so on - disputed the very notion that anything, human life included, needed to end. How could Maupin reconcile this with the actuality of a city whose young men were dying in droves? He therefore wound up all those simultaneous stories in Sure of You , published in 1990. Nevertheless, he found that the books 'just wouldn't go away'. He has spent the intervening years producing them for television, consorting with actors who play his dead friends and his own, younger slimmer self. In the third series, filmed this summer, he treats himself to a Hitchcockian walk-on, and can be seen making a nostalgic, unfulfilled exit from a sex club as Michael struts expectantly in. Though his admirers wanted more, he feared facile self-repetition. But would he ever be able to do anything different? In 1993 he wrote Maybe the Moon; also a gauzy fairytale about the dwarf who inhabited E.T.'s rubber suit in Spielberg's film. Now The Night Listener makes a more determined effort to cast off the blithe, breezy manner of the Tales and to start again. Its tale is cruel not kind, and it begins in a chapter of self-accusation by warning us that the storyteller is a congenital liar. </p> <p>Maupin is embarrassed that his readers cherish him as a well-wishing friend, an agony uncle whose job is to solve their problems, just as he neatly extricates the characters in Tales from their predicaments. During our talk he showed me letters moist with confessions and requests for advice. But the emotional needs of all these strangers only make him more aware of his own bereft solitude. Where's the novelist who will devise a happy ending for him? This is the pathos of celebrity: everyone knows you and admires you, but you remain utterly alone. </p> <p>'I do wish I had another person to share this house with,' he said as his cleaner, having made all its vacant surfaces shine, exited with a witticism and a wiggle, (this being San Francisco, the cleaner has enough attitude for an operatic diva). 'Oh, I guess I share the house with Sophie - just like Prince Edward!' Maupin added with a wink. Jokes are his remedy for the sagging, shuffling depression that always seems about to claim him. Sophie is his mongrel. Barefoot, like an odalisque of a certain age in a sweat suit, he arranged himself on a sofa and cuddled her. </p> <p>He then took me through his emotional history during the past decade, which is recapitulated in his rawly autobiographical Night Listener . 'I'm in a happy state,' he conceded, 'but I'm not euphoric. Being in love is the only transcendent experience.' Nowadays he defines himself as a bachelor, though he fully expected to be a widower. For 10 years he lived with Terry Anderson, who doubled as his business partner, managing a literary enterprise which Maupin, with one of his customary double entendres, calls 'our cottage industry'. Anderson was HIV positive since 1986, so Maupin resigned himself to an inevitable loss. But drugs have controlled Anderson's condition, and he now keeps proud count of his multiplying T cells. In 1996 he decided - this, I repeat, is California - that he 'wanted to explore by himself'. He announced his secession by ritually pierc ing his nose and scrotum. Then he donned a new uniform of padlocked leather, and vroomed off on a new motorcycle. The Night Listener retraverses the breach in almost shaming detail. The narrator is a novelist called Gabriel, patently Maupin himself, while his departed lover Jess is self-evidently Terry. All writers resort to imagination to assuage the pain of reality; Maupin coped with the break-up by writing about it. Terry gave me permission. He encouraged me, even though what I wrote was bound to hurt him, then he brain-stormed the book's promotion. So he'll be coming to England with me on the publicity trip, along with his new boyfriend.' </p> <p>Now 56, Maupin is confronting his own sexual superannuation. Since sex has always been the source of his personal identity, his religious gospel and his forthright, up-front political ideology, it has not been easy for him to find himself sidelined - 'past my prime', as he remarked, 'in the gay world'. It's characteristic of his sweet nature, that the experience should have made him more tolerant, rather than bitter. In 1976 he had a brief affair with Rock Hudson, re-enacted in the forthcoming televised Tales. It broke off when the closeted star insisted he remain hidden. In 1985, just before Hudson's death from Aids, Maupin outed him. 'I'm the age now that Rock was when he picked me up, so I can understand how he felt - how his fame limited his freedom. You get kinder as you go along.' That line of thinking might be his salvation. Isn't retirement from the gladiatorial arena of the disco a relief? Aren't there compensations in increasing age? </p> <p>Slowly, grudgingly, Maupin is coming to accept this, as he reveals in one of The Night Listener 's subplots, which concerns Gabriel's reconciliation with his father. The younger Maupin pilloried his father as 'a homophobic old bastard'. In the novel, he denounces this chilly, bigoted monster all over again, then kills him off. Why not? Fiction permits such acts of vengeance. Except that Maupin almost at once, in a postmodern whimsy, brings his father back to life. It is a brave attempt to resolve the psychodrama between them. He swallowed hard before sending an advance copy to Armistead Maupin Senior, aware that its explicitness about Armistead Junior's sexual tastes would be distressing to an 85-year-old man. 'But he called me when I was in Montreal to say it was my finest book and that it made him proud of me. He tells me he loves me all the time now. I risked being honest, and I got a hug - miracle of miracles!' </p> <p>Maupin's benevolent plotting in the Tales often relied on miracles, more or less plausible. Yet in The Night Listener he lays down his wand. Gabriel becomes obsessed with a young fan he's never met, a child infected with Aids by the father who raped him. It's another Dickensian invention: the boy is Maupin's Tiny Tim. But there is no final blessing. Maupin made me promise not to impart the twist in this plot. Let me merely say that, to his credit, the new book - harsher and morally tougher than anything he's written before, without the sentimental fade-outs built into the Tales - concludes ambiguously. </p> <p>'I guess you could describe The Night Listener as one big ad in the personal columns: \"Middle-aged gay writer seeks buddy for fun times\".' There was a poignant truth to this: all writers address themselves to an imaginary friend, who may or may not be game for more than friendship. 'I'm such a gregarious person,' Maupin continued. 'Not long ago my number was in the phone book. When I get back from this book tour, I'm planning to learn the internet. Maybe I can hook up in cyberspace. There's gotta be someone out there!' </p> <p>Later in the day, having descended the mountain, I thought of him up there in his eyrie, making the best of a solitary sunset and a consolatory video.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Regular readers of these pages might remember that we have already featured the interior of Wayne Hemingway's family home in Sussex. His wife, Gerardine, designed the house, which was built from scratch and includes a huge open-plan living space on the top floor, complete with a climbing wall for the couple's three children to play on. The house is a cross between a chic, sleek, architect's home and a playhouse. The name on the gate reads simply, 'home'. </p> <p>The house featured on these pages is Gerardine Hemingway's latest creation. It's called 'workplace' and - as the name suggests - is not a second home but the couple's London HQ and office. Most of the time, the couple commute to and from it, getting home in time for tea with the children, although there are bedrooms where they can stay the night. From the outside, it looks like a typical 1919 suburban semi in Wembley, north London. But, as is often the case with the Hemingways, what you see is not what you get. </p> <p>The couple bought the house 13 years ago, when they were developing their business Red or Dead. The company's head office is still nearby. When business took off, they moved out to the country, but kept the house. Last year, however, Hemingway sold 75 per cent of his Red or Dead shares to the Pentland Group, taking on a new role as non-executive chairman, and leaving him free to pursue other areas of his work. The prankster designer with an insatiable appetite for fun and games on the catwalk has, it seems, finally grown up. </p> <p>'At 39, you can't really preach to the youth,' he says. 'Red or Dead will always be a young label. We just felt we needed a new challenge in life.' The couple have gone back to square one, working together again, just the two of them, plotting new ideas, new designs, and hatching plans that they hope will make a difference to someone, somewhere. It soon transpires, however, that the thoroughly modern new workplace is still a playground for Wayne. It's just that the toys have got more sophisticated. 'I've got really good with technology,' he explains. And behind the fa\u00e7ade of the chic-chi modern day home, the place is buzzing with hi-tech gadgets, computers, modem cables and DVD players. It might look homely, but the Hemingway workplace is seriously wired for business. 'We wanted this house to be really efficient,' says Wayne. 'So far it hasn't felt like we've been at work. The novelty still hasn't worn off.' </p> <p>Certainly, 'workplace' is quite a novelty. Downstairs, there is a library which houses his complete collection of orginal Nova magazines, an office area with PCs (Hemingway hates i-Macs), a lounge area, a state-of-the-art kitchen with an amazing round, free-standing unit, and a huge round table with a hot-plate centrepiece where guests are treated to DIY 'cook-on-table' lunches. The Hemingway children recently used the place for a birthday party and couldn't get enough of the sizzling chunks of meat, fish and dipping sauces.</p> <p>After dinner, they were treated to a DVD extravaganza in the audio visual room, where DVDs are projected on to the wall. The room also has a serious side; it can be used to show clients images from MP3, and for business presentations. Wayne changes the disc from a loop of photographic prints courtesy, of the on-line gallery Eye Storm, to show me his latest project. It's a book, Just Above the Mantelpiece, to be published next month by Booth-Clibborn Editions. It uncovers one of his greatest passions - his beloved collection of mass-produced art. </p> <p>There is something quite surreal about seeing a 1970s' picture of a boy with huge saucer eyes staring out from thousands of pounds-worth of cutting-edge equipment. But, of course, it is very Hemingway. He likes to stretch the boundaries of taste - both good and bad. The book features a flocked cover, and traces the stories of some of the most prolific and popular artists of the 20th century, from Tretchikoff, who painted The Green Lady , to the numerous, sometimes (understandably) anonymous, artists responsible for The Crying Boy . </p> <p>Wayne's collection of kitsch art, 70s fantasy paintings and bizarre 3-D pieces that look like fluffy gonks flattened on to a canvas, is a world apart from the cool interior of Gerardine's vision of 'workplace'. The only trace of his taste in art hangs in the garden room. Hanging above the functional sofas (Gerardine's designs) are some fine examples of string art. But in the true spirit of string art, Gerardine made hers herself. They are large, abstract and surprisingly modern-looking - in keeping with her bright but minimal decoration. This, and the images projected on to the cinema screen, is her only concession to Wayne's taste in pictures. His collection has been banished to one of the rooms upstairs. </p> <p>Welcome to Wayne's room, a place where he can feel truly at home with his ship cocktail bar and his Spanish seaside wicker ponies. It's a small room and every available millimetre of space has been crammed with his art collection. Eyes follow you round the room wherever you look. Big, soppy Bambi eyes, brimming with tears. They even stare down at you from the ceiling, where Wayne started to hang them when he ran out of wall space. He's been collecting them for as long as he can remember, and still can't resist haggling over them at car boot sales.</p> <p>In his book, which features many of his own masterpieces (as well as others belonging to Charles Saatchi), photographed framed against garish floral and flock wallpapers, he writes: 'It is not clear who painted the first crying child, but mass-marketed artists such as Dallas Simpson, Anna Zinkeisen and Irene Spencer all grasped the concept that sad eyes cry. I'm not clear why tens of thousands should want something as sorrowful as a child in distress peering down from the living-room wall, but there is no doubting the haunting quality of some of the works.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wayne feels strangely at home in his gallery, with art-laden walls not dissimilar to those he remembers growing up in as a lad in his grandmother's house in Morecambe. Ida Hemingway was, he says, 'an appreciator and collector of mass-market masterpieces'. She picked them up from Freemans catalogues and Argos, and over the years the collection spread from her chimney breast to the rest of the house. Little Wayne was transfixed by it, as big Wayne still is. </p> <p>Outside, in the lush green garden, there is a business meeting going on. Gerardine is getting together with associates from Milliken carpets, the company that has just manfactured her first designs for carpet tiles. The oversized polkadots scattered randomly across the floor are the first thing that hits you as you walk through the door. You would never know they were carpet tiles. The dots are just one of a series of designs that includes trompe l'oeil concrete and denim, designed for industrial use or for warehouse apartments with acres of space. </p> <p>Back in the kitchen, Wayne is telling me his plans for the future. 'I can't imagine ever doing the six-month treadmill of the fashion show,' he says. 'We're more creative at the moment than we've ever been. It's great being back to just us two again talking about ideas and exciting concepts rather than money, legal registrations and shows.'</p> <p>As well as his work on The Big Breakfast , and his work consulting for a major British high-street menswear label, he says that what he'd really like to do is to get involved with a company like Wimpy or Barratt. 'They can't get away from the three-up, three-down box with a pointed roof. They build consistently boring houses and they are always looking backwards. And it's not all down to cost.' He would love to get his hands on a residential estate and breathe some Hemingway magic into it. But there's no guarantee that every house - however innovative and forward-looking - wouldn't come with a Tretchikoff just above the mantel.</p>",

      "body": "<b> Marigold </b> <p>These flowers have a long history of cultivation, probably because they are prolific, floriferous and have many medicinal and culinary uses. In the kitchen, marigolds were used as a cheap substitute for saffron. In the Middle Ages, marigolds were deemed to be useful as a treatment for insect and snake bites. When taken internally they were said to have healing properties for the intestine and liver. </p> <p> Soil conditions: grows best in poor soil. Situate: in sun or light shade. Propagation: sow directly in the garden in spring, then again in summer. Will self-seed readily. Resilience: hardy annual. Care: watch out for greenfly. </p> <p> <b> Clematis </b></p> <p>The first foreign species arrived from Spain in 1569, and the opening up of the Far East - Japan was effectively closed to the West until the mid-19th century - created a frenzy of plant collecting, with many species arriving from Korea, China and Japan. The clematis thrives in mixed company. It will grow in pots if the roots are kept cool by under planting, but it comes into its own as it adorns vertical structures, walkways and trees. </p> <p> Flowering season: different varieties flower through the season. Soil conditions: rich free-draining soil. Situate: in full sunlight or partial shade, but protect the roots from the sun. Propagation: sow seed when ripe under glass - it won't always come true. Layering is an easier way to increase stocks. Resilience: hardy-to-slightly frost-prone. Care: support young plants until they are established. Mulch with well-rotted manure or compost in winter. Prune late-flowering clematis in winter for maximum flowers. Others need little pruning except to shape. Wilt - caused by a fungus - affects large-flowered clematis. Planting them deeply encourages extra shoots, to increase chances of survival. </p> <p> <b> Cosmos </b></p> <p>Surprisingly resilient for a plant of such apparent fragility, it seems entirely appropriate that its name comes from the Greek Kosmos , meaning beautiful. The plants are relatively new to the gardens of Europe. Cosmos astrosanguineus arrived in Britain in 1835 when William Thompson of Ipswich had seeds sent to him from Mexico. It is a perennial that bears blooms of the deepest brownish-maroon from mid-summer onwards, smelling, astonishingly of chocolate. </p> <p> Flowering season: all summer into autumn. Soil conditions: rich, moist soil that is free draining. Situate: in full sunshine. Propagation: if grown in pots, sow in early spring; late spring, sow directly in the garden. Resilience: hardy and semi-hardy species. Care: deadhead for a longer flowering season, leaving some to self-seed. Aphids and slugs love them. Lift half-hardy perennials in frost-prone areas. </p> <p> <b> Montbretia </b></p> <p>Crocosmia takes its name from the Greek krokos , meaning saffron, and osme , smell. Intriguingly, the flowers have no scent when growing, but dried and subsequently steeped in water they develop the perfume of the crocus. Modern montbretias are derived from two closely related plants, tritonia and crocosmia, both native to South Africa. </p> <p> Flowering season: all summer to autumn. Soil conditions: humus-enriched soil that drains freely. Situate: either in full sunlight or some shade. Propagation: sow ripe seed in pots under glass. Lift and divide established clumps in spring. Resilience: hardy except with prolonged frost. Care: protect with a mulch in the first winter of growth and also if there is a continuing frost. Watch out for spider mites. </p> <p> <b> Cyclamen </b></p> <p>The name cyclamen comes from the Greek word for circle, kuklos , and the ancient Greeks knew it as chelonion , or little tortoise, to which they likened its corm. Over the centuries, the cyclamen has had many medicinal applications. The Greek philosopher Theophrastus suggested using it to heal wounds and boils. During the Renaissance, when it was believed that like healed like, the ear-shaped leaves of the plant were supposed to indicate that it could cure earache. In England, in the late 16th century, cyclamen was used to induce childbirth, it was deemed so potent that pregnant women were advised to avoid it at all costs, until needed. </p> <p> Flowering season: all year, depending on species. </p> <p>Soil conditions: fairly rich soil with high humus content that drains freely.

      "bodyText": "Marigold These flowers have a long history of cultivation, probably because they are prolific, floriferous and have many medicinal and culinary uses. In the kitchen, marigolds were used as a cheap substitute for saffron. In the Middle Ages, marigolds were deemed to be useful as a treatment for insect and snake bites. When taken internally they were said to have healing properties for the intestine and liver. Soil conditions: grows best in poor soil. Situate: in sun or light shade. Propagation: sow directly in the garden in spring, then again in summer. Will self-seed readily. Resilience: hardy annual. Care: watch out for greenfly. Clematis The first foreign species arrived from Spain in 1569, and the opening up of the Far East - Japan was effectively closed to the West until the mid-19th century - created a frenzy of plant collecting, with many species arriving from Korea, China and Japan. The clematis thrives in mixed company. It will grow in pots if the roots are kept cool by under planting, but it comes into its own as it adorns vertical structures, walkways and trees. Flowering season: different varieties flower through the season. Soil conditions: rich free-draining soil. Situate: in full sunlight or partial shade, but protect the roots from the sun. Propagation: sow seed when ripe under glass - it won't always come true. Layering is an easier way to increase stocks. Resilience: hardy-to-slightly frost-prone. Care: support young plants until they are established. Mulch with well-rotted manure or compost in winter. Prune late-flowering clematis in winter for maximum flowers. Others need little pruning except to shape. Wilt - caused by a fungus - affects large-flowered clematis. Planting them deeply encourages extra shoots, to increase chances of survival. Cosmos Surprisingly resilient for a plant of such apparent fragility, it seems entirely appropriate that its name comes from the Greek Kosmos , meaning beautiful. The plants are relatively new to the gardens of Europe. Cosmos astrosanguineus arrived in Britain in 1835 when William Thompson of Ipswich had seeds sent to him from Mexico. It is a perennial that bears blooms of the deepest brownish-maroon from mid-summer onwards, smelling, astonishingly of chocolate. Flowering season: all summer into autumn. Soil conditions: rich, moist soil that is free draining. Situate: in full sunshine. Propagation: if grown in pots, sow in early spring; late spring, sow directly in the garden. Resilience: hardy and semi-hardy species. Care: deadhead for a longer flowering season, leaving some to self-seed. Aphids and slugs love them. Lift half-hardy perennials in frost-prone areas. Montbretia Crocosmia takes its name from the Greek krokos , meaning saffron, and osme , smell. Intriguingly, the flowers have no scent when growing, but dried and subsequently steeped in water they develop the perfume of the crocus. Modern montbretias are derived from two closely related plants, tritonia and crocosmia, both native to South Africa. Flowering season: all summer to autumn. Soil conditions: humus-enriched soil that drains freely. Situate: either in full sunlight or some shade. Propagation: sow ripe seed in pots under glass. Lift and divide established clumps in spring. Resilience: hardy except with prolonged frost. Care: protect with a mulch in the first winter of growth and also if there is a continuing frost. Watch out for spider mites. Cyclamen The name cyclamen comes from the Greek word for circle, kuklos , and the ancient Greeks knew it as chelonion , or little tortoise, to which they likened its corm. Over the centuries, the cyclamen has had many medicinal applications. The Greek philosopher Theophrastus suggested using it to heal wounds and boils. During the Renaissance, when it was believed that like healed like, the ear-shaped leaves of the plant were supposed to indicate that it could cure earache. In England, in the late 16th century, cyclamen was used to induce childbirth, it was deemed so potent that pregnant women were advised to avoid it at all costs, until needed. Flowering season: all year, depending on species. Soil conditions: fairly rich soil with high humus content that drains freely. Situate: in dappled shade. Propagation: soak ripe seeds for 12 hours before sowing. Keep in dark until germinated. Resilience: most are hardy, except for pot plants. Care: outdoors mulch each year with leaf mould when leaves have died back. Pot plants need a cool draught-free spot. Water them from below and feed sparingly with a liquid low-nitrogen feed. Globe artichoke The Ancient Egyptians were the first to cultivate the globe artichoke, the Arabs introduced it to Spain and Italy in the 15th century, and by the 16th century, it was being grown in France and England. Medicinally, the plant is thought to be beneficial for the liver and kidneys. The most effective parts of the plant are said to be the leaves and roots. Flowering season: summer through to autumn.

Resilience: hardy, but give extra protection from frost. Care: in winter protect roots with a dry mulch. Watch out for aphids and slugs, which adore them.

The Spanish sent them back to the Old World, but they weren't immediately popular - opinions differed on their flavour and their palatability. Dahlias finally began to be appreciated for their flowers in Europe in the late-18th century.

      "body": "<p><strong> Zo\u00eb Robinson: </strong> I was driving home from work as I always do in my Ford Fiesta and coming up a hill about five minutes from my home in Althorne, Essex. Over the crest of the hill was a delivery van coming the other way on my side of the road. We were both doing 45mph, so we had a head-on crash at 90mph. This was May last year. </p> <p>I haven't got any memory from about two weeks before my accident until after I came out of a coma three weeks later. I'm told the other driver was only bruised while I was unconscious in the car. When the air ambulance got there, Barry smashed the back window with his hand to get to me quickly. He then held my airway open for 40 minutes to prevent me choking on my blood and my vomit. Barry says my jaw was like jelly, it had been broken in three places, and I had a big hole in my cheek. Apparently, I was going through my 'golden hour', which meant they had only an hour to save me. When they freed me from the car and flew me to Colchester, I was only minutes from dying. </p> <p>As well as a serious head injury, I broke my right femur, had a big gouge taken out of my right leg, broke my hand, had to have stitches in every finger and my nails were ripped off. But still I feel so lucky to be alive. </p> <p>Recovery has been a very slow process. It's taken months of physiotherapy and I'm still in and out of hospital. I was a hairdresser and I don't know whether I'll ever be able to go back to the salon because I can't stand for long. </p> <p>Barry doesn't usually keep in touch with people he rescues. I sent him and the crew a card thanking them for what they'd done for me, which started the friendship. It was then several months before I was able to meet Barry in person. I just looked at him and thought, that man has saved my life. He gave me some flowers and we got on brilliantly from the start. Since the accident, I haven't been able to cry - I thought I was going to the day I saw Barry, but I didn't. It was emotional inside, though. </p> <p>The accident happened three days after my 21st birthday and I couldn't remember anything of it. So Barry arranged a huge party for my 22nd birthday, with a marquee at the back of my house, a DJ and a cake in the shape of a helicopter. I can't believe he saved my life and was prepared to do all this for me. </p> <p> <strong> Barry Fogg: </strong> We were sitting at the airbase. It was a quietish day and the phone went off with an emergency call. We checked the maps and set off two minutes later. It was a really nasty accident. The front of the car had been pushed right up towards the steering wheel. I said to my colleague, the person in that car is going to be very lucky to survive. We landed five minutes after getting the call. We saw that Zo\u00eb had been submarined from the seat down into the foot well. She had a serious head injury and was choking on her own blood. </p> <p>The main priority was to help her breathe. We couldn't open the car doors, so I climbed through the back window and got behind the driver's seat. The left side of her jaw wasn't there, it was like a bag of jelly. I tilted her head back and opened the airway enough to suck the blood out and clear it. I was doing that while the fire service was busy trying to cut the roof off. I kept thinking how young she was. We finally got her out and into the helicopter, seven minutes later we were at Colchester Hospital, with just minutes to spare. </p> <p>It's not until after the job that your emotions come back. In 14 years, this was one of the worst accidents I've seen. The crew and I sat around analysing things, checking we did all we could. That's our form of counselling. That evening I remember coming home and talking to my wife about it. When I went to bed that night, she was woken by me dreaming that I was choking, gagging, reliving the accident as though I was Zo\u00eb. This was very unusual - I've never had such a connection with a patient before. </p> <p>Working for the ambulance service you become hardened. Your sense of humour changes, too. We'll crack jokes about things that aren't funny to most. It's our way of coping with death. For some reason, with Zo\u00eb, it was different. I wasn't so detached. For weeks after, I kept phoning the hospital to check on her. To hear she'd survived and made such progress was phenomenal. </p> <p>The day we met, I didn't recognise her at first. In the accident, she looked a complete mess. It was an emotional meeting. To say the bottom lip was quivering was an understatement. We've since become close friends. We meet up at fundraising events, I play golf with her dad, her mum rings up for a chat. My young twins have got to know her and there have been tears at bedtime explaining to them what happened. </p> <p>Zo\u00eb's bubbly and outgoing, a breath of fresh air to be around. It seems she's been given another crack at life and she's taking it with both hands.</p>",

This was very unusual - I've never had such a connection with a patient before. Working for the ambulance service you become hardened. Your sense of humour changes, too. We'll crack jokes about things that aren't funny to most. It's our way of coping with death. For some reason, with Zo\u00eb, it was different. I wasn't so detached. For weeks after, I kept phoning the hospital to check on her. To hear she'd survived and made such progress was phenomenal. The day we met, I didn't recognise her at first. In the accident, she looked a complete mess. It was an emotional meeting. To say the bottom lip was quivering was an understatement. We've since become close friends. We meet up at fundraising events, I play golf with her dad, her mum rings up for a chat. My young twins have got to know her and there have been tears at bedtime explaining to them what happened. Zo\u00eb's bubbly and outgoing, a breath of fresh air to be around. It seems she's been given another crack at life and she's taking it with both hands.",

      "body": "<p>The attention to aesthetic detail starts at the gates, where leaves of hammered silver weave in and out of the Victorian wrought-iron work. Inside the converted church, colour lifts the spirit and the sumptuous spangled light from the stained-glass windows calms the senses. Inside, there's a water feature to keep the chi flowing and a Tree of Life mural with enamel flowers along its stem to represent the chakras. These features, along with the curved walls and ceilings, have been installed under guidance from a feng shui master to promote good relationships, growth and health.</p> <p>The traffic outside bustles noisily along Fulham Broadway. But inside, plumped into comfy sofas are small groups of women who chat or sit alone, reading leisurely. All is serene and reassuring. It is like a gentlewoman's club for the New Age. But this is the Haven Trust; a drop-in daycare centre which offers complementary therapies to women (and their partners and families) who have breast cancer. Reiki, singing and yoga classes are all on the agenda, along with emotional advice and counselling.</p> <p>The Haven Trust was the brainchild of Sara Davenport, 37. Five years ago, her friend, Wendy Ricketts, was informed that she had breast cancer, and sent home alone to an empty house. Davenport was shocked to find out that she had been offered no emotional support at the time of diagnosis or during her treatment. 'It shouldn't be that way,' says Davenport. 'No woman should have to face cancer alone.' With that in mind, she sold her art-dealing business and ploughed a large sum of her own money into buying a deconsecrated church and then began building a team to raise funds for its conversion. Restoration of the former Welsh Presbyterian church and drama college cost \u00a3650,000.</p> <p>Wendy's breast-cancer treatment was a success, but she would definitely have benefited from the emotional support and therapies that the Haven is now offering, importantly, without the need for a referral from your doctor or specialist. In the main therapy rooms, various classes take place, such as yoga, art therapy and hands-on healing. Apart from being able to just drop in at the centre, it was also vital to Davenport that the Haven's services would be entirely free. The centre boasts five full-time healthcare professionals and 15 part-time and voluntary therapists, plus a seven-member fund-raising and administrative team.</p> <p>Since opening in February this year, the Haven has registered 2,000 visits. It is a drop-in centre that defies the term's common meaning in its attention to aesthetic beauty and the ethos that the environment is integral to one's health. And looks do matter. Davenport explains: 'I've always believed the environment is key to our wellbeing and strength of spirit. You walk into some NHS hospitals and think, \"I may never survive this place because of all the horrible grey walls.\" So we always wanted to create a beautiful space.'</p> <p>That the centre exists reflects a general attitudinal shift to a more positive and proactive approach to our health, a willingness to take more responsibility for our own personal wellbeing. Similarly, Theresa Hale, founder of the Hale Clinic, London's foremost private centre for complementary medicine, has also noticed a shift in the medical profession's attitude to complementary therapies. 'I think doctors have realised that they don't necessarily have all the answers. Scientific research is still key, but it must also be acknowledged that there are many issues around the effect of emotions on the body. If a person says a complementary therapy helped them, a doctor may say it's just a placebo. But so what? If a placebo can medically simulate the body's natural healing process, isn't that good?'</p> <p>Caroline Stevensen, director of services at the Haven Trust, says that nurses and therapists work in harmony with patients' specialists, and the centre may go some way to filling a gap left by an overstretched NHS. 'We are offering whatever support people might need - physical, mental or spiritual - outside the hospital environment. One of the best effects of these therapies is how they can help with some of the side-effects of conventional cancer treatment.</p> <p>For example, the tiredness, hot flushes, nausea and depression.' Stevensen says that those affected by breast cancer have to deal with special emotional issues. 'If you have a mastectomy or breast reconstruction, for example, it is slightly different to having a cancer where you've got a scar, but for all intents and purposes, it doesn't show. With breast cancer, there are a lot of issues around body image and femininity, mutilation, aspects of how they feel as a woman, as well as how their partners cope with it.' One of the psychotherapists, an ex-Relate counsellor, is on hand to talk to couples about these issues, as well as the children of those affected.</p> <p>Pam Morrow, 56, is single and lives in Chiswick. She is a freelance consultant in corporate communications, and was lying in bed one weekend when she discovered a lump in her breast. 'It was hard and small, like a pea. I hadn't been great at examining my breasts but when I found the lump, I acted quickly and went straight to my GP.' She was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of April 1999. Doctors at Charing Cross Hospital found the lump malignant but containable. She had a lumpectomy and as a precaution had the lymph nodes removed, followed by six weeks of radiotherapy.</p> <p>'During radiotherapy, the side-effects build up,' says Morrow. 'The skin becomes very tender and you're warned to be careful of the whole area, and to avoid blistering. Mostly I felt extremely tired. I wasn't prepared for that level of tiredness.' She also developed oedoema (swelling) of the breast, a condition that affects 60 per cent of women with breast cancer. 'My breasts swelled up and my bra size went from a D-cup to an F. My consultant said the swelling would go but couldn't say when. The skin was so stretched it looked like a balloon about to burst. And it was uncomfortable and painful.'</p> <p>Although Morrow was treated at Charing Cross Hospital, which has one of the foremost complementary cancer units, she ended her treatment unaware of the Haven Trust but came across an article about its facilities and felt new hope. 'When I eventually called I heard a welcoming voice. The woman said they were sure they could help me, and when could I come in. She rang back in 20 minutes with an appointment time. I thought, \"Fantastic. Someone out there is listening.\"'</p> <p>Morrow was seen by nurse Trudi Coyne. 'She was very understanding. We talked through my medical history, including my sleep patterns and energy levels, and she suggested therapies that might suit and that I should see the lymphoedema nurse.' To combat the debilitating lethargy, the nurse suggested she should try Reiki, a type of hands-on healing. 'At the first session,' Morrow recalls, 'the therapist put her hands on my head. I sensed an energy running down my arms that flowed back again. I went in feeling like a limp lettuce and I came out feeling... well, I bounced out.'</p> <p>Morrow feels she's been helped to take a more pro-active approach to her health care generally. She was assessed by a nutritionist at the Haven. 'My diet has improved a lot.' She also had three weeks of lymphatic drainage, a gentle massage to help reduce the breast swelling. 'I've also learned how to do the drainage for myself each day, so I can just go in once a fortnight for maintenance. I've always been interested in complementary care, but the Haven has opened my eyes to the value of a holistic approach to health.' They also offered Morrow valuable emotional support.</p> <p>'My friends have been fantastic, and some have tried desperately to understand what it must be like to have cancer. But with the best intentions, they haven't experienced it. People don't talk about breast cancer, not in real life. Even if you meet someone who's had it, they don't want to tell you what's really involved. So after my first visit to the Haven, I walked down the street crying tears of gratitude. I felt an enormous burden had been lifted, as if someone else was shouldering some of the responsibility for my health.'</p> <p>Recently, there has been a mini 'breast-cancer backlash' against the upcoming October Awareness Month and the charities, which are considered by some to be feted for their fashionability. Michael Baum, professor of surgery at University College and Middlesex hospitals, even called for a 'breast-cancer unawareness month' to 'desensitise the public to panic and hysteria'. Caroline Stevensen simply refers to the bare statistics: 'Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women aged 35 to 54. There are about 30,000 new cases each year in the UK. And the oft-quoted statistic about one in 12 women being affected by the disease at some stage in their life has just gone up to one in 11.'</p> <p>In September, the Haven Trust will have an open day for GPs, surgeons and breast-care workers 'so that we are actively connecting'. Then there will be counselling groups for men whose partner or loved one has breast cancer. There are also plans for a cr\u00e8che, a shop selling books, relaxation tapes, wigs, swimsuits, and Look Good, Feel Better sessions offering hair, beauty and fashion advice. The Trust already has the active support of celebrities such as Trevor McDonald, Anthea Turner and Bryan Adams, who last May auctioned his photographs, including those of Kate Moss, Liz Hurley and the Duchess of Kent, raising \u00a3140,000.

Amanda Graham, co-owner of the restaurant Ostlers Close, (25 Bonnygate, Cupar, Fife, 01334 655 574), despairs when her husband Jimmy is out picking again. But wild mushrooms are abundant in Scotland (chanterelles in particular favour foggy places near the coast) and Jimmy's culinary inventions with fungi have been acclaimed in The Good Food Guide . His menus feature lobster with chanterelles and a saffron sauce, saddle of roe deer and wood pigeon with wild mushrooms and, for vegetarians, stir-fry mushrooms with oriental flavoured Puy lentils.",

At one level, 'breakdown' is one of those words that operates as shorthand; many of us routinely refer to being on the verge of a breakdown when we want to convey just how put upon, stressed and pressurised we are, without really meaning it at all. </p> <p>At a deeper level, though, a nervous breakdown is generally understood to describe a crisis situation; when someone has reached rock bottom and 'broken', in as much as they have ceased to function in a normal way. The details are more difficult - how a breakdown happens, why, and who it is likely to happen to are harder to pin down.</p> <p>There is no textbook experience, as Dr David Bell, consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist at the Tavistock Centre, confirms. 'Breakdown is a general term that people use to describe a very, very wide variety of experiences.' Still, he feels it is an 'appropriate' word. 'It captures something of the experience,' he says. Despite the fact that, as Dr Massimo Riccio, consultant psychiatrist and medical director of The Priory in Roehampton, points out: 'There isn't really any such thing in medical terms - saying someone has had a breakdown means everything and nothing, and we need a lot more information to fine-tune a diagnosis and make it manageable.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, it is a helpful description for the layman. According to a study earlier this year, more than a quarter of Americans (26 per cent) say they have felt on the verge of a mental breakdown (relationship problems and being a single parent were most often cited as the cause). The study, by a psychologist at Indiana University, represents an increase of 7 per cent since the last similar study 40 years ago, which may not mean that any more of us are suffering from major depressive episodes, just that more of us are willing to admit it's a possibility. Whatever 'it' is. </p> <p>The most common kind of breakdown, according to Dr Philip Timms, a consultant psychiatrist with the South London and Maudsley Trust, is someone developing moderately severe depression, normally over a period of weeks. 'A person would begin to feel more on edge, find it more difficult to sleep, find themselves thinking more negatively about themselves, feel increasingly hopeless and incompetent about what they're doing, and then there comes a day when they just can't face going to work, or getting out of bed, perhaps. Breakdown occurs if a depressive episode is not dealt with - it builds up and it's part of a process.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart, 37, suffered a breakdown last year. He now sees work-related stress as the catalyst. 'Increasingly, I couldn't cope with the pressure. Twelve months to a year before the breakdown, I was having symptoms. I started getting tired, when before I wasn't, unable to deal with stresses that I used to. At that stage, it was a very physical thing that attacked my immune system. I got colds that lingered and lingered and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). I was always tired. Depressive tiredness is different - you can't cure it through sleep, so you wake up more tired than when you went to bed. </p> <p>'Then I started having panic attacks. I couldn't go into shops because I couldn't stand fluorescent lights or the other people wandering around supermarkets. Getting to work became a nightmare - I couldn't get on the Tube. I felt so run-down I wasn't able to cope with even the basics. I became agoraphobic and more panicky. This is the stage where you should seek help, but I didn't.' </p> <p>Eventually Ewart did go and see his doctor, who told him to take time off work. 'I took two weeks off and just lay in bed. After the two weeks, I still felt bloody awful, but I went back to work and by Monday afternoon I knew it hadn't worked; I was completely unable to handle anything and I had very strange feelings of unreality. I was looking at the office as though I wasn't part of it; I was panicky, shaky and absolutely full of anxiety.' </p> <p>David Bell says that anxiety is central to all breakdown experiences - 'anxiety that has become unmanageable. When you feel anxiety mixed with depression, the result is often terrible vulnerability - people describe being in a room and feeling that others can see right through them. In fact, their boundaries have gone. The ordinary boundaries that keep them functioning.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart stopped functioning after leaving his job and then - temporarily - leaving his partner and son to go and stay in a hotel. 'I still thought I could cure myself, that it was all work related and that I just needed some peace, to cut myself off from everything. But while I was at the hotel I realised how desperate I was; I went to bed and couldn't move because I was absolutely terrified, I felt physically paralysed. I lay like that for two days - I'd try to get out of bed, but my breathing was all over the place, I'd been on the edge for so long. Luckily, I think I knew something of what was happening - when I was 11 years old, I'd read an account of a nervous breakdown, a very dated book now, but nevertheless I was aware. It was hell, though, the worst my life had ever been, and I thought I was dying. Then, at 5am, I managed to move and go home. By 9am, I was at my doctor's, who prescribed an antidepressant called Lustral as well as therapy.' </p> <p>Ewart's breakdown - a collapse in social roles, if you like - is one way to break down; another, according to Oliver James, consultant psychologist and author of Britain on the Couch , 'concerns the question of whether there has been a fissure - a break - in your sense of reality'. In fact, according to James, 'a lot of psychoanalytically minded people would want to introduce that element and say, \"It's not really a breakdown unless the person has actually 'lost the plot', to put it in to ordinary language\" - ie, started to think things are true that are manifestly not true. In other words, the person has become delusional.' </p> <p>Sarah, now 52, has suffered psychotic breakdown on several occasions, that is, she became delusional. 'The first episode was to do with romantic, unrequited love, but also to do with being made homeless at the same time. I was 28. I'd been in a stable relationship for a long time, which I think might have protected me. When it finished, I wasn't able to deal with it, so I latched on to something else. I was delusional and thought that I was in love with somebody and that he was in love with me. </p> <p>'The outward signs of this were that for a while I became a bit manic - I had a kind of heightened energy. But then, when it seemed obvious that the person I'd fixated on wasn't in love with me, I kind of thought, \"Now what happens?\" and became a hypochondriac and thought I was dying. </p> <p>'I also had other delusions that I was an alien; it was quite full-blown psychosis. I could hold a conversation. I carried on, but in the back of mind I'd think, \"Well, actually, I'm an alien.\" The episode didn't last long... several days, or something.' </p> <p>Sarah was treated by a psychiatrist. 'A friend contacted my parents when I thought I was dying and they took me away to see a psychiatrist who gave me anti-psychotic medication, which worked very quickly. It happened again, but in a slightly milder way, about a year later. I think it was when somebody was leaving me and I was also leaving a job, albeit voluntarily. The main symptom was that I thought I was dying again, dying of Aids, which wasn't totally irrational because I'd had a relationship with a bisexual man, but I'd had an Aids test which was negative. The fear might be rational, but what is irrational is the extent to which you feel it. I'd had an Aids test, so why was I still afraid? The last time I was properly delusional and thought I was dying was about eight years ago, when I was evicted from a flat - it's always at times of intense stress.' </p> <p> David Bell feels it is important to see psychotic breakdown as distinct from our normal understanding of a breakdown. 'Psychotic breakdown is obviously different, but isn't always schizophrenia. There are many types of psychotic breakdown, but people tend to have altered experiences defined by losing touch with reality - having delusions and hallucinations and other strange experiences, like travelling on the bus and not thinking, \"I hate it because I think they're looking at me\" but \"They are looking at me.\"' </p> <p>Key to understanding any sort of breakdown is understanding 'why'. Why Ian? Why Sarah? Broadly speaking, experts agree that breakdowns are caused by interaction of the external and internal. Massimo Riccio says that with mental illness, there is always a catalyst. 'Research shows that any mental-health problem is, normally speaking, associated with a life event - the extent to which this event will cause a mental-health problem will vary according to the individual's internal coping mechanism.' </p> <p>In other words, there is an interaction between internal vulnerability and an external event. In fact, according to consultant psychiatrist Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, 'All breakdowns are a function of three interacting factors: genetic vulnerability - what you're born with; then the way you've lived your life - your emotional robustness, and then an interacting event.' Bell feels that given the right - or wrong - set of circumstances, any one of us might break down. 'All of us have our weak spots, our areas of vulnerability that are laid down early in life. If you know your area of vulnerability, you might accept and acknowledge it, but some of us might find our weakness intolerable and try to avoid it.</p> <p>Some of the ways we cope with anxieties are positive and developmental, but others impose a restriction on our personality because they're rather rigid defences. For example, a person might dread vulnerability and so pretend to their partner that they're self sufficient - in other words, they're always acting. This would make them a very controlling person, so when a girlfriend or boyfriend leaves, in addition to the ordinary feelings any of us have, they might feel out of control, overwhelmed with anxiety and vulnerability, and they might break down.' </p> <p>Sarah sees her breakdowns as 'a mixture of circumstance and genetics combined with a highly strung and nervous person; I was weak and also immature - give another person the same stress I had, and I think they would have dealt with it.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart, meanwhile, has traced the seeds of his breakdown directly to childhood. 'I wanted to blame work, but I'd had other depressive episodes before this one. The fact is I'd had a crap upbringing. I always wanted to do creative things, but my father encouraged me into jobs in offices, and because he was a well-known solicitor I was under his shadow. What I really wanted to be was a writer/musician/painter, but I was frightened. I went in to the wrong line of work. Now I know I will never get another office job, and it's such a relief. I do think it's wrong to try and pinpoint one cause of a breakdown, though, when it's often three or four, but in simple terms I would say that my inability to cope with work came from being mentally undermined by my past, which eventually lead to a breakdown.' </p> <p>Even when we've reached rock bottom, though, we don't always act in our best interests. It took Ewart several months to get to grips with his treatment properly, even after he'd accepted that he needed medication. </p> <p>'At first I made a hell of a song and dance about taking the drugs I'd been prescribed. I waited until the following morning to start and then I had a total freak-out because I thought I was having some sort of fit, which was all in my mind. With antidepressants, there's a period when you're still very ill before they kick in - you get panicky about side effects. I think I exaggerated the side effects.</p> <p>Eventually my doctor changed the drug, but even then I wouldn't take the full dose. I took half a tablet for a month to six weeks, so I'd feel good for two or three days, but then have a setback where I couldn't leave the house or something. In the end my partner told me to stop being stupid and I went on the full dose. Within a week, things had changed out of all recognition. Symptoms of anxiety which made me unable to take my son for a walk or go to the shops disappeared and my mood lifted. All the worries and anxieties that had been eating away at me were still present, but it was as if they had been pushed back a couple of metres. l'm still taking the drugs, but I've also had therapy, which was crucial and helped me to totally restructure the way I think and live. I look after my son now for a few days of the week and freelance from home.' </p> <p>Experts agree that it is never right to treat a major depressive episode solely with drugs. 'In the first instance, if I was going mad I would want drugs to help,' says Oliver James, 'but there's a lot of evidence to show that what comes after that is critically important.' Massimo Riccio agrees. 'Medication is never enough - we need to look at a coping strategy, either in group therapy or individually.' </p> <p>Riccio also feels that when it comes to treating mental illness 'there still isn't enough education, so while primary care physicians are educated about mental illness, they are not skilled enough at detection and there is still stigma.' Sarah has come through her breakdowns feeling more scarred by the stigma than anything else. 'I'd had a label attached to me. The actual breakdown wasn't such a bad experience - I wasn't suicidal or a danger to others - so by far the worst thing about it was feeling so stigmatised. When I was first diagnosed, they thought I might be schizophrenic, so I've had that hanging over me, even though another doctor had told me that I couldn't possibly be. Still, the label of schizophrenia has been very, very stigmatising, and it has robbed me of a certain confidence. In terms of work, I've lost 10 years.' </p> <p>Sarah was treated - at various times - using both medication and therapy and nowadays feels 'just better able to cope. I've been in quite stressful situations since - I left my long-term partner and I've suffered as much stress since then as I did at the time of my breakdown - but I'm just better able to cope with it. You just think, \"No, that time before when I thought I was dying I wasn't dying\"; you can think your way out of it rationally.' </p> <p>While no one would recommend a breakdown, David Bell certainly feels that with the appropriate treatment, they can at least be viewed as an opportunity. 'Obviously, what people want when they're in that state is immediate relief, which is perfectly understandable, but when a person has spent their whole life functioning in a particular way, what starts off as a breakdown turns into a breakthrough, if they see someone who is psychoanalytically or psychotherapeutically trained. A well-managed breakdown can give the person an opportunity to really understand what went wrong.' </p> <p>Similarly, Massimo Riccio tells his patients that if they are able to deal with a breakdown successfully it is possible that they will come out the other side a better person. 'I don't advise people to have a breakdown, but once you've been depressed and had one and perhaps had psychoanalytical treatment, you learn about yourself, about your coping strategies, and this will help you to deal with life in a different way.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart remembers reading Dorothy Rowe. 'She says that depression is something that should be welcomed because it's a sign that something needs to change. I think, prior to all this, I'd been stuck in an unhelpful pattern for my entire life.'</p> <p>\u0095 Sarah's name has been changed.</p> <p><strong>Fact from fiction </strong></p> <p>Mental illness is shrouded in myth. Here is the truth about four commonly held 'nervous breakdown' misconceptions:</p> <p><strong>'Nervous breakdown' is a technical term</strong><br> Oliver James says that the term nervous breakdown is devoid of technical meaning. 'It is most likely to have come into use in the First World War as a result of treating shell shock. A lot of our understanding and attitudes to mental illness come from medicine in the military.' Dr David Bell says that the term probably dates back to a time when all psychiatric illness was referred to as nervous disorder: 'It was thought that all mental-health complaints were neurological in origin.'</p> <p><strong>Breakdowns are always 'bad'</strong><br>Most experts agree that breakdowns are not an entirely negative experience - with the right treatment, they can be turned into a breakthrough. As David Bell says, 'When someone has spent their whole life functioning in a certain way, breakdown can be an opportunity for change.' There are also circumstances under which breaking down is an entirely rational response. 'In fact,' says David Bell, 'for some people, not breaking down is a problem.'</p> <p><strong>A breakdown is most likely to occur where there is a genetic predisposition</strong><br> Dr Philip Timms says that although 'depression, like most major mental illnesses, runs in families, genetics doesn't explain all of it.' And, according to Dr Massimo Riccio, even psychotic breakdown could happen to anyone: 'In the general population, there is a 1 per cent lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia.' Oliver James feels that most nervous breakdowns are caused by 'a very poor early infancy, resulting in a very weak sense of self, which, if you like, makes for a much weaker foundation stone.' </p> <p><strong>Breakdowns can't be prevented</strong><br> Philip Timms says that in some cases a breakdown could be avoided if we felt able to take a few weeks out before we reached crisis point. 'It's about the way we organise our lives, about pacing ourselves. There's this notion that we're either fully functional or completely disabled, and people find it hard to deal with the halfway mark.' </p> <p><strong>Warning signs </strong></p> <p>In Positive Under Pressure (\u00a36.99, Thorsons), psychotherapist Gael Lindenfield and stress specialist Dr Malcolm Vandenburg identify the early warning signs of immobilising stress.</p> <p><strong>Physical</strong><br> Includes bowel-related problems, such as diarrhoea and constipation, back pain, migraines, palpitations, breathing problems, disrupted sleep, loss of libido, impotence and, for women, a disrupted menstrual cycle.</p> <p><strong>Emotional</strong><br> Includes worrying all the time, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, out of control, guilty, confused, trapped and unable to know what to do next.</p> <p><strong>Behavioural</strong><br> Includes mood swings, temper loss, preoccupation, inability to tolerate noise, withdrawal from 'normal' life (eg, stopping hobbies), inability to stop moving/fidgeting.</p> <p><strong>Going public</strong></p> <p> When a celebrity's private suffering becomes common knowledge.</p> <p>Stephen Fry walked out of West End play Cell Mates in 1995. 'I would say now it was a breakdown. I don't know precisely what it was. I did see doctors, both the ordinary ones and the psychiatric kind. They said it was a cyclothymic bipolar episode or something like that. That'll do. But one might as well use the language of demonisation. There was a demon of something in me and it took a lot of getting out.' </p> <p>Joanna Lumley on her 1970 breakdown: 'I found everything just unbearable. I'd try to go shopping at Safeway or whatever and couldn't go in, the thought of all the people in there. You'd have to talk to yourself aloud in your head, divide yourself in two and counsel yourself like a friend, so the one you knew would speak in a sensible voice would tell the other one the simplest task they had to do, and the reward would be to go out of the shop and go home.'</p> <p>Brett Easton Ellis had a breakdown after the success of his novel Less Than Zero . 'It was a sort of emotional exhaustion,' he says now. 'My mom came over, I started seeing a shrink, I got my medicine - kind of regulated myself.'</p> <p>PJ Harvey had a nervous breakdown after the break up of her first affair in her early twenties. 'I couldn't do anything for weeks - little things like having a bath and brushing your teeth, I just didn't know how to do it. I never want to go back there again.'</p> <p>Alistair Campbell on his drinking and breakdown in the mid-80s while working on Today newspaper. 'It was a nightmare recovering, trying to re-build my career, while trying to give up drinking. You learn what your priorities are and who your real friends are - and you can count those on one hand... I get letters from people who say, \"I've had a nervous breakdown and it's great that someone talks about it.\"'</p> <p>Peter Mullan on breaking down during his final year in university: 'I was working 15 hours a day, every day, for two months. Then something snapped. I started crying and didn't stop for a week. I had three or four relapses in my twenties. It was very humbling. It was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. You realise there is a darkness within that you can't always deal with.'</p> <p>Spike Milligan: 'If you've been through a breakdown, it's like having been honed by a very fine Toledo blade.'</p> <p>Bob Hoskins: 'When I separated I had a nervous breakdown because walking away from two kids is a horrific thing. I started living in a kind of bubble, a bubble of grief, because I'd lost my family and couldn't cope... I was having these long sessions with a psychiatrist, then going for a drink with my friend Verity Bargate. She used to say, \"You're telling the psychiatrist all your best plots. You should be doing it on stage.\"'</p> <p>\u0095 The Mental Health Foundation information line is manned Monday to Friday, from 10am-6pm (020 7535 7420).

Even when we've reached rock bottom, though, we don't always act in our best interests. It took Ewart several months to get to grips with his treatment properly, even after he'd accepted that he needed medication. 'At first I made a hell of a song and dance about taking the drugs I'd been prescribed. I waited until the following morning to start and then I had a total freak-out because I thought I was having some sort of fit, which was all in my mind. With antidepressants, there's a period when you're still very ill before they kick in - you get panicky about side effects. I think I exaggerated the side effects. Eventually my doctor changed the drug, but even then I wouldn't take the full dose. I took half a tablet for a month to six weeks, so I'd feel good for two or three days, but then have a setback where I couldn't leave the house or something. In the end my partner told me to stop being stupid and I went on the full dose. Within a week, things had changed out of all recognition. Symptoms of anxiety which made me unable to take my son for a walk or go to the shops disappeared and my mood lifted. All the worries and anxieties that had been eating away at me were still present, but it was as if they had been pushed back a couple of metres. l'm still taking the drugs, but I've also had therapy, which was crucial and helped me to totally restructure the way I think and live. I look after my son now for a few days of the week and freelance from home.' Experts agree that it is never right to treat a major depressive episode solely with drugs. 'In the first instance, if I was going mad I would want drugs to help,' says Oliver James, 'but there's a lot of evidence to show that what comes after that is critically important.' Massimo Riccio agrees. 'Medication is never enough - we need to look at a coping strategy, either in group therapy or individually.' Riccio also feels that when it comes to treating mental illness 'there still isn't enough education, so while primary care physicians are educated about mental illness, they are not skilled enough at detection and there is still stigma.' Sarah has come through her breakdowns feeling more scarred by the stigma than anything else. 'I'd had a label attached to me. The actual breakdown wasn't such a bad experience - I wasn't suicidal or a danger to others - so by far the worst thing about it was feeling so stigmatised. When I was first diagnosed, they thought I might be schizophrenic, so I've had that hanging over me, even though another doctor had told me that I couldn't possibly be. Still, the label of schizophrenia has been very, very stigmatising, and it has robbed me of a certain confidence. In terms of work, I've lost 10 years.' Sarah was treated - at various times - using both medication and therapy and nowadays feels 'just better able to cope. I've been in quite stressful situations since - I left my long-term partner and I've suffered as much stress since then as I did at the time of my breakdown - but I'm just better able to cope with it. You just think, \"No, that time before when I thought I was dying I wasn't dying\"; you can think your way out of it rationally.' While no one would recommend a breakdown, David Bell certainly feels that with the appropriate treatment, they can at least be viewed as an opportunity. 'Obviously, what people want when they're in that state is immediate relief, which is perfectly understandable, but when a person has spent their whole life functioning in a particular way, what starts off as a breakdown turns into a breakthrough, if they see someone who is psychoanalytically or psychotherapeutically trained. A well-managed breakdown can give the person an opportunity to really understand what went wrong.' Similarly, Massimo Riccio tells his patients that if they are able to deal with a breakdown successfully it is possible that they will come out the other side a better person. 'I don't advise people to have a breakdown, but once you've been depressed and had one and perhaps had psychoanalytical treatment, you learn about yourself, about your coping strategies, and this will help you to deal with life in a different way.' Ian Ewart remembers reading Dorothy Rowe. 'She says that depression is something that should be welcomed because it's a sign that something needs to change. I think, prior to all this, I'd been stuck in an unhelpful pattern for my entire life.' \u0095 Sarah's name has been changed. Fact from fiction Mental illness is shrouded in myth. Here is the truth about four commonly held 'nervous breakdown' misconceptions: 'Nervous breakdown' is a technical term Oliver James says that the term nervous breakdown is devoid of technical meaning. 'It is most likely to have come into use in the First World War as a result of treating shell shock. A lot of our understanding and attitudes to mental illness come from medicine in the military.' Dr David Bell says that the term probably dates back to a time when all psychiatric illness was referred to as nervous disorder: 'It was thought that all mental-health complaints were neurological in origin.' Breakdowns are always 'bad' Most experts agree that breakdowns are not an entirely negative experience - with the right treatment, they can be turned into a breakthrough. As David Bell says, 'When someone has spent their whole life functioning in a certain way, breakdown can be an opportunity for change.' There are also circumstances under which breaking down is an entirely rational response. 'In fact,' says David Bell, 'for some people, not breaking down is a problem.' A breakdown is most likely to occur where there is a genetic predisposition Dr Philip Timms says that although 'depression, like most major mental illnesses, runs in families, genetics doesn't explain all of it.' And, according to Dr Massimo Riccio, even psychotic breakdown could happen to anyone: 'In the general population, there is a 1 per cent lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia.' Oliver James feels that most nervous breakdowns are caused by 'a very poor early infancy, resulting in a very weak sense of self, which, if you like, makes for a much weaker foundation stone.' Breakdowns can't be prevented Philip Timms says that in some cases a breakdown could be avoided if we felt able to take a few weeks out before we reached crisis point. 'It's about the way we organise our lives, about pacing ourselves. There's this notion that we're either fully functional or completely disabled, and people find it hard to deal with the halfway mark.' Warning signs In Positive Under Pressure (\u00a36.99, Thorsons), psychotherapist Gael Lindenfield and stress specialist Dr Malcolm Vandenburg identify the early warning signs of immobilising stress. Physical Includes bowel-related problems, such as diarrhoea and constipation, back pain, migraines, palpitations, breathing problems, disrupted sleep, loss of libido, impotence and, for women, a disrupted menstrual cycle. Emotional Includes worrying all the time, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, out of control, guilty, confused, trapped and unable to know what to do next. Behavioural Includes mood swings, temper loss, preoccupation, inability to tolerate noise, withdrawal from 'normal' life (eg, stopping hobbies), inability to stop moving/fidgeting. Going public When a celebrity's private suffering becomes common knowledge. Stephen Fry walked out of West End play Cell Mates in 1995. 'I would say now it was a breakdown. I don't know precisely what it was. I did see doctors, both the ordinary ones and the psychiatric kind. They said it was a cyclothymic bipolar episode or something like that. That'll do. But one might as well use the language of demonisation. There was a demon of something in me and it took a lot of getting out.' Joanna Lumley on her 1970 breakdown: 'I found everything just unbearable. I'd try to go shopping at Safeway or whatever and couldn't go in, the thought of all the people in there. You'd have to talk to yourself aloud in your head, divide yourself in two and counsel yourself like a friend, so the one you knew would speak in a sensible voice would tell the other one the simplest task they had to do, and the reward would be to go out of the shop and go home.' Brett Easton Ellis had a breakdown after the success of his novel Less Than Zero . 'It was a sort of emotional exhaustion,' he says now. 'My mom came over, I started seeing a shrink, I got my medicine - kind of regulated myself.' PJ Harvey had a nervous breakdown after the break up of her first affair in her early twenties. 'I couldn't do anything for weeks - little things like having a bath and brushing your teeth, I just didn't know how to do it. I never want to go back there again.' Alistair Campbell on his drinking and breakdown in the mid-80s while working on Today newspaper. 'It was a nightmare recovering, trying to re-build my career, while trying to give up drinking. You learn what your priorities are and who your real friends are - and you can count those on one hand... I get letters from people who say, \"I've had a nervous breakdown and it's great that someone talks about it.\"' Peter Mullan on breaking down during his final year in university: 'I was working 15 hours a day, every day, for two months. Then something snapped. I started crying and didn't stop for a week. I had three or four relapses in my twenties. It was very humbling. It was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. You realise there is a darkness within that you can't always deal with.' Spike Milligan: 'If you've been through a breakdown, it's like having been honed by a very fine Toledo blade.' Bob Hoskins: 'When I separated I had a nervous breakdown because walking away from two kids is a horrific thing. I started living in a kind of bubble, a bubble of grief, because I'd lost my family and couldn't cope... I was having these long sessions with a psychiatrist, then going for a drink with my friend Verity Bargate. She used to say, \"You're telling the psychiatrist all your best plots. You should be doing it on stage.\"' \u0095 The Mental Health Foundation information line is manned Monday to Friday, from 10am-6pm (020 7535 7420).

      "body": "<p>Kerri Sharp has had quite a lot of jobs. She was once a goatherd in Crete: 'I lived in a cave and drank a bottle of brandy a day.' She was once a topless ice-cream seller in St Tropez. There was a brief period as a bus conductor in Torquay and a sojourn in a squat in Stoke Newington screen-printing Anarchy T-shirts for Malcolm McLaren. She was always 'feckin' skint'. </p> <p>Her family were full-on Gypsy Rose Lee travellers with no birth certificates or anything. They finally landed in Leytonstone, east London, though Kerri got out of there fast. 'My father was a singer - grew up with Krays, told stories about spivs, organised crime, Soho, the Messina brothers, prostitution, racketeering... I take after my dad...' Her mother, possibly afraid of this, sent her only daughter to a Catholic convent in Wanstead. 'I loathed that miserable God with his white beard and wagging finger.' </p> <p>It was not the right place for an eight-year-old who stuck nude pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe on the door of her locker and devoted her time to the Rudy Trudies, a club whose sole mission was to go out and find naughty pictures. 'My mother thought I wouldn't get a good education in the local state schools. What I got was an early introduction to sadomasochism.' </p> <p>Caned for spelling mistakes, caned for putting stickers on her briefcase, caned for not wearing a hat in the summer, Ms Sharp emerged with 'unparalleled loathing for authority and a desire to investigate everything that was seen as a sin'. </p> <p>This is a good thing, in general, and particularly useful to her current incarnation, for nowadays, Ms Sharp reigns over Black Lace books, Britain's leading seller of erotic fiction written by women for women. As an imprint of Virgin publishing, Black Lace writhes shamelessly on the huge bed that is Richard Branson's empire. Not all of his 200 enterprises make money, but Black Lace continues to be a success story. Three million books sold to date, in fact. Three million books that describe a vast range of proclivities. Vampires. Nordic gods. Gang bangs. Ice hockey. You name it. </p> <p>Ladies who lust are a faithful market. And a big one. While men will always reach for the top shelf and go for the gyno, women want words, and particularly words that are formed into phrases such as 'rock-hard' and 'Sit on my desk, Sister Clarissa'. Where once the female reader liked to read about kindly Mills &amp; Boon medics living in market towns, now they are absorbed by dark alleys and drag queens. Engagement rings and coy kisses have been replaced by whipping and ramming. </p> <p>'There's nothing wrong with romance,' says Sharp. 'But today's Black Lace books should be primarily concerned with hot, kinky sex, and not be ashamed to explore the filthiest behaviour. Being brave is what it's all about.' </p> <p>Sharp's own sexuality is coloured by adventure, and her love life has been enhanced by exotic scenery. 'I tried to be a lesbian for a year,' she says. 'But you weren't allowed to wear wigs.' Then there was a Rastafarian 'who taught me how to cook' and a man she met down the pub who had long blond hair, looked like a surfer, and spoke like a south London mechanic. 'My god, he was so pretty. He was going like, \"Have you got stockings and suspenders and lovely bras?\" I was like, \"I don't mind dressing up and stuff...\" but he said, \"No, they're for me!\"' </p> <p>Now aged 40, happily single, though in a committed relationship, Sharp has no intention of getting married or having children. 'I'm not a thirtysomething, got a mortgage and a lovely little place in Battersea...' she says. 'You know: waiting for a wonderful man, can't wait to have babies and go on posh holidays to Tuscany, no, no, no...' </p> <p>The libido is a strange thing - don't even pretend you understand it - but as a creative force, it has long been imbued with clear cultural significance, related as it is to everything from legal censorship to progressive thought. </p> <p>The basic symbology of erotica has not changed since John Cleland described the 'delirous transports' [sic] of Fanny Hill in 1748. As the 1959 study 'Pornography and the Law' recorded some basic themes - seduction, defloration, permissive authority figure, rampant hussy and the 'brute' as a sexual symbol - so all these things can still be found in Black Lace narratives. The song remains the same. 'Saving Julie', Catharine McCabe's short story, opens with: 'Reverend Billy Washburn sat at his desk, one hand gently rubbing the erection growing down his long, muscular thigh' - which directly echoes a line in the 1877 classic The Autobiography of a Flea: 'Father Ambrose was the living personification of lust.' </p> <p>Erotic fiction is still rude, but its history has changed. Once the sole domain of male writers, it is now subsumed by the female imagination, and that imagination is purveying that most manly of concepts - sex without emotion. The Black Lace heroine has sex for the sake of it. Sex without commitment. Sex without babies. Sex on Hampstead Heath. She does not get involved. Hell, she hardly hangs around long enough to lace up her thigh-high leather boots. </p> <p>'Black Lace came along at exactly the right time,' says Sharp. 'It succeeded where women's porn magazines failed.' </p> <p>Black Lace was launched in 1993 after a Virgin marketing questionnaire revealed that women wanted kinky erotica that it was possible to buy without embarrassment. An advertisement in The Guardian for 'an unshockable female' produced Ms Sharp. </p> <p>At that point she was working for the glossy fetish magazine Skin Two, having graduated with a BA in film from the University of Westminster. Her heroes were Vivian Stanshall (the comic genius behind the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, but her belief system had crystallised the evening that she walked into a cinema in 1986 and saw Blue Velvet. </p> <p>'That film inspired me to study surreal directors, and I realised that the perverse subconscious was a valid form of emotional and artistic expression - to me, that is fantastically liberating, because it means living in a state of honesty rather than in a state of chintzy denial.' </p> <p>She settled into the Virgin office, then in Ladbroke Grove, and oversaw the first four books, one of which, Cassandra's Conflict, ignited a furore that ensured the success of the Black Lace series. The tale featured a sadomasochistic relationship, a dark master, a new nanny and an atmosphere of non-consensuality at a time when it was not clearly understood that the rape fantasy was about being overcome by a man of the mind's choice, rather than an actual desire to be maimed by some thug out of a drain in Hackney. </p> <p>'There was a lot of humiliation and violation in it,' says Sharp. 'And everyone went mad, saying, \"How dare you imply that women want to be hurt during sex\" and so on. The Daily Mail accused me of \"corrupting the morals of the nation's women and betraying civilised values\". The result was that they all sold out within a week.' </p> <p>Now, seven years later, Black Lace is respectable. Virgin publish two new novels and one reprint per month, each of which can expect to sell around 10,000 copies in England and America. There are popular collections of short stories and 'specials' are tacked as free gifts on to enlightened magazines, such as New Woman. The readers are from 18 to 40 years old and many of them, for some reason, are nurses. Sharp receives five unsolicited manuscripts a week and at least 10 short stories. She inclines towards writers that show some knowledge of the 'lineage of pulp fiction and cult films', and in general, she likes surprises. </p> <p>'I look for something that isn't an autobiographical piece about splitting up with your boyfriend and getting revenge by discovering your new sexuality,' she says. 'That's dull, and it is 80 per cent of what I get.' </p> <p>The authors range from Janine Ashbless, who composes erotic fairy tales in the tradition of Angela Carter, to 74-year-old Tesni Morgan, who manages to juggle her career with the demands made by nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. </p> <p>'I think erotic stories are enjoyed by career women who are too tired to have any emotional involvement,' Morgan theorises. 'They are often bringing up children on their own. They flop down, exhausted, after a day's work. All they want to do is relax with a glass of wine, and they would prefer to read a sexy book than deal with the stress that goes with a relationship.' </p> <p>Asked to name the writers who best epitomise the mood of the current sexual zeitgeist, Sharp cites Tabitha Flyte and Stella Black. Black has created an eponymous bisexual heroine with a degree from Oxford who wears black stilettos because she likes film noir. She lives in Hollywood, drives a mid-60s Firebird and packs a gun. She indulges in a wide range of postlapsarian pervery, her problems only arriving when she makes the mistake of falling in love. In this, she represents the basic schism that exists in erotic fiction for women: while relational values have always tended to thread through female erotica (and were the very thing that turned The Story of O into a work of quality), so they also impair emotional independence - and emotional independence is useful (if not indispensable) to the woman who wishes to be empowered by transgression. </p> <p>Erotic fiction is about having sex in complicated times. Sexism and body fascism still swamp popular culture and no one bothers to fight it any more. Commerce has won. Professional women undermined by the nesting instinct are in a double bind where the rules of the battle are that there are no rules and no obvious trophy. </p> <p>The result is a psychosexual schizophrenia that is encapsulated in Tabitha Flyte's short story 'The Chef's Revenge', where lewd Tasha 'rapes' a celebrity chef and he repays the compliment by later 'raping' her. It is a classic fable of modernity: lad girl/predator likes it when the man she has undermined turns on her because, in sexual terms, lad girl/predator likes a worthy competitor. </p> <p>'Many women fantasise about being dominated,' says the author, 'but I would only write such a thing in an appropriate context. I think it's really important to write in a way that does not demean women.' </p> <p>Flyte, 29, was born in Southend-on-Sea and read politics at Warwick University. Having worked in Asia for five years, she now lives in Tooting with her boyfriend. 'Most of my friends have read and enjoyed my work,' she says. 'I love telling strangers what I do just to see their faces!' </p> <p>She points out that the men who appear in her books tend to be the kind of men that she likes - that is, they are easy going, open minded and humorous. 'I'm not bothered by what men look like or how much they earn, so my characters tend not to have flash clothes or cars.' </p> <p>Asked if she thinks that erotic fiction is important, she says, 'It is when it shows women's sexuality in a positive light. Rather than portraying women as recipients or passive vessels, good erotic fiction explores their fantasies and show, them to be acceptable. How could this be a bad thing?' </p> <p> Last year, Sharp edited Wicked Words, a collection of erotic short stories that became the first British book to introduce slash lit to mainstream publishing. Slash lit was born at Star Trek conventions and then spread on the net in the Dark Ages when the web was first colonised by Trekkies and pornographers. Female dissidents met in a variety of virtual forums and posted short stories which appropriated mainstream sci-fi characters (in particular Captain Kirk and Spock) and placed them in a homoerotic context. Now a global phenomenon with an infrastructure of hundreds of sites and zines, slash sexualises everyone from Starsky and Hutch to Buffy and Xena. It is a world where a Dalek can date Captain Mainwaring and anything goes. </p> <p>The characteristics of slash fall in line with those demanded by any effective subversive activity. It is a means of expression for the individual (particularly those who feel marginalised); it is a way of undermining the hegemony of corporate concept; it is a completely new and innovative form of literature within the structure of an omnipotent technology; it operates, by and large, outside the demands of profit, which gives it freedom; it is egalitarian - anyone can post their work. </p> <p>Slash lit is the insubordinate's latest chapter to a history that not only relates an intimate relationship between erotica and subversion, but has also proved its political efficacy. The basic nature of slash fiction is illegal (no corporate publisher is going to print rude stories about another corporation's properties) and it is thus confined, but its links to erotic fiction are strong and represented by writers such as Kitty Fisher. Her short story 'Shadowlight' was modified for Black Lace, but reflects the traits of slash in that it is a sci-fi narrative about an affair between two men. </p> <p>Fisher, university educated, 40 years old and living in London, is bisexual and works in management. She has been involved with the slash-lit subculture for eight years and enjoys its renegade aspects. 'It is certainly part of the appeal for me. Going to a slash convention is still a bit like being part of a secret society - all these women from vastly different backgrounds sitting down to discuss whether Mulder would have better sex with Skinner or Krycek.' </p> <p>One of the characteristics of slash, which has yet to be adequately explained, is the fact that it is same-sex fiction (men with men, women with women) written by women for women. The anomalies of this are not simple: it is not just about lesbianism - heterosexual women are also involved. Why, then, are they both inspired and aroused by homo-erotica? This, of course, intrigues culture-studies types, who write long essays about complex pathologies, the creative implications of sexual guilt and the lack of female characters in popular culture. </p> <p>'I don't think any of the theories are quite right,' says Fisher. 'But I do think that women are only beginning to explore their sexuality.' </p> <p>Sharp has long been unafraid to engage herself as a pro-porn voice in the long-running debate that still severs feminist thinkers. 'It's time for women to make a friend of the word pornography,' she says. 'It doesn't have to be a pejorative term.' </p> <p>A couple of years ago she appeared on a David Frost programme and took on Catharine MacKinnon, the influential legal theorist who sees pornography as an engine of inequality that violates human rights. MacKinnon believes that the adult-entertainment industry should be made legally responsible for the damage it is causing. Sharp commented that by repudiating a woman's right to enjoy pornography, MacKinnon was denying the woman's right to have a sexuality, a point for which she received a round of applause from the audience. </p> <p>Sharp's politics were moulded in the mid-80s when, as a reaction against the 'awfulness' of Thatcherism, she became interested in the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I wouldn't dare admit to myself that the whole scene was dreary - those caucus meetings where you'd have Paul Foot and Tony Cliff and the guy who started Rock Against Racism, Paul somebody, who was a dish. But at the end of the day, you would have some terrible gentle beard in corduroys pressing your flesh and talking about Gramsci for 10 minutes. The imagination was not tolerated, there was no room for discussion, and there was no place for an alternative sexuality. It was the same with the unreconstructed feminism that was happening at the same time. It wasn't any fun.' </p> <p>Kerri Sharp's presence at Black Lace means that the imprint is more than a pulp factory churning out saucy books. She understands the subtle ebb and flow of sexual more and tends to steer her authors towards them; where once the narratives were full of pirates and Victorians, now they reflect the post-feminist paradoxes that exist within experimental sex, gender play, office politics and club culture. </p> <p>'The characters are getting older,' Tesni Morgan observes. 'Kerri thinks older women are more interesting...' </p> <p>As female writers continue to explore female sexuality, Black Lace works from within the system to disseminate messages about the joy of unashamed individualism. Ignored by reviews (a promotional tool that pulp fiction has never needed), the writers work in a world of their own. Creating their own cult heroines and spreading lubricious ideas about realistic possibilities, they are a fifth column percolating alternatives in an environment where the overall sexual perspective is still supervised by low-brow yobs.</p>",

The basic symbology of erotica has not changed since John Cleland described the 'delirous transports' [sic] of Fanny Hill in 1748. As the 1959 study 'Pornography and the Law' recorded some basic themes - seduction, defloration, permissive authority figure, rampant hussy and the 'brute' as a sexual symbol - so all these things can still be found in Black Lace narratives. The song remains the same. 'Saving Julie', Catharine McCabe's short story, opens with: 'Reverend Billy Washburn sat at his desk, one hand gently rubbing the erection growing down his long, muscular thigh' - which directly echoes a line in the 1877 classic The Autobiography of a Flea: 'Father Ambrose was the living personification of lust.' Erotic fiction is still rude, but its history has changed. Once the sole domain of male writers, it is now subsumed by the female imagination, and that imagination is purveying that most manly of concepts - sex without emotion. The Black Lace heroine has sex for the sake of it. Sex without commitment. Sex without babies. Sex on Hampstead Heath. She does not get involved. Hell, she hardly hangs around long enough to lace up her thigh-high leather boots. 'Black Lace came along at exactly the right time,' says Sharp. 'It succeeded where women's porn magazines failed.' Black Lace was launched in 1993 after a Virgin marketing questionnaire revealed that women wanted kinky erotica that it was possible to buy without embarrassment. An advertisement in The Guardian for 'an unshockable female' produced Ms Sharp. At that point she was working for the glossy fetish magazine Skin Two, having graduated with a BA in film from the University of Westminster. Her heroes were Vivian Stanshall (the comic genius behind the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, but her belief system had crystallised the evening that she walked into a cinema in 1986 and saw Blue Velvet. 'That film inspired me to study surreal directors, and I realised that the perverse subconscious was a valid form of emotional and artistic expression - to me, that is fantastically liberating, because it means living in a state of honesty rather than in a state of chintzy denial.' She settled into the Virgin office, then in Ladbroke Grove, and oversaw the first four books, one of which, Cassandra's Conflict, ignited a furore that ensured the success of the Black Lace series. The tale featured a sadomasochistic relationship, a dark master, a new nanny and an atmosphere of non-consensuality at a time when it was not clearly understood that the rape fantasy was about being overcome by a man of the mind's choice, rather than an actual desire to be maimed by some thug out of a drain in Hackney. 'There was a lot of humiliation and violation in it,' says Sharp. 'And everyone went mad, saying, \"How dare you imply that women want to be hurt during sex\" and so on. The Daily Mail accused me of \"corrupting the morals of the nation's women and betraying civilised values\". The result was that they all sold out within a week.' Now, seven years later, Black Lace is respectable. Virgin publish two new novels and one reprint per month, each of which can expect to sell around 10,000 copies in England and America. There are popular collections of short stories and 'specials' are tacked as free gifts on to enlightened magazines, such as New Woman. The readers are from 18 to 40 years old and many of them, for some reason, are nurses. Sharp receives five unsolicited manuscripts a week and at least 10 short stories. She inclines towards writers that show some knowledge of the 'lineage of pulp fiction and cult films', and in general, she likes surprises. 'I look for something that isn't an autobiographical piece about splitting up with your boyfriend and getting revenge by discovering your new sexuality,' she says. 'That's dull, and it is 80 per cent of what I get.' The authors range from Janine Ashbless, who composes erotic fairy tales in the tradition of Angela Carter, to 74-year-old Tesni Morgan, who manages to juggle her career with the demands made by nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 'I think erotic stories are enjoyed by career women who are too tired to have any emotional involvement,' Morgan theorises. 'They are often bringing up children on their own. They flop down, exhausted, after a day's work. All they want to do is relax with a glass of wine, and they would prefer to read a sexy book than deal with the stress that goes with a relationship.' Asked to name the writers who best epitomise the mood of the current sexual zeitgeist, Sharp cites Tabitha Flyte and Stella Black. Black has created an eponymous bisexual heroine with a degree from Oxford who wears black stilettos because she likes film noir. She lives in Hollywood, drives a mid-60s Firebird and packs a gun. She indulges in a wide range of postlapsarian pervery, her problems only arriving when she makes the mistake of falling in love. In this, she represents the basic schism that exists in erotic fiction for women: while relational values have always tended to thread through female erotica (and were the very thing that turned The Story of O into a work of quality), so they also impair emotional independence - and emotional independence is useful (if not indispensable) to the woman who wishes to be empowered by transgression. Erotic fiction is about having sex in complicated times. Sexism and body fascism still swamp popular culture and no one bothers to fight it any more. Commerce has won. Professional women undermined by the nesting instinct are in a double bind where the rules of the battle are that there are no rules and no obvious trophy. The result is a psychosexual schizophrenia that is encapsulated in Tabitha Flyte's short story 'The Chef's Revenge', where lewd Tasha 'rapes' a celebrity chef and he repays the compliment by later 'raping' her. It is a classic fable of modernity: lad girl/predator likes it when the man she has undermined turns on her because, in sexual terms, lad girl/predator likes a worthy competitor. 'Many women fantasise about being dominated,' says the author, 'but I would only write such a thing in an appropriate context. I think it's really important to write in a way that does not demean women.' Flyte, 29, was born in Southend-on-Sea and read politics at Warwick University. Having worked in Asia for five years, she now lives in Tooting with her boyfriend. 'Most of my friends have read and enjoyed my work,' she says. 'I love telling strangers what I do just to see their faces!' She points out that the men who appear in her books tend to be the kind of men that she likes - that is, they are easy going, open minded and humorous. 'I'm not bothered by what men look like or how much they earn, so my characters tend not to have flash clothes or cars.' Asked if she thinks that erotic fiction is important, she says, 'It is when it shows women's sexuality in a positive light. Rather than portraying women as recipients or passive vessels, good erotic fiction explores their fantasies and show, them to be acceptable. How could this be a bad thing?' Last year, Sharp edited Wicked Words, a collection of erotic short stories that became the first British book to introduce slash lit to mainstream publishing. Slash lit was born at Star Trek conventions and then spread on the net in the Dark Ages when the web was first colonised by Trekkies and pornographers. Female dissidents met in a variety of virtual forums and posted short stories which appropriated mainstream sci-fi characters (in particular Captain Kirk and Spock) and placed them in a homoerotic context. Now a global phenomenon with an infrastructure of hundreds of sites and zines, slash sexualises everyone from Starsky and Hutch to Buffy and Xena. It is a world where a Dalek can date Captain Mainwaring and anything goes. The characteristics of slash fall in line with those demanded by any effective subversive activity. It is a means of expression for the individual (particularly those who feel marginalised); it is a way of undermining the hegemony of corporate concept; it is a completely new and innovative form of literature within the structure of an omnipotent technology; it operates, by and large, outside the demands of profit, which gives it freedom; it is egalitarian - anyone can post their work. Slash lit is the insubordinate's latest chapter to a history that not only relates an intimate relationship between erotica and subversion, but has also proved its political efficacy. The basic nature of slash fiction is illegal (no corporate publisher is going to print rude stories about another corporation's properties) and it is thus confined, but its links to erotic fiction are strong and represented by writers such as Kitty Fisher. Her short story 'Shadowlight' was modified for Black Lace, but reflects the traits of slash in that it is a sci-fi narrative about an affair between two men. Fisher, university educated, 40 years old and living in London, is bisexual and works in management. She has been involved with the slash-lit subculture for eight years and enjoys its renegade aspects. 'It is certainly part of the appeal for me. Going to a slash convention is still a bit like being part of a secret society - all these women from vastly different backgrounds sitting down to discuss whether Mulder would have better sex with Skinner or Krycek.' One of the characteristics of slash, which has yet to be adequately explained, is the fact that it is same-sex fiction (men with men, women with women) written by women for women. The anomalies of this are not simple: it is not just about lesbianism - heterosexual women are also involved. Why, then, are they both inspired and aroused by homo-erotica? This, of course, intrigues culture-studies types, who write long essays about complex pathologies, the creative implications of sexual guilt and the lack of female characters in popular culture. 'I don't think any of the theories are quite right,' says Fisher. 'But I do think that women are only beginning to explore their sexuality.' Sharp has long been unafraid to engage herself as a pro-porn voice in the long-running debate that still severs feminist thinkers. 'It's time for women to make a friend of the word pornography,' she says. 'It doesn't have to be a pejorative term.' A couple of years ago she appeared on a David Frost programme and took on Catharine MacKinnon, the influential legal theorist who sees pornography as an engine of inequality that violates human rights. MacKinnon believes that the adult-entertainment industry should be made legally responsible for the damage it is causing. Sharp commented that by repudiating a woman's right to enjoy pornography, MacKinnon was denying the woman's right to have a sexuality, a point for which she received a round of applause from the audience. Sharp's politics were moulded in the mid-80s when, as a reaction against the 'awfulness' of Thatcherism, she became interested in the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I wouldn't dare admit to myself that the whole scene was dreary - those caucus meetings where you'd have Paul Foot and Tony Cliff and the guy who started Rock Against Racism, Paul somebody, who was a dish. But at the end of the day, you would have some terrible gentle beard in corduroys pressing your flesh and talking about Gramsci for 10 minutes. The imagination was not tolerated, there was no room for discussion, and there was no place for an alternative sexuality. It was the same with the unreconstructed feminism that was happening at the same time. It wasn't any fun.' Kerri Sharp's presence at Black Lace means that the imprint is more than a pulp factory churning out saucy books. She understands the subtle ebb and flow of sexual more and tends to steer her authors towards them; where once the narratives were full of pirates and Victorians, now they reflect the post-feminist paradoxes that exist within experimental sex, gender play, office politics and club culture. 'The characters are getting older,' Tesni Morgan observes. 'Kerri thinks older women are more interesting...' As female writers continue to explore female sexuality, Black Lace works from within the system to disseminate messages about the joy of unashamed individualism. Ignored by reviews (a promotional tool that pulp fiction has never needed), the writers work in a world of their own. Creating their own cult heroines and spreading lubricious ideas about realistic possibilities, they are a fifth column percolating alternatives in an environment where the overall sexual perspective is still supervised by low-brow yobs.",

One in seven children in the UK suffers from asthma, with the number of children under the age of five who have developed asthma and wheezing almost doubling in less than a decade. One of the latest studies to raise these concerns was carried out by Professor Anthony Seaton, from the University of Aberdeen, who found that the children who consumed the least milk, fibre, vegetables, vitamin E and essential minerals were far more likely to suffer from a breathing-related illness.</p> <p>Along with such factors as family history and allergic tendencies, having an unbalanced, junk-food-based diet was found to raise the chances of children developing asthma, while a deficiency of vitamin E was identified with a threefold increase. Other scientists have seemed to confirm Professor Seaton's findings. Dr Martyn Partridge, chairman of the British Thoracic Society, says that 'this study adds to the evidence that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables can help prevent the world's children from developing asthma and wheezy illnesses.'</p> <p>Where this leaves children who already have problems with their breathing is not yet fully understood. My gut instinct and clinical experience tell me that eating more fruit and vegetables as part of a healthy, balanced diet will both help children to feel better and strengthen their immune systems, making them less likely to develop colds and other illnesses which can wreak havoc with an asthmatic's breathing.</p> <p>From a nutritional perspective, asthmatics who have to take steroids can give the most cause for concern, as steroids decrease the levels of such minerals as calcium in the bones. A lack of calcium can cause bones to become brittle and, in the long term, may lead to osteoporosis. It is, therefore, especially important that such people include calcium-rich foods in their daily diet and limit the loss of calcium and other nutrients by avoiding certain foods and activities, such as smoking. (I have seen many asthmatics who choose to smoke and ignore the fact that it hampers breathing, interferes with the transport of oxygen around the body and weakens the skeleton.) Keeping as active as possible - subject to your doctor's advice - will also encourage your bones to remain healthy.</p> <p>In addition, because caffeine inhibits the body's ability to absorb calcium, keep your consumption of tea, coffee, chocolate and colas to a minimum. Remember, too, that combining caffeine with calcium-containing foods renders the calcium virtually useless. If you have cheese on toast with a milkshake made with melted chocolate, or yogurt mixed with blueberries followed by coffee, the caffeine in the chocolate and coffee will bind the calcium in the dairy product within the gut, stopping it from being absorbed. So if your child likes cola, encourage them to drink it between meals - and adults should do the same with coffee and tea.</p> <p>There are many delicious sources of calcium to choose from, including dairy products, which, even when skimmed, contain hefty doses (as do sheep's- and goat's-milk products). The calcium content is increased when milk is turned into cheese, be it soft or hard, or from cows, sheep or goats. To maximise the body's supply of calcium, people with asthma should aim to consume slightly more than the recommended calcium intake for non-asthmatic people. Children should have 500ml (just under a pint) of milk, a few small pots of yogurt or 75g of cheese a day, while the target quantity for adults is 850ml of milk, 500g of yogurt (a large pot) or 125g of cheese. Although this may sound a lot, it is easily achieved if you have cereal with yogurt or milk for breakfast, for instance, a yogurt after lunch and a meal incorporating cheese or followed by a milkshake or yogurt in the evening.</p> <p>If dairy products aren't your thing, look to green, leafy vegetables instead, such as kale, spinach, watercress or broccoli (pur\u00e9eing them can be a good way of tempting your child to eat them). Okra, tofu, dried figs and apricots (without added sulphur dioxide), canned fish with soft, edible bones (like salmon and mackerel), sesame seeds, almonds and white bread also contain useful doses of calcium. If you're unable to eat dairy products, suffer from asthma and take steroids, see a dietician to ensure that your non-dairy calcium intake is high enough to counteract the negative effects of the medication. They will probably advise you to eat a lot more of these foods than you would dairy products and may recommend that you take a supplement. Seeking professional advice can also be valuable if you suspect that specific foods - such as additives, for instance Tartrazine (found in many yellow and orange synthetically coloured foods) - trigger an asthma attack.</p> <p>You need to be confident that cutting specific foods out of your diet won't render it unbalanced or deficient in essential nutrients. Calcium also needs vitamin D to create and maintain strong bones. Because the body produces vitamin D primarily as a result of exposure to sunlight, make sure that your child spends plenty of time in the sun (and, of course, that their skin is protected with sunscreen). As we get older, our bodies become less efficient at metabolising vitamin D through the skin, so include vitamin D-packed foods, such as oily fish and eggs, in your diet to make up the deficit.</p> <p>All in all, the sooner children start enjoying a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet, eating their greens and drinking fresh juice or tucking into fruit after meals, the stronger their bones will become and the less likely they will be to wheeze.

      "body": "<p>The change in Jay McInerney's life is apparent as soon as you enter his apartment. It is in one of those discreetly expensive Upper East side townhouses off Central Park, with a liveried doorman and a creaking panelled lift. The whole building reeks of old money and conventional mores - not exactly McInerney's natural habitat. The apartment contains a few pieces of antique furniture - a bookcase, a sofa, a table - and one or two silver-framed photographs of his parents, his children, his wife's horse. But the air is stale and the room is dusty and underfurnished, with marks on the walls where pictures once hung. I guess, even before he tells me, that the apartment is up for sale. </p> <p>'This is sort of a relic,' he says, looking round the empty walls. 'Helen decided it's better for the kids to live in the country, so she's taken them back to Tennessee and I'm selling this and moving downtown. Downtown is better for me - I find myself going there every night anyway. This is more of a family place.' He speaks so flatly I wonder at first if he is drugged or hungover. But he is, I think, just very unhappy. His third marriage, to his Southern belle, Helen Bransford, is over. It lasted nine years - longer than any of his previous relationships - and made him a father for the first time. But now, at 45, and beginning to look it, he is footloose again. </p> <p>His new collection of short stories is called How It Ended - but it is not about the end of his marriage to Helen Bransford. Most of the stories were written several years ago - even the one that seems to be about Bill Clinton was written before Clinton was anywhere near the White House. He says he thought of putting dates on the stories, 'But the nice thing is that people don't seem to necessarily know that they weren't all written recently. I've published 20 or 25 stories in magazines over the years, and ultimately these were the only ones that I thought were durable. I'm not saying they're all of Joycean quality, but at least I feel confident that they're the best I've done. A few of them are new - the newest is 'Third Party', written this year. My agent said, \"God that's the way you were writing 15 years ago - grow up!\"' </p> <p>That was slightly my reaction to 'Third Party' too, but I'm surprised that he says it. Usually he is brilliant at hyping his work, but today it's as if he can't quite get his act together. He apologises, 'I'm just figuring this out as I go along. I haven't really talked about this book.' He doesn't even seem to have looked at it - 'What's that car doing on the cover?' he asks. 'It's not exactly my department is it?' No indeed - he is not a great car writer in the Martin Amis or Will Self league; in fact I can't remember any great automotive moments in the McInerney oeuvre. His forte is relationships, especially - as in these stories, as in his life - failing or failed relationships. </p> <p>How It Ended is not even being published in the States, because many of the stories were included in the American edition of Model Behavior, published two years ago. The New York Times praised the stories, but Model Behavior was generally panned. These days, he says - again with unusual self-deprecation - his literary reputation is 'balanced on a knife edge'. This isn't quite true, but the general American view is that he has never lived up to the gigantic promise of his first novel, Bright Lights, Big City in 1984, when he was hailed as 'the next F Scott Fitzgerald'. It didn't help that the 1988 film of Bright Lights, Big City was a turkey, largely because Michael J Fox was cruelly miscast as the hero. But mainly his literary reputation has been cluttered, confused and ultimately damaged by his gossip-column celebrity. In New York in the 80s, it seemed you couldn't open a newspaper or magazine without seeing a picture of him at the latest nightclub with the latest model draped on his arm. </p> <p>He loved it at the time, but now he thinks it damaged him. 'If there is a way in which I have had a more difficult time with monogamy and a quiet life than the average person, I think that, you know, the success of my first book was very disruptive. I felt incredibly lucky at the time and for a long time afterwards, but it unsettled my life in a way that I only now realise. It opened so many doors, and I got so much attention that it couldn't help but spoil me somewhat.' The other night he was having dinner with Bret Easton Ellis, and Ellis recalled something he had forgotten - that they went to a movie premiere together in about 1987, and the photographers were so desperate to get a shot of Jay with his new girlfriend Marla Hanson, that they ended up punching Ellis's girlfriend to the ground and trampling her underfoot. 'That's how crazy it was - it was a really ugly scene. That's why I needed to get out of New York for a while. I was burned out. It was not a sane or reflective existence toward the end. I didn't know whether the escape would be permanent - it turned out that I just needed a break.' </p> <p>The 'break' was marriage to Helen Bransford, and moving to Tennessee. But now that, too, is over. This again raises the question always asked by Jay-watchers: is he really a good boy pretending to be bad, or is he actually as bad - as callous and brattish - as he can sometimes seem? Naturally he has always favoured the former view, and said two years ago, 'I think I've been trying to prove I'm a really bad guy for 20 years, that I'm not a mother's boy. But part of me is stuck with being a Catholic boy who is slightly shocked by things.' Part of him - but perhaps a decreasing part. He once admitted that, as a teenager, he was deeply influenced by the Playboy 'Adviser' section and he still retains that slightly tacky notion of sophistication - he really has to have a beautiful woman on his arm. And the emotional detritus is piling up. </p> <p>He says he's not behaved so badly. 'I don't think I've left a trail of weeping women in my wake. I mean, the number of serious relationships I've had has not been into double digits. Merry [his second wife] once said I was a very dangerous man, but I don't know many people who would agree with her. I think I have a much more tempestuous and eventful amorous life than the average middle-class citizen, but I wouldn't agree that I necessarily behaved dishonourably. The score is about equal between me and the opposite sex!' </p> <p>Perhaps. His first wife, Linda Rossiter, was a half-Japanese model whom he met when he was living in Japan on a Princeton scholarship. The marriage lasted for precisely four months - she went off to the Milan collections and never came back. Then in 1981, while studying at Syracuse under Raymond Carver, he married a PhD student called Merry Reymond. He was still living with her when Bright Lights, Big City was published in 1984, and changed his life. He claims that no one thought he was handsome till he became a famous writer, but suddenly every door in New York was open to him, everyone was offering him cocaine, and models were passing him their phone numbers. It was exciting for him but confusing for Merry: 'She married a graduate student and woke up married to an MTV star.' </p> <p>In 1987 he left her for a model, Marla Hanson, who was then headline news as a result of having had her face slashed by a mugger. Merry suffered acute depression, attempted suicide, and was in a psychiatric hospital for nine months. He paid the enormous bills, which wiped out his earnings from Bright Lights, and said, 'Yeah, I did feel guilty, but I paid a lot of money to expunge the guilt.' One of the best stories in How It Ended seems to relate to this period. It is about a famous actor going to visit his estranged wife in a psychiatric home, and wondering why he keeps delaying their divorce. 'Sometimes he suspected he was afraid to let go because she was the only person who wouldn't allow him to reinvent himself completely, into something bright and shiny and superficial... [She] was perhaps his best chance to remember and preserve the best of what he had been.' </p> <p>So he was slow to divorce Merry and never got round to marrying Marla Hanson, though they stayed together for four years. He remembers it as 'a very obsessive relationship, throwing glasses at each other, cheating on each other. It was very exciting.' But she left him in 1991, walking out with her portfolio and her diaphragm, just like his first wife. Within days, he rang an old friend, Helen Bransford, asked her out, and suddenly they were in love and married three weeks later at City Hall. She came from a very grand old Tennessee family (the family seat, Belle Meade, is now a museum) and he seems to have fallen in love with the South as much as with her. They bought a country ranch near Nashville, and he signed off from New York with his big valedictory novel Brightness Falls . His next novel, The Last of the Savages, was set in the South, and the interviews he gave on publication were all about horses, heirlooms, ancestors, and revealed a hitherto-unsuspected vein of snobbery. He claimed, 'I always wanted to live in the world that I have ended up living in.' </p> <p>But the Tennessee idyll was already flawed. Helen was 43 when they married - seven years older than him - and warned him that they might not be able to have children. He said he honestly didn't mind. But when she became pregnant within weeks of marrying him, he seemed to share her delight. Then she had a miscarriage. Then she had four more miscarriages. Then she turned to IVF. But her eggs were too old, and her uterus too old to carry the baby to term. Most women, I imagine, would have given up at this point, but she didn't. A friend of hers called Jesse, a country and western singer, offered to donate eggs, and Helen advertised for a surrogate mother to carry the baby. She found a waitress who was willing to do it for $15,000. Thus, with Jay's sperm, her friend's eggs, and her employee's womb, Helen created the twins, Maisie and John Barrett McInerney III. But it was touch and go. The waitress refused to give up smoking, much to Helen's fury, and then developed diabetes and kept going into labour. The twins were eventually born three months prematurely, weighing less than 2lb each, and had to spend 10 weeks in incubators. Helen wrote a gripping account of the whole saga for American Vogue. </p> <p>Jay's role at first was hardly more than sperm donor and bemused spectator. He'd always assumed he would be a father one day, but he was in no hurry. 'I never really cared that much. I just didn't get it until I saw them [the twins] and held them and got to know them.' The twins were born in 1995, the year he turned 40, and lost his own father - it should have marked the end of his long restless adolescence. </p> <p>But the next year there was an odd little warning sign that all was not quite perfect in the marriage. Helen had a facelift. She decided to do it, she said, because when Jay came back from interviewing Julia Roberts he remarked, 'I told her all about you. Well, everything but your age.' It was the first sign, to Helen, that the seven-year age gap was a problem - a problem for Jay, she thought. So off she went and had a facelift, and wrote an article, and then a book, about it. Jay said he felt 'a little embarrassed. But I have to say that I've benefited from it. She looks great, as good as she did when I first met her 14 years ago.' </p> <p>He once said that what attracted him to Helen was that 'She was so cool, like a guy.' She was the first woman he'd lived with who was not emotionally needy or wounded in some way. 'And,' he now adds, 'who wasn't emotionally unbalanced. Maybe that's one of the reasons why our separation is so amicable. She's not threatening to stab me in my sleep or stab any future girlfriends in my life!' </p> <p>But surely having a facelift and going to all those lengths to have children suggest that she was needy, or at least that she was worried about ageing? 'Well. I never quite understood those decisions. Neither of those decisions were pacts that I was in agreement with. Those were not moments of great concord , so I don't know how to answer for those decisions. Helen is a great eccentric - and I say that affectionately. I don't think anyone else would have had quite that response to that set of problems.' </p> <p>Significantly, his next novel, Model Behavior, published in 1998, was set again in New York and marked what one critic called 'a return to the shallow end'. He had grown bored with country life, and was spending more and more time in their New York apartment, so eventually Helen moved there with the twins, bought an adjacent apartment (from Stephen Fry, who seldom used it) and tried to make a family home. Helen said it was fine for him to go out partying till three in the morning, as long as he didn't expect her to accompany him. </p> <p>Inevitably, this soon provoked rumours that Jay was having affairs, though he insists that's not the reason they split up - 'We were having our own problems, all by ourselves.' One basic problem was that Helen wanted to be in Nashville and he wanted to be in New York. Helen had done New York in her twenties and thirties and wanted to get out - 'She didn't feel she needed all the social desperation, I guess.' Whereas he felt he belonged - 'It's my place, you know? It's the only place I've ever felt entirely at home. There's a wonderful fantasy element to life in Tennessee, and it was something I wanted to try but I don't think it was ultimately the life for me.' </p> <p>They officially separated earlier this year, but Jay says the real crisis was last year. Of course, he'd been through divorce before, but not when there were children. 'Children change everything,' he sighs. 'That's what makes it essentially really awful - that was what gave us both such trouble and regrets. And the resolution is somewhat melancholy, but at the same time I'm so relieved that there is some resolution, and so is Helen. We both get along much better now - we started as really great friends and that's what we've reverted to, and it seems to work very well.' He visits the children two or three times a month and recently went on holiday with them. The other day he accompanied Helen to a party in Nashville, which he says shocked some of their friends. Jesse, the biological mother of the twins, is still angry with him. 'She might be a little down on me - one always has to blame somebody - but I think she'll get over that. Because Helen is so incredibly non-judgemental that her friends are coming around now.' </p> <p>But last year, he says, was 'a terrible, terrible year for me'. What made it so terrible was that he suffered writer's block - something that had never happened to him before and that he thought never would. 'With so much of my life in turmoil, I just couldn't settle in a place where I could concentrate. I couldn't get enough distance when my mind was so consumed by this life crisis, and I was really stuck for a while. I'm very happy that's over.' </p> <p>Actually, even blocked, he managed to write a short story, a film script, a wine column, a travel piece about Cuba, and a brilliant non-fiction piece for The New Yorker about his mother's death. She died in 1979, and of course her death formed part of the hinterland of Bright Lights, Big City, but this time he wrote more nakedly of the last three days he spent with her and her deathbed confession that she had not been quite the model Catholic wife she appeared to be - she had committed adultery, at least in her heart. It was as if, by giving him her 'sin', she absolved him of some of his guilt.</p> <p>The piece was much admired by readers - but not by his mother's friends and not by his two brothers, one of whom refused to speak to him for a year. 'I got a lot of questions about, \"Why would you do this? Why would you hold our mother up this way?\" and of course the answer is: because I'm a writer - and I'm hardly the first writer to have come up against this problem. There's a terrible way in which being a novelist or a memoirist is a question of constantly betraying the deepest confidences of those around you. So, yes, it was tough. It was tough to come up with an answer for my brother - Why did you do it? Well - because I had to. That's what I do . And this is my way of dealing with it - I've been living with it for a long time. And ultimately I fell back on the old excuse that it was my form of therapy.' </p> <p>Of course, as he says, many writers are guilty of using their friends and family as material. But he seems to do more - he actually seems to live his life in order to fuel his writing, grabbing experiences wherever he can, and at whatever cost to other people. Thus, Nashville was a useful interlude to give him some Southern background and enable him to see New York with fresh eyes, and having children was useful in all sorts of ways. He used to fear the pram in the hall, but now he thinks children are a great bonus for a writer because a) they give you new access to your own childhood memories b) they enable you to watch the development of language and c) they make you think in a bigger time scale, whereas before he never thought further ahead than 'Where am I having dinner tonight, and will I get a good table?' </p> <p>When he talks like this, it sounds callous and he seems to agree it is callous. 'I'm afraid that - not necessarily deliberately, but consistently - I've made a kind of laboratory out of my life, where I mix the stuff in the test tubes to create explosions - possibly resulting in interesting by-products. I mean, not deliberately - I'd be crazy to deliberately do that - or maybe not. But it sometimes appears to be part of a plan. Flannery O'Connor once said that anybody who had a childhood has enough to write about, and she lived on her little farm, not leaving the house for months at a time, and she wrote better than I probably ever will. But I do think that diversity and range of experience can't help but make me a more interesting novelist. There is a type of writer that can happily bury themselves in the country and dig very deep, but I'm not like that.' </p> <p>So what next? He is back in the bright lights, big city, presumably chasing models and partying hard - though he is off the Bolivian marching powder these days. He claims there is no new girlfriend - though that seems unlikely - and that, anyway, he is in no hurry to get divorced. But most importantly, he has a new novel on the go, and this is the big one, he believes, perhaps even big enough to justify all the heartaches of the past year. He wrote his way out of his block by starting a novel about a marriage breakup 'since that was all I could think about at the time', but now the novel has developed and diverged to the point where he might omit the marriage breakup entirely. </p> <p>Suddenly, talking about his new novel, he seems really fired up for the first time. He says he mustn't talk about it - he knows the rules of publicity, he's supposed to be plugging How It Ended - but he can hardly stop himself. It's about the film industry, set in New York, Los Angeles and Rome, and deals with the collision between art and commerce. His personal life might be in chaos, but he almost doesn't care - 'All I know for certain is that I'm in transition and surely this metamorphosis must be bringing me a little closer to my mature form. So now: if I can just write a really good new novel, that's my main goal for the next year. And I'm hoping that other things will take care of themselves. As long as my kids are happy. And it's a big novel.'</p> <p>\u0095 How it Ended by Jay McInerney (\u00a312.99, Bloomsbury) is out on 18 September.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The change in Jay McInerney's life is apparent as soon as you enter his apartment. It is in one of those discreetly expensive Upper East side townhouses off Central Park, with a liveried doorman and a creaking panelled lift. The whole building reeks of old money and conventional mores - not exactly McInerney's natural habitat. The apartment contains a few pieces of antique furniture - a bookcase, a sofa, a table - and one or two silver-framed photographs of his parents, his children, his wife's horse. But the air is stale and the room is dusty and underfurnished, with marks on the walls where pictures once hung. I guess, even before he tells me, that the apartment is up for sale. 'This is sort of a relic,' he says, looking round the empty walls. 'Helen decided it's better for the kids to live in the country, so she's taken them back to Tennessee and I'm selling this and moving downtown. Downtown is better for me - I find myself going there every night anyway. This is more of a family place.' He speaks so flatly I wonder at first if he is drugged or hungover. But he is, I think, just very unhappy. His third marriage, to his Southern belle, Helen Bransford, is over. It lasted nine years - longer than any of his previous relationships - and made him a father for the first time. But now, at 45, and beginning to look it, he is footloose again. His new collection of short stories is called How It Ended - but it is not about the end of his marriage to Helen Bransford. Most of the stories were written several years ago - even the one that seems to be about Bill Clinton was written before Clinton was anywhere near the White House. He says he thought of putting dates on the stories, 'But the nice thing is that people don't seem to necessarily know that they weren't all written recently. I've published 20 or 25 stories in magazines over the years, and ultimately these were the only ones that I thought were durable. I'm not saying they're all of Joycean quality, but at least I feel confident that they're the best I've done. A few of them are new - the newest is 'Third Party', written this year. My agent said, \"God that's the way you were writing 15 years ago - grow up!\"' That was slightly my reaction to 'Third Party' too, but I'm surprised that he says it. Usually he is brilliant at hyping his work, but today it's as if he can't quite get his act together. He apologises, 'I'm just figuring this out as I go along. I haven't really talked about this book.' He doesn't even seem to have looked at it - 'What's that car doing on the cover?' he asks. 'It's not exactly my department is it?' No indeed - he is not a great car writer in the Martin Amis or Will Self league; in fact I can't remember any great automotive moments in the McInerney oeuvre. His forte is relationships, especially - as in these stories, as in his life - failing or failed relationships. How It Ended is not even being published in the States, because many of the stories were included in the American edition of Model Behavior, published two years ago. The New York Times praised the stories, but Model Behavior was generally panned. These days, he says - again with unusual self-deprecation - his literary reputation is 'balanced on a knife edge'. This isn't quite true, but the general American view is that he has never lived up to the gigantic promise of his first novel, Bright Lights, Big City in 1984, when he was hailed as 'the next F Scott Fitzgerald'. It didn't help that the 1988 film of Bright Lights, Big City was a turkey, largely because Michael J Fox was cruelly miscast as the hero. But mainly his literary reputation has been cluttered, confused and ultimately damaged by his gossip-column celebrity. In New York in the 80s, it seemed you couldn't open a newspaper or magazine without seeing a picture of him at the latest nightclub with the latest model draped on his arm. He loved it at the time, but now he thinks it damaged him. 'If there is a way in which I have had a more difficult time with monogamy and a quiet life than the average person, I think that, you know, the success of my first book was very disruptive. I felt incredibly lucky at the time and for a long time afterwards, but it unsettled my life in a way that I only now realise. It opened so many doors, and I got so much attention that it couldn't help but spoil me somewhat.' The other night he was having dinner with Bret Easton Ellis, and Ellis recalled something he had forgotten - that they went to a movie premiere together in about 1987, and the photographers were so desperate to get a shot of Jay with his new girlfriend Marla Hanson, that they ended up punching Ellis's girlfriend to the ground and trampling her underfoot. 'That's how crazy it was - it was a really ugly scene. That's why I needed to get out of New York for a while. I was burned out. It was not a sane or reflective existence toward the end. I didn't know whether the escape would be permanent - it turned out that I just needed a break.' The 'break' was marriage to Helen Bransford, and moving to Tennessee. But now that, too, is over. This again raises the question always asked by Jay-watchers: is he really a good boy pretending to be bad, or is he actually as bad - as callous and brattish - as he can sometimes seem? Naturally he has always favoured the former view, and said two years ago, 'I think I've been trying to prove I'm a really bad guy for 20 years, that I'm not a mother's boy. But part of me is stuck with being a Catholic boy who is slightly shocked by things.' Part of him - but perhaps a decreasing part. He once admitted that, as a teenager, he was deeply influenced by the Playboy 'Adviser' section and he still retains that slightly tacky notion of sophistication - he really has to have a beautiful woman on his arm. And the emotional detritus is piling up. He says he's not behaved so badly. 'I don't think I've left a trail of weeping women in my wake. I mean, the number of serious relationships I've had has not been into double digits. Merry [his second wife] once said I was a very dangerous man, but I don't know many people who would agree with her. I think I have a much more tempestuous and eventful amorous life than the average middle-class citizen, but I wouldn't agree that I necessarily behaved dishonourably. The score is about equal between me and the opposite sex!' Perhaps. His first wife, Linda Rossiter, was a half-Japanese model whom he met when he was living in Japan on a Princeton scholarship. The marriage lasted for precisely four months - she went off to the Milan collections and never came back. Then in 1981, while studying at Syracuse under Raymond Carver, he married a PhD student called Merry Reymond. He was still living with her when Bright Lights, Big City was published in 1984, and changed his life. He claims that no one thought he was handsome till he became a famous writer, but suddenly every door in New York was open to him, everyone was offering him cocaine, and models were passing him their phone numbers. It was exciting for him but confusing for Merry: 'She married a graduate student and woke up married to an MTV star.' In 1987 he left her for a model, Marla Hanson, who was then headline news as a result of having had her face slashed by a mugger. Merry suffered acute depression, attempted suicide, and was in a psychiatric hospital for nine months. He paid the enormous bills, which wiped out his earnings from Bright Lights, and said, 'Yeah, I did feel guilty, but I paid a lot of money to expunge the guilt.' One of the best stories in How It Ended seems to relate to this period. It is about a famous actor going to visit his estranged wife in a psychiatric home, and wondering why he keeps delaying their divorce. 'Sometimes he suspected he was afraid to let go because she was the only person who wouldn't allow him to reinvent himself completely, into something bright and shiny and superficial... [She] was perhaps his best chance to remember and preserve the best of what he had been.' So he was slow to divorce Merry and never got round to marrying Marla Hanson, though they stayed together for four years. He remembers it as 'a very obsessive relationship, throwing glasses at each other, cheating on each other. It was very exciting.' But she left him in 1991, walking out with her portfolio and her diaphragm, just like his first wife. Within days, he rang an old friend, Helen Bransford, asked her out, and suddenly they were in love and married three weeks later at City Hall. She came from a very grand old Tennessee family (the family seat, Belle Meade, is now a museum) and he seems to have fallen in love with the South as much as with her. They bought a country ranch near Nashville, and he signed off from New York with his big valedictory novel Brightness Falls . His next novel, The Last of the Savages, was set in the South, and the interviews he gave on publication were all about horses, heirlooms, ancestors, and revealed a hitherto-unsuspected vein of snobbery. He claimed, 'I always wanted to live in the world that I have ended up living in.' But the Tennessee idyll was already flawed. Helen was 43 when they married - seven years older than him - and warned him that they might not be able to have children. He said he honestly didn't mind. But when she became pregnant within weeks of marrying him, he seemed to share her delight. Then she had a miscarriage. Then she had four more miscarriages. Then she turned to IVF. But her eggs were too old, and her uterus too old to carry the baby to term. Most women, I imagine, would have given up at this point, but she didn't. A friend of hers called Jesse, a country and western singer, offered to donate eggs, and Helen advertised for a surrogate mother to carry the baby. She found a waitress who was willing to do it for $15,000. Thus, with Jay's sperm, her friend's eggs, and her employee's womb, Helen created the twins, Maisie and John Barrett McInerney III. But it was touch and go. The waitress refused to give up smoking, much to Helen's fury, and then developed diabetes and kept going into labour. The twins were eventually born three months prematurely, weighing less than 2lb each, and had to spend 10 weeks in incubators. Helen wrote a gripping account of the whole saga for American Vogue. Jay's role at first was hardly more than sperm donor and bemused spectator. He'd always assumed he would be a father one day, but he was in no hurry. 'I never really cared that much. I just didn't get it until I saw them [the twins] and held them and got to know them.' The twins were born in 1995, the year he turned 40, and lost his own father - it should have marked the end of his long restless adolescence. But the next year there was an odd little warning sign that all was not quite perfect in the marriage. Helen had a facelift. She decided to do it, she said, because when Jay came back from interviewing Julia Roberts he remarked, 'I told her all about you. Well, everything but your age.' It was the first sign, to Helen, that the seven-year age gap was a problem - a problem for Jay, she thought. So off she went and had a facelift, and wrote an article, and then a book, about it. Jay said he felt 'a little embarrassed. But I have to say that I've benefited from it. She looks great, as good as she did when I first met her 14 years ago.' He once said that what attracted him to Helen was that 'She was so cool, like a guy.' She was the first woman he'd lived with who was not emotionally needy or wounded in some way. 'And,' he now adds, 'who wasn't emotionally unbalanced. Maybe that's one of the reasons why our separation is so amicable. She's not threatening to stab me in my sleep or stab any future girlfriends in my life!' But surely having a facelift and going to all those lengths to have children suggest that she was needy, or at least that she was worried about ageing? 'Well. I never quite understood those decisions. Neither of those decisions were pacts that I was in agreement with. Those were not moments of great concord , so I don't know how to answer for those decisions. Helen is a great eccentric - and I say that affectionately. I don't think anyone else would have had quite that response to that set of problems.' Significantly, his next novel, Model Behavior, published in 1998, was set again in New York and marked what one critic called 'a return to the shallow end'. He had grown bored with country life, and was spending more and more time in their New York apartment, so eventually Helen moved there with the twins, bought an adjacent apartment (from Stephen Fry, who seldom used it) and tried to make a family home. Helen said it was fine for him to go out partying till three in the morning, as long as he didn't expect her to accompany him. Inevitably, this soon provoked rumours that Jay was having affairs, though he insists that's not the reason they split up - 'We were having our own problems, all by ourselves.' One basic problem was that Helen wanted to be in Nashville and he wanted to be in New York. Helen had done New York in her twenties and thirties and wanted to get out - 'She didn't feel she needed all the social desperation, I guess.' Whereas he felt he belonged - 'It's my place, you know? It's the only place I've ever felt entirely at home. There's a wonderful fantasy element to life in Tennessee, and it was something I wanted to try but I don't think it was ultimately the life for me.' They officially separated earlier this year, but Jay says the real crisis was last year. Of course, he'd been through divorce before, but not when there were children. 'Children change everything,' he sighs. 'That's what makes it essentially really awful - that was what gave us both such trouble and regrets. And the resolution is somewhat melancholy, but at the same time I'm so relieved that there is some resolution, and so is Helen. We both get along much better now - we started as really great friends and that's what we've reverted to, and it seems to work very well.' He visits the children two or three times a month and recently went on holiday with them. The other day he accompanied Helen to a party in Nashville, which he says shocked some of their friends. Jesse, the biological mother of the twins, is still angry with him. 'She might be a little down on me - one always has to blame somebody - but I think she'll get over that. Because Helen is so incredibly non-judgemental that her friends are coming around now.' But last year, he says, was 'a terrible, terrible year for me'. What made it so terrible was that he suffered writer's block - something that had never happened to him before and that he thought never would. 'With so much of my life in turmoil, I just couldn't settle in a place where I could concentrate. I couldn't get enough distance when my mind was so consumed by this life crisis, and I was really stuck for a while. I'm very happy that's over.' Actually, even blocked, he managed to write a short story, a film script, a wine column, a travel piece about Cuba, and a brilliant non-fiction piece for The New Yorker about his mother's death. She died in 1979, and of course her death formed part of the hinterland of Bright Lights, Big City, but this time he wrote more nakedly of the last three days he spent with her and her deathbed confession that she had not been quite the model Catholic wife she appeared to be - she had committed adultery, at least in her heart. It was as if, by giving him her 'sin', she absolved him of some of his guilt. The piece was much admired by readers - but not by his mother's friends and not by his two brothers, one of whom refused to speak to him for a year. 'I got a lot of questions about, \"Why would you do this? Why would you hold our mother up this way?\" and of course the answer is: because I'm a writer - and I'm hardly the first writer to have come up against this problem. There's a terrible way in which being a novelist or a memoirist is a question of constantly betraying the deepest confidences of those around you. So, yes, it was tough.

And this is my way of dealing with it - I've been living with it for a long time. And ultimately I fell back on the old excuse that it was my form of therapy.' Of course, as he says, many writers are guilty of using their friends and family as material. But he seems to do more - he actually seems to live his life in order to fuel his writing, grabbing experiences wherever he can, and at whatever cost to other people. Thus, Nashville was a useful interlude to give him some Southern background and enable him to see New York with fresh eyes, and having children was useful in all sorts of ways.

He is back in the bright lights, big city, presumably chasing models and partying hard - though he is off the Bolivian marching powder these days. He claims there is no new girlfriend - though that seems unlikely - and that, anyway, he is in no hurry to get divorced. But most importantly, he has a new novel on the go, and this is the big one, he believes, perhaps even big enough to justify all the heartaches of the past year. He wrote his way out of his block by starting a novel about a marriage breakup 'since that was all I could think about at the time', but now the novel has developed and diverged to the point where he might omit the marriage breakup entirely. Suddenly, talking about his new novel, he seems really fired up for the first time. He says he mustn't talk about it - he knows the rules of publicity, he's supposed to be plugging How It Ended - but he can hardly stop himself. It's about the film industry, set in New York, Los Angeles and Rome, and deals with the collision between art and commerce. His personal life might be in chaos, but he almost doesn't care - 'All I know for certain is that I'm in transition and surely this metamorphosis must be bringing me a little closer to my mature form. So now: if I can just write a really good new novel, that's my main goal for the next year. And I'm hoping that other things will take care of themselves. As long as my kids are happy. And it's a big novel.' \u0095 How it Ended by Jay McInerney (\u00a312.99, Bloomsbury) is out on 18 September.",

There was sensible auntie Valerie Singleton and her sticky-backed plastic. There was an assortment of inanely grinning women with their hands up glove puppets. And then there was Lady Penelope, London agent for International Rescue and the real star of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds . She only had one serious rival in my eyes, but although Stingray 's heroine Marina swam beautifully, in the end she was just too dumb to emulate. Not daft, you understand, just dumb. The mermaid didn't speak. </p> <p>Lady Penelope, on the other hand, spoke beautifully. Always cool under pressure, her cut-glass English accent was faultless, as were her manners. She never failed to praise her adenoidal chauffeur sidekick after another successful mission with a warm, calm 'Parker, well done!' and he never failed to know his place. She was always 'M'lady', even when they were shooting up the bad guys. More hit woman than It Girl, Lady Penelope had style: the immaculately coiffed blonde hair, the perfectly shaped sugar-pink nails, the smart trouser suits and, most of all, the pink retro Rolls-Royce with the gun concealed in the grille. Compared to her, the rest of the cast of her long- running show - those wholesome Tracy brothers and their insufferably smug father - seemed a little, well, wooden. </p> <p>Why the reminisces? Well, you may already know that Lady Penelope is back. BBC2 is showing a digitally remastered version of Thunderbirds at 5.25pm on Sundays. But Lady Penelope's spirit is also influencing the collections creeping into the shops now, with some of the models in the autumn/winter catwalk shows looking shockingly ladylike and polished in demure-looking slim-fit coats (Marc Jacobs), tailored trousers, full-length macs, tailored hound's-tooth coats (Markus Lupfer), suits in tweed (Narciso Rodriguez, MaxMara) and cashmere (Clements Ribeiro), and scarves clasped round necks (Celine). Tousled hair was replaced by smooth chignons, make-up was more Grace Kelly than Siouxsie Sioux, and glittery brooches featured everywhere. It was a touch of class on the catwalk after a long period of floaty, unstructured clothes, and in a four-page feature in this month's British Vogue has hailed the return of the proper madam. </p> <p>The evidence seems clear: It Girls gathering in the ladies' room at Claridges; the trend for more feminine, floaty interiors as seen in Ian Schrager's latest London hotel, The Sanderson; the return of the acronym NSIT among girls (to indicate ungallant men who are Not Safe In Taxis); the boom in books on modern manners; cheaper, faster US-style nail shops finally making regular lunch-time manicures accessible for working women; matching shoes and handbags being pushed in luxury leather stores for the first time in years. For proof that this is more than just a glossy-fashion fiction, look no further than this year's Burberry boom: one minute it's a brand for the country set and upmarket Americans, next it's being worn by Meg Mathews and coveted by the club set, and slight variations on its distinctive check pattern are currently gracing the windows of high-street fashion stores throughout the land. </p> <p>Yet before you go rushing to Herm\u00e8s for your headscarf, perhaps you should check your irony levels. Fashion runs in cycles, and it may well be time for a little more polish and refinement. But gone are the days when Paris could decree that hemlines were up and women across Europe would dutifully take out their sewing machines to comply. Instead, we take looks from the catwalk, the high street and the second-hand shop and mix them together in our post-modern dressing-up box, rifling through different looks, eras and attitudes to fit our mood. So it is that the same issue of Vogue also has features on the return of the playboy (a man who is always NSIT), the revival of 80s style, a story updating 70s punk looks, plus a very sensible warning from buyer Joan Burstein of Browns about the new trend for ladylike tailoring: 'People have really appreciated the sense of freedom in dress, and they are not going to give that up.' </p> <p>So it may be that this winter we'll flirt with twin-sets and pearls, wear tailored skirts and two-piece suits to work and play, even buy matching shoes and bags for the first time in years. We may be once, twice, three times a lady, but in between we can also be rock chicks, disco dollies, boho hippies, even track-suited slobs. Unlike Lady Penelope, there are no strings on us.</p>",

He has a part-time job with BT and a full-time one at the BBC which involves shift work in the evenings and at weekends. </p> <p>The shifts enable him see more of his nine-month-old son Gabriel than if he worked from 9am to 5pm, but he wants fewer hours. </p> <p>However, he also wants to reduce his mortgage as fast as he can, to save and provide a pension for his wife, Zehavit. Last year he took a Standard Life Bank flexible repayment mortgage, which enables homeowners to pay off their loans early without penalty. Since then James has paid \u00a3160 a month more than he needs to. At this rate, he will have cleared his loan in 16 years rather than 25. He likes the fact that this type of mortgage allows homeowners to borrow back their overpayments. </p> <p>He is saving \u00a3200 a month in a Save As You Earn (SAYE) share option scheme. He has gradually increased his savings each year for the past three years from \u00a340 a month to \u00a3100 to \u00a3200. The first scheme matures next year. Other savings and investments include \u00a32,000 in BT shares which he bought last October. He has invested more in shares at other times. </p> <p>He has \u00a34,000 in an Egg account, invested over the internet, but is now looking for another internet savings account. He likes arranging his finances over the internet, which he can easily access at work or at home. </p> <p>He is considering opening a cash Isa with Smile, the Co-op's internet bank. He says he shies away from savings plans where you can't judge the value yourself, such as with-profits endowments. He likes investments that are completely transparent. </p> <p>He feels his own pension is 'sorted'. He has been a member of the BBC's final salary scheme for the past 18 months. Before that he was a member of money purchase schemes with three previous employers. However, he would like to start a pension for his wife. </p> <p>His debts include a per sonal loan taken out when he moved home last year, though he has already paid off most of it. Both he and his wife also have student loans. </p> <p>He met Zehavit on a kibbutz in Israel where he spent two years after graduating. She has recently completed an archaeology degree. She is a full-time mother but is considering self-employed work, or further studies at university.

If he wishes to continue saving and repaying his debts at the current rate, he will have to keep his current workload. </p> <p>Given the amount of his earnings relative to his outgoings, I am impressed that James is able to save as much as he does. He is right that a cash Isa is the most appropriate place for his cash savings, as this will shelter his money from tax. A maximum of \u00a33,000 can be invested in one of these Isas in the current tax year. He should also consider using his stocks and shares mini-Isa allowance of \u00a33,000 for longer-term investment.</p> <p>He could use his wife's Isa allowances to provide cash for her retirement.</p> <p>He is right in trying to repay his debts as soon as possible. He could use some of his maturing SAYE scheme money for that, too. However, he and his wife could keep their low-interest student loans.</p> <p>James's wish for a pension for Zehavit could be partly met by the new stakeholder regime, which starts next April. This allows up to \u00a33,600 to go into a scheme without evidence of earnings. This money would benefit from tax relief at 22 per cent and will grow in a virtually tax-free environment.</p> <p>James's \u00a3180,000 life insurance is adequate.

He may have to save less, too, but he could maximise returns by rearranging his existing savings. </p> <p>For example, if cash deposits are made in Zehavit's name, she should register to receive interest without tax deducted, as long as she is a non-taxpayer.

I checked the application form. There was no tick and I had written 'N/A' next to the box. </p> <p>I had completed this form in the shop, where I was also given a personal loan voucher, completed by a Courts employee, which I signed, assuming it just repeated my application form.

You have paid for the sofas in full, and will not get caught by interest charges. </p> <p><strong> AA membership: Unused cover</strong></p> <p>On 3 April, I sent a cheque for \u00a375 to renew my AA membership, due at the end of April. But before the end of the month, I bought a new car that included three years' AA cover. </p> <p>I asked for a refund but was told that subscriptions are accepted for 12 months' continuous membership and are not refundable.

The only consolation is that the AA defers the unused portion until you want to reactivate it, so you will get 358 unused days of the subscription at this year's rate, however much the fee has increased. </p> <p><strong> Cooling off: The cold reality</strong></p> <p>I took out an Aberdeen unit trust Isa for \u00a35,000 but cancelled within the 14-day period.

Is it unrealistic to think we could get a mortgage for this additional money?<br><strong>PK, Glasgow</strong> </p> <p>You should have no problem.

And this number is growing, according to the British Marine Industries Federation. </p> <p>A record 118,000 people visited last year's Southampton Boat Show, and if the weather holds, the organisers expect even more to attend this year's event, which starts on Friday. </p> <p>Southampton has a big advantage over the London Boat Show in that prospective purchasers can take a boat out for a test sail. 'Everything is there,' says Joe Field of Navigators &amp; General Insurance. 'You can sign up for a boat, sort out the finance and insurance and get fully kitted out all in one day. All you need to bring is your chequebook.' </p> <p>But before anyone gets carried away imagining the wind in their hair and the tang of salt in their nostrils, it's as well to think seriously about how much life on the ocean wave is going to cost. </p> <p>Boats ranging in price from \u00a3300 up to the Sun seeker 105 at a cool \u00a34 million-plus are on show in Southampton. But there is a healthy secondhand market, which can be reached through a boat broker or advertising in trade magazines. Brokers automatically check things such as who legally owns a boat that is for sale and whether there is any outstanding debt on it. Private buyers need to do the same. </p> <p>Shoppers wanting to spend a lot will find a number of specialist marine finance companies offering special boat-buying packages. They include Capital Bank, Lombard North Central and Mercantile Credit. Typical charges are 11 per cent APR for a \u00a320,000 unsecured personal loan to 9.9 per cent APR for a marine mortgage of the same size. </p> <p>You will want to insure your boat. This is not a legal requirement, but there could be problems mooring it if you don't have a policy. Cover for a small dinghy costs between \u00a340 and\u00a350 a year, including theft, damage in the dinghy park or on the water, vandalism and third- party claims. </p> <p>'Most claims are for theft after break-ins at the moorings or in yards,' says Field. 'You don't see too many write-offs or thefts of the boats themselves.' </p> <p>Mooring fees are another expense. Recent marina developments mean moorings are more plentiful today than 10 years ago, but there is still pressure in some of the more desirable locations. </p> <p>All three marinas owned by MDL on the river Hamble in Hampshire are full and there is a waiting list, says marketing director Helen France. Elsewhere, things are easier. A pontoon mooring on the East coast costs about \u00a3235 per metre of your boat's length per year. A swinging mooring (to a midstream buoy) would cost \u00a3205 per metre. </p> <p>Beginners can take time over buying the latest electronic navigational gear, but it is essential to kit yourself out properly. You probably don't need the world's most expensive boat shoes - prototypes made of hi-tech materials for Pete Goss, skipper of the Team Philips round-the- world catamaran, at \u00a335,000 a pair - but you will need a decent waterproof jacket and trousers and suitable shoes. Lifejackets are also essential, so you are probably talking about a minimum outlay of around \u00a3300. </p> <p>Finally, you will need to be able to sail. Five-day beginners courses in dinghies, to Royal Yachting Association recognised standards, are available all over this country and abroad. They cost between \u00a3250 and \u00a3300 for a residential course. 'Competent crew' courses for yachtsmen and women cost about the same. </p> <p>James Stevens, the RYA's training manager, says: 'Sailing for the beginner can be pretty miserable. It's much more fun if you learn to do it properly.' </p> <p>So having exhausted at least one chequebook, is it all worthwhile?

The basic tax return runs to eight pages, but you may need to ask for supplementary pages if, for instance, are self-employed, have potential capital gains charges or fall into a few other specialist categories. The supplementary pages - listed on page two of the tax return - should be sent to you automatically if you also received them last year, but mistakes are sometimes made. Ring the Revenue orderline (0845 9000 404) if you need extra pages, or download them from <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 Collect the other information you need to fill in the form - such as the year-end P60 form which your employer has to provide, listing your income, tax deducted and other vital figures.

Other sources of income - freelance earnings, for example, and rental payments received - will also generate their own paperwork, including sets of accounts for the total received and expenses set off against it during the year. (Getting this information can be easier than you think: some building societies and employers will be happy to give you the figures on the telephone.) </p> <p>\u0095 Dust off last year's tax return. This will make your task far easier: if your circumstances are unchanged, you can probably use last year's form as your guide for this year. You can also save yourself possible trouble by giving a written explanation in a note if there is a change in your income.

There are many pitfalls which could see you paying more tax than you need. For example, it is vital that you put down your employed earnings figure after pension contributions. If you do not do this, you will do yourself out of the tax relief you are entitled to on them. Make sure you do not include income from Peps and Isas, warns John Whiting of accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p> <p>\u0095 Ask for help if you need it. Staff at Inland Revenue offices are surprisingly helpful. You can ring up your local office and ask to make an appointment. They will not fill in the form for you, but they will advise you if an area is particularly difficult to understand. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep a copy of the return before you send it in. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep all your back-up information in a folder in case the Revenue asks you more questions or launches one of its dreaded investigations into your affairs. If you run your own business or have letting income, you must retain the relevant doc uments for five years after the 31 January final filing date. Other people need to keep their records and documents for a year after the 31 January filing date. </p> <p>\u0095 Expect to get a 'tax calculation' letter from the Revenue in a few weeks if you asked them to do the calculation.

      "body": "<p>Well, they made it. Despite the worst intentions of Thatcher and the best of Scargill, trade unions have survived into the twenty-first century. Today marks the start of their first Congress of the new millennium, and, on one level at least, there's a feeling that they're on a roll. </p> <p>Along with a raft of helpful legislation, last year they saw membership rise for the first time in two decades. The gain was substantial - 100,000 people joined unions in 1999, taking membership to 6.8 million. </p> <p>But there is a problem. According to the Trades Union Congress, the additions were in solid core constituencies - the public sector, teaching, manufacturing. A strengthening of the unions' traditional support base may bring cheers from branches around the country. But is this relevant to their future? Silence. </p> <p>Unions are seen as old organisations, in all the worst associations of the word. They are Old Labour. They are Old Economy. And they are made up of old people - the average age of UK union members is 46; the average age of all workers is just 34. </p> <p>John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, says: 'At the moment I think of little else. The whole future of trade unions depends on us demonstrating our value in new sectors. We can't just rest on our traditional heartlands of manufacturing and the public sector.' </p> <p>In July a seminar called Organising in the Network Economy was held by Union Network International, a Geneva-based umbrella organisation claiming affiliation from 15 million union members in 920 unions worldwide. It aims to encourage growth into high technology sectors. </p> <p>UNI's general secretary, Philip Jennings, says: 'The changes that information technology is bringing to the relationships between companies and their staff are creating firmer management and supervision, with less security. It is a massive transformation.' </p> <p>As UNI admits, the first problem is finding a clear starting point. There are few statistics revealing the penetration of unions into new-economy companies, some of which are hostile. </p> <p>'New organisations - Microsoft, Vodafone, anything owned by Rupert Murdoch - are very anti-union and determined to keep them out,' says Jennings. </p> <p>Older companies that start separate operations, such as mobile telecoms businesses, tend to set them up at arms length, free of union involvement. And the profile of their workforces is changing, too. A UNI paper states: 'Companies are churning their work forces... hiring younger people with more modern qualifications rather than retraining incumbent staff.' The physical environment of the new economy - greenfield offices or call centres - is a further barrier. </p> <p>Call centres burgeoned in the Nineties, with growth rates in the US and Europe of 30 to 40 per cent, and 100,000 jobs a year being created in Europe. The UK has led the way; 45 per cent of European call-centre capacity is located here. Call-centre operatives are forecast to outnumber teachers and farmers by 2002. </p> <p>Dai Davies, of financial services union Unifi, says: 'It is very hard to get into these places, and if you do, it is very difficult to talk to employees because supervision is so strict.' </p> <p>The problem for Unifi is growing as bank branches - membership strongholds - are closed. Membership has dropped from about 200,000 five years ago (in the three unions that formed Unifi) to 180,000 now - of whom 10,000 are in call centres. </p> <p>UNI says: 'A redundant worker who was a union member is invariably being replaced by a younger worker who is not a union member.' And it points out that membership among young workers is falling alarmingly. In Sweden, for example, the proportion of young unionised workers in 1993 was 62 per cent; by 1999 it was 47 per cent. </p> <p>Unions are also concerned that the growth in demand for IT professionals - the EU predicts a 1.7 million shortfall by 2003 - has led countries in the UK and the US to look to 'import' skilled workers from places such as India and Asia. Not only does this show that governments accept that companies are not prepared to retrain existing, possibly unionised workers, it creates another economically important group that has no traditional attachment to unions. </p> <p>But do new-economy employees need to organise? Of course, say the unions. The virtues of the new economy - flexibility, speed, opportunity - are virtues only to employers. To employees, they are vices - insecurity, intrusion, stress. </p> <p>Unions may be shunted out as old companies set up new businesses. But this provides unions a way into the new organisations - by tracking the former employees. The Communication Wor kers Union, nearly half of whose 280,000 members came from BT and other telecoms or engineering backgrounds, has been tracking members as BT has fragmented. </p> <p>'We have had to identify and follow the membership,' says Jeannie Drake, CWU deputy general secretary. 'First we look to those who leave BT, and try to get recognition in companies where they go. So, for example, CWU has recognition agreements in parts of telecoms groups such as Nortel, Global Crossing and Corning Cables. We also have to go into areas BT has bought into - such as retailer DX Communications.' </p> <p>But there remains an uncomfortably long list of 'priority targets', from big mobile-phone operators such as Vodafone and Orange, through cable companies and bigger internet operations. The CWU points to legislation - particularly the Employ ment Relations Act, which gives unions legal rights to recognition and to represent employees in grievances - as levers for breaking into new businesses. </p> <p>But it will be difficult. Five years ago the CWU had 160,000 members in telecoms - 150,000 in BT. Now it has 110,000, with 70,000 in BT. The erosion of the state monopoly has eaten away at union membership. </p> <p>This would all be very depressing if it were not for recent successful union action in the US - particularly a campaign by the CWU's counterpart, the Communication Workers of America. The CWA represented 35,000 employees at Verizon, a US telecoms company, who went on strike for two weeks last month over pay and conditions of work. </p> <p>The strike gave the CWA massive exposure and raised the issue of the power of unions within the new economy in the free-market US. But the terms of the settlement were as interesting as the dispute itself. It estab lished the right of workers to organise in the wireless division of Verizon - partly owned by Vodafone. As one influential American commentator remarked: 'Their willingness to strike, not over current workers' wages or benefits, but over the future of hi-tech unionism, suggests a new chapter in labour relations and a surprising foothold in the information economy.' </p> <p>Jeff Miller of the CWA says: 'We have been extremely aggressive in targeting new economy companies and trying to represent what employees want. There is clearly a demand for organisation and union representation in the new economy, and we are beginning to get that message through.'. </p> <p>Its tactics seem to be working. Since 1995 union membership among US workers has fallen from 15.5 per cent to 13.9 per cent. But the CWA has seen its membership rise, by 20 per cent. It now stands at around 630,000 - 500,000 of whom are in telecoms and 'new' sectors. Future targets include MCI Worldcom and internet companies such as Amazon. </p> <p>The Verizon action is just one of a number of disputes that indicate that IT workers are organising. Jennings points to a 47-day strike by 18,000 computer technician and engineer members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees at Boeing, triggered by a pay dispute. It was the largest white-collar dispute since the war. </p> <p>And unions are using the internet to organise themselves, running 'e-campaigns' and 'cyberpickets', where unions pressurise companies to update members on the progress of disputes and get petitions and protests signed via the net. Canada's Communication, Energy and Paper Workers Union (CEP) has 'cyberpicketed' the Calgary Herald newspaper - formerly owned by Conrad Black - over contract terms. </p> <p>The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTec) grew out of the software industry around Microsoft because of insecurity created by short-term contracts. </p> <p>It has 250 members in Microsoft and an online news service with 2,000 subscribers. Its aims are to 'work to make sick pay, holiday pay and decent medical coverage basic workplace rights'. A similar organisation exists at IBM, called Alliance@IBM. </p> <p>Joel Yudken, head of policy at the AFL-CIO, the national union federation, says: 'In the US the labour movement has turned a corner. Professionals in places like Verizon and Boeing are speaking out. In the new economy you see a feeling of growing insecurity. They are beginning to look to unions to help.' That is what lies behind CWA's increase. </p> <p>The UK's communications union certainly wants to emulate its US cousins. In five years' time it hopes that the majority of its members will be outside BT, and that membership will have passed the 160,000 level of five years ago. But will enough workers answer its call? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk\">oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

It now stands at around 630,000 - 500,000 of whom are in telecoms and 'new' sectors. Future targets include MCI Worldcom and internet companies such as Amazon. The Verizon action is just one of a number of disputes that indicate that IT workers are organising. Jennings points to a 47-day strike by 18,000 computer technician and engineer members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees at Boeing, triggered by a pay dispute. It was the largest white-collar dispute since the war. And unions are using the internet to organise themselves, running 'e-campaigns' and 'cyberpickets', where unions pressurise companies to update members on the progress of disputes and get petitions and protests signed via the net. Canada's Communication, Energy and Paper Workers Union (CEP) has 'cyberpicketed' the Calgary Herald newspaper - formerly owned by Conrad Black - over contract terms. The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTec) grew out of the software industry around Microsoft because of insecurity created by short-term contracts. It has 250 members in Microsoft and an online news service with 2,000 subscribers. Its aims are to 'work to make sick pay, holiday pay and decent medical coverage basic workplace rights'. A similar organisation exists at IBM, called Alliance@IBM. Joel Yudken, head of policy at the AFL-CIO, the national union federation, says: 'In the US the labour movement has turned a corner. Professionals in places like Verizon and Boeing are speaking out. In the new economy you see a feeling of growing insecurity. They are beginning to look to unions to help.' That is what lies behind CWA's increase. The UK's communications union certainly wants to emulate its US cousins. In five years' time it hopes that the majority of its members will be outside BT, and that membership will have passed the 160,000 level of five years ago. But will enough workers answer its call? oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk",

Over eight years, from the age of only 25, John Michael Clegg built Wace from a near-bankrupt stock market shell into the world's biggest provider of pre-press photographic and design services to the advertising and media industries. Until January 1992, that is, when the fast-talking City whizz kid quit abruptly, blaming wild rumours about his alleged links with the IRA for destabilising the company. </p> <p>Clegg firmly denied terrorist connections. But the authorities had taken the talk seriously enough to convene a secret meeting at the Stock Exchange the previous summer. Present were representatives from the Royal Ulster Constabulary's C13 anti-racketeering squad, the Serious Fraud Office, the Bank of England and the exchange's own insider dealing unit. The inquiry, however, was shelved and no evidence found to back up the gossip. </p> <p>The truth about Clegg and some of his family's murky dealings has now finally been revealed, after an eight-and-a-half year inquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry. Stretching to 300 pages, the DTI's report tells a tale of fraud, lies, deception, insider dealing, forgery and fake bank accounts. The story is a cocktail of high stakes finance and slapstick farce. And the biggest surprise is not that after all this time no further action is likely, but that the book on Wace was not closed sooner. </p> <p>Clegg, his father John Henry and uncle Albert - the three villains of the piece - had long since skipped abroad, their whereabouts unknown. In all, the DTI inspectors say they used no fewer than 29 aliases for secret wheeler-dealing in Wace and its takeover targets, Parkway, European Colour and Tinsley Robor. </p> <p>Members of the extended Clegg family across three continents piled into the shares - so many of them, indeed, that it quickly became a standing joke in the boardroom. One ex-Wace director said it was a tradition to ask: 'Come on John, who is this one?' Clegg's invariable response was: 'I am sorry, but I have a lot of relations.' </p> <p>The trio ruthlessly booked deals in the names of their relatives, several of whom had no idea that their names were being used. A two-month-old baby, long dead acquain tances and non-existent associates were among the characters to turn up on share registers, in offshore bank accounts and on a confetti of fake documents. Wace's advisers and the trio's numerous bankers were hoodwinked, said the DTI, which cleared them of any complicity. </p> <p>'Mr J M Clegg was an extremely convincing individual whose subsequent domination of the Wace board increased in proportion with the company's spectacular growth by acquisition into a major plc,' the inspectors concluded. </p> <p>'Most notably we believe he benefited from substantial secret dealings in the shares of Wace, European Colour, Tinsley Robor and Parkway through bank accounts in his name at Credit Suisse and... with Anglo Irish Bank.' </p> <p>Clegg's first involvement with Wace was based on a lie. Casting around for a shell company, he and his father lighted on the struggling firm in 1983. Their initial \u00a3270,000 investment, they said, came from a wealthy cousin of Clegg's in South Africa. </p> <p>In fact, she was Clegg's half-sister, Jayne Wright, a 19-year-old love child from an affair his father had in the mid-Sixties. The money, it is believed, came from the sale of a ragbag of properties the Cleggs owned in Sheffield. Clegg barely knew Wright and she had, the inspectors found, no idea of the secret deals in her name. </p> <p>Nor, later on, had her husband and baby daughter, whose names were also used. The marriage collapsed under the strain of the revelations. But, with poetic justice, in 1993 she sued for control of accounts and properties in her name, robbing Clegg and his father of \u00a310 million of their ill-gotten gains. </p> <p>Clegg's whole life, indeed, may have been a cruel deception. Born on a holiday in Nice in 1958, he was christened William - the name later used on the Anglo Irish Bank account for many of his share deals. </p> <p>A month later, at the British consulate in Marseilles, his father registered a new name. The reason, said witnesses, was not just that his wife wanted John, but that her sister was Clegg's real mother. Clegg, meanwhile, was 'astonished' to hear of the first birth certificate. The inspectors concluded drily: 'Clearly we are not in a position to say who the parents of Mr J M Clegg are.' </p> <p>Clegg's father and uncle had an equally colourful background. Identical twins, they were born in Sheffield in 1919, the sons of a bookmaker turned property developer, and both had been bankrupted by the Inland Revenue. They would regularly impersonate one another. 'They operate false passports ... they can shuffle them up like playing cards,' one witness said. </p> <p>In the Sixties, the twins first punted on the stock market and ran their own firm, South Yorkshire Motor Insurance, which was wound up by the DTI in 1967. That set alarm bells ringing early at Wace, but it was young Clegg, after all, who was on the board, and the directors comforted themselves with his training as a solicitor at respected City law firm, Nabarro Nathanson. </p> <p>In fact both his father and uncle quickly and secretly moved into Wace. Using the aliases Michael and Albert Clark, and operating as Geoffrey's Securities Services, they were first handed the wages collection contract. Father and son advised the board on deals. The directors had no idea of the connection. </p> <p>Albert, too, had the run of the place as Wace's janitor, gaining the nickname 'Uncle Geoffrey'. They were 'like two peas in a pod', said company secretary Finlay Scott Ritchie. 'You could only tell who was who by the fact that one usually saw Michael Clark in a suit and Uncle Geoffrey was usually in a mess.' </p> <p>Wace expanded rapidly by acquisition. Nevertheless, and entirely unknown to the outside world, Clegg family members and friends at one point owned more than 40 per cent of the company. Clegg's failure to disclose such dealings repeatedly misled investors and broke the law, the inspectors found. </p> <p>In 1986, the Clegg trio unsuccessfully tried to pressurise European Colour, an inkmaker, into a deal. They spread false rumours in the market, the DTI found, built up a large secret stake and, using aliases, the twins heckled the European Colour board at its annual meeting. </p> <p>The pattern was repeated from 1998 to 1990 at the print and packaging group Tinsley Robor, where Wace and certain members of Clegg's fam ily built up a 25 per cent stake. One of the aliases used to hide the buying was Harold Staniforth, someone the twins had known during their childhood in Sheffield but who had died in 1930 at age 11. </p> <p>As Staniforth, in reality Uncle Albert, was then being hunted by private detectives working for the retail broker Sharelink to recover a debt it was hardly surprising when Clegg mused that it was 'not the most suitable name' to have used. This did not prevent Clegg from vouching for the long-dead 'Staniforth'. 'We can only surmise how, 58 years after Mr H Staniforth died, Mr J M Clegg claimed to the Wace board to have met him,' the inspectors wrote. </p> <p>By 1990, Wace had turned its guns on Parkway, its main rival, which had hit serious financial trouble. After long and tortuous negotiations, Wace clinched the deal for \u00a311m that August. Once again the Clegg trio built up a large undeclared stake. In all, Wace and Clegg family members owned 17.8 per cent of Parkway. 'As the tempo built up in the takeover discussions... so did the purchases of shares in Parkway by certain members of the Clegg family,' the DTI inspectors said. </p> <p>'If the true facts had been publicly available in 1990, this would have led to Mr J M Clegg's immediate removal from the Wace board and the possible abandonment of the proposed takeover.' </p> <p>This time the secret stakebuilding did raise alarm bells at Wace's advisers, BZW. The Wace board, too, finally pressed the issue, employing a private detective to gather evidence. Wace's dossier was handed to the DTI in early 1992, and within weeks the inspectors were appointed. </p> <p>The market at last sensed a scandal. Wace's shares plunged in value by 40 per cent after the Parkway deal. The Clegg trio, however, had already secretly made their escape.

      "body": "<p>Business folklore has it that when property developers unleash schemes so grandiose as to border on the absurd, it heralds the first sign of economic catastrophe. And they don't come much more grandiose than plans for a 1,200ft-high skyscraper next to London Bridge station. </p> <p>The man behind the London Bridge tower is Irvine Sellar, a colourful entrepreneur who personally lost \u00a330 million in 1991 when his former company went belly-up - a victim of double-digit interest rates, negative growth and the Gulf War. </p> <p>Sellar, who made his first fortune selling bell-bottom jeans on Carnaby Street, told The Observer that plans for what could be Europe's highest building will be submitted by the end of the year. It will cost \u00a3600m, but there's every chance that the 86-storey neck-strainer, 400ft higher than Canary Wharf, will rise next to the Thames in 2003. </p> <p>Planning authorities have encouraged Sellar to reach for the sky, and he claims that a mixture of his company's equity and debt from UK clearing banks will leave this lasting legacy on London's skyline. </p> <p>Now in his late fifties, Sellar endured sleepless nights when his company went bust. 'The memory and lessons of that time are indelibly printed on my mind,' he says. 'But I can't see any clouds on the horizon. I assume they're there though.' </p> <p>The project is one of an unprecedented number of ambitious skyscraper schemes. Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool all want them, and 10 are mooted in London. </p> <p>Skyscrapers are the most obvious sign of a business community brimming with virile confidence. Today that confidence in property circles is based on the startling growth of office rents in central London: they have climbed by 30 per cent already this year, to an all-time record of \u00a380 a sq ft in London's Mayfair. Excited London surveyors now believe it won't be long before we see \u00a395 a sq ft. </p> <p>The rise has been caused by surging demand for space from dotcoms, from telecoms companies and from media and financial institutions, whose penchant for mergers has created the need for new offices. </p> <p>Consequently investors from Ireland, the US and the Middle East all want to buy into UK real estate. In the first six months of this year, a record \u00a33.6bn of commercial property changed hands in London alone, according to research from property consultant Knight Frank. This has yielded the Treasury and commercial lawyers about \u00a3100m each, from stamp duty and conveyancing fees, respectively. </p> <p>And still the party swings: a record number of offices are up for sale in the final quarter of this year. Prices may dip slightly, but that's due to the sheer weight of real estate coming on to the market. </p> <p>'We are six years into a period of sustained growth and I've never known an upturn to last this long,' says Michael Slade, chief executive of Helical Bar, one of the few quoted property companies respected by City institutions. 'But everything is focused on London and the South East. Labour will travel. People are commuting from Leicester to the Thames Valley every day. Computers and the IT revolution have finally hit home. You don't need provincial offices anymore. You just need to be close to where the action is.' </p> <p>There are those who say that a 50 per cent rise in construction starts this year signals that the property industry is overreaching itself. But what sent legendary figures such as Gerald Ronson, Godfrey Bradman and Stuart Lipton over the financial edge was loans secured on the basis of 'floating' interest rates. When a rise in those rates combined with a contracting economy, disaster struck. Today fixed-rate loans are the norm, and virtually every victim of the early Nineties recession is thriving. </p> <p>The property industry has engineered one of the most controlled and 'managed' property booms ever - capitalism at its most efficient. The instinct to build speculatively has been kept at bay, which means that should things turn nasty, there will be few property financial casualties. </p> <p>Most UK quoted property firms, whose shares are trading at an average 25 per cent discount to their net asset value, have this year been forced to shift focus to appeasing restless City investors. Companies such as MEPC, Prestbury and Green Properties have all left an unsympathetic stock market. Many others have launched share buy-back schemes to bolster performance. </p> <p>City concerns are heightened by the potential oil crisis and worries about whether London can remain a financial centre if it stays outside the eurozone. </p> <p>The talk in London is that there could soon be a shortage of land for new offices - hence the resurgence of towers. But still there is that nagging feeling that skyscrapers spell doom. How long will the wider business community be prepared to pay booming office rents? A camel's back can only take so much.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Business folklore has it that when property developers unleash schemes so grandiose as to border on the absurd, it heralds the first sign of economic catastrophe. And they don't come much more grandiose than plans for a 1,200ft-high skyscraper next to London Bridge station. The man behind the London Bridge tower is Irvine Sellar, a colourful entrepreneur who personally lost \u00a330 million in 1991 when his former company went belly-up - a victim of double-digit interest rates, negative growth and the Gulf War. Sellar, who made his first fortune selling bell-bottom jeans on Carnaby Street, told The Observer that plans for what could be Europe's highest building will be submitted by the end of the year. It will cost \u00a3600m, but there's every chance that the 86-storey neck-strainer, 400ft higher than Canary Wharf, will rise next to the Thames in 2003. Planning authorities have encouraged Sellar to reach for the sky, and he claims that a mixture of his company's equity and debt from UK clearing banks will leave this lasting legacy on London's skyline. Now in his late fifties, Sellar endured sleepless nights when his company went bust. 'The memory and lessons of that time are indelibly printed on my mind,' he says. 'But I can't see any clouds on the horizon. I assume they're there though.' The project is one of an unprecedented number of ambitious skyscraper schemes. Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool all want them, and 10 are mooted in London. Skyscrapers are the most obvious sign of a business community brimming with virile confidence. Today that confidence in property circles is based on the startling growth of office rents in central London: they have climbed by 30 per cent already this year, to an all-time record of \u00a380 a sq ft in London's Mayfair. Excited London surveyors now believe it won't be long before we see \u00a395 a sq ft. The rise has been caused by surging demand for space from dotcoms, from telecoms companies and from media and financial institutions, whose penchant for mergers has created the need for new offices. Consequently investors from Ireland, the US and the Middle East all want to buy into UK real estate. In the first six months of this year, a record \u00a33.6bn of commercial property changed hands in London alone, according to research from property consultant Knight Frank. This has yielded the Treasury and commercial lawyers about \u00a3100m each, from stamp duty and conveyancing fees, respectively. And still the party swings: a record number of offices are up for sale in the final quarter of this year. Prices may dip slightly, but that's due to the sheer weight of real estate coming on to the market. 'We are six years into a period of sustained growth and I've never known an upturn to last this long,' says Michael Slade, chief executive of Helical Bar, one of the few quoted property companies respected by City institutions. 'But everything is focused on London and the South East. Labour will travel. People are commuting from Leicester to the Thames Valley every day. Computers and the IT revolution have finally hit home. You don't need provincial offices anymore. You just need to be close to where the action is.' There are those who say that a 50 per cent rise in construction starts this year signals that the property industry is overreaching itself. But what sent legendary figures such as Gerald Ronson, Godfrey Bradman and Stuart Lipton over the financial edge was loans secured on the basis of 'floating' interest rates. When a rise in those rates combined with a contracting economy, disaster struck. Today fixed-rate loans are the norm, and virtually every victim of the early Nineties recession is thriving. The property industry has engineered one of the most controlled and 'managed' property booms ever - capitalism at its most efficient. The instinct to build speculatively has been kept at bay, which means that should things turn nasty, there will be few property financial casualties. Most UK quoted property firms, whose shares are trading at an average 25 per cent discount to their net asset value, have this year been forced to shift focus to appeasing restless City investors. Companies such as MEPC, Prestbury and Green Properties have all left an unsympathetic stock market. Many others have launched share buy-back schemes to bolster performance. City concerns are heightened by the potential oil crisis and worries about whether London can remain a financial centre if it stays outside the eurozone. The talk in London is that there could soon be a shortage of land for new offices - hence the resurgence of towers. But still there is that nagging feeling that skyscrapers spell doom. How long will the wider business community be prepared to pay booming office rents? A camel's back can only take so much.",

      "bodyText": "The former boss of media services group Wace and certain members of his family committed insider dealing on a huge scale, a long-awaited Department of Trade &amp; Industry report has concluded. The report has found that John Clegg, Wace's former chief executive, his father and his uncle were guilty of flagrant breaches of company law and Stock Exchange rules from 1984 to 1992. DTI inspectors were appointed in February 1992 to investigate share dealings in Wace and three of the firm's takeover targets: Parkway, European Colour and Tinsley Robor. From 1984, Clegg built Wace into the world's top pre-press services group, but he quit in January 1992 following unfounded rumours of alleged IRA involvement. Controversially, however, the DTI plans to take no further action. Clegg, his father and his uncle fled the country during the investigation. They were last understood to be in Florida, Chicago and Australia respectively, but the DTI has no idea where they are now. The inquiry was conducted under Section 442 of the Companies Act and, after its failure to extradite convicted fraudster Roger Levitt from the US for alleged offences under the Act, the DTI is wary of further humiliation. 'The prime culprits are no longer under the jurisdiction of the UK courts,' a DTI spokesman said. 'If they come within UK jurisdiction, we will consider what further action to take.' The report was published without fanfare by the DTI on 31 August. Just three Companies Act reports remain to be published: investigations into Robert Maxwell and the Mirror Group flotation, the demise of hotel firm Queen's Moat Houses and DTI grant applications by former Paymaster-General Geoffrey Robinson's collapsed engineering firm, Transtec. Wace was finally taken over by US rival Applied Graphics Technologies last year. The DTI report concluded that Clegg, and his father and uncle made millions from insider dealing using aliases and offshore bank accounts. The three hoodwinked Credit Suisse, Anglo Irish Bank, NatWest and many others into opening accounts in false names. The DTI cleared banks and advisers used by the trio of any blame.",

They claim it is as if a man went in for a vasectomy and woke up to find he had been castrated. Doctors insist the procedures are necessary to save the patients' lives. </p> <p>A study at one London hospital suggests the number of cases has increased sevenfold in the past 10 years. It shows women who have previously had a caesarean are far more likely to be at risk, with as many as one in 90 being given a hysterectomy at the same time as the birth. The women cannot give their consent because they are under anaesthetic. </p> <p>Caesarean sections cause a scar inside the womb which can open up during the next birth. If the womb splits it can lead to a haemorrhage that can only be stopped by a total hysterectomy. Many of the mothers claim they are not clearly told of the risks beforehand, or that they are pressured into having a caesarean against their will. </p> <p>Beverley Beech, chair of the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services, says she has been contacted by an increasing number of mothers who suffered emergency hysterectomies. 'These women are devastated. Some say they would never have given consent and would have preferred to die. Their husbands are finding it difficult to cope with their wives' despair and are distraught,' she said. </p> <p>Elaine Russell, from Manchester, said medical complacency led to her having a caesarean birth so late in her fourth pregnancy that her womb split. The doctor decided to do a hysterectomy. Despite asking to be put to sleep, Elaine was under local anaesthetic and awake during the entire three-and-a-half hour operation. </p> <p>'I can't believe the way I was treated. I was a fertile person, and now I've got no womb. I would have liked more children. I feel so damaged by it all. I'm finding it very hard to come to terms with,' she told The Observer. 'I was horrified by the whole event, and it's deeply affected my life. It's like surgical rape.' </p> <p>In some cases women can lose their womb after their first baby. Other cases uncovered by The Observer include: </p> <p>\u0095 a Scottish mother who was given too much of the drug prostaglandin to induce her first baby and was overstimulated. Her womb ruptured, and she lost the baby and had an emergency hysterectomy; </p> <p>\u0095 a woman who was pressured into having a caesarean, and woke up to be told she had also been given a hysterectomy. She says she was not given an adequate explanation; </p> <p>\u0095 a woman who was told she was being taken back to the operating theatre to have her womb sewn up, to stop bleeding after her second baby was born. She woke up without a womb. </p> <p>A study in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology found that the number of women having caesarean hysterectomies at St George's Hospital in London has risen sevenfold. In the early Nineties only one in 7,000 women who gave birth at the hospital had to have a hysterectomy. At the end of the decade it had risen to one in 1,000 mothers. </p> <p>However, the risks rise sharply if the mother has previously already had a caesarean birth. The study suggested that one in 90 women who had already had a caesarean section ended up having a hysterectomy immediately after the birth. </p> <p>The author, Dr Deborah Gould, said: 'Strikingly, women with a past history of caesarean section appeared to be up to 27 times more likely to require obstetric hysterectomy than women who have not had a previous caesarean section. We are now seeing hysterectomy being increasingly performed as a consequence of previous delivery by caesarean section.' </p> <p>The proportion of mothers given caesareans has risen steadily in recent years. In 1989 only 11 per cent of births were by caesarean, but that had risen to 18 per cent by last year. In some hospitals, almost a third of babies are delivered by caesarean. Department of Health figures suggest there were 64 caesarean hysterectomies last year, although that might underestimate the scale of the problem. </p> <p>Gina Lowdon, caesarean co-ordinator of the National Childbirth Trust, said: 'All the risks from caesareans are on the increase because the number of caesareans are rising dramatically. They are doing it so much they are becoming blas\u00e9, and not doing them as carefully as they used to.' </p> <p>Beech claimed: 'Many of these caesareans are being given by junior doctors, who are making mistakes. They're then doing hysterectomies to save themselves - it's a rescue job. These things are predominantly caused by the meddling with child-birth, the medicalisation of childbirth.' </p> <p>Gould warned that if caesarean births carried on being so popular the problem of emergency hysterectomies would increase. She wrote: 'It appears that hysterectomy may have an increasing role in future obstetric practice, particularly in view of the progressive increase in caesarean section rates. It is essential that obstetricians continue to be trained in major pelvic surgery.' </p> <p>For advice, contact the Association for Improvements in Maternity Services on 01753 652 781; or the National Childbirth Trust helpline on 020 8992 8637. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\"> anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Spike Lee has just made the most successful film of his career. It doesn't feature one of Denzel Washington's seemingly effortless portrayals of a complex, troubled man. Nor does it feature Lee's inventive use of colour, or an upside down camera, or references to the work of his heroes Wilder, Godard, Scorsese or Kazan. This time round, all Lee did was point a cheap video camera at a stage and record four guys talking. But if you look at the figures on a per cinema basis, Original Kings Of Comedy has outperformed most of the big summer hits. </p> <p>Maybe that isn't a surprise. After all the confused signals Hollywood has been picking up this summer - Are stars in or out? Are historical epics worth it (Gladiator) or possibly not (The Patriot) - one thing seems clear: black men being funny works. Big Momma's House featuring Martin Lawrence and Scary Movie, which starred and was written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, have been unexpected blockbusters. And this in a summer when neither Will Smith nor aspirant superstar Chris Tucker had a film out. What's going on? </p> <p>Perhaps the best place to begin is Eddie Murphy's latest hit star vehicle, The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, which reaches these shores in October. Not because the film has that much going for it: it's the usual mix of gooey good-heartedness and gross-out comedy, with the obesity of the Klump family (almost all played by Murphy) as the starting point for most of the jokes. But long before he re-emerged as a movie star with Nutty Professor, Murphy was a vital figure in the evolution of black comedy, both at his peak and because his career crisis prompted a search for the next Eddie Murphy which belatedly spawned this year's stars. </p> <p>Before Murphy, of course, there were Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. Cosby was the original. In the early Sixties he was the first black stand-up to cross over to a mainstream (that's to say mainly white) audience. Inspired by him, Pryor started off with a similar vein of amiable humour. But he was a different kind of man, scarred by a horrendous childhood (he grew up a brothel). Liberated by the influence of Malcolm X and Lenny Bruce, he became an incendiary performer, brilliant but openly self-loathing. 'Pryor started everything. He's Yoda,' says Scary Movie director Keenan Ivory Wayans. </p> <p>That Pryor became seen as the anti-Cosby doesn't mean there was antagonism between the two: when they appeared together in California Suite (1978), Pryor insisted Cosby get paid equally with him. But while Cosby rarely ruffled his audiences, here's a Pryor joke at the expense of Martin Luther King: 'I have been to the mountain top too, and what did I see? More white people with guns.' </p> <p> But with a few exceptions - Blue Collar, Uptown Saturday Night, the script for Blazing Saddles - Pryor's film career never did justice to his talent. Yet despite massive drug abuse, he was hugely successful in the late Seventies, especially paired with Gene Wilder in Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980). In 1983, when the decline had set in, he was still getting paid more than Christopher Reeve to appear in Superman III. </p> <p>In those days Hollywood was willing to accommodate one famous funny black at a time (just as even today, executives are unsure that there is room for both Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek). So as Pryor stalled, Eddie Murphy rose. It's worth remembering just how big Murphy was at his peak: not just popular, around the time of Beverly Hills Cop (1984) he was as central to the feel of the mid-80s as Madonna or Prince or Miami Vice.</p> <p>His stage act, packed with four letter words and a rather insistent homophobia, was clearly influenced by Pryor, but coming from a stable middle-class background, he lacked the same inner rage. 'I've only been called \"nigger\" once in my life. There is very little anger in my humour,' he admitted. Murphy's hero, his obsession, turned out to be Elvis. But despite steering clear of drink and drugs, Murphy too found his career dipping violently in the late Eighties, mostly caused by an inability to chose decent films. </p> <p>In the short term the vacuum wasn't filled. But Murphy's Eighties superstardom, plus the memory of Pryor at his best, had inspired ambitious young black men to try comedy, and given the space to do so, especially on a couple of seminal TV shows. And it is that generation who are just reaching their peak now. Various Wayans brothers could be seen on In Living Color in the early Nineties. Most of the rest - including Chris Tucker and Martin Lawrence - appeared on Def Comedy Jam, which ran from 1993 to 1996. </p> <p>Many of them, including Lawrence, went down the sitcom route, but Tucker - a stand-up with a helium voice and a knack for physical comedy - was determined not to get stuck doing TV. The movies, he reasoned, were where the real stars were. He got his break when he starred with Ice Cube in the laidback 'hood comedy Friday . The film did OK in the cinemas but was hugely successful on video. Soon he was appearing in Luc Besson's deranged The Fifth Element and Tarantino's Jackie Brown, and co-starring with Charlie Sheen in Money Talks and Jackie Chan in Rush Hour. </p> <p>It was Rush Hour that made him a real star, one who can command the same kind of money that Eddie Murphy can. By doing The Fifth Element and by making a film with Chan, Tucker ensured he made a name in the vast film market outside the US, where black film stars usually struggle. So when he decided he wanted to make a film where he plays the first black president, Bill Clinton let him tag along for a few days. Which meant it was no surprise that Tucker gently declined Ice Cube's request that he appear in the sequel to Friday. Playing a neighbourhood slacker with a huge marijuana habit was no longer part of the plan (the film, incidentally, was a hit without him). </p> <p>Tucker talks about Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks as his inspirations. And why not? He doesn't come from the bullet-strewn streets of the South Bronx: he's from a middle class suburb of Atlanta. 'I always have thought in terms of the largest possible audience,' he says. 'I want everyone to relate to what I am doing. And that's been easy, because in my career I haven't experienced any racism.' </p> <p>You can hear the echoes of Murphy there. It is tempting to see traces of the Cosby-Pryor divide in the contrast between Chris Tucker and Chris Rock, not least because people often confuse the two. Rock is the opposite of Tucker in many ways: he's working class from Brooklyn, his comedy is entirely verbal, he likes working on TV, being a stand-up is more central to his career, and he doesn't see the world in colour-blind terms: his most recent TV special was called Bigger and Blacker. But, equally, Rock has pointed out that since only around 12 per cent of Americans are black, anyone who keeps it too 'real' is going to have a very limited career. His comedy idols included Woody Allen and Jerry Seinfeld as well as the inevitable Pryor, and his last two films have been for loquacious white directors Kevin Smith (Dogma) and Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty, released last week). </p> <p>But while Pryor and Cosby were effectively unchallenged, Rock and Tucker are far from alone. Big Momma's House was one of the most surprising successes of the summer. The star, Lawrence, shared equal billing with Will Smith (1993's Bad Boys) and Eddie Murphy (last year's Life). But only now has he reached the A-list. Big Momma's House is a terrible film, but like The Nutty Professor II, it uses the conceit of having a young-ish man play a fat, elderly woman. And that seems to go down endlessly well with the American public: Big Momma's House has picked up $119m, turning a tidy profit on its $30m budget. Some black commentators have worried that this film, and The Klumps, exploit fried chicken-chomping stereotypes. Spike Lee's next film, Bamboozled , attacks US television's predilection for lowbrow black comedy shows. But at the current level of success, Hollywood couldn't care less. </p> <p>There is a mystery underlying all this: comedy on US TV remains stubbornly segregated. Blacks won't watch Friends or Frasier, whites refused to watch Murphy's animated show The PJs. Martin Lawrence's sitcom Malcolm ran for four years without ever being a true mainstream success, while the Wayans brothers' TV show was cancelled not long before Scary Movie took off. </p> <p>The acts in Original Kings Of Comedy are also TV regulars, without troubling the higher reaches of the ratings.

      "bodyText": "Spike Lee has just made the most successful film of his career. It doesn't feature one of Denzel Washington's seemingly effortless portrayals of a complex, troubled man. Nor does it feature Lee's inventive use of colour, or an upside down camera, or references to the work of his heroes Wilder, Godard, Scorsese or Kazan. This time round, all Lee did was point a cheap video camera at a stage and record four guys talking. But if you look at the figures on a per cinema basis, Original Kings Of Comedy has outperformed most of the big summer hits. Maybe that isn't a surprise. After all the confused signals Hollywood has been picking up this summer - Are stars in or out? Are historical epics worth it (Gladiator) or possibly not (The Patriot) - one thing seems clear: black men being funny works. Big Momma's House featuring Martin Lawrence and Scary Movie, which starred and was written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, have been unexpected blockbusters. And this in a summer when neither Will Smith nor aspirant superstar Chris Tucker had a film out. What's going on? Perhaps the best place to begin is Eddie Murphy's latest hit star vehicle, The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, which reaches these shores in October. Not because the film has that much going for it: it's the usual mix of gooey good-heartedness and gross-out comedy, with the obesity of the Klump family (almost all played by Murphy) as the starting point for most of the jokes. But long before he re-emerged as a movie star with Nutty Professor, Murphy was a vital figure in the evolution of black comedy, both at his peak and because his career crisis prompted a search for the next Eddie Murphy which belatedly spawned this year's stars. Before Murphy, of course, there were Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. Cosby was the original. In the early Sixties he was the first black stand-up to cross over to a mainstream (that's to say mainly white) audience. Inspired by him, Pryor started off with a similar vein of amiable humour. But he was a different kind of man, scarred by a horrendous childhood (he grew up a brothel). Liberated by the influence of Malcolm X and Lenny Bruce, he became an incendiary performer, brilliant but openly self-loathing. 'Pryor started everything. He's Yoda,' says Scary Movie director Keenan Ivory Wayans. That Pryor became seen as the anti-Cosby doesn't mean there was antagonism between the two: when they appeared together in California Suite (1978), Pryor insisted Cosby get paid equally with him. But while Cosby rarely ruffled his audiences, here's a Pryor joke at the expense of Martin Luther King: 'I have been to the mountain top too, and what did I see? More white people with guns.' But with a few exceptions - Blue Collar, Uptown Saturday Night, the script for Blazing Saddles - Pryor's film career never did justice to his talent. Yet despite massive drug abuse, he was hugely successful in the late Seventies, especially paired with Gene Wilder in Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980). In 1983, when the decline had set in, he was still getting paid more than Christopher Reeve to appear in Superman III. In those days Hollywood was willing to accommodate one famous funny black at a time (just as even today, executives are unsure that there is room for both Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek). So as Pryor stalled, Eddie Murphy rose. It's worth remembering just how big Murphy was at his peak: not just popular, around the time of Beverly Hills Cop (1984) he was as central to the feel of the mid-80s as Madonna or Prince or Miami Vice. His stage act, packed with four letter words and a rather insistent homophobia, was clearly influenced by Pryor, but coming from a stable middle-class background, he lacked the same inner rage.

      "body": "<p><strong> Life in the Jungle: My Autobiography</strong><br>Michael Heseltine<br>Hodder &amp; Stoughton \u00a320, pp542<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450380,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Representative democracy cannot live without characters. The theatre of big egos and sprawling talents keeps the audience's interest alive. People say it's only the issues that matter, but as soon as the theatre folds, the audience melts away. For that reason, Michael Heseltine has been one of the great servants of British democratic life since the Seventies, a vivid, preening carnivore who helped put the life into arguments that convulsed the country. From council house sales to CND, Toxteth to Margaret Thatcher, at some time or other Heseltine has provoked gurgles of private agreement and teeth-grindings of angry dissent in half the kitchens of the nation. </p> <p>We know, or think we do, the main outlines of his story - the dyslexic schoolboy who made a fortune in low-rent hotels and magazines, became a Heathite Tory MP, a technocratic Minister, Margaret Thatcher's great enemy, the 'nearly man' who might have been Prime Minister or party leader on at least three occasions but who didn't, and has now retired to contemplate, rather than swing among, his fine collection of trees. </p> <p>British political memoirs tend to follow a predictable pattern. The early life, with its interesting revelations of family eccentricity and tough, ambition-forging times, is followed by the Oxbridge years, when lifelong political friendships and contacts are formed. Then comes the breathless account of the first constituency campaign, the charmingly self-mocking account of that terrifying maiden speech, the gruff advice from Sir Old Salt MP - what a character! - then the tramp, tramp, tramp of departmental achievements. As he tramps, Our Hero absolves himself from any errors other memoirs attack him for, and energetically reheats ancient grudges. </p> <p>Wives appear in a blur. Children provide a few paragraphs of amusing background colour. A couple of imperfectly remembered jokes are hastily inserted after the first read-through. And - hey presto! - it's time to call the chap at the Daily Mail who apparently pays such a lot to extract the microwaved grudges. Strangely, Our Hero has no examples of his own of petty spite, failure of vision or genuine remorse to record. </p> <p>This autobiography follows the pattern but it is vastly better than most. Heseltine says he does not find writing (or reading) easy and he is not an exciting prose writer. But, presumably thanks to veteran journalist Anthony Howard, who has been a close friend since student days and helped with it, this is one of the most elegant, politically informative and, in the widest sense, literate reviews of a political life in many years. It is not up there with the great autobiographies of Healey or Jenkins, but it stands easy comparison with Thatcher, Major or Lawson. </p> <p>Like many people, I always found Heseltine rather aloof, wary, even cold. He is certainly a private man. His frank account of the catastrophic effect of his father's early death is not followed by much later soul-baring. The general tone is of wry lack of self-pity, amusement at the pitfalls and treacheries of political life and disdain, rather than anger, for old enemies such as Airey Neave, Normans Tebbit, Lamont and Thatcher herself. </p> <p>It is impressive rather than endearing. And indeed it is a curious tribute to the British class system that a Swansea boy who made his fortune in London bedsits and commercial magazines and who was much lampooned as a wideboy 'who has to buy his own furniture' should, in his sixties, have the aura of a very grand grandee indeed, the nearest Blair's Britain has to a Whig aristo. </p> <p>So why is the book so good, lacking as it does the easy bile, the maudlin revelations or the gossip that mostly keeps us reading? Close students of the great dramas of Heseltine's career - his near-bankruptcy, the mace-waving, his Cabinet resignation, his leadership challenge, his involvement in the Ponting or Matrix Churchill cases, won't even find much new information on those, though the Westland story is one that still makes me seethe when I read it. </p> <p>No, the cheering, old-fashioned answer is that Life in the Jungle is crammed with detail and serious explanation about many of the issues that have mattered most to Heseltine and Britain over the years.

      "bodyText": "Life in the Jungle: My Autobiography Michael Heseltine Hodder &amp; Stoughton \u00a320, pp542 Buy it at BOL Representative democracy cannot live without characters. The theatre of big egos and sprawling talents keeps the audience's interest alive. People say it's only the issues that matter, but as soon as the theatre folds, the audience melts away. For that reason, Michael Heseltine has been one of the great servants of British democratic life since the Seventies, a vivid, preening carnivore who helped put the life into arguments that convulsed the country. From council house sales to CND, Toxteth to Margaret Thatcher, at some time or other Heseltine has provoked gurgles of private agreement and teeth-grindings of angry dissent in half the kitchens of the nation. We know, or think we do, the main outlines of his story - the dyslexic schoolboy who made a fortune in low-rent hotels and magazines, became a Heathite Tory MP, a technocratic Minister, Margaret Thatcher's great enemy, the 'nearly man' who might have been Prime Minister or party leader on at least three occasions but who didn't, and has now retired to contemplate, rather than swing among, his fine collection of trees. British political memoirs tend to follow a predictable pattern. The early life, with its interesting revelations of family eccentricity and tough, ambition-forging times, is followed by the Oxbridge years, when lifelong political friendships and contacts are formed. Then comes the breathless account of the first constituency campaign, the charmingly self-mocking account of that terrifying maiden speech, the gruff advice from Sir Old Salt MP - what a character! - then the tramp, tramp, tramp of departmental achievements. As he tramps, Our Hero absolves himself from any errors other memoirs attack him for, and energetically reheats ancient grudges. Wives appear in a blur. Children provide a few paragraphs of amusing background colour. A couple of imperfectly remembered jokes are hastily inserted after the first read-through. And - hey presto! - it's time to call the chap at the Daily Mail who apparently pays such a lot to extract the microwaved grudges. Strangely, Our Hero has no examples of his own of petty spite, failure of vision or genuine remorse to record. This autobiography follows the pattern but it is vastly better than most. Heseltine says he does not find writing (or reading) easy and he is not an exciting prose writer. But, presumably thanks to veteran journalist Anthony Howard, who has been a close friend since student days and helped with it, this is one of the most elegant, politically informative and, in the widest sense, literate reviews of a political life in many years. It is not up there with the great autobiographies of Healey or Jenkins, but it stands easy comparison with Thatcher, Major or Lawson. Like many people, I always found Heseltine rather aloof, wary, even cold. He is certainly a private man. His frank account of the catastrophic effect of his father's early death is not followed by much later soul-baring. The general tone is of wry lack of self-pity, amusement at the pitfalls and treacheries of political life and disdain, rather than anger, for old enemies such as Airey Neave, Normans Tebbit, Lamont and Thatcher herself. It is impressive rather than endearing. And indeed it is a curious tribute to the British class system that a Swansea boy who made his fortune in London bedsits and commercial magazines and who was much lampooned as a wideboy 'who has to buy his own furniture' should, in his sixties, have the aura of a very grand grandee indeed, the nearest Blair's Britain has to a Whig aristo. So why is the book so good, lacking as it does the easy bile, the maudlin revelations or the gossip that mostly keeps us reading? Close students of the great dramas of Heseltine's career - his near-bankruptcy, the mace-waving, his Cabinet resignation, his leadership challenge, his involvement in the Ponting or Matrix Churchill cases, won't even find much new information on those, though the Westland story is one that still makes me seethe when I read it. No, the cheering, old-fashioned answer is that Life in the Jungle is crammed with detail and serious explanation about many of the issues that have mattered most to Heseltine and Britain over the years. His struggle to respond practically to inner-city despair, above all in Liverpool; the complex, fascinating tale of how Margaret Thatcher abused her power to please her friends during Westland; the grappling with industrial change, council house sales, privatisations, transport schemes, wildlife protection and rough sleepers - those sorts of things are the meat of the book. It's a book about doing, not being. From his early days as a businessman to his political apotheosis as President of the Board of Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, Heseltine has been a formidable doer, a hands-on administrator fascinated by the processes of power. He has put that gift to the service of a political identity which was once common among the Heathite Tories but is less so now - hawkish on defence, pro-European, tough-minded to the point of hardness when it comes to profits and the virtue of capitalism generally, yet genuinely gripped by the plight of the poor and courageously liberal on race at a time when it wasn't half so easy. He also has a strong sense of history. He would never have tried to persuade Margaret Thatcher to make him 'Minister for Merseyside', it seems, had he not been gripped by awe and desolation at how the once great city port had collapsed from within. Perhaps less happily, he would not have embraced the Millennium Dome had he not dreamed of emulating the Great Exhibition and the Festival of Britain. The most important missing ingredient, however, is a fully honest discussion of his own driving ambition. After Westland, he writes as if all the momentum that led him to challenge Thatcher came from outside, as if an eccentric army of newspaper editors, disaffected backbench MPs and humble commoners was urging the rebel general on, entirely to his own surprise. Yet he kept a detailed record of backbench Tory support hidden in his office and was prowling round Thatcher like the predator he also is. He describes it as 'my own battle for political survival', which is perhaps more eloquent than he intended. Thatcher was one top beast and he was another, and they both knew it, and knew only one could survive. They stoked up their mutual loathing because at some level they had no choice. It's simple, David Attenborough stuff and it happens often in politics. This is the deeper, serious, policy Heseltine but the man we watched in the theatre, the human tiger, was real enough too.

She balances ancient history with her own travels and encounters throughout Tibet and China and also details the relationships and balances between the Dalai Lamas and the Panchen Lamas with remarkable clarity. You come away having learned a great deal about Tibet, while at the same time feeling as if you've just been on an amazing adventure. This is my Daughter Roxana Robinson Bloomsbury \u00a36.99, pp404 Buy it at BOL A tale of two divorced parents and their children, Roxana Robinson's This Is My Daughter is a poignant New York drama. Set in the midst of Park Avenue society, where everyone has nannies and summer homes, Emma and Peter struggle out of their failing marriages and into life together. Also thrown into this package are Emma's sweetly adoring daughter, Tess, and Peter's sullen daughter, Amanda, as well as their tumultuous histories with their exes. Robinson writes a compassionate novel, where no one is perfect and everyone has a difficult time finding enough love to go around. Her prose is a swiftly moving, interwoven narrative of the two protagonists' thoughts and actions. Ladysmith Giles Foden Faber and Faber \u00a36.99, pp366 Buy it at BOL Ladysmith is historical fiction at its finest. Foden's grippingly detailed story of the Boer War, told from a variety of British, Dutch and African perspectives, is a chronicle of slaughter, exploding shells and enormous losses, as well as a painfully aware narrative of love, death and family loyalty. Foden has a remarkable eye for the small details of war. He describes how wartime conditions change the face of a town and all the nations who live within it. Presenting all sides of the war with an observant and vividly aware eye, Foden makes the novel both an adventure story and a painful portrait of the bloodiest battles, victories and losses.",

He has, though, contracted Aids, is dying, and while in hospital he has listened avidly to Gabriel Noone's Maupin-esque tales on the radio, a warm, humane, fatherly voice that 'often, though Pete knew better, seemed to be speaking to Pete alone.' </p> <p>Noone adopts Pete, or at least he does so on the telephone, listening to him day and night, his fears and jokes, just as Pete once listened to Noone from the darkness of his hospital bed. Pete calls him Dad, wants Noone to call him Son, and they develop a conversational bond that calls on and exploits Maupin's great gift as a writer of wholly natural dialogue. Noone uses this relationship as a touchstone and a metaphor for the crumbling intimacies in his own life: with his absent lover and his distant and disapproving father. </p> <p>As the relationship develops, however, Noone, against his better judgment, and for a number of reasons that could be dismissed as coincidence or paranoia, comes to doubt the truth of Pete's story, and the book becomes something else entirely, a powerful and moving suspense story, and an examination of the power of belief, of a writer's ability to induce it in his readers. </p> <p>As Noone struggles in himself to authenticate Pete's horrors, the Dickensian tale of a boy he has never met, we are invited to listen intently to every riddling inflection of the boy's disembodied voice, and to question the basis of our own judgments of truth and credulity. At one point in his dialogue, Noone describes something called 'room tone', the charged silence of a pause in radio dialogue, into which our imagination jumps feet first.

We would learn about an Age of Fishes, an Age of Reptiles, an Age of Mammals, yet nothing about an Age of Bacteria which occupied 2,000 million years. It is of course terrifying to consider the supremacy of bacteria over our own bodies, almost as terrifying as the contemplation of being devoured after death. But there are perhaps worse terrors still, those consequent on the protection of ourselves from multi-faceted reality, and on the inevitable breakdown of that protection - the irreparable collapse of some article of deceiving religious or philosophical faith. </p> <p>Dekkers argues his cases with great brilliance, only occasionally vitiated by a certain over-determined jauntiness. Unsurprisingly he reveals the culture from which he is writing. The Netherlands is a country wrested from the sea, Nature has been fended off to a degree that has entered the national psyche, and this explains the animus behind some eloquent passages.</p> <p>He tells us how the mind often supplants one event with another comparable but more recent one, and uses the example of the First and Second World Wars.

So let me say straight away that James Thackara's The Book Of Kings is printed on very nice paper; the typeface is clear and readable, and Samantha Nundy's photograph of the author is in focus. And, given that it's 773 pages long, the author has shown a commendable degree of application and spent a great deal of time on the project. </p> <p>That, as it turns out, is the literary-London story of the book; that he's been writing it for years and years, and was writing the Story of the Twentieth Century. This, we were promised, was going to be the great novel of the European experience, covering continents in its magisterial stride. Now, at last, here it is and we can judge for ourselves. </p> <p>And it's terrible. Startlingly badly written, with no apparent understanding of what drives people or how people relate or talk to each other, it is a book of gigantic, hopeless awfulness. You read it to a constant, internal muttering of 'Oh - God - Thackara - please, don't - no - oh, God, just listen to this rubbish'. It's so awful, it's not even funny. There is not one decent sentence in the book, nothing but falsity and a useless sincerity. It may be the very worst novel I have ever read. </p> <p>The scene is Paris in 1932. Thunder clouds are gathering over Europe, but what care our four gay students? They will go and drink and eat and be merry at Polidor's! Ah, Polidor's, where you can buy, er, fish from the jolly old patronne - ' \"La-Bas, mes beaux gar\u00e7ons, mes anges; sit down, eat a good dinner!\" she shouted, with the discernment of old women for young men.' Meanwhile, things are getting grim in Germany - 'My dear Son,' someone's dear old mum writes. 'Times are hard even in our little village. My old head is full of our new dictator.' </p> <p>Soon, the time will come for our four students to part. David Sunda, Johannes Godard, Duncan Penn and Justin Lothaire; each comes from a different part of the world. History will treat some of them roughly, of that you may be sure! And some will survive the coming catastrophe, and some, mes braves, will triumph over the savage wavelets of History. (Thackara's style, distressingly, is rather contagious.) And the result is the usual stuff, the tragedy of Germany, the tragedy of Europe, former friends sundered by the movements of History and a book as thick as your wrist. </p> <p>What sets Thackara apart from other writers in this territory is quite a simple fact. He can't write. After a while, the incredulous reader starts to play a game with this book. The game is to open the book at random and try and find a tolerable sentence.</p> <p>Save your effort - you will never win. Thackara is always ahead of you, with his uncanny knack for the not-quite-right word and the yer-what turn of phrase. 'You could not see his parents' intricate cultivation, nor that the ball was in the Palazzo Farnese, just after the war.' 'Justin's friend was not in the courtyard, but the fountain was.' 'The Hanoverian battery commander, Egbert, was as delighted as a music conductor to show off for his guests behind the embankment wall.' 'Yet presently David was descending behind his parents' guests round the great staircase into the bright halls of white-tied gentlemen and crop haired ladies in clinging lace, with their cigarette stems and sashes.' These examples are taken entirely at random. It is all at least as bad as this, and some of it is worse to an unspeakable degree. </p> <p>Terrible as Thackara's prose is, it becomes quite unremarkable when set next to his idea of dialogue. It is the purest Hollywood mini-series idea of how foreigners talk to each other, a sort of language never spoken by man or woman. 'David... what about kindness and children, what about right and wrong? Also love. What about love?' 'Isn't the power and its refinement here?' 'The struggle there, Eli, is for the soil of my fathers.' 'All this will seem insignificant afterward. You and I must concentrate on Karin's beautiful wedding... you look so handsome and well-rested.' You keep suspecting that the characters aren't listening to each other and are prepared to say anything at all.</p> <p>The truth is that it's Thackara who is just incapable of listening. Every single character talks in exactly the same idiotically macaronic way, and five hundred pages into it, you are still trying to remember which humourless pundit is which. The women sound like the men. The men sound like nothing on earth. And not one of them has a single thing to say other than how the Tragedy of History is progressing. </p> <p>The awful thing is that Thackara really wants to say something. He is utterly sincere and will probably be admired by people who believe that sincerity, rather than art, is the basis of a great novel. He is probably a nice man. He obviously cares deeply about these great historical movements and has done a great deal of research - my God, he has researched and researched and researched. But on the evidence of The Book of Kings, he could not write 'Bum' on a wall.</p>",

In the black book of Scottish history, however, the name of Darien has more grievous and embarrassing associations, which Galbraith takes as the matter of his massive and thoroughly impressive first novel, The Rising Sun.</p> <p>In 1697, the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa was founded and floated in imitation of the English trading companies of the day. Scots great and small flocked to subscribe. The following year, a convoy of five ships, carrying around 1,100 volunteers, set out from Leith to establish a Scottish colony ('Caledonia') in the virgin territory of Darien and, by forcing an overland route through the jungle from ocean to ocean, to clear a dizzying prospect of commercial fortunes for Scottish investors. Instead, the destruction of the enterprise - by in-fighting, disease, the machinations of the superpowers and the unbelievable malice of the elements - bankrupted the nation and so brought on the indignity of takeover by England in the Act of Union (1707). </p> <p>Galbraith's fictional recreation of the Darien catastrophe is presented through the chronicle, composed piecemeal like a diary, of Roderick Mackenzie, the young superintendent of cargoes on the expedition's flagship, the Rising Sun. A spirited, even flamboyant narrator ('the Herodotus of our comic tragedy', as he styles himself), Mackenzie is, by nature, at once cunning and naive, which makes his insight on the obscure rivalries at work in the settlement both rewardingly observant and intriguingly incomplete. </p> <p>Part of Mackenzie's journal is given over to an account of his own earlier history in Edinburgh, before he begged and conned his way into the company and aboard ship. His first position is as bookkeeper to the wine merchant 'Claret' Colquhoun, a red-faced volcano of self-righteousness, the best of a gallery of vividly realised male characters (the women are a sorry little group of dumb prostitutes and pinched wives).</p> <p>Like the rest of 1690s Edinburgh, Colquhoun speaks recent if not quite modern colloquial English ('Damn them all, damn that damned Dutchman!'). This may be strictly inaccurate, but it is also fresh and apt in its effect, not least because it protects Galbraith's city from the echoes of other historical Edinburghs, Scott's, Hogg's. Stevenson's. In other matters of material authenticity, though, Galbraith's reconstruction is as convincing as any of these. </p> <p>Brought up in Scotland, Galbraith was a doctoral student in medieval history at Cambridge and it is his attraction to lost facts - menus, business practice, engineering, medicines, ways of thinking - that give his novel its depth of authority. An allusion, say, to the sequence of stages on the Bristol-to-London coach may be incidental, but the great stacks of documentary detail to which it contributes buttress the narrative and our belief in it. And none, or very little, of this appears as unprocessed research, for, besides being a responsible historian, Galbraith is a powerfully imaginative storyteller and a stylish writer. </p> <p>The Rising Sun is distinguished by its supple and characterful prose, full of lively figures: to quote just one of a thousand pleasing examples: 'I had a vision of myself with one foot on the Company and one on Colquhoun. They drifted apart like a boat from the quay with cold water threatening beneath.' And the rhythm of the collapse in Darien ('where the powers of corruption are so fantastically accelerated'), the satisfying crescendo of appalling incident, is masterfully controlled. </p> <p>The Rising Sun isn't quite perfect. The historian gets the better of the novelist when he extends the tale beyond its natural scope to encompass the affray about the Union. All but dead when he returns from Darien, Mackenzie has to kick his heels for nine years and 60 pages to witness it. And in their heyday, adventures in far-off lands would be fronted with maps: one here of 'Caledonia' would help us to enjoy detailing such as that of 'a fortified ditch across the narrow neck of the peninsula where it joins the mainland'.</p> <p>But we finish the book with strong feelings of gratitude for the amount and variety of fictional entertainment it has provided. Its publication propels Douglas Galbraith to a place among the very best of our historical novelists.</p>",

Stevenson's. In other matters of material authenticity, though, Galbraith's reconstruction is as convincing as any of these. Brought up in Scotland, Galbraith was a doctoral student in medieval history at Cambridge and it is his attraction to lost facts - menus, business practice, engineering, medicines, ways of thinking - that give his novel its depth of authority. An allusion, say, to the sequence of stages on the Bristol-to-London coach may be incidental, but the great stacks of documentary detail to which it contributes buttress the narrative and our belief in it. And none, or very little, of this appears as unprocessed research, for, besides being a responsible historian, Galbraith is a powerfully imaginative storyteller and a stylish writer. The Rising Sun is distinguished by its supple and characterful prose, full of lively figures: to quote just one of a thousand pleasing examples: 'I had a vision of myself with one foot on the Company and one on Colquhoun. They drifted apart like a boat from the quay with cold water threatening beneath.' And the rhythm of the collapse in Darien ('where the powers of corruption are so fantastically accelerated'), the satisfying crescendo of appalling incident, is masterfully controlled. The Rising Sun isn't quite perfect. The historian gets the better of the novelist when he extends the tale beyond its natural scope to encompass the affray about the Union. All but dead when he returns from Darien, Mackenzie has to kick his heels for nine years and 60 pages to witness it. And in their heyday, adventures in far-off lands would be fronted with maps: one here of 'Caledonia' would help us to enjoy detailing such as that of 'a fortified ditch across the narrow neck of the peninsula where it joins the mainland'. But we finish the book with strong feelings of gratitude for the amount and variety of fictional entertainment it has provided. Its publication propels Douglas Galbraith to a place among the very best of our historical novelists.",

Dame Muriel rearranges herself on the sofa and considers. 'I have sometimes thought that.' </p> <p>Others have noted it too, over her 50-year writing career, this lack of sentiment, and have called it coldness or ruthlessness. Miss Jean Brodie called it dedication ('You must all grow up to be dedicated women,' she tells her girls). Spark's co-religionist and former patron Graham Greene pinpointed the same quality in different words: 'There is a splinter of ice in the heart of a writer.' </p> <p>In person, she is charming, with shrewd, smiling eyes and careful, dark-red lipstick that matches her hair. She offers me coffee, invites me to admire the exuberant flowers her publisher has sent to cheer up the small room of her genteel hotel, is very concerned with my tape recorder and whether it's working properly. She might be 82, but don't make the mistake of talking to her as if she's an old lady. </p> <p>'Do you get to travel much these days?' I realise before I've finished the question how patronising it sounds. Spark draws herself up slightly and replies: 'This is my third trip to London this year and I'm coming back in October. But we nearly didn't get here because of those French fishermen.' </p> <p>Sitting across from her, leafing through recent reviews and cuttings, is Penelope Jardine, Spark's friend and companion of more than 20 years; it is Penelope who does the driving to and from the converted Tuscan presbytery they share when not travelling, and Penelope who, rather like Mrs Tennyson, takes care of the practical side of life while Spark is writing and researching, Penelope who types up Spark's manuscripts, all written in long-hand in special notebooks she orders from the Edinburgh stationer James Thin.</p> <p>Occasionally, Spark appeals to Penelope to corroborate a story or back up an opinion - 'I think it's not as hard for women writers to get noticed these days - what do you think, Pen? You always say women writers have a bad deal.' 'Do I?' 'Yes, you do.' </p> <p>'Someone's got you down here as a single mother,' Penelope remarks, looking up from her cuttings, 'meaning you weren't married when you had a baby.' </p> <p>'Well, I was virtually a single mother,' Spark cries, indignantly, 'he was absolutely abandoned by his father!' </p> <p>Her critics might find this accusation a little disingenuous. Spark's relationship with her son, Robin, appears always to have been unorthodox. Her husband, Sydney Oswald, whom she married at 19 having emigrated to join him in Rhodesia, began to show signs of mental illness not long after the child's birth and was eventually interned in an institution; Muriel filed for divorce and, keen to experience the war in Europe at first-hand, left little Robin in a convent while she braved the voyage back to England on a troop ship. When her son joined her the following year, he went to live with her parents in Edinburgh, while Spark continued her war work for the Foreign Office, broadcasting subtle anti-Nazi propaganda and false information to German troops. </p> <p>She was writing poetry in Rhodesia, but her literary career was launched in 1951, when she submitted a short story to a competition in The Observer and won first prize out of nearly 7,000 entries. 'You had to send it under a pseudonym,' she remembers, 'and put your real name inside. It was Philip Toynbee who opened it, and he was quite surprised to find that it was by a woman. I don't know if that's a compliment or not. But that was a great moment. The New Yorker gave me a party.' </p> <p>A publishing contract followed, and Spark's career took her to New York. But the relationship with her son attracted attention again two years ago, when Robin, an artist and an Orthodox Jew who still lives in Edinburgh, suddenly flourished his grandparents' marriage certificate which, he claimed, disproved Muriel's assertion that her mother was not Jewish. Muriel, naturally, countered with characteristic energy and defiance; a letter of 1998 to The Observer begins: 'Your report (last week) that I \"finally conceded\" that I was not born of a Jewish father and a Gentile mother, is wrong. I conceded no such thing. I do not need to prove anything, anyway.' </p> <p>'My mother falsified the marriage certificate so she could be married in a synagogue,' she says, her tone somewhere between weariness and protestation. 'I can't help it that she wasn't a Jew. When my son started playing up, I gave his letters to the National Library of Scotland, who handle my manuscripts. I think it's only right that people should know the truth, and his letters speak for themselves.' </p> <p>Perhaps Robin felt his mother was threatening the identity he had painstakingly constructed? </p> <p>'He thought I should have gone along with it and covered up,' she says, really quite affronted. 'I'd have done anything to make him a full Jew, but I wasn't going to lie! But I think he got annoyed because I pointed out that he was just pure damn jealous - he was very resentful of my success.' </p> <p>Identity is a crucial theme for Spark; you can imagine she would be resentful of anyone who tried to rewrite her own past. 'I'm a Catholic,' she says, 'but if people attack the Jews, then I do feel very Jewish. I think environment is the provocation.' </p> <p>She returns to the theme of literary success and jealousy. 'I'm a very bad picker of men. Obviously I didn't pick my son, but weak men can't cope with women who are successful, particularly if you're a writer, because your heart is always with the work, you exclude them. I've made three terrible mistakes - well, one was my husband and he was bonkers, so you can't count him. But the other two were writers, and they couldn't cope with my doing better than them. If you don't want that sort of treatment you should pick men who are more ambitious.' </p> <p>I'm nodding, perhaps too vigorously, and her eyes turn suddenly sharp. 'Are you married?' I tell her I'm not. 'Well, not to worry, you've plenty of time.' She smiles, with a touch of benevolence. It seems a curious comment from someone who speaks of her own marriage as 'disastrous', never considered remarrying and tells, quite matter-of-factly, of having had 'lots of affairs'. I ask how she endeavours to keep in touch with new generations of readers. </p> <p>'Ah, one can never be sure of that. You can only hope for the best - the thing is not to bore myself. I watch television, so I do know what's going on. We have Sky News, CNN and BBC World,' she says, proudly. </p> <p>She also reads contemporary fiction, when it's sent her way. On the coffee table is a proof of Toby Litt's forthcoming novel. 'Do you know this writer? Terribly good. Word of mouth matters more than reviews.' </p> <p>But does her semi-reclusive life in Italy mean that she is now obliged to draw on past experience and memory for her fiction? 'I've often wondered that - am I just left with my past? But no - the next novel I'm writing has nothing to do with my past. Well, only in the way that everything draws on your past to an extent, but this is a totally new thing.' </p> <p>It's only when a tentative boy arrives with more flowers that I glance at my watch and realise we've been talking for half an hour past the allotted time. 'Now that we've met,' she says, getting to her feet, 'you must come and visit us in Italy, we'd love that, wouldn't we, Pen?' Dame Muriel may not be sentimental, she may be single-minded, unflinching and possessed of a wit that slices like cheesewire, but her splinter of ice is hidden under a warm and generous exterior.</p>",

Occasionally, Spark appeals to Penelope to corroborate a story or back up an opinion - 'I think it's not as hard for women writers to get noticed these days - what do you think, Pen? You always say women writers have a bad deal.' 'Do I?' 'Yes, you do.' 'Someone's got you down here as a single mother,' Penelope remarks, looking up from her cuttings, 'meaning you weren't married when you had a baby.' 'Well, I was virtually a single mother,' Spark cries, indignantly, 'he was absolutely abandoned by his father!' Her critics might find this accusation a little disingenuous. Spark's relationship with her son, Robin, appears always to have been unorthodox. Her husband, Sydney Oswald, whom she married at 19 having emigrated to join him in Rhodesia, began to show signs of mental illness not long after the child's birth and was eventually interned in an institution; Muriel filed for divorce and, keen to experience the war in Europe at first-hand, left little Robin in a convent while she braved the voyage back to England on a troop ship. When her son joined her the following year, he went to live with her parents in Edinburgh, while Spark continued her war work for the Foreign Office, broadcasting subtle anti-Nazi propaganda and false information to German troops. She was writing poetry in Rhodesia, but her literary career was launched in 1951, when she submitted a short story to a competition in The Observer and won first prize out of nearly 7,000 entries. 'You had to send it under a pseudonym,' she remembers, 'and put your real name inside. It was Philip Toynbee who opened it, and he was quite surprised to find that it was by a woman. I don't know if that's a compliment or not. But that was a great moment. The New Yorker gave me a party.' A publishing contract followed, and Spark's career took her to New York. But the relationship with her son attracted attention again two years ago, when Robin, an artist and an Orthodox Jew who still lives in Edinburgh, suddenly flourished his grandparents' marriage certificate which, he claimed, disproved Muriel's assertion that her mother was not Jewish. Muriel, naturally, countered with characteristic energy and defiance; a letter of 1998 to The Observer begins: 'Your report (last week) that I \"finally conceded\" that I was not born of a Jewish father and a Gentile mother, is wrong. I conceded no such thing. I do not need to prove anything, anyway.' 'My mother falsified the marriage certificate so she could be married in a synagogue,' she says, her tone somewhere between weariness and protestation. 'I can't help it that she wasn't a Jew. When my son started playing up, I gave his letters to the National Library of Scotland, who handle my manuscripts. I think it's only right that people should know the truth, and his letters speak for themselves.' Perhaps Robin felt his mother was threatening the identity he had painstakingly constructed? 'He thought I should have gone along with it and covered up,' she says, really quite affronted. 'I'd have done anything to make him a full Jew, but I wasn't going to lie! But I think he got annoyed because I pointed out that he was just pure damn jealous - he was very resentful of my success.' Identity is a crucial theme for Spark; you can imagine she would be resentful of anyone who tried to rewrite her own past. 'I'm a Catholic,' she says, 'but if people attack the Jews, then I do feel very Jewish. I think environment is the provocation.' She returns to the theme of literary success and jealousy. 'I'm a very bad picker of men. Obviously I didn't pick my son, but weak men can't cope with women who are successful, particularly if you're a writer, because your heart is always with the work, you exclude them. I've made three terrible mistakes - well, one was my husband and he was bonkers, so you can't count him. But the other two were writers, and they couldn't cope with my doing better than them. If you don't want that sort of treatment you should pick men who are more ambitious.' I'm nodding, perhaps too vigorously, and her eyes turn suddenly sharp. 'Are you married?' I tell her I'm not. 'Well, not to worry, you've plenty of time.' She smiles, with a touch of benevolence. It seems a curious comment from someone who speaks of her own marriage as 'disastrous', never considered remarrying and tells, quite matter-of-factly, of having had 'lots of affairs'. I ask how she endeavours to keep in touch with new generations of readers. 'Ah, one can never be sure of that. You can only hope for the best - the thing is not to bore myself. I watch television, so I do know what's going on. We have Sky News, CNN and BBC World,' she says, proudly. She also reads contemporary fiction, when it's sent her way. On the coffee table is a proof of Toby Litt's forthcoming novel. 'Do you know this writer? Terribly good. Word of mouth matters more than reviews.' But does her semi-reclusive life in Italy mean that she is now obliged to draw on past experience and memory for her fiction? 'I've often wondered that - am I just left with my past? But no - the next novel I'm writing has nothing to do with my past. Well, only in the way that everything draws on your past to an extent, but this is a totally new thing.' It's only when a tentative boy arrives with more flowers that I glance at my watch and realise we've been talking for half an hour past the allotted time. 'Now that we've met,' she says, getting to her feet, 'you must come and visit us in Italy, we'd love that, wouldn't we, Pen?' Dame Muriel may not be sentimental, she may be single-minded, unflinching and possessed of a wit that slices like cheesewire, but her splinter of ice is hidden under a warm and generous exterior.",

      "body": "<p>A devastating portrait of the political and personal rivalries between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the two most powerful men in Britain, is revealed in today's Observer.</p> <p>In the definitive account of their relationship during New Labour's first term in office, Andrew Rawnsley, this newspaper's chief political commentator, discloses in a new book that the Prime Minister and his Chancellor have regular raging arguments, which have threatened to derail the Government's most important policies.</p> <p>The book, Servants of the People, serialisation of which begins today, says that the relationship between the two would often descend into petulant battles over who had the greatest authority. Blair and Brown both vied for the Labour leadership after John Smith died in 1994.</p> <p>Rawnsley, who was given unprecedented access to senior officials and Ministers in government, reveals that the feuding extended to Blair being left in the dark by Brown over sensitive issues, such as the euro and the Budget. Supporters of both sides - Blairites and Brownites - would stoop to anything to beat the other camp.</p> <p>The Prime Minister would shout in frustration at the way Brown operated and often explained Brown's mode of working with psychological theories, saying once that 'Gordon's problem is that he does not have a family'.</p> <p>The book throws new light on the deep faults and brooding tensions at the heart of the New Labour Government and for the first time exposes the true scale of the divisions between Blair and Brown, which officials have hitherto tried to deny.</p> <p>Ahead of publication, Labour officials signalled their concern that such a public airing of the most damaging details of the two men's relationship will undermine the New Labour image, which is being carefully constructed ahead of the party's conference in a fortnight.</p> <p>The book reveals that:</p> <p>\u0095 Brown wanted to sack the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, in 1997 because he saw him as a threat. Blair had to telephone George personally to make sure he remained in post and prevent the markets collapsing.</p> <p>\u0095 Blair often lost his temper with Brown's plotting and manoeuvring, saying 'God, Gordon can be impossible' and exploding: 'Jesus. What has Gordon done now?'. He said the Chancellor was often un-cooperative.</p> <p>\u0095 On a fundamental change in policy on the euro in 1997, Blair was left completely in the dark and had to have Brown's new policy read over the phone to him from an article in a newspaper.</p> <p>\u0095 Brown threatened to resign earlier this year over a pro-euro speech by Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who has fallen out repeatedly with the Chancellor.</p> <p>\u0095 Blair and Brown rowed over increases in health spending after the Prime Minister announced on a Sunday morning television programme that Britain's health bud get should be brought up to the European Union average. Brown was so furious with the Prime Minister he shouted at him: 'You've stolen my f****** Budget.'</p> <p>\u0095 Blair was so angry with Brown's one-time chief press spokesman, Charlie Whelan, about pro-Treasury briefings on Government policy, that he repeatedly said he would force him out. When he failed to do so, Blair became an object of ridicule among his own senior aides. Whelan was finally forced out by Blair after details of Mandelson's home loan from Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson became public.</p> <p>In a disclosure that will infuriate the Blair camp, the book reveals that Brown is unimpressed with the Prime Minister's economic abilities and always knew he could beat him in an economic argument. 'Tony wants to tax less, spend more and borrow less,' the book quotes Brown as saying. 'Our job is to make it add up for him.'</p> <p>The book, which is meticulously sourced at the highest level, also deals with the row over leaks about Brown's 'psychological flaws' - a comment Rawnsley says was made by someone 'with an extremely good claim to know the mind of the Prime Minister'.</p> <p>Although Rawnsley does not reveal who made the comment, he does rule out Mandelson, who some blamed at the time. The book makes no comment on allegations that Alastair Campbell was the source, something that has been strenuously denied by the Prime Minister's official spokesman.</p> <p>It does say that Brown, who confronted Blair about the remarks which he believed had come from someone in No 10, believed Blair was lying when he said he did not know who made them.</p> <p>The book says Brown has harboured a burning resentment about the remarks ever since.</p> <p>Brown's desire to get rid of the Governor of the Bank of England, who is still in position, will shock the markets. Brown wanted to give independence to the bank, a move he bounced on Blair in the first few days after the general election.</p> <p>Blair supported the move, but did not know that Brown wanted to act immediately. Brown thought that George could be disloyal.</p> <p>The most remarkable revelation centres on Government policy on the euro, which the book reveals descended into a shambles during 1997. Brown decided, after a five-minute phone call with Blair, that the policy needed to be 'clarified' in an interview with the Times political editor, Philip Webster.</p> <p>The story was spun to suggest that Brown ruled out membership of the euro for the lifetime of the parliament, one of the most important Government statements on Europe since the general election.</p> <p>Blair was unaware that Brown was going to make such a significant move and was stranded at his country home, Chequers, when the Times article was published.</p> <p>The first the Prime Minister knew about the fundamental shift was when Mandelson rang him and read out the article.</p> <p>Blair was furious but when he tried to contact Brown and Campbell, both had gone incommunicado. With his own press secretary having gone missing, Blair was left to telephone Whelan, who was briefing journalists about the policy change on a mobile phone outside a pub.</p> <p>Nor have relations improved between Blair and Brown. The book reveals that the rows between the two men have infected the whole history of the Government up to the present.</p> <p>Brown wanted to make a big announcement on health in the Budget last March but a flu crisis in January and criticisms about standards in the health service by New Labour peer Professor Robert Winston meant that Blair wanted to say something positive earlier in the year.</p> <p>In an interview on Breakfast with Frost he made the European Union cash pledge. Brown was angry that the centrepiece of his Budget had been revealed and also that the amounts being talked about (\u00a316 billion) were so high when he had yet to make a final decision.</p> <p>In a further twist to the levels of discord in government, the book also reveals that Mo Mowlam turned down the post of Health Secretary in her bid to become first Foreign Secretary and then Defence Secretary.</p> <p>Mowlam, who announced last week that she was resigning, then offered to fight Ken Livingstone for Mayor of London, even though Frank Dobson was already the official Labour candidate.</p> <p>However, it is the disclosures about Brown and Blair that are of greatest interest. Rawnsley explains the remarkably fraught relationship between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor with reference to Brown's failure to become Prime Minister.</p> <p>'The itch that Brown could not stop himself scratching was the smouldering resentment that Blair had taken the first prize of politics,' the book says.</p>",

In the definitive account of their relationship during New Labour's first term in office, Andrew Rawnsley, this newspaper's chief political commentator, discloses in a new book that the Prime Minister and his Chancellor have regular raging arguments, which have threatened to derail the Government's most important policies. The book, Servants of the People, serialisation of which begins today, says that the relationship between the two would often descend into petulant battles over who had the greatest authority. Blair and Brown both vied for the Labour leadership after John Smith died in 1994. Rawnsley, who was given unprecedented access to senior officials and Ministers in government, reveals that the feuding extended to Blair being left in the dark by Brown over sensitive issues, such as the euro and the Budget. Supporters of both sides - Blairites and Brownites - would stoop to anything to beat the other camp. The Prime Minister would shout in frustration at the way Brown operated and often explained Brown's mode of working with psychological theories, saying once that 'Gordon's problem is that he does not have a family'. The book throws new light on the deep faults and brooding tensions at the heart of the New Labour Government and for the first time exposes the true scale of the divisions between Blair and Brown, which officials have hitherto tried to deny. Ahead of publication, Labour officials signalled their concern that such a public airing of the most damaging details of the two men's relationship will undermine the New Labour image, which is being carefully constructed ahead of the party's conference in a fortnight. The book reveals that: \u0095 Brown wanted to sack the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, in 1997 because he saw him as a threat. Blair had to telephone George personally to make sure he remained in post and prevent the markets collapsing. \u0095 Blair often lost his temper with Brown's plotting and manoeuvring, saying 'God, Gordon can be impossible' and exploding: 'Jesus. What has Gordon done now?'. He said the Chancellor was often un-cooperative. \u0095 On a fundamental change in policy on the euro in 1997, Blair was left completely in the dark and had to have Brown's new policy read over the phone to him from an article in a newspaper. \u0095 Brown threatened to resign earlier this year over a pro-euro speech by Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who has fallen out repeatedly with the Chancellor. \u0095 Blair and Brown rowed over increases in health spending after the Prime Minister announced on a Sunday morning television programme that Britain's health bud get should be brought up to the European Union average. Brown was so furious with the Prime Minister he shouted at him: 'You've stolen my f****** Budget.' \u0095 Blair was so angry with Brown's one-time chief press spokesman, Charlie Whelan, about pro-Treasury briefings on Government policy, that he repeatedly said he would force him out. When he failed to do so, Blair became an object of ridicule among his own senior aides. Whelan was finally forced out by Blair after details of Mandelson's home loan from Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson became public. In a disclosure that will infuriate the Blair camp, the book reveals that Brown is unimpressed with the Prime Minister's economic abilities and always knew he could beat him in an economic argument. 'Tony wants to tax less, spend more and borrow less,' the book quotes Brown as saying. 'Our job is to make it add up for him.' The book, which is meticulously sourced at the highest level, also deals with the row over leaks about Brown's 'psychological flaws' - a comment Rawnsley says was made by someone 'with an extremely good claim to know the mind of the Prime Minister'. Although Rawnsley does not reveal who made the comment, he does rule out Mandelson, who some blamed at the time. The book makes no comment on allegations that Alastair Campbell was the source, something that has been strenuously denied by the Prime Minister's official spokesman. It does say that Brown, who confronted Blair about the remarks which he believed had come from someone in No 10, believed Blair was lying when he said he did not know who made them. The book says Brown has harboured a burning resentment about the remarks ever since. Brown's desire to get rid of the Governor of the Bank of England, who is still in position, will shock the markets. Brown wanted to give independence to the bank, a move he bounced on Blair in the first few days after the general election. Blair supported the move, but did not know that Brown wanted to act immediately. Brown thought that George could be disloyal. The most remarkable revelation centres on Government policy on the euro, which the book reveals descended into a shambles during 1997. Brown decided, after a five-minute phone call with Blair, that the policy needed to be 'clarified' in an interview with the Times political editor, Philip Webster. The story was spun to suggest that Brown ruled out membership of the euro for the lifetime of the parliament, one of the most important Government statements on Europe since the general election. Blair was unaware that Brown was going to make such a significant move and was stranded at his country home, Chequers, when the Times article was published. The first the Prime Minister knew about the fundamental shift was when Mandelson rang him and read out the article. Blair was furious but when he tried to contact Brown and Campbell, both had gone incommunicado. With his own press secretary having gone missing, Blair was left to telephone Whelan, who was briefing journalists about the policy change on a mobile phone outside a pub. Nor have relations improved between Blair and Brown. The book reveals that the rows between the two men have infected the whole history of the Government up to the present. Brown wanted to make a big announcement on health in the Budget last March but a flu crisis in January and criticisms about standards in the health service by New Labour peer Professor Robert Winston meant that Blair wanted to say something positive earlier in the year. In an interview on Breakfast with Frost he made the European Union cash pledge. Brown was angry that the centrepiece of his Budget had been revealed and also that the amounts being talked about (\u00a316 billion) were so high when he had yet to make a final decision. In a further twist to the levels of discord in government, the book also reveals that Mo Mowlam turned down the post of Health Secretary in her bid to become first Foreign Secretary and then Defence Secretary. Mowlam, who announced last week that she was resigning, then offered to fight Ken Livingstone for Mayor of London, even though Frank Dobson was already the official Labour candidate. However, it is the disclosures about Brown and Blair that are of greatest interest. Rawnsley explains the remarkably fraught relationship between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor with reference to Brown's failure to become Prime Minister. 'The itch that Brown could not stop himself scratching was the smouldering resentment that Blair had taken the first prize of politics,' the book says.",

Three Tests this summer have failed to reach Sunday - and it would have been four but for rain in the Lord's Test against Zimbabwe. This has deprived the game of about \u00a32 million that it can ill afford to lose. Poor pitches with uneven bounce will also undermine our young cricketers. Batsmen will settle for a rapid, swishing 40, which might be enough to win the game. Bowlers won't bother to try to swing or spin the ball since all they have to do is plonk it on a length and wait.

England's seam attack has been unusually reliable and fit in all forms of cricket, but their spin 'attack' for the winter is based on a wing and a prayer and influenced too much by the fact that Ashley Giles and Ian Salisbury are 'multi-dimensional', namely that they know which end of the bat to hold. Both are unproven; Giles has minimal experience at Test level; Salisbury's record prompts a grimace - 12 Tests, 19 wickets at 70 apiece.

A broken finger could upturn the balance of the England side at any moment and at some point old age will set in. England don't know who will replace him. Each winter they try someone new; it was Warren Hegg in Australia, Chris Read in South Africa and this winter Paul Nixon, fiercely competitive but limited and already in his thirtieth year.

      "body": "<p>Of all the specialist batsmen who played in the recent series, only Marcus Trescothick is a winner. He alone has improved his Test average - and that is only because, not having one to start with, 47.5 can be said to be an improvement. But everyone else, Englishmen and West Indians alike, came off the worse. </p> <p>In our table below, the 'Comp' figure shows how the player's series average compares with his Test career average at the start of the series. Of course, minus figures are comparative. Michael Atherton's is fairly small, and over the span of a long, 187-innings Test career has a negligible impact of only a few decimal points. </p> <p>Even the young man who ended up top of the visitors' batting averages, Ramnaresh Sarwan, was some way below his overall Test figures. That, though, was because his is a fledgling career, comprising just four previous innings, two of them not out, for an average of 55.5. At least, one assumes that figure was a little unrealistic. It is possible that what we saw in England 2000 will be a blip at the start of a very great career. </p> <p>Like Sarwan's, the career of Wavell Hinds is also in its infancy. In his case, it may remain there if his disappointments this summer prove too much. The preceding series against Pakistan had provided a flying start to his Test career, and an average of 58.4. Now, a figure of 16.3 means there was no bigger loser in this series - though Hussain and Ramprakash might seem to run him close. </p> <p>For the bowlers, of course, a minus figure is very good news, and nearly all of them were winners. There was dramatic improvement for Dominic Cork and Craig White, but the biggest winner was surely Courtney Walsh: all those wickets, nine more than anyone else, and at an average that very nearly halved his career benchmark. </p> <p>But there were four English bowlers who averaged under - well under - 25 a wicket, and only two West Indians. Significantly, in this summer of ball-dominance, Reon King and Franklyn Rose bucked the trend and ended up with worse averages. With Robert Croft, they finished among the summer's many losers.</p> <p><strong> England's Batsmen</strong> </p> <p> Runs Av Comp </p> <p><strong> Trescothick</strong> 190 47.5 n/a </p> <p><strong> Atherton</strong> 311 34.6 -4.0 </p> <p><strong> Vaughan</strong> 169 28.2 -1.9 </p> <p><strong> Stewart</strong> 195 24.4 -16.8 </p> <p><strong> Thorpe</strong> 96 24.0 -15.1 </p> <p><strong> Knight</strong> 68 17.0 -17.0 </p> <p><strong> Hick</strong> 116 16.6 -15.5 </p> <p><strong> Hussain</strong> 61 10.2 -28.9 </p> <p><strong> Ramprakash</strong> 20 5.0 -22.7 </p> <p> <strong> West Indies' Batsmen</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sarwan</strong> 163 40.7 -14.8 </p> <p><strong> Chanderpaul</strong> 104 34.7 -5.6 </p> <p><strong> Campbell</strong> 270 30.0 -5.3 </p> <p><strong> Lara</strong> 239 26.6 -25.1 </p> <p><strong> Adams</strong> 220 24.4 -22.7 </p> <p><strong> Griffith</strong> 132 16.5 -10.6 </p> <p><strong> Hinds</strong> 147 16.3 -32.1 </p> <p> <strong> England's Bowlers</strong> </p> <p> Wkts Av Comp </p> <p><strong> Cork</strong> 20 12.2 -19.6 </p> <p><strong> White</strong> 13 18.1 -23.0 </p> <p><strong> Caddick</strong> 22 19.2 -9.7 </p> <p><strong> Gough</strong> 25 21.2 -7.7 </p> <p><strong> Croft</strong> 3 59.0 +21.7 </p> <p> <strong> West Indies' Bowlers</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Walsh</strong> 34 12.8 -12.3 </p> <p><strong> Ambrose</strong> 17 18.6 -2.5 </p> <p><strong> King</strong> 8 30.5 +3.3 </p> <p><strong> Nagamootoo</strong> 3 30.7 n/a </p> <p><strong> McLean</strong> 7 33.3 -8.9 </p> <p><strong> Rose</strong> 4 67.5 +39.7 </p>",

      "bodyText": "Of all the specialist batsmen who played in the recent series, only Marcus Trescothick is a winner. He alone has improved his Test average - and that is only because, not having one to start with, 47.5 can be said to be an improvement. But everyone else, Englishmen and West Indians alike, came off the worse. In our table below, the 'Comp' figure shows how the player's series average compares with his Test career average at the start of the series. Of course, minus figures are comparative. Michael Atherton's is fairly small, and over the span of a long, 187-innings Test career has a negligible impact of only a few decimal points. Even the young man who ended up top of the visitors' batting averages, Ramnaresh Sarwan, was some way below his overall Test figures. That, though, was because his is a fledgling career, comprising just four previous innings, two of them not out, for an average of 55.5. At least, one assumes that figure was a little unrealistic. It is possible that what we saw in England 2000 will be a blip at the start of a very great career. Like Sarwan's, the career of Wavell Hinds is also in its infancy. In his case, it may remain there if his disappointments this summer prove too much. The preceding series against Pakistan had provided a flying start to his Test career, and an average of 58.4. Now, a figure of 16.3 means there was no bigger loser in this series - though Hussain and Ramprakash might seem to run him close. For the bowlers, of course, a minus figure is very good news, and nearly all of them were winners. There was dramatic improvement for Dominic Cork and Craig White, but the biggest winner was surely Courtney Walsh: all those wickets, nine more than anyone else, and at an average that very nearly halved his career benchmark. But there were four English bowlers who averaged under - well under - 25 a wicket, and only two West Indians. Significantly, in this summer of ball-dominance, Reon King and Franklyn Rose bucked the trend and ended up with worse averages. With Robert Croft, they finished among the summer's many losers.

      "body": "<p><strong> Tantrums in Florence</strong> </p> <p>Are these the bitterest fans in football? Supporters of Fiorentina - furious about the \u00a322.8m sale of hairy icon Gabriel Batistuta earlier this year - have walked out on the club. Last season Fiorentina sold 32,505 season tickets. This year they've barely scraped 5,000. Batistuta's departure in June was the most violently received transfer of recent times. When the Argentine announced his plans, fans began days of massive 'Please don't go' riots: three Molotov cocktails were thrown at the office of club president Vittorio Cecchi Gori, 500 fans surrounded the stadium, and 50 others held a candle-light vigil outside Batistuta's villa with a banner declaring: 'Florence loves you. You love Florence. So why leave?' Money would seem to have been a factor - but the fans remain appalled. Now, upset again by the appointment of unglamorous Turkish coach Faith Terim and his subsequent failure to sign Barcelona's Boudewijn Zenden, fans have deserted the club in droves, and more direct action could follow. In 1990, Roberto Baggio moved to rivals Juventus, and was the subject of furious death threats - almost fulfilled when a group of fans broke into the Italian national camp in Coverciano to try to reach him. If Fiorentina win their first couple of games, season ticket sales will no doubt recover. If not, it'll be a quiet few months at the Artemio Franchi. </p> <p> <strong> Divine Bambino: cash rolls in</strong> </p> <p>Vincenzo Sarno - the Italian preteen 'Bambino of God' profiled in Said &amp; Done in January last year - has returned home to Napoli after his remarkable \u00a350,000 move to Turin broke down. Vincenzo, discovered by Europe's money men after scouts reported a ten-year-old miniature Maradona with perfect ball control, joined Torino - 500 miles from home - when the club offered his unemployed father a car, a house and tens of millions of lira. 'You don't realise what this adventure means for us,' protested father Ernesto when the move was condemned as 'soccer paedophilia'. 'I haven't slept in days. I stay awake at night thinking, \"The new Maradona was born in my house.\" I can't believe it.' But less than a year after the boy's first training session in Turin, financial disputes and an unhappy Vincenzo ('My friends miss me') have forced the family home. But he won't be there for long. After a recent promotional tour of New York, where the youngster made the rounds of the morning talk shows, little Vincenzo is again the subject of interest from Roma and Juventus. And with all the money from the Turin move gone, Ernesto's keen to do business. 'This season he'll be in a soccer school in Napoli,' he says. 'He can have a break. But he's still young - only 12. We have time.' </p> <p><strong> Rooms with a pew</strong> </p> <p>Twenty-two nuns have opened a bed and breakfast at their Merseyside convent in an attempt to cash in on fans visiting Liverpool and Everton. The Augustinian Sisters hope the venture will provide much-needed resources, and encourage supporters to stay and pray. 'We decided to open a guesthouse to help us pay the bills,' says Sister Carmel, deputy mother superior. 'Our location means we should get a lot of trade.' The nuns are charging \u00a320 for bed and breakfast, and \u00a35 extra for a homemade dinner, served by the sisters. 'We think this is good value,' said Sister Carmel. Important facts for prospective guests : Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, North Africa, died in 430BC, and is patron saint of brewers. Key Augustinian rules: 1. Chant only what is prescribed for chant; moreover, let nothing be chanted unless it is so prescribed. 2. Subdue the flesh, so far as your health permits, by abstinence from drink. 3. Although your eyes may chance to rest upon some woman or other, you must not fix your gaze. An abomination to the Lord is he who fixes his gaze. There's space for 30 guests - Manchester United are in town next week. </p> <p> <strong>King Kev cleans up</strong> </p> <p> The tenth edition of Private Eye 's Colemanballs is published in November - with precedence and the front cover given over to the increasingly profound Kevin Keegan...</p> <p>Kev on England: 'England can end the millennium as they started it - as the greatest football nation in the world'; Kev on goalkeepers: 'Goalkeepers aren't born today until they're in their late twenties or thirties'; Kev on refs: 'The ref was vertically 15 yards away'; Kev on 2004: 'The 33 or 34-year-olds will be 36 or 37 by the time the next World Cup comes around, if they're not careful'; Kev on fire: '...using his strength.

'You don't realise what this adventure means for us,' protested father Ernesto when the move was condemned as 'soccer paedophilia'. 'I haven't slept in days. I stay awake at night thinking, \"The new Maradona was born in my house.\" I can't believe it.' But less than a year after the boy's first training session in Turin, financial disputes and an unhappy Vincenzo ('My friends miss me') have forced the family home. But he won't be there for long. After a recent promotional tour of New York, where the youngster made the rounds of the morning talk shows, little Vincenzo is again the subject of interest from Roma and Juventus. And with all the money from the Turin move gone, Ernesto's keen to do business. 'This season he'll be in a soccer school in Napoli,' he says. 'He can have a break. But he's still young - only 12. We have time.' Rooms with a pew Twenty-two nuns have opened a bed and breakfast at their Merseyside convent in an attempt to cash in on fans visiting Liverpool and Everton. The Augustinian Sisters hope the venture will provide much-needed resources, and encourage supporters to stay and pray. 'We decided to open a guesthouse to help us pay the bills,' says Sister Carmel, deputy mother superior. 'Our location means we should get a lot of trade.' The nuns are charging \u00a320 for bed and breakfast, and \u00a35 extra for a homemade dinner, served by the sisters. 'We think this is good value,' said Sister Carmel. Important facts for prospective guests : Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, North Africa, died in 430BC, and is patron saint of brewers. Key Augustinian rules: 1. Chant only what is prescribed for chant; moreover, let nothing be chanted unless it is so prescribed. 2. Subdue the flesh, so far as your health permits, by abstinence from drink. 3. Although your eyes may chance to rest upon some woman or other, you must not fix your gaze. An abomination to the Lord is he who fixes his gaze. There's space for 30 guests - Manchester United are in town next week. King Kev cleans up The tenth edition of Private Eye 's Colemanballs is published in November - with precedence and the front cover given over to the increasingly profound Kevin Keegan... Kev on England: 'England can end the millennium as they started it - as the greatest football nation in the world'; Kev on goalkeepers: 'Goalkeepers aren't born today until they're in their late twenties or thirties'; Kev on refs: 'The ref was vertically 15 yards away'; Kev on 2004: 'The 33 or 34-year-olds will be 36 or 37 by the time the next World Cup comes around, if they're not careful'; Kev on fire: '...using his strength. And that is his strength, his strength'; and most remarkable of all, Kev on his own: 'I have talked with Phil Neville and he knows that he has never let me down.' Colemanballs 10 will be published by Private Eye Books, priced \u00a33.99. Role model of the week Twenty minutes before his second ever Everton start at White Hart Lane last Tuesday, Paul Gascoigne was spotted by curious young fans smoking a pre-match cigarette. Time, clearly, for an England recall. Tales from the Tabs CHELSEA'S \u00a310m SAVIO Brazilian star Savio is desperately trying to secure a French passport in an attempt to salvage his \u00a310m move to Chelsea. Gianluca Vialli bid for the classy Real Madrid left winger last week, but, says chief executive Colin Hutchison: 'We're aware of complications over a work permit.' ARS\u00e8NE PRICE BUSTER Arsenal have put a massive bid for Sunderland's Kevin Phillips on hold with a view to signing him on a free if the transfer system is abolished in October. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had been preparing a \u00a315m deal - now he'll wait, and Phillips is keen: 'To play at Highbury is still a big dream of mine.' GARETH: I'LL STAY, THEN Gareth Southgate is ready to tear up his Aston Villa transfer request after coming to terms with no one wanting to pay \u00a38m for him. 'Nothing's happening on the transfer front and I just have to get my head round that,' says Southgate. 'If the deadlock remains I may just have to readjust my thinking.' And the rest... Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has told Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood he'll consider extending his contract until 2004. 'He's been mulling it over and we're very confident,' says Hill-Wood. 'I'm happy at the moment,' says Wenger. Jermaine Pennant, meanwhile, is set to join Wolves on loan. Doug Ellis has told Villa fans calling for his resignation to be quiet. 'John Gregory has never been refused a single penny for players he wanted to sign.' Bradford have agreed to sell Ashley Westwood to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3150,000. Charlton could miss out on Leicester's Tony Cottee after Norwich stepped up their interest. Chelsea's Bernard Lambourde will have talks with Portsmouth over a \u00a3750,000 permanent move after joining on a month's loan. Colin Hendry will leave Coventry this week after Gordon Strachan confirmed he won't be a regular starter. Derby's Dean Sturridge could complete his long-awaited move to Birmingham in the next few days. Young Everton striker Phil Jevons has been told he won't be leaving for Grimsby. 'We need him to stay here and we need him to play here and that's where he will stay', says Walter Smith. Ipswich are leading the race to sign young Falkirk midfielder Mark Kerr - George Burley has also bid for a mystery foreign defender. Robert Molenaar has turned down a move to Wimbledon from Leeds - the clubs had agreed a \u00a31m fee. Leicester boss Peter Taylor is still watching Charlton striker Andy Hunt and Bradford defender Andy O'Brien. Liverpool's Rigobert Song is still a target for Blackburn despite Henning Berg's move from Manchester United. Defender Richard Jobson could join Stockport from Man City on loan - Chris Killen is off to Wrexham for a month. Manchester United officials have flown to Italy in an attempt to gazump Bari striker Antonio Cassano's move to Juventus. Middlesbrough are set to spend again: Forest's \u00a35m-rated youngster David Prutton, Tromso wonderkid Morten Gamst Pedersen and Colchester's Lomana Lua-Lua are top targets. Bobby Robson won't be spending any more Newcastle cash until the future of the transfer system is determined: 'We don't want to make a move until we know what's going to happen.' Southampton are considering a Crystal Palace bid for Matt Le Tissier after James Beattie's move to London collapsed. Sunderland's Andy Marriot has rejected a \u00a3300,000 move to Sam Hamman's Cardiff. Spurs have rejected a \u00a33m offer for Steffen Iversen from Reggiana, but could sell Les Ferdinand to an unnamed Division One club to finance a big bid for Watford's Tommy Smith. West Ham have enquired about Japanese defender Tsuneyasu Miyamoto - he'll be available for transfer when the J-League ends in December. Valencia, meanwhile, are ready to bid big for midfielder Frank Lampard. david.hills@observer.co.uk",

But it's not such a good idea if players have just signed a contract for two or three years. </p> <p>'It looks as if, with these changes, players are being encouraged to leave.

'We're always looking for new players,' he said, 'but it's unlikely that we'll do anything until we know what's going to happen. It will affect us without stopping us.' Instead, he hopes to sign Sunderland midfielder Chris Lumsden on loan this week. </p> <p>Hamilton is slightly more optimistic. 'At this moment in time, to spend money, aware that the situation could change and the money would be gone, is a risk. It has to be a concern, but if the right player was available at the right price I would probably do it, and take the risk.' </p> <p>Both clubs insist that the youth scheme, however, will continue, whatever happens. 'It has to affect the youth team,' said Hamilton, 'but there has to be a youth academy. There has to be a development programme at any progressive club, or at any progressive business. You've seen businesses over the years who haven't done that and they've gone belly up. So I firmly believe in development, and always will.' </p> <p>How Hamilton could do with another bright young thing to roll off the production line immediately. This was Norwich's second point of the season, and his team are now bottom of the First Division having scored in just one of five league games.

It was rather different for Chelsea's Bernard Lambourde, in Portsmouth's match against Watford. </p> <p>The classy 29-year-old Frenchman, who was signed by Chelsea from Bordeaux for \u00a31.7million in June 1997, has had only moderate success in the Premiership. Even so, Portsmouth's manager, Tony Pulis, says that it took him two months to persuade him to take the step-down. </p> <p>Pulis likes to think that Lambourde will grow fond enough of Fratton Park to want to make the move permanent. However, one wonders what Lambourde will have thought of the game against Watford. Portsmouth did hit the woodwork twice. But Watford proved more accurate, deservedly winning the match 3-1. </p> <p>'We dominated periods of the game and could have scored even more,' said Watford's manager, Graham Taylor, whose team leapfrogged over Fulham (who play today against Barnsley) to the top of the First Division. </p> <p>With Walsall losing 2-0 against Bury, Fulham are now the only team with a 100 per cent league record. In terms of the teams who have yet to be beaten, they are joined by Blackburn, Watford, Bolton, Wycombe, Bristol Rovers, Leyton Orient and Cardiff. </p> <p>Bolton maintained their record with a 3-2 win at Huddersfield - a success that owed much to the finishing of their substitute Michael Ricketts. He missed Bolton's opening three matches because of suspension and Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce, said: 'He has been superb since his return. He is big and powerful, and is beginning to show that he can turn his raw potential into reality. I am convinced he can achieve something in the game, and it is our job to keep his feet on the ground.' </p> <p>This is bound to be less of a problem with the key men at Norwich - the only First Division team who have yet to win. Their inevitable lack of confidence in the goalless draw against Crewe was best illustrated when Darel Russell was put clean through by an Iwan Roberts flick-on. but hit his shot against a post when it seemed easier to score. </p> <p>The no-wins category also includes Bournemouth, Oxford, Halifax and Hull. As it happened, the last had an excellent result yesterday - a 2-2 draw at Leyton Orient - but did not have that much caused to feel totally good about themselves because they were twice in the lead. </p> <p>The player who deserved the most sympathy was the Wolves midfielder, Scott Taylor. The former Leicester and Reading player, who has a history of knee trouble, was carried off with a rupture of the right patella tendon against Tranmere and is expected to be out of action for six to 12 months. </p> <p>To make matters worse for Wolves, they had their captain, Kevin Muscat, sent off for a foul - on Sean Flynn - which gave Tranmere their match-winning penalty nine minutes from the end. Wolves' 2-1 defeat was their third league loss in succession and leaves them struggling near the foot of the table. </p> <p>The other First Division player shown the red card was Sheffield United's Michael Brown at Birmingham. By that time, Birmingham had established a 1-0 lead through an eighth-minute Martin O'Connor penalty and, though United created good chances to equalise, that's how it remained.</p>",

'We dominated periods of the game and could have scored even more,' said Watford's manager, Graham Taylor, whose team leapfrogged over Fulham (who play today against Barnsley) to the top of the First Division. With Walsall losing 2-0 against Bury, Fulham are now the only team with a 100 per cent league record. In terms of the teams who have yet to be beaten, they are joined by Blackburn, Watford, Bolton, Wycombe, Bristol Rovers, Leyton Orient and Cardiff. Bolton maintained their record with a 3-2 win at Huddersfield - a success that owed much to the finishing of their substitute Michael Ricketts. He missed Bolton's opening three matches because of suspension and Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce, said: 'He has been superb since his return. He is big and powerful, and is beginning to show that he can turn his raw potential into reality. I am convinced he can achieve something in the game, and it is our job to keep his feet on the ground.' This is bound to be less of a problem with the key men at Norwich - the only First Division team who have yet to win. Their inevitable lack of confidence in the goalless draw against Crewe was best illustrated when Darel Russell was put clean through by an Iwan Roberts flick-on. but hit his shot against a post when it seemed easier to score. The no-wins category also includes Bournemouth, Oxford, Halifax and Hull. As it happened, the last had an excellent result yesterday - a 2-2 draw at Leyton Orient - but did not have that much caused to feel totally good about themselves because they were twice in the lead. The player who deserved the most sympathy was the Wolves midfielder, Scott Taylor. The former Leicester and Reading player, who has a history of knee trouble, was carried off with a rupture of the right patella tendon against Tranmere and is expected to be out of action for six to 12 months. To make matters worse for Wolves, they had their captain, Kevin Muscat, sent off for a foul - on Sean Flynn - which gave Tranmere their match-winning penalty nine minutes from the end. Wolves' 2-1 defeat was their third league loss in succession and leaves them struggling near the foot of the table. The other First Division player shown the red card was Sheffield United's Michael Brown at Birmingham. By that time, Birmingham had established a 1-0 lead through an eighth-minute Martin O'Connor penalty and, though United created good chances to equalise, that's how it remained.",

      "body": "<p>A defensive clanger loud enough to be heard back in Glasgow cost Rangers two points at Dundee. Their flighty skipper Lorenzo Amoruso was the man who dropped it, committing the cardinal sin of being dispossessed in front of his own goal. The Italian tried to be too clever on the edge of his penalty area and was robbed of the ball by Dundee substitute Juan Sara. </p> <p>Sara, the Argentine who had come on only minutes earlier, managed to poke the ball past Stefan Klos and ensure that an occasionally bad-tempered game finished with honours even. </p> <p>A delighted Sara promptly tugged his shirt over his head to reveal a T-shirt bearing the legend 'Jesus Loves You', rather ironic considering his team's terrible disciplinary record so far this season. Dundee had already clocked up an astonishing six red cards and 21 yellows before kick-off. </p> <p>Until then it had looked likely that Neil McCann's 56th-minute strike might be the decider. The left winger, who scored Scotland's winner against Latvia in their World Cup qualifier earlier in the week, smashed a 20-yard drive past his international colleague Robert Douglas after being set up by Tugay Kerimoglu. </p> <p>Rangers dominated the opening exchanges as Dundee, obviously hoping to carve chances from counter-attacks rather than numbers up front, opted to defend in strength, leaving the Argentine Fabien Caballero as a lone, and often lonely, striker. </p> <p>At the other end it took Rangers' Dutch striker Michael Mols, making his first competitive start since he was injured in a collision with Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn 10 months ago, 20 minutes to get a sight of goal and when he did Steven Tweed was in the way. </p> <p>Rangers' early pressure began to evolve into chances and Marcello Marrocco had to be calm under pressure to head away McCann's far-post cross from the left before Mols could pounce. </p> <p>Mols, warmly applauded by the visiting supporters, had few chances in total though, and spent much of the game on his backside claiming fouls which were rarely given. </p> <p>His manager Dick Advocaat will at least have been encouraged that he managed to last the vigorous 90 minutes, especially with Rangers' Champions League campaign beginning on Tuesday, at home against Austrian side Sturm Graz. </p> <p>With the home team snapping at their heels though, Rangers had no time to think of Europe. As one might expect from a game involving bad boys Dundee, the referee was kept busy throughout. </p> <p>Scott Wilson was booked for bringing down Caballero, Marco di Marchi for fouling Neil McCann and Tugay received a similar punishment for fouling Dundee player-manager Ivano Bonetti, who was at the heart of many of his side's most pleasing moments.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A defensive clanger loud enough to be heard back in Glasgow cost Rangers two points at Dundee. Their flighty skipper Lorenzo Amoruso was the man who dropped it, committing the cardinal sin of being dispossessed in front of his own goal. The Italian tried to be too clever on the edge of his penalty area and was robbed of the ball by Dundee substitute Juan Sara. Sara, the Argentine who had come on only minutes earlier, managed to poke the ball past Stefan Klos and ensure that an occasionally bad-tempered game finished with honours even. A delighted Sara promptly tugged his shirt over his head to reveal a T-shirt bearing the legend 'Jesus Loves You', rather ironic considering his team's terrible disciplinary record so far this season. Dundee had already clocked up an astonishing six red cards and 21 yellows before kick-off. Until then it had looked likely that Neil McCann's 56th-minute strike might be the decider. The left winger, who scored Scotland's winner against Latvia in their World Cup qualifier earlier in the week, smashed a 20-yard drive past his international colleague Robert Douglas after being set up by Tugay Kerimoglu. Rangers dominated the opening exchanges as Dundee, obviously hoping to carve chances from counter-attacks rather than numbers up front, opted to defend in strength, leaving the Argentine Fabien Caballero as a lone, and often lonely, striker. At the other end it took Rangers' Dutch striker Michael Mols, making his first competitive start since he was injured in a collision with Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn 10 months ago, 20 minutes to get a sight of goal and when he did Steven Tweed was in the way. Rangers' early pressure began to evolve into chances and Marcello Marrocco had to be calm under pressure to head away McCann's far-post cross from the left before Mols could pounce. Mols, warmly applauded by the visiting supporters, had few chances in total though, and spent much of the game on his backside claiming fouls which were rarely given. His manager Dick Advocaat will at least have been encouraged that he managed to last the vigorous 90 minutes, especially with Rangers' Champions League campaign beginning on Tuesday, at home against Austrian side Sturm Graz. With the home team snapping at their heels though, Rangers had no time to think of Europe. As one might expect from a game involving bad boys Dundee, the referee was kept busy throughout. Scott Wilson was booked for bringing down Caballero, Marco di Marchi for fouling Neil McCann and Tugay received a similar punishment for fouling Dundee player-manager Ivano Bonetti, who was at the heart of many of his side's most pleasing moments.",

Indeed, it is hard to see how anyone can get to become a club stalwart if teams like Real are going to cynically exploit the Bosman ruling and make a quick buck on players who cost them nothing. There is not much more you can ask of a foreign player in his first season at a club than to settle into the side after a change of manager, play an integral part in helping reach a European Cup final in Paris and score a goal when he gets there.

      "body": "<p>Estonia is a paradox: young, free and modern, but with a pagan soul. What good-time boy could resist a brew of heaving bars, beauteous nymphs, devilish revels and wild nights, not forgetting hairy beasts? No wonder the Tartan Army feels at home. </p> <p>As a child, I had looked through enough old atlases and stamp collections to know that Estonia is not, as many seem to believe, in the Balkans, but not much more. One guidebook advises visitors to bring their own condoms, another to bring Mace to fend off stray dogs while jogging in the suburbs. I found a little poem by the renowned Estonian poet, Juhan Liiv: </p> <p> You are too little <br> Little to be seen <br> To be known <br> To be felt <br> You are a little land <br> Little your speech <br> You have an indrawn heart <br> They cannot reach. </p> <p>Estonia is not that small, actually: it's bigger than Switzerland, consisting of a sizeable chunk of the Northern European mainland plus well over a thousand islands. But it does boast one of the world's smallest population densities. It shares the Baltic Sea with Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany. It has the same latitude as the northernmost tip of Scotland. Estonia emerged from the chaos of the First World War and the turmoil of Russian revolution as a highly literate country gaining its independence for the first time in 700 years. </p> <p>The recently formed Estonian Airlines flight from Gatwick provided excellent food and service.Although smoking was not allowed, nicotine chewing gum of various strengths was thoughtfully provided. I was reading the in-flight magazine and strategically seated next to a fluently English-speaking Estonian beauty called Monica. An old lad's research prospects had never looked brighter. </p> <p>Estonians are thought to be glum, pessimistic, stubborn, secretive, narrow (if not closed) minded, self-absorbed, unable to smile, brusque, and are expected to be so because of the long, dark mini-Ice Age winters and constant interrogations by the Gestapo and the KGB. 'May your face be as ice,' is an understandable and sensibly held motto. </p> <p>None of this seemed to apply to Monica, with whom I struck up a conversation. She explained how Estonian independence lasted a mere 20 years and had been followed by half a century of Soviet occupation. The Soviets committed their standard catalogue of atrocities - secret murders, executions without trial, mass deportations, exile to Siberian prison camps, the ruthless destruction of cemeteries, national treasures and cultural memories. Even Father Christmas and privately owned windmills were abolished. All phone calls and mail had to be routed through Moscow. The Estonian national anthem was forbidden, and people were sent to Siberia for singing it. However, it was played on Finnish TV and radio, which could be covertly picked up. </p> <p>Monica's eyes welled with the tears of painful memories. I tactfully changed the subject. </p> <p>'Why do lads like Tallinn so much, Monica?' </p> <p>She had no idea what I meant. My 20-minute summary of lad culture did nothing to improve her understanding, but she did infer the requirement of hedonism. </p> <p>'Presumably, these lads like to sing?' </p> <p>'Lads do quite like singing, yes.' </p> <p>'Then it's easy. To have a good time in Estonia, you must go to the country, to the moonlight parties in the woods. Dance back to health. Sing away your sorrows. Drink and be merry. I suggest the island of Saaremaa. I have a summer-house there. Here is my mobile.' </p> <p>The next morning, I made a sightseeing tour of the capital. Built as a fort, a marketplace and a port, Tallinn is a jumble of contradictions, with its winding, cobbled streets, hidden courtyards, open-air markets and theatres, gingerbread fa\u00e7ades, and quirky defensive walls forming an intact medieval city encircled by tree-lined avenues, a belt of parks, a cluster of Soviet-era buildings, and the Baltic Sea. In the heart of the Old Town are pool bars, bowling alleys and subterranean 10,000-watt discos with all the lights. </p> <p>Previously neglected monastic buildings have been turned into student caf\u00e9s. Some establishments offered private striptease. Dimly lit cigar lounges enticed secret smokers. Hundreds of restaurants offered cuisines from dozens of nationalities. There were biker bars with real bikers, and country bars without country music. </p> <p>The Russians, in their 50-year occupation, painted buildings to achieve an inner-city drab uniformity, turned the churches into sterile museums and offices, and renamed streets after Russian military heroes. Now the paint is being peeled away, constantly revealing scenes of multi-coloured medieval merriment. I peeped inside an Orthodox church where a wedding and a funeral were simultaneously taking place in front of bemused Japanese tourists. </p> <p>I stumbled into haunted houses with heavily documented apparitions of crucified monks and black dogs with burning eyes. One house claimed to be the site of the Devil's wedding and subsequent reception; the clinking glasses could be heard all night. A well sits in the middle of a cobbled street. Food is thrown down to appease the goblin that lives at the bottom. Goblins and devils were more real in this city then in any other I've visited. Paganism is clearly alive and well. But where were the lads? </p> <p>A cursory glance around the Old City clearly showed that the main entertainment is, indeed, liquid. The many varieties of Estonian beer are first-class. During the thirteenth century, bishops demanded beer as payment for taxes. Fines and sacrifices were also paid in beer, and brewing beer was obligatory on holidays. When sailors brought back potatoes from America, the idea of vodka was quickly and sensibly conceived. And the best beer and vodka in Estonia come from Saaremaa, the island of the wood nymph with the mobile, the island where, during the Soviet occupation, no foreigner was allowed to visit, the island where enforced isolation preserved the traditions and culture of Old Estonia. I decided to forget the lads and head for Saaremaa. </p> <p>Renting a car was surprisingly cheap and easy, and the roads were very visitor-friendly and empty. Hitchhiking is actively encouraged, so I filled up the car with the first four thumb-wavers I encountered. They made helpful guides and informed me of the weird sports that have become popular in Estonia. These included wife-carrying races, mobile-phone throwing, and Keekiin (swinging in vertical circles). </p> <p>The beauties of the countryside are subtle and delicate. Half the country is covered with primeval forests, which yield to deep peat bogs, vast swamps, wild fens, misty marshes, sparkling lakes and rivers, and long and lonely sandy coastlines. We took a 30-minute ferry ride to Muhu, an island joined by causeway to Saaremaa. Tourism provides a welcome income here. Everything is available for those who believe active holidays restore creative powers: water sports, hiking, hunting, cycling, canoe trips and horse-riding. </p> <p>We passed through popular spa areas, where the locals have had centuries of experience with the curative properties of the shoreline mud. For those of us perfectly healthy but thoroughly inactive, roadside notices advertise fishing, open-air museums, and berry and mushroom picking. My passengers assured me that picking mushrooms could be a dangerous business for a visitor not accompanied by an Estonian able to distinguish the edible, the poisonous and those that render the consumer temporarily bananas. </p> <p>We got out of the car and rambled through the forest. It felt like being let loose in a safari park. Estonia has more large wild mammals than anywhere else in Europe. My fellow pickers claimed to see brown bears, elk, deer, wild boar, wolves and lynx. Earlier, we had definitely seen beavers, seals and otters, as well as black storks, sea swans and golden eagles. We filled a bag with berries and mushrooms, and I ate some. On the walk back, we passed the eerie 8,000-year-old meteorite crater of Kaali, where in Scandinavian mythology the sun has its grave. I wondered what secrets of the past were hidden here. An elderly gentleman approached me. </p> <p>'Are you from Scotland?' </p> <p>'No. I'm from a similar country called Wales.' </p> <p>'I study unidentified objects, you see, and I want to go to Loch Ness.' </p> <p>The sun was beginning to set as we drove to the Illiku Ladu summer disco. It would soon open its doors. There would then be a moonlight party in the woods. Assuming (even if hoping otherwise) that the mushrooms I'd wolfed were of the non-psychoactive variety, I joined the festivities and sampled extensively the local brews and spirits. Several hours of heavy drinking later, I was unable to determine if my assumption had been correct. We were in a sacred oak grove with totem pole-like energy columns beaming out waves of psychic rejuvenation. It was a bonfire-lit night of magic and sorcery with naked witches running through the trees, casting their spells. </p> <p>It was a night when dawn, furiously and swiftly, embraced the dusk. It was a night for boozing, a night for music, and a night for lovers. We adorned crowns of leaves, sported garlands of flowers, grasses, and herbs to ward off (or, in my case, encourage) those naughty wood nymphs. On ropes hung from trees, we swung over bonfires. We bathed in the magical, wrinkle-removing dew. The only forbidden activity was sleeping, punishable by a year's bad luck. I felt safe. </p> <p>Back in Tallinn, the city was heaving with laughing drinkers. A bar called Molly Malone's was crammed but no one was Irish. This was made clear by the presence of what had to be all the blonde contestants of Ms World, the attire worn by each male boozer (kilt, sporran and beret), and the tune being sung - 'Doh, a deer, a female deer'. I had walked into the temporary headquarters of the Tartan Army, Scotland's football fans. As far as laddish behaviour goes, the Tartan Army are pretty hard to beat. Chas, the head barman (a Scot), recognised me. 'That was all British and American propaganda, wasn't it, Howard?' said Chas, surrounded by hand-picked, beautiful barmaids. </p> <p>'What do you mean?' </p> <p>'You know. All that bollocks about women in the Soviet countries being fat and ugly.' </p> <p>'Why are the Scots here, Chas?' </p> <p>'Well, the owner of Molly Malone's is a Scot, and Scotland are playing Latvia on Saturday. Whenever Scotland are playing anywhere in or fairly near to Estonia, they always spend a few nights here in Tallinn. It's become a tradition.' </p> <p>The reasons are interesting. The region's worst maritime disaster outside of war was the 1994 sinking of the Estonia, a ferry operating between Stockholm and Tallinn. More than 800, including 500 Estonians, lost their lives. Some Scottish football fans, who had travelled on that same route, were so moved that they raised funds for the surviving families and presented the cheque to the Estonian embassy in London. </p> <p>A year later, Scotland were playing Estonia away. The Tartan Army's first act was to visit Tallinn's memorial to the deceased. Led by a lone piper, they marched through the streets and paid tribute with flowers. The fans were officially given the freedom of the city. The floodlights of Tallinn's small stadium had gone badly wrong, so the match was brought forward to be played in daylight. The Estonian team was too far out of town to get there in time, so Scotland marched on to the pitch alone. Six hundred members of the Tartan Army stood in the stands, otherwise empty, apart from the Estonian army who were filling in for the security men. Scotland played for a few seconds, walked off, and hit the town, to be joined later by the tardy Estonian team. </p> <p>The revelry was unprecedented and unsurpassed. Word gets around. Many fans return for weekend benders well outside the football season. They are complimented for their behaviour. A raggle-taggle mob of crazily dressed, skint people bevvying and swearing are not the usual criteria of civic order. But with Estonia and the Tartan Army, it's true love. </p> <p>Estonians are far from prudish. They excel in mockery of state authority. Their folk heroes never become kings; they talk philosophy with the Devil, then double-cross him. </p> <p>I shall definitely return. So will lots of lads.</p> <p><strong>Estonia facts </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.estonian-air.ee\">Estonian Air</a> (020 7333 0196) has six weekly direct flights from London Gatwick to Tallinn (daily except Saturday).

'May your face be as ice,' is an understandable and sensibly held motto. None of this seemed to apply to Monica, with whom I struck up a conversation. She explained how Estonian independence lasted a mere 20 years and had been followed by half a century of Soviet occupation. The Soviets committed their standard catalogue of atrocities - secret murders, executions without trial, mass deportations, exile to Siberian prison camps, the ruthless destruction of cemeteries, national treasures and cultural memories. Even Father Christmas and privately owned windmills were abolished. All phone calls and mail had to be routed through Moscow. The Estonian national anthem was forbidden, and people were sent to Siberia for singing it. However, it was played on Finnish TV and radio, which could be covertly picked up. Monica's eyes welled with the tears of painful memories. I tactfully changed the subject. 'Why do lads like Tallinn so much, Monica?' She had no idea what I meant. My 20-minute summary of lad culture did nothing to improve her understanding, but she did infer the requirement of hedonism. 'Presumably, these lads like to sing?' 'Lads do quite like singing, yes.' 'Then it's easy. To have a good time in Estonia, you must go to the country, to the moonlight parties in the woods. Dance back to health. Sing away your sorrows. Drink and be merry. I suggest the island of Saaremaa. I have a summer-house there. Here is my mobile.' The next morning, I made a sightseeing tour of the capital. Built as a fort, a marketplace and a port, Tallinn is a jumble of contradictions, with its winding, cobbled streets, hidden courtyards, open-air markets and theatres, gingerbread fa\u00e7ades, and quirky defensive walls forming an intact medieval city encircled by tree-lined avenues, a belt of parks, a cluster of Soviet-era buildings, and the Baltic Sea. In the heart of the Old Town are pool bars, bowling alleys and subterranean 10,000-watt discos with all the lights. Previously neglected monastic buildings have been turned into student caf\u00e9s. Some establishments offered private striptease. Dimly lit cigar lounges enticed secret smokers. Hundreds of restaurants offered cuisines from dozens of nationalities. There were biker bars with real bikers, and country bars without country music. The Russians, in their 50-year occupation, painted buildings to achieve an inner-city drab uniformity, turned the churches into sterile museums and offices, and renamed streets after Russian military heroes. Now the paint is being peeled away, constantly revealing scenes of multi-coloured medieval merriment. I peeped inside an Orthodox church where a wedding and a funeral were simultaneously taking place in front of bemused Japanese tourists. I stumbled into haunted houses with heavily documented apparitions of crucified monks and black dogs with burning eyes. One house claimed to be the site of the Devil's wedding and subsequent reception; the clinking glasses could be heard all night. A well sits in the middle of a cobbled street. Food is thrown down to appease the goblin that lives at the bottom. Goblins and devils were more real in this city then in any other I've visited. Paganism is clearly alive and well. But where were the lads? A cursory glance around the Old City clearly showed that the main entertainment is, indeed, liquid. The many varieties of Estonian beer are first-class. During the thirteenth century, bishops demanded beer as payment for taxes. Fines and sacrifices were also paid in beer, and brewing beer was obligatory on holidays. When sailors brought back potatoes from America, the idea of vodka was quickly and sensibly conceived. And the best beer and vodka in Estonia come from Saaremaa, the island of the wood nymph with the mobile, the island where, during the Soviet occupation, no foreigner was allowed to visit, the island where enforced isolation preserved the traditions and culture of Old Estonia. I decided to forget the lads and head for Saaremaa. Renting a car was surprisingly cheap and easy, and the roads were very visitor-friendly and empty. Hitchhiking is actively encouraged, so I filled up the car with the first four thumb-wavers I encountered. They made helpful guides and informed me of the weird sports that have become popular in Estonia. These included wife-carrying races, mobile-phone throwing, and Keekiin (swinging in vertical circles). The beauties of the countryside are subtle and delicate. Half the country is covered with primeval forests, which yield to deep peat bogs, vast swamps, wild fens, misty marshes, sparkling lakes and rivers, and long and lonely sandy coastlines. We took a 30-minute ferry ride to Muhu, an island joined by causeway to Saaremaa. Tourism provides a welcome income here. Everything is available for those who believe active holidays restore creative powers: water sports, hiking, hunting, cycling, canoe trips and horse-riding. We passed through popular spa areas, where the locals have had centuries of experience with the curative properties of the shoreline mud. For those of us perfectly healthy but thoroughly inactive, roadside notices advertise fishing, open-air museums, and berry and mushroom picking. My passengers assured me that picking mushrooms could be a dangerous business for a visitor not accompanied by an Estonian able to distinguish the edible, the poisonous and those that render the consumer temporarily bananas. We got out of the car and rambled through the forest. It felt like being let loose in a safari park. Estonia has more large wild mammals than anywhere else in Europe. My fellow pickers claimed to see brown bears, elk, deer, wild boar, wolves and lynx. Earlier, we had definitely seen beavers, seals and otters, as well as black storks, sea swans and golden eagles. We filled a bag with berries and mushrooms, and I ate some. On the walk back, we passed the eerie 8,000-year-old meteorite crater of Kaali, where in Scandinavian mythology the sun has its grave. I wondered what secrets of the past were hidden here. An elderly gentleman approached me. 'Are you from Scotland?' 'No. I'm from a similar country called Wales.' 'I study unidentified objects, you see, and I want to go to Loch Ness.' The sun was beginning to set as we drove to the Illiku Ladu summer disco. It would soon open its doors. There would then be a moonlight party in the woods. Assuming (even if hoping otherwise) that the mushrooms I'd wolfed were of the non-psychoactive variety, I joined the festivities and sampled extensively the local brews and spirits. Several hours of heavy drinking later, I was unable to determine if my assumption had been correct. We were in a sacred oak grove with totem pole-like energy columns beaming out waves of psychic rejuvenation. It was a bonfire-lit night of magic and sorcery with naked witches running through the trees, casting their spells. It was a night when dawn, furiously and swiftly, embraced the dusk. It was a night for boozing, a night for music, and a night for lovers. We adorned crowns of leaves, sported garlands of flowers, grasses, and herbs to ward off (or, in my case, encourage) those naughty wood nymphs. On ropes hung from trees, we swung over bonfires. We bathed in the magical, wrinkle-removing dew. The only forbidden activity was sleeping, punishable by a year's bad luck. I felt safe. Back in Tallinn, the city was heaving with laughing drinkers. A bar called Molly Malone's was crammed but no one was Irish. This was made clear by the presence of what had to be all the blonde contestants of Ms World, the attire worn by each male boozer (kilt, sporran and beret), and the tune being sung - 'Doh, a deer, a female deer'. I had walked into the temporary headquarters of the Tartan Army, Scotland's football fans. As far as laddish behaviour goes, the Tartan Army are pretty hard to beat. Chas, the head barman (a Scot), recognised me. 'That was all British and American propaganda, wasn't it, Howard?' said Chas, surrounded by hand-picked, beautiful barmaids. 'What do you mean?' 'You know. All that bollocks about women in the Soviet countries being fat and ugly.' 'Why are the Scots here, Chas?' 'Well, the owner of Molly Malone's is a Scot, and Scotland are playing Latvia on Saturday. Whenever Scotland are playing anywhere in or fairly near to Estonia, they always spend a few nights here in Tallinn. It's become a tradition.' The reasons are interesting. The region's worst maritime disaster outside of war was the 1994 sinking of the Estonia, a ferry operating between Stockholm and Tallinn. More than 800, including 500 Estonians, lost their lives. Some Scottish football fans, who had travelled on that same route, were so moved that they raised funds for the surviving families and presented the cheque to the Estonian embassy in London. A year later, Scotland were playing Estonia away. The Tartan Army's first act was to visit Tallinn's memorial to the deceased. Led by a lone piper, they marched through the streets and paid tribute with flowers. The fans were officially given the freedom of the city. The floodlights of Tallinn's small stadium had gone badly wrong, so the match was brought forward to be played in daylight. The Estonian team was too far out of town to get there in time, so Scotland marched on to the pitch alone. Six hundred members of the Tartan Army stood in the stands, otherwise empty, apart from the Estonian army who were filling in for the security men. Scotland played for a few seconds, walked off, and hit the town, to be joined later by the tardy Estonian team. The revelry was unprecedented and unsurpassed. Word gets around. Many fans return for weekend benders well outside the football season. They are complimented for their behaviour. A raggle-taggle mob of crazily dressed, skint people bevvying and swearing are not the usual criteria of civic order. But with Estonia and the Tartan Army, it's true love. Estonians are far from prudish. They excel in mockery of state authority. Their folk heroes never become kings; they talk philosophy with the Devil, then double-cross him. I shall definitely return. So will lots of lads. Estonia facts Estonian Air (020 7333 0196) has six weekly direct flights from London Gatwick to Tallinn (daily except Saturday). Return fares start at \u00a3268. Estonian Air passengers qualify for special rates with selected hotels in Tallinn. A double room at the two-star Hotel Central costs \u00a340 per night while the five-star Park Consul Schlossle costs from \u00a395. Contact Estonian Air reservations for details.

      "body": "<p>England's keenest football fan, Tony Blair, who can't remember the first game he went to and used to sit in Newcastle's Gallowgate End - even though it didn't have seats then - has come out in favour of keeping the present transfer system. Phew, that should save it then. </p> <p>As nothing was happening at the New York Millennium Summit last week Blair made a statement on football transfers. The statement only amounted to nine words, 'Dismantling the entire transfer system is not the answer.' With a little help from Alastair Campbell, who unlike his boss does know about football, that was more than enough to make a story. We were told that Blair had the backing of the German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der - which he confirmed yesterday - and French President Jacques Chirac. </p> <p>Don't hold your breath. I well remember attending a European summit meeting when the issue of saving duty free came up. Chirac turned to Blair and said, 'Why are we abolishing it when it's so popular with everyone?' Blair and the rest of Europe's leaders just shrugged their shoulders. Even though none of the elected leaders wanted to get rid of duty free, the Brussels bureaucrats did, and look who won. </p> <p>'Transfers Herr to stay.' Get it? But The Sun's headline this week was certainly premature. What must be most worrying for those who want to keep the system is the 'setting up of a New Labour-style Transfer Task Force. Worse still, there is talk of adopting the Spanish system where players have a buy-out clause in their contract. This is the one that resulted in Luis Figo moving from Barcelona to Real Madrid for \u00a338 million even though Real are in effect bankrupt. </p> <p>If they were really serious, Uefa should have blocked the deal or insisted that any fee must be paid up front, not in instalments - but that would be too sensible. Uefa need to introduce financial accountability to the crazy football market and at least there's talk of them introducing a licence which would be withdrawn for serious financial mismanagement. </p> <p>The intervention from Blair was strange and very un-Blair, because in no way could the keeping of the transfer system be seen as 'populist.' Most fans know that all the talk about 'the end of football' is tosh. The talking points for fans this week have been Keegan's decision not to start with Michael Owen and Chelsea's inability to defend a two-goal lead, not transfers. </p> <p>Supporters will rightly scoff at any big clubs and big earners who claim that the end of the transfer system will end football as we know it, and laugh at their crocodile tears for the small clubs who they claim will suffer. Since when did they care about the small clubs? The reason for setting up the Premier League in the first place was to direct more money to them and less to the smaller clubs. </p> <p>The fact is football has always resisted change and some of us are old enough to remember what the big clubs said about the abolition of the maximum wage when players were treated as slaves. You've guessed it - they said it would be the end of football, as we know it. </p> <p>It's not surprising that the Premier League bosses (or the chairmen at least) were unanimous in their support for maintaining the status quo: it just confirms that they must be wrong. What is more surprising is the attitude of the players' union. You would have thought that ending the 'cattle market' transfer system would have the support of the PFA, particularly as the top players would stand to make even more money than they do now. They apparently argue that they are more worried about the wages of players in the lower divisions, which isn't that surprising given that a lot of them are on silly money and are paid far more than they are worth. </p> <p>The present system is indefensible and football's claim to be a special case is not justified. It's not often that the Eurocrats get it right but they were right on freedom of contract and they are right about transfers. What other business operates like football, buying and selling workers for millions of pounds they don't have? And what has been done about all the corruption that goes with it, including 'bungs'? </p> <p>Absolutely nothing. It's high time football's money madness was reined in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "England's keenest football fan, Tony Blair, who can't remember the first game he went to and used to sit in Newcastle's Gallowgate End - even though it didn't have seats then - has come out in favour of keeping the present transfer system. Phew, that should save it then. As nothing was happening at the New York Millennium Summit last week Blair made a statement on football transfers. The statement only amounted to nine words, 'Dismantling the entire transfer system is not the answer.' With a little help from Alastair Campbell, who unlike his boss does know about football, that was more than enough to make a story. We were told that Blair had the backing of the German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der - which he confirmed yesterday - and French President Jacques Chirac. Don't hold your breath. I well remember attending a European summit meeting when the issue of saving duty free came up. Chirac turned to Blair and said, 'Why are we abolishing it when it's so popular with everyone?' Blair and the rest of Europe's leaders just shrugged their shoulders. Even though none of the elected leaders wanted to get rid of duty free, the Brussels bureaucrats did, and look who won. 'Transfers Herr to stay.' Get it? But The Sun's headline this week was certainly premature. What must be most worrying for those who want to keep the system is the 'setting up of a New Labour-style Transfer Task Force. Worse still, there is talk of adopting the Spanish system where players have a buy-out clause in their contract. This is the one that resulted in Luis Figo moving from Barcelona to Real Madrid for \u00a338 million even though Real are in effect bankrupt. If they were really serious, Uefa should have blocked the deal or insisted that any fee must be paid up front, not in instalments - but that would be too sensible. Uefa need to introduce financial accountability to the crazy football market and at least there's talk of them introducing a licence which would be withdrawn for serious financial mismanagement. The intervention from Blair was strange and very un-Blair, because in no way could the keeping of the transfer system be seen as 'populist.' Most fans know that all the talk about 'the end of football' is tosh. The talking points for fans this week have been Keegan's decision not to start with Michael Owen and Chelsea's inability to defend a two-goal lead, not transfers. Supporters will rightly scoff at any big clubs and big earners who claim that the end of the transfer system will end football as we know it, and laugh at their crocodile tears for the small clubs who they claim will suffer. Since when did they care about the small clubs? The reason for setting up the Premier League in the first place was to direct more money to them and less to the smaller clubs. The fact is football has always resisted change and some of us are old enough to remember what the big clubs said about the abolition of the maximum wage when players were treated as slaves. You've guessed it - they said it would be the end of football, as we know it. It's not surprising that the Premier League bosses (or the chairmen at least) were unanimous in their support for maintaining the status quo: it just confirms that they must be wrong. What is more surprising is the attitude of the players' union. You would have thought that ending the 'cattle market' transfer system would have the support of the PFA, particularly as the top players would stand to make even more money than they do now. They apparently argue that they are more worried about the wages of players in the lower divisions, which isn't that surprising given that a lot of them are on silly money and are paid far more than they are worth. The present system is indefensible and football's claim to be a special case is not justified. It's not often that the Eurocrats get it right but they were right on freedom of contract and they are right about transfers. What other business operates like football, buying and selling workers for millions of pounds they don't have? And what has been done about all the corruption that goes with it, including 'bungs'? Absolutely nothing. It's high time football's money madness was reined in.",

      "body": "<p>Conspicuously absent from the champagne-soaked celebrations at The Oval was the England coach, Duncan Fletcher. In fact we've hardly seen him all summer. He could be glimpsed on the balcony throughout the Test series, stern-faced, lugubrious, betraying little emotion whether England were getting thrashed at Edgbaston or mounting a surreal comeback at Lord's. </p> <p>He has appeared occasionally at press conferences, but only when demanded. There he speaks with clipped common sense, but in contrast to his predecessors, David Lloyd and Raymond Illingworth, he says as little as he possibly can without being obstructive. In any case, he soon learnt in South Africa last winter that he's only required to say anything when England are struggling, which has seldom been the case this summer. He does not need the plaudits of the press; he's adamant that 'players, not coaches, win matches'. Curiously, this stance now provokes more praise. Recently he's been hailed in the papers as England's 'best ever coach'. </p> <p>More importantly, the players are coming to the same conclusion. Nasser Hussain admitted last year that 'I would not have recognised him if he had walked past me in the street' and was wary how the new coach might react to him given all the stories about 'bad boy Hussain', but he soon described him as 'a breath of fresh air'. None of the players I've spoken to has a critical, off-the-record word to say about him (I haven't talked to Robert Croft recently). But beyond the dressing room he remains to most of us something of an enigma, who guards his privacy carefully, who actively wants to keep out of the way - even in victory. </p> <p>I met him at Lord's the day after England's series triumph; he had been overseeing some fitness testing of the players before popping back to South Africa for a brief holiday. I began with a bland - OK, maybe boring - question: 'What was the most satisfying aspect of the summer?' This was solemnly blocked. 'Winning and seeing the players enjoying their cricket,' he said, trying to be helpful after an exasperated pause. 'It's satisfying to identify certain players and to be proved correct.' </p> <p>Hmmm... this was not getting us far. But somehow we were soon discussing the techniques of batting; suddenly he was animated and up on his feet; there was a spark in his eyes as on the concrete at the Nursery End he was demonstrating with an imaginary bat different ways of playing the hook shot. His thesis (we won't bother with the technicalities) made sense and his exposition was clear and dynamic. I thought how much I would have enjoyed being coached by this man. </p> <p>This called to mind an observation about Fletcher made by the England newcomer Marcus Trescothick. 'He reminds me of Dermot [Reeve],' he said. This made me blink. Reeve is a good coach, but it's hard to think of many parallels with Fletcher. Reeve has never been one to shun the limelight, nor to choose his words sparingly. Then Trescothick explained how both men were prepared to challenge the traditional methods of playing the game; both were flexible, lateral thinkers, always positive in outlook. </p> <p>However, there are some fundamentals, to which Fletcher sticks rigidly when coaching. He has a distinct method that he's used successfully at Western Province and at Glamorgan. 'Before I took the England job I was nervous whether it would work at international level.' His approach is based on the primacy of the captain. He explains: 'When I was first made captain [in Zimbabwe] I thought I needed a coach to run everything. I was an all-rounder and I wanted time to concentrate on my own game, so I had Peter Carlstein installed as an omnipotent coach. It took me two practice sessions to establish that this was not working. The players can't have two bosses; the captain must be the man in charge.' It was never so straightforward when David Lloyd, who pined to be Alex Ferguson, or Illy, whose book was proudly entitled One-Man Committee, were in charge. </p> <p>'Give people responsibility and they'll respond,' says Fletcher. 'I learnt that from my days in the commercial world [he worked in the computer industry in South Africa]. With England we have a committee to discuss all matters relating to the team both on and off the field.' This summer it comprised Fletcher and Hussain plus Atherton, Stewart, Gough and Thorpe (interesting that he should reinstate Thorpe so rapidly after his self-imposed exile last winter). </p> <p>Fletcher has sometimes referred to himself as a 'consultant' to a company, whose managing director is the captain of the team. Steve James of Glamorgan has recalled how Fletcher outlined this system at the first meeting with his players at Cardiff in 1997. His message was relayed with typical clarity until he climaxed his talk with, 'OK, let's get this road on the show', a slip they never let him forget. Fletcher, despite the dour demeanour, can laugh at himself. Indeed his solemn countenance can sometimes be an unlikely source of humour. Simon Hughes, yakking around Zimbabwe many years ago, was informed that Fletcher's brother held the world record for the number of press-ups. This impressed Hughes: 'At an opportune moment I asked him about his brother's press-up prowess. Fletcher's expression darkened and he said solemnly \"My brother hasn't got any arms\" and stared at the ground. Just as I was about to splutter a profuse apology he burst into rolling laughter.' </p> <p>While Fletcher oversees England's pre-match practices in consultation with Hussain, much of his most important work is done on a one-to-one basis. This summer, for example, he trekked up to Chester-le-Street to visit Steve Harmison, not for a net, but just to talk things over. He emphasises that the players 'must trust you and know that you are on their side'. After a fortnight in South Africa last winter, Andy Caddick felt that Fletcher understood the individual needs of a fast bowler far better than any of his predecessors; Craig White told me how Fletcher made him feel 'ten feet tall' one rainy afternoon in Cape Town after explaining how he might become an integral part of the Test team. Fletcher makes time to get to know his players. </p> <p>At the start he didn't know any of them. He scarcely had any input into the selection of the touring party for South Africa last year. He recalls how he had never seen Michael Vaughan bat before. 'But I watched him in the nets at the beginning of the tour and thought, \"This guy could bat at number four\".' He trusts his own eyes, which has led to the rapid elevation of White and Trescothick this summer. </p> <p>Increasingly he has more influence over selection, although he admits that he's barely seen Ian Salisbury, the surprise package for Pakistan, bowl. 'It's difficult given the international calendar to see them in action in county cricket. Players only perform one in three times and that's only if they happen to be batting or bowling on the day you're there.' He had only heard reports of England's other wrist-spinner, Chris Schofield, before he was offered a central contract in April, but he vehemently rejects the idea that Schofield's experience this summer undermines the validity of the central-contract system. </p> <p>Indeed he says that he was very fortunate that his tenure as coach coincided with the advent of that system. 'There're bound to be teething problems. It was just the same when it was introduced in South Africa five or six years ago. Initially the state sides were up in arms. But at Western Province we often did better without our international players. Someone like Gary Kirsten would come back from the Tests; he'd be willing himself to do well for his state side but the spark wasn't there. The same can happen here. </p> <p>'Next year I would like 15 or 16 to be contracted. That would give healthy competition and a degree of security to the players involved. You're never going to get it 100 per cent right in your selection for central contracts.' I suggest that the counties are less grumpy now that England have prospered this summer. 'Success this summer should be irrelevant. This is the right way forward,' he says. He agonised long and hard about whether to allow players to turn out for their counties at the end of this season. 'I thought about letting some of the younger ones, like Flintoff and Trescothick, play a few games, but in the end I concluded that they might be weary by the time we reach the second Test in Pakistan.' </p> <p>He's never been to Pakistan, where the cricket is unlikely to be played on the seamer-friendly surfaces that have suited England so well this summer. 'I've already talked to some of the batsmen about playing spin, offering a few technical suggestions [which he was reluctant to divulge]. They will be working on those in Nairobi and during the one-day series in Pakistan. But when the Tests are approaching it is no longer right to dwell on technicalities.' </p> <p>He may acknowledge England's frailties in the spin department, but like the good coach, he's swift to defend those chosen (Salisbury and Ashley Giles) even if he doesn't know them well - yet. 'It's hard for spinners in this country, who are suddenly expected to bowl out the opposition single-handedly when a turning track comes along.' He knows that Salisbury has potential even though he's never shown it at Test level. 'We'll just have to make sure he has plenty of bowling early on and give him as much confidence as we can.' Judging by England's performances this summer, that's what Fletcher is remarkably good at.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Mallorca is an island celebrated for its beauty. I've been there a few times and know all about the fertile valleys, scenic mountains, shady citrus groves, fine restaurants and picturesque villages. Yet somehow, up till now, I' d never managed to see any of it. </p> <p>Mallorca - or Majorca, as we called it then - was where we took our first family holiday abroad. I was 14 and it was heaven, a two-week package of sun, sea, sangria, hotel discos and all-you-can-eat BBQ excursions. We didn't see a great deal of the island, but my parents came back to Birmingham with the copy of 'Y Viva Espana' they' ve played at every family get-together since and I flew home feeling worldly and sophisticated with a sombrero on my head and a 3ft high plastic donkey on my lap. It was, we all agreed, a perfect holiday. </p> <p>Later, I came back with friends from the club world to visit BCM in Magaluf, Europe's biggest disco and a regular summer stopover for British DJs. The hospitality of the club' s manager, Toni Palmer, is legendary, and his guests always end up going to bed early. Usually a day or two after they first enter his establishment. So it is that I know more about Magaluf bar life than is perhaps healthy or desirable and am also familiar with a handful of charming after-hours clubs and bars in the island's capital, Palma. I've even staggered into the cathedral there once, admiring the Gothic architecture and examining in a dazed and confused way the rather peculiar altar added by Antoni Gaud\u00ed before wandering off for some long overdue sleep. </p> <p>But this time, things were going to be different. This time, we had our four-year-old son and an air-conditioned Volvo that was a pleasure to drive. Finally, we were going to explore Mallorca. And after the gaudy bustle of Magaluf, the first revelation was our tranquil base on the south-east coast. Porto Petro is the kind of place brochures still like to call 'a sleepy fishing village', although it is now more a marina for tourist sailing boats, surrounded by restaurants with menus in several languages. But it's protected from over-development by its lack of beach and our villa stood on a quiet, pine-shaded road that was only a short walk from the waterside but felt like a private retreat. </p> <p>For the first few days, we barely strayed from the safe, sandy twin coves of nearby Cala Mondrago. We drove, but a van pulled a cute little tourist 'train' through the resorts strung along this part of the coast several times a day, ferrying its red-skinned cargo to the beaches. Mondrago is its last stop and also the prettiest. Both of its beaches had clear, clean water shelving gently into the sea. The closer of the two boasted a big restaurant pumping out loud music and an endless supply of chips, bumper-to-bumper sunbeds and children splashing in and out of the sea while screaming loudly in a variety of languages. The other beach, accessed along a long concrete path, was far more peaceful, with only a small booth serving drinks and hiring out sun-beds. (No prizes for guessing which one our son preferred.) </p> <p>Lunch came most days from a man selling melon, pineapple and coconut on the beach, all of which he' d expertly cut using a lethal-looking machete. Children who you suspect never touch fruit at home queued to buy from him and our son developed a taste for watermelon that has lasted long after the holiday ended. At night we ate at first in the excellent restaurants overlooking Porto Pedro' s marina. The lobster we ordered one night was delicious but took well over an hour to arrive: great if you' re sharing a bottle of wine or two with friends; an eternity if you're trying to entertain a small boy who cannot understand why food should ever take longer than a Big Mac and fries. </p> <p> At home, one of our solutions to the fast food versus good food conundrum is tapas: the food comes quickly, there' s endless variety and lots of different things for picky kids to try. But in Mallorca, the problem was finding it. Only one place in Porto Petro claimed to serve tapas, but their technique of coating every ingredient in thick batter before chucking it into the deep-fat fryer for what seemed like an hour owed more to Scottish chip shops than Spanish bars. Along the coast we found wood-fired pizzerias, an Italian ice-cream parlour, German-run cafes - but no tapas. </p> <p>So we drove around the island. A restaurant in a back-street in the north-west resort of Port de Pollen\u00e7a offered a delicious bread-and-vegetable stew as part of a ridiculously cheap set lunch.

The day-trippers had left and lovely Dei\u00e0 seemed to have closed for the night, so we drove on and finally ended up in a promising-looking bar opposite the church in nearby Calvi\u00e0 with a cold beer and a plate of assorted mashed vegetable bits that was called tapas but looked more like something you see thrown up in the gutter in Magaluf after the bars have closed. </p> <p>It was the end of the week before we left the beach again and ventured into Palma.

      "bodyText": "Mallorca is an island celebrated for its beauty. I've been there a few times and know all about the fertile valleys, scenic mountains, shady citrus groves, fine restaurants and picturesque villages. Yet somehow, up till now, I' d never managed to see any of it. Mallorca - or Majorca, as we called it then - was where we took our first family holiday abroad. I was 14 and it was heaven, a two-week package of sun, sea, sangria, hotel discos and all-you-can-eat BBQ excursions. We didn't see a great deal of the island, but my parents came back to Birmingham with the copy of 'Y Viva Espana' they' ve played at every family get-together since and I flew home feeling worldly and sophisticated with a sombrero on my head and a 3ft high plastic donkey on my lap. It was, we all agreed, a perfect holiday. Later, I came back with friends from the club world to visit BCM in Magaluf, Europe's biggest disco and a regular summer stopover for British DJs. The hospitality of the club' s manager, Toni Palmer, is legendary, and his guests always end up going to bed early. Usually a day or two after they first enter his establishment. So it is that I know more about Magaluf bar life than is perhaps healthy or desirable and am also familiar with a handful of charming after-hours clubs and bars in the island's capital, Palma. I've even staggered into the cathedral there once, admiring the Gothic architecture and examining in a dazed and confused way the rather peculiar altar added by Antoni Gaud\u00ed before wandering off for some long overdue sleep. But this time, things were going to be different. This time, we had our four-year-old son and an air-conditioned Volvo that was a pleasure to drive. Finally, we were going to explore Mallorca. And after the gaudy bustle of Magaluf, the first revelation was our tranquil base on the south-east coast. Porto Petro is the kind of place brochures still like to call 'a sleepy fishing village', although it is now more a marina for tourist sailing boats, surrounded by restaurants with menus in several languages. But it's protected from over-development by its lack of beach and our villa stood on a quiet, pine-shaded road that was only a short walk from the waterside but felt like a private retreat. For the first few days, we barely strayed from the safe, sandy twin coves of nearby Cala Mondrago. We drove, but a van pulled a cute little tourist 'train' through the resorts strung along this part of the coast several times a day, ferrying its red-skinned cargo to the beaches. Mondrago is its last stop and also the prettiest. Both of its beaches had clear, clean water shelving gently into the sea. The closer of the two boasted a big restaurant pumping out loud music and an endless supply of chips, bumper-to-bumper sunbeds and children splashing in and out of the sea while screaming loudly in a variety of languages. The other beach, accessed along a long concrete path, was far more peaceful, with only a small booth serving drinks and hiring out sun-beds. (No prizes for guessing which one our son preferred.) Lunch came most days from a man selling melon, pineapple and coconut on the beach, all of which he' d expertly cut using a lethal-looking machete. Children who you suspect never touch fruit at home queued to buy from him and our son developed a taste for watermelon that has lasted long after the holiday ended. At night we ate at first in the excellent restaurants overlooking Porto Pedro' s marina. The lobster we ordered one night was delicious but took well over an hour to arrive: great if you' re sharing a bottle of wine or two with friends; an eternity if you're trying to entertain a small boy who cannot understand why food should ever take longer than a Big Mac and fries. At home, one of our solutions to the fast food versus good food conundrum is tapas: the food comes quickly, there' s endless variety and lots of different things for picky kids to try. But in Mallorca, the problem was finding it. Only one place in Porto Petro claimed to serve tapas, but their technique of coating every ingredient in thick batter before chucking it into the deep-fat fryer for what seemed like an hour owed more to Scottish chip shops than Spanish bars. Along the coast we found wood-fired pizzerias, an Italian ice-cream parlour, German-run cafes - but no tapas. So we drove around the island. A restaurant in a back-street in the north-west resort of Port de Pollen\u00e7a offered a delicious bread-and-vegetable stew as part of a ridiculously cheap set lunch. A caf\u00e9 at the Mirador de ses Barques up in the mountains had cold drinks and breathtaking views down to the sea. Down among the citrus groves by S\u00f3ller, we drank a fresh orange juice at a table shaded by the trees the fruit had been picked from. But by tapas-time, the culinary trail had grown cold. The day-trippers had left and lovely Dei\u00e0 seemed to have closed for the night, so we drove on and finally ended up in a promising-looking bar opposite the church in nearby Calvi\u00e0 with a cold beer and a plate of assorted mashed vegetable bits that was called tapas but looked more like something you see thrown up in the gutter in Magaluf after the bars have closed. It was the end of the week before we left the beach again and ventured into Palma. It is a beautiful city, interesting and easy to walk around with fantastic shops and delis, extravagant turn-of-the-century modernista exteriors, caf\u00e9s in shady squares selling excellent food and coffee at a fraction of the price of the resorts.

      "body": "<p>The best way to find a good hotel is by personal recommendation and The Good Hotel Guide could be described as word-of-mouth in print. A good hotel was defined by Hilary Rubinstein, who founded the Guide 24 years ago, as: 'Where the guest comes first.' </p> <p>We look for hotels of unusual character and quality. They are usually on the small side and owner-managed; almost no hotels in the book belong to a chain, since these usually fail to provide the welcome and care for guests' comfort that can be found in the best of the small, individually owned hotels. Most have been recommended by correspondents who have taken the trouble to write to us. We verify and collate the reports, making an anonymous overnight inspection where necessary. </p> <p>The Guide is independent: we accept no free hospitality, contributors are not paid for writing to us and hotels do not pay for their entry. This gives us the freedom to criticise where appropriate. The entries are updated each year. Hotels are dropped if critical reports outweigh those in favour, if we have had no reports for some time or if there has been a change of ownership, unless we are sure that standards have been maintained. Despite the name, we also include inns, guest houses and B&amp;Bs, since many of our readers like their good value and lack of formality. </p> <p>Each year 10 special hotels are given our C\u00e9sar award for excellence. Some of the winners in the 2001 edition are included in this selection (they are marked with a laurel leaf). </p> <p><strong> Town house hotels</strong></p> <p> One of the interesting trends in recent years has been the development of the small townhouse hotel in major cities. </p> <p> <strong> 1 Hotel on the Park</strong><br> Evesham Road, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

      "bodyText": "The best way to find a good hotel is by personal recommendation and The Good Hotel Guide could be described as word-of-mouth in print. A good hotel was defined by Hilary Rubinstein, who founded the Guide 24 years ago, as: 'Where the guest comes first.' We look for hotels of unusual character and quality. They are usually on the small side and owner-managed; almost no hotels in the book belong to a chain, since these usually fail to provide the welcome and care for guests' comfort that can be found in the best of the small, individually owned hotels. Most have been recommended by correspondents who have taken the trouble to write to us. We verify and collate the reports, making an anonymous overnight inspection where necessary. The Guide is independent: we accept no free hospitality, contributors are not paid for writing to us and hotels do not pay for their entry. This gives us the freedom to criticise where appropriate. The entries are updated each year. Hotels are dropped if critical reports outweigh those in favour, if we have had no reports for some time or if there has been a change of ownership, unless we are sure that standards have been maintained. Despite the name, we also include inns, guest houses and B&amp;Bs, since many of our readers like their good value and lack of formality. Each year 10 special hotels are given our C\u00e9sar award for excellence. Some of the winners in the 2001 edition are included in this selection (they are marked with a laurel leaf). Town house hotels One of the interesting trends in recent years has been the development of the small townhouse hotel in major cities. 1 Hotel on the Park Evesham Road, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

      "body": "<p>'C'mon, mate. Are ya a bloke or a Sheila? Git it down ya' nick!' </p> <p>With his hanging corks hat and khaki shorts, Mick encapsulated almost every Australian stereotype, needing just a can of Foster's in his hand to complete the effect. Mick, a wizened, red-coloured man in his sixties, was the owner of the Johnstone River Crocodile Farm. This was one of the stops offered by Oz Experience, the tour company facilitating my journey along Queensland's east coast, and as I looked down at the greasy crocodile kebab that was dripping down my hand, I was beginning to wonder if this was one Oz experience too far. </p> <p>'It's not gonna bite ya, mate. It's dead!' </p> <p>Mick knew all about being bitten by crocs. In his 20 years at the farm he had accrued an impressive collection of scars and maulings, yet his enthusiasm for sitting on and taunting the beasts was undimmed. </p> <p>The Johnstone River Crocodile Farm lies a couple of hours south of Cairns and is ideally situated in the middle of croc country, the lush, marshy lands at the foot of the Atherton Tablelands. In this area it is not unknown for crocodiles to walk through the centre of towns like Innisfail during periods of drought, causing all kinds of traffic problems. The farm is home to more than 1,500 crocodiles of varying sizes, some captive-reared and some from the wild, as well as some that are shaped like handbags and boots. It is run as a profit organisation, selling skins and meat throughout Australia, although if the kebab I was holding in my hand was typical of the fare that they offered I would guess that most of their income comes from skins. Tentatively, I raised the yellowish meat to my mouth and took a small bite. </p> <p>'About bloody time too!' Mick commented impatiently as the rest of the group gave me a patronising round of applause. </p> <p>The meat had a strange, jelly-like quality, almost as if I was eating brain, but Mick pointed out that crocodile brain would scarcely be large enough to provide an hors d'oeuvre , and only the tail of the creature is consumed. The look on my face was enough to dissuade anybody else from sampling the delights of reptile cuisine and we moved on into the farm. </p> <p>Upon entrance, each of us had been asked to reveal our nationality to a skinny, slightly malnutritioned-looking assistant called Tai, with selected nationalities receiving a stamp on their hand. I reckoned that from the look of him Tai didn't much care for crocodile meat either and had been forced to subsist on any roots and nuts that he found growing around the farm. Being English, my compatriots (Phil and Sarah) and I were slightly disappointed not to receive a stamp, but once it became clear what they signified it was a blessed relief. </p> <p>Mick strode on ahead of the group, carrying a bucket of mutilated chicken carcasses to feed the crocs. First stop was a pair of freshwater crocodiles which are kept as pets at the farm. Freshwater crocodiles are of little use economically as they grow too slowly, and it is only the gigantic saltwater crocodiles that end up on skewers or Jimmy Nail's feet. The freshwater crocodiles weren't hungry, so after receiving a tongue-lashing from Mick for their unwillingness to co-operate we moved on to meet Gregory, at six metres long the largest specimen at the farm. </p> <p>'Let's see if he's Gregory Peckish' Mick announced, striding into the enclosure as though it contained nothing more than a few fluffy rabbits. </p> <p>Gregory lay snoozing in the corner of his pen, like an exhausted dinosaur, paying absolutely no attention to Mick as he filled us in on his colourful background. </p> <p>Gregory had been brought to the farm after eating an incautious 18-year-old farm-hand when he had been just a sprightly adolescent at three metres long. Apparently he once had a pretty bad temper, but after almost doubling in size at the farm he had mellowed somewhat and now ate people only rarely. Mick walked straight over to Gregory, sat on the huge monster's back, straddling him like a scaly horse, and placed his hat on his head. Crocodiles are quite sensitive to sunburn, and with the sun beginning to emerge from behind the thick grey cloud that had covered most of Queensland since my arrival, Mick informed us that he was worried about Gregory getting sunstroke. </p> <p>This was when the meaning of the stamps was revealed to us all. Those people that had received a stamp belonged to nationalities that had not yet had a recorded fatality to saltwater crocodiles in Australia. The lucky few included a couple of nervous Belgians, three bemused Dutchmen, a gaggle of drunken Irishmen and a solitary German. It was the German, a lanky, long-haired chap called Axel, who was singled out by Mick. </p> <p>'Where's the bloody German?', he shouted from astride the crocodile, moving his head from side to side like an eagle hunting its prey. Axel, somewhat timidly, stepped forward from the group. He didn't know what he was being called forward for, but you could tell that he wished it was one of the Dutchmen in his place. </p> <p>Mick failed to resist the opportunity to mention the war, citing this as an experiment to see whether Gregory had forgiven the Germans for all the Anzacs who lost their lives, and as he placed a blindfold over Axel's eyes we were still in the dark about exactly what the experiment was going to be. With the blindfold in place, Mick began to steer the terrified Axel, now shaking violently, backwards towards Gregory. </p> <p>'Vot is happening? Vhere are you taking me?' Axel inquired, trying to sound calm, but with a distinctly nervous quiver in his voice. 'I'm gonna feed ya to Greg,' Mick replied bluntly, solving the puzzle. </p> <p>Inexplicably, Axel made no attempt to resist, and when he was about 10 yards from Gregory, Tai, who had sneaked into the enclosure unnoticed, leapt out from behind a tree, smacked the victim's backside with a plastic rake and made a roaring noise like a hungry crocodile. Poor Axel nearly jumped out of his skin, while the rest of us fell about in hysterics. </p> <p>'He wouldn't eat ya, anyway. You'd get stuck in his teeth!' Mick shouted after the trembling German, as he raced to rejoin the group to sympathetic applause. </p> <p>Leaving Gregory behind, Mick tossed a chicken towards him and the great beast came momentarily to life as he lurched forward to catch the bird in mid-air with a great crash of his huge jaws, before resuming his semi-conscious, statuesque pose. Sarah's face went white. </p> <p>We were shown around the rearing pens (swimming pools filled with hundreds of miniature crocodiles that looked quite cute but would apparently bite your fingers off), introduced to the breeding enclosure (where females guarded empty nests that they thought contained eggs but had actually been raided by the owners) and finally shown the cassowary display. </p> <p>This cage contained a pair of colourful, ostrich-like birds with blue necks and helmeted heads and the idea was to begin a breeding programme to reintroduce this endangered species to the wild. The breeding programme had been running for three years, with a success rate at the time of writing of zero per cent, but they hadn't given up hope yet. </p> <p>Apparently it is quite hard for cassowaries to concentrate on the job when they are surrounded by killer crocodiles. </p> <p>The tour ended pretty much back where it had begun, under the tin-roofed visitors' centre with its talking, caged cockatoos. Mick hadn't given up trying to plug his crocodile kebabs, despite the limited interest that they had attracted first time around, and even gave Axel a complimentary kebab, only for him promptly to waste the opportunity for revenge on the reptiles by illicitly handing it on to somebody else. For anybody who hadn't had enough of scaly things, there was a chance to handle a deadly brown snake, which was supposedly very good-natured, quite fortunate considering that one bite would inject you with enough neurotoxins to wipe out a small town. </p> <p>Phil, who had turned into quite the herpetologist over the past couple of hours, was photographed proudly with the snake coiled around his neck. I politely declined the offer of a similar picture. 'We'd best take a head count before you leave, just to make sure that you've got the same number that you came in with,' Mick announced with his screeching Aussie drawl, as we prepared to head on towards Cairns. </p> <p>We were one short. Axel was already on the bus.</p> <p><strong>This year's winner </strong></p> <p>Paul Smith secured his first job in journalism last week, the day before he was declared the winner of The Observer Young Travel Writer of the Year award. He is to be a web-journalist on <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com\">www.yougov.com</a>, an internet site that has a youthful focus on news and politics. The 23-year-old Liverpudlian travelled to New Zealand and South America after graduating in Zoology from Liverpool University. He has just completed a masters degree at Southampton in osteo-archaeology.</p> <p>Previous finalists include Toby Green, whose book Travels with Darwin has been shortlisted for the Thomas Cook Award,and Cath Uruquhart, travel editor of the Times . Judges were Observer travel editor Desmond Balmer; travel writer Martin Buckley, author of the acclaimed Grains of Sand, Radio 1 DJ Rajesh Mirchandani, Claire McKay of Air New Zealand and Kirsty Cumming of Austravel.</p> <p><strong>Runners-up tell of bastard melons, huge millipedes and deadly jellyfish </strong></p> <p><strong>Heather Buttivant, 23, a fast-stream graduate working for Customs and Excise in Brussels, travelled from Alice Springs to Adelaide. </strong></p> <p>Salty, the dromedary, and I were the only takers for the afternoon trek. 'Afghan' camels, probably from Pakistan, were imported to help build the Ghan railway. Many were then released and large numbers still roam the desert. Others are farmed for meat, tourism and sport, the Camel Cup race being one of Alice Springs' biggest annual events.</p> <p>I've always been slightly suspicious of camels, but my guide assured me that they were just 'misunderstood'. Sure enough, Salty was surprisingly comfortable and didn't spit once. From his back I could easily see over the stunted bushes to the Todd River, flowing beneath its sandy bed.</p> <p>The area is normally sparsely vegetated and characterised by deep red sandy soil. Following recent rain it had turned a vivid green and was teeming with wildlife. The ground appeared to be strewn with ripe apples. These were 'bastard melons', a ground growing vine fruit, so called because they look great but are poisonous. Brightly coloured parrots, galahs and cockatoos flitted among the eucalyptus trees and big spiders lurked between the bushes. Fortunately I was spared any encounters with the deadly snakes that thrive in the region.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer Coyle, 24, a graduate trainee at Reuters, travelled from Darwin to Alice Springs</strong></p> <p>I enjoyed the company of Territorians; straight-talking survivors with a fierce appreciation of their harsh land. Towns are few and far between in the Territory and apart from the former gold-rush settlement at Pine Creek, the next place of any size south of Darwin is Katherine. Here the local Elvis tribute band were performing in the arcade, alongside two beaming teenage girls selling lip balm, with a special 'Buy one, get three free!' offer.</p> <p>Our acerbic guide Tim was a Territory veteran - a former cattle ranger whose tales of life on the vast stations sounded immensely romantic to my city ears. An authority on bush survival, he lectured the pale European visitors sternly on the correct technique for shaking out our 'swags' - the portable sleeping mattresses that we zipped ourselves into after thoroughly evacuating any wildlife. Much to my horror, I had a near miss when an enormous millipede unexpectedly concealed itself in a corner. However, it was undoubtedly a price worth paying for the privilege of sleeping under the light of the Southern Cross and Milky Way at Katherine Gorge, or Nitmiluk as it is called by the Janwoyn tribe that own the land. Tim was mystified with our city dwellers' delight at discovering a night sky that wasn't orange.</p> <p><strong>Hannah Lewis,29, a freelance radio producer, travelled from Sydney to Brisbane</strong></p> <p>In the morning the rain had stopped. One of the group was keen on 'going to look at the hippies' in the neighbouring commune of Nimbin but I declined the offer to join him and decided to try sea-kayaking instead. After my trip around Sydney aquarium, I was apprehensive. The deadly box jellyfish had been on display, safely behind glass and in formaldehyde but accompanied by gruesome photographs of a victim covered in deep lacerations from its poisonous and lengthy tentacles. It might be the wrong time of year for the jellyfish but I had visions of the sea teeming with 'these stingers'. But at the mention of seeing dolphins, I decided I could live with disfiguring welts if need be.</p> <p>As we were getting into our kayaks, fishermen were standing on the shore with a vast net. Every wave that rolled in was lined with thousands of mullet that all came in one size - large. A lone walker was eating chips, unaware that he was being followed by about 50 seagulls. It was a surreal morning.</p> <p>On the open sea giant sea turtles came up for air alongside us and a group of 20 dolphins and their young were swimming close by. We paddled in to a quiet cove for breakfast and walked to the clifftop for a stunning view of the surrounding bays.</p>",

Phil, who had turned into quite the herpetologist over the past couple of hours, was photographed proudly with the snake coiled around his neck. I politely declined the offer of a similar picture. 'We'd best take a head count before you leave, just to make sure that you've got the same number that you came in with,' Mick announced with his screeching Aussie drawl, as we prepared to head on towards Cairns. We were one short. Axel was already on the bus. This year's winner Paul Smith secured his first job in journalism last week, the day before he was declared the winner of The Observer Young Travel Writer of the Year award. He is to be a web-journalist on www.yougov.com, an internet site that has a youthful focus on news and politics. The 23-year-old Liverpudlian travelled to New Zealand and South America after graduating in Zoology from Liverpool University. He has just completed a masters degree at Southampton in osteo-archaeology. Previous finalists include Toby Green, whose book Travels with Darwin has been shortlisted for the Thomas Cook Award,and Cath Uruquhart, travel editor of the Times . Judges were Observer travel editor Desmond Balmer; travel writer Martin Buckley, author of the acclaimed Grains of Sand, Radio 1 DJ Rajesh Mirchandani, Claire McKay of Air New Zealand and Kirsty Cumming of Austravel. Runners-up tell of bastard melons, huge millipedes and deadly jellyfish Heather Buttivant, 23, a fast-stream graduate working for Customs and Excise in Brussels, travelled from Alice Springs to Adelaide. Salty, the dromedary, and I were the only takers for the afternoon trek. 'Afghan' camels, probably from Pakistan, were imported to help build the Ghan railway. Many were then released and large numbers still roam the desert. Others are farmed for meat, tourism and sport, the Camel Cup race being one of Alice Springs' biggest annual events. I've always been slightly suspicious of camels, but my guide assured me that they were just 'misunderstood'. Sure enough, Salty was surprisingly comfortable and didn't spit once. From his back I could easily see over the stunted bushes to the Todd River, flowing beneath its sandy bed. The area is normally sparsely vegetated and characterised by deep red sandy soil. Following recent rain it had turned a vivid green and was teeming with wildlife. The ground appeared to be strewn with ripe apples. These were 'bastard melons', a ground growing vine fruit, so called because they look great but are poisonous. Brightly coloured parrots, galahs and cockatoos flitted among the eucalyptus trees and big spiders lurked between the bushes. Fortunately I was spared any encounters with the deadly snakes that thrive in the region. Jennifer Coyle, 24, a graduate trainee at Reuters, travelled from Darwin to Alice Springs I enjoyed the company of Territorians; straight-talking survivors with a fierce appreciation of their harsh land. Towns are few and far between in the Territory and apart from the former gold-rush settlement at Pine Creek, the next place of any size south of Darwin is Katherine. Here the local Elvis tribute band were performing in the arcade, alongside two beaming teenage girls selling lip balm, with a special 'Buy one, get three free!' offer. Our acerbic guide Tim was a Territory veteran - a former cattle ranger whose tales of life on the vast stations sounded immensely romantic to my city ears. An authority on bush survival, he lectured the pale European visitors sternly on the correct technique for shaking out our 'swags' - the portable sleeping mattresses that we zipped ourselves into after thoroughly evacuating any wildlife. Much to my horror, I had a near miss when an enormous millipede unexpectedly concealed itself in a corner. However, it was undoubtedly a price worth paying for the privilege of sleeping under the light of the Southern Cross and Milky Way at Katherine Gorge, or Nitmiluk as it is called by the Janwoyn tribe that own the land. Tim was mystified with our city dwellers' delight at discovering a night sky that wasn't orange. Hannah Lewis,29, a freelance radio producer, travelled from Sydney to Brisbane In the morning the rain had stopped. One of the group was keen on 'going to look at the hippies' in the neighbouring commune of Nimbin but I declined the offer to join him and decided to try sea-kayaking instead. After my trip around Sydney aquarium, I was apprehensive. The deadly box jellyfish had been on display, safely behind glass and in formaldehyde but accompanied by gruesome photographs of a victim covered in deep lacerations from its poisonous and lengthy tentacles. It might be the wrong time of year for the jellyfish but I had visions of the sea teeming with 'these stingers'. But at the mention of seeing dolphins, I decided I could live with disfiguring welts if need be. As we were getting into our kayaks, fishermen were standing on the shore with a vast net. Every wave that rolled in was lined with thousands of mullet that all came in one size - large. A lone walker was eating chips, unaware that he was being followed by about 50 seagulls. It was a surreal morning. On the open sea giant sea turtles came up for air alongside us and a group of 20 dolphins and their young were swimming close by. We paddled in to a quiet cove for breakfast and walked to the clifftop for a stunning view of the surrounding bays.",

This long quasi-narrative poem follows the movement of the painter Camille Pissarro from his birthplace in St Thomas through to the firmament of Impressionist Paris, and the poet's own artistic and creative quest. In it we move with the narrator in an exploration of artistic awakening, and processes that parallel and connect with those of the artist. </p> <p>This is a complex work about identity, place and time and the problems of reading history and empire ('He was Art's subject as much as any empire's') through the narrative we construct out of memory. The guilt of leaving, the guilt of betrayal, and of self-justification, burn as background. The political points are there ('We are history's afterthought'), but their presentation lacks vitality. </p> <p>Attempts to segue speech and writing into the field of the canvas as well as the page, to examine the rebus nature of visual thought, become repetitive and overplayed. Walcott doesn't do metatext and self-referential poetry particularly well. We get too much of this: 'the stroke, the syllable, planted in the furrows of page and canvas, in varnished pews...' It goes on and on: 'its apostrophe/poised like a gull' and 'My pen replaced a brush'. </p> <p>There is often interesting palimpsesting of places, and the play on the doubt of the apostle St Thomas, on the artist (and poet's) self-doubt, is in tension with a secular reading of the world. In the poetry itself, there is none of the excitement that the narrator senses on first glimpsing the 'vermilion light in a hound's thigh'. The movement through memory, place, and history, is steady rather than emphatic, but there is a deft awareness of the limitations of art: 'except Time is not/narrative'. </p> <p>Clearly, the versifying is the work of a craftsman - the pentameter rolls across the page, the interconnected couplets rhyming abab to maintain the narrative flow without closing off as traditional heroic couplets might; but there is a lack of vitality that, on occasions, drags the work into the doldrums. The Walcott paintings included with the text are competent, but as dated and drab as the verse technique, and their inclusion bewildering except in terms of the aims of a gift book. </p> <p>It would be nice to see more rage and less quiet. Stillness and poise and grace centre the European eye - a more persistent paranoid vision might better reveal the deep obfuscations and abstractions that inform the great wrongs of colonial history, the evils of false social contracts. Walcott knows this well. </p> <p>And he knows about the fragility of authority and the narrative voice: 'My inexact and blurred biography is like his painting; that is fiction's treason to deny fact, alter topography to its own map...'. Not a masterpiece, but had it been half the length and a little more intense both in form and language, it might well have been. </p> <p>John Burnside has the potential to produce a masterpiece. His language usage is recognisably his own, and his sense of the line is accomplished. His new volume <strong> The Asylum Dance</strong> carries a number of flawed and indifferent poems, but, in the main, is a stunning manual of the lyrical art. While Pissarro guides Walcott, it's Munch that Burnside summons up. </p> <p>This is a book of half-lights, wraiths and ghosts. It's the in-between world of 'presence' and 'absence', concepts that in some ways correlate to Gerard Manley Hopkins's 'inscape' and 'instress', but in the main capture an ambivalence, an edginess between the real and imagined, the at-home and wandering.</p> <p>The apparently straightforward lyric is underpinned by cerebral concerns about the way language works. For all its poise and control, this is a book of guilt and pain. The reader is taken on dark dances along the edge, the place between home and away: 'In school we were taught to admire the homing instinct, animate and sharp behind the eyes ignoring this vast delight, this useless motion.' Certain words occur in poem after poem - 'ghost', 'snow' (as guilt and purity), 'traces', and so on. </p> <p>The book builds like therapy. There is a need for security but a hungering for instability. This transforms most often into the geographic, but centres on relationships: 'and I waited for my father to begin unravelling like twine'. Tensions abound. You can draw schematic diagrams over the pages of this book. Between the Pagan and God, the purgatorial and the preordained, the 'hints and traces' of other possible lives, the lists of objects and plants. Lists anchor identity, give the stability that's craved and rejected. 'Ports', 'The Hay Devil', 'Roads', 'Fields', and the title poem are astonishing works. In these poems, nothing is as simple as believing or not believing. </p> <p>Sharon Olds's <strong> Blood, Tin, Straw</strong> continues the themes she has explored in her previous books. Explorations of the self through sexuality, familial relationships, and the exposition of the private, feed these poems, divided into five sections - the three of the title plus 'Fire' and 'Light'. There are some vintage Olds poems in there, but the language rarely lifts off the page. </p> <p>If Olds's poetry is confessional, it's of the variety that is about 'witness' more than locating the authentic self. There are poems of escape: 'I want to be a baby,/I want to be small and naked...'; of love-hate filial relationships: 'but my sperm king/fished me back, and gave me to my mother/to strip and towel-dry, to burnish'; and sex. The associations between sexual pleasure, need, crisis, death, and birth, are unrelenting. The highlight of the volume comes with Olds's self-ironising (or defensiveness) in 'Take The I Out': ' ...I love the I, frail between its flitches, its hard ground and hard sky, it soars between them like the soul that rushes, back and forth, between the mother and the father'.</p>",

      "byline": "Harriet Lane",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Five years ago, the smart Hollywood money was on Julia Ormond becoming the new Julia Roberts or the new Meg Ryan. Instead, she went off at a different angle and became the new Geena Davis. Like Davis, Ormond enjoyed a spectacular launch in Hollywood, buoyed by gallons of publicity rocket fuel: a dazzling ascent swiftly followed by a tumble back to earth at the end of a blackened stick. </p> <p>There is something rather Hilaire Belloc about Julia Ormond's story, something a little cautionary. Or rather, there would be if she would only play along with it, cast herself as The Fallen Star, or The Girl From Surrey Who Thought She Was Audrey Hepburn. But one role she's simply not interested in is that of victim. 'For sure, you don't believe the good stuff,' says Ormond, referring to the hullaballoo that surrounded her in 1995 when Legends of the Fall , First Knight and Sabrina all opened more or less simultaneously. 'I mean, the good stuff is just insane - wacky. If you don't take it too much to heart, it does help when the negative stuff hits. And you know the negative stuff is coming. It's got to! What comes up must come down.' </p> <p>And it's true: she did know it was coming. At 29, Ormond hadn't submitted rapturously to the star machine. There were sacrifices she didn't want to make. On-set admirers called her 'formidable' and 'flinty' and 'honest'; unnamed sources grumbled about 'attitude'. Looking back at her earliest interviews, conducted amid a swarm of excitable movie execs and publicists, with superagent Michael Ovitz himself on hand to fetch her glasses of water, you note a rich seam of ho-hum scepticism. 'They seem to be very sure things are going to be a success,' Ormond told Vogue in 1995. 'I'm not being negative about it, but I'm hedging my bets.' </p> <p>Certainly, the timing was unfortunate. Legends of the Fall, where she played the love interest, was quickly followed by First Knight, a hilarious turkey in which a trumpet-sleeved Ormond was Guinevere, torn between Sean Connery and Richard Gere. Then came a remake of Sabrina, in which director Sydney Pollack misguidedly steered her into Audrey Hepburn's ballet pumps. Though she knows Sabrina was a mistake, Ormond has no regrets.

But that all gets forgotten. At first I was a bit indignant about it, and then I realised, \"No, that's what people want, so that's what is given.\" But it's not in your control.

      "bodyText": "Five years ago, the smart Hollywood money was on Julia Ormond becoming the new Julia Roberts or the new Meg Ryan. Instead, she went off at a different angle and became the new Geena Davis. Like Davis, Ormond enjoyed a spectacular launch in Hollywood, buoyed by gallons of publicity rocket fuel: a dazzling ascent swiftly followed by a tumble back to earth at the end of a blackened stick. There is something rather Hilaire Belloc about Julia Ormond's story, something a little cautionary. Or rather, there would be if she would only play along with it, cast herself as The Fallen Star, or The Girl From Surrey Who Thought She Was Audrey Hepburn. But one role she's simply not interested in is that of victim. 'For sure, you don't believe the good stuff,' says Ormond, referring to the hullaballoo that surrounded her in 1995 when Legends of the Fall , First Knight and Sabrina all opened more or less simultaneously. 'I mean, the good stuff is just insane - wacky. If you don't take it too much to heart, it does help when the negative stuff hits. And you know the negative stuff is coming. It's got to! What comes up must come down.' And it's true: she did know it was coming. At 29, Ormond hadn't submitted rapturously to the star machine. There were sacrifices she didn't want to make. On-set admirers called her 'formidable' and 'flinty' and 'honest'; unnamed sources grumbled about 'attitude'. Looking back at her earliest interviews, conducted amid a swarm of excitable movie execs and publicists, with superagent Michael Ovitz himself on hand to fetch her glasses of water, you note a rich seam of ho-hum scepticism. 'They seem to be very sure things are going to be a success,' Ormond told Vogue in 1995. 'I'm not being negative about it, but I'm hedging my bets.' Certainly, the timing was unfortunate. Legends of the Fall, where she played the love interest, was quickly followed by First Knight, a hilarious turkey in which a trumpet-sleeved Ormond was Guinevere, torn between Sean Connery and Richard Gere. Then came a remake of Sabrina, in which director Sydney Pollack misguidedly steered her into Audrey Hepburn's ballet pumps. Though she knows Sabrina was a mistake, Ormond has no regrets. 'It was a fantastic learning experience and OK, I got slammed because I wasn't Audrey Hepburn... but you could have predicted that, really, if you'd opened your eyes wide enough. But I was hungry for the learning experience and didn't feel secure enough to say no. You need to be bloody secure to say no.' She knew she was lucky, but she also knew she was out of her depth - not with the acting, but with the stuff that surrounded it. 'The odd thing for me is the focus on looks which happened in the States. I'd always felt that was not going to be a strong point. That made me feel very disturbed, because it never seemed to be about how much hard work was involved. Ever. It was about... \"hazel eyes\". It does help if you can brush that stuff off.'

      "body": "<p>Eliza Carthy, catalytic converter of English folk music, has been leading a double life. For the past three years, the fiddle player and singer has been writing a pop album on the quiet. Carthy, just turned 25, was signed to Warner Bros as a singer-songwriter in 1997 by the A&amp;R man who signed Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison. Since when she's got on with 'being a folkie', in pubs, in Peru, at Glastonbury and Meltdown, as Joan Baez's 'co-mentor' (Joan's word) and on tour with her famous folk parents, Norma Waterson and Martin Carthy. Only now their Liza shares the same PR woman as Madonna. </p> <p>'It's been a secret, my little thing,' she says, brushing crumbs off the table after late Sunday breakfast. Today Liza's hair, usually blue, is green. On the windowsill, Buffy the goldfish is circling to the sound of US popster Pink. The neon purveyor of old English love songs lives in Scotland, in a converted stable south of Edinburgh, nothing but sheep for miles, Scottish boyfriend playing English pipes outside the front door. </p> <p>Angels and Cigarettes , like Carthy on stage, is seductively raw.

      "bodyText": "Eliza Carthy, catalytic converter of English folk music, has been leading a double life. For the past three years, the fiddle player and singer has been writing a pop album on the quiet. Carthy, just turned 25, was signed to Warner Bros as a singer-songwriter in 1997 by the A&amp;R man who signed Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison. Since when she's got on with 'being a folkie', in pubs, in Peru, at Glastonbury and Meltdown, as Joan Baez's 'co-mentor' (Joan's word) and on tour with her famous folk parents, Norma Waterson and Martin Carthy. Only now their Liza shares the same PR woman as Madonna. 'It's been a secret, my little thing,' she says, brushing crumbs off the table after late Sunday breakfast. Today Liza's hair, usually blue, is green. On the windowsill, Buffy the goldfish is circling to the sound of US popster Pink. The neon purveyor of old English love songs lives in Scotland, in a converted stable south of Edinburgh, nothing but sheep for miles, Scottish boyfriend playing English pipes outside the front door. Angels and Cigarettes , like Carthy on stage, is seductively raw.

      "byline": "Nigel Slater",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Early morning, open window, church bells, birdsong, Sunday papers, mushrooms on toast. Utter bliss. At least, I see it that way. Others may notice that last night's wine bottles and empty glasses are still on the table, the open window looks out on to someone else's bathroom and the peal of church bells is drowned out every time a bus passes. The birds are not nightingales, but city pigeons stuffing their faces with my elderberries, and who will relieve themselves in magnificent purple splatters down my freshly cleaned windows. Still, the mushrooms on toast are genuine enough. </p> <p>When I am asked (for the 200th time) to name my favourite food, I invariably mutter, 'Mashed potato.' In truth, that is more a comfort thing and has more to do with my state of mind than my tastebuds. What I should really say is, 'Mushrooms on toast.' But they need to be quite perfect; that is, cooked thoughtfully, tenderly and with almost obsessive attention to detail. </p> <p>The toast must be cut thick and from a good, old-fashioned white loaf. It should be crisp, even faintly burned around the edges, forming a soggy hollow towards the middle, on which will be perched one, two or three flat mushrooms as soft as velvet and as black as your hat. There must be butter and plenty of it. This is not bruschetta - olive oil and garlic have no place here. This is the best of the something-on-toasts. Crunchy, soggy, buttery, velvety and woodsy - that's a mouthful of mushrooms on toast. </p> <p>Remember the way Richard Bohringer buttered his baguette in Diva ? Well, I can, of a late-summer Sunday morning, get as fixated by making my mushrooms on toast. No fancy fungi, thank you. With due respect, you can keep your pleurottes, girolles, porcini and trompettes de la mort. Field mushrooms are what we want at this point, and as I am being a touch perfectionist about the whole thing, I think they should be the sort whose gills open flat rather than the ones that sit cup-shaped. Of course this is perfection we are talking about. But why not? There is more pleasure to be had in getting something right. </p> <p>The bread-and-mushroom idea is a pleasing enough way to start the day, but it can just as easily lapse into lunch, though by then it might well be using some of those posh toadstools I cannot face at breakfast. We could also involve a crushed clove of garlic or two, some olive oil and even a scattering of oregano or basil. Some tender salad can sit at the side, too, so that their fragile leaves virtually melt into the warm mushroom juices. I recommend that you try a mushroom bap. Bake the largest fungi you can lay your hands on with garlic butter and sandwich them between a floury bun. I use a bit more butter than I would normally here so that it moistens the soft, doughy bread. </p> <p>Baked mushrooms take on a warm, savoury depth if you include mustard and a palmful of tarragon or oregano leaves. Add to that a squeeze of lemon and we are approaching a supper of almost beefsteak toothsomeness. My father used to upend the Mushroom Ketchup bottle over his, which sounds like coals to Newcastle, yet he swore by its salty-sharp seasoning. I am sure he was right. Even now, I won't argue with him. </p> <p>Depending on how they are to be eaten, you can grill, fry or bake mushrooms with equal success. The trick is simply to keep them moist. This need not be with butter, although it is tempting. I have baked a terracotta dish of them with a spoonful of balsamic vinegar and a little water before now and not a knob of butter in sight, and they stayed silky, the vinegar for once having good reason to be there. </p> <p>Cream is an obvious choice when baking fungi, though one I turn to less often than I did. Such luxury - especially if you fry some finely chopped shallot first, taking care it doesn't colour, then introduce some white wine or, better still, Madeira. You can pour seasoned cream (salt, pepper, and don't forget the nutmeg) over some lightly fried chestnut mushrooms, then bake them in a moderate oven till bubbling. It takes about half an hour from start to sumptuous finish. But I am sounding a lush. </p> <p>If mushrooms alone are not enough, you might like to mix them with another ingredient. At this time of year, I suggest mussels. It is a fine, though slightly unexpected marriage and full of salty, earthy depth. Briefly, you could do worse than to steam the mussels and pick them from their shells, then tip them into a shallow pan of saut\u00e9ed button mushrooms, garlic and just a little cream. Thick toast to mop up the juice would be good. </p> <p>Other mycological marriages with bread include the large capped variety, now christened portabella or portabello in some shops, stuffed with crabmeat or minced prawns, seasoned with finely chopped fried onion, a little pepper and ground mace, then coated with a thin layer of fine, fresh breadcrumbs. I hadn't believed the crabmeat and mushroom match till I tried it, despite it being a favourite of the late Mrs Grigson. Which reminds me of that forgotten autumnal starter of deep-fried mushrooms in crisp breadcrumbs, the sort you used to dip into garlic mayonnaise before we discovered the far more flattering salsa verde. </p> <p>Oh, and did I mention that the mushrooms should have been in a bag in the fridge for a day or so, so that they become a bit damp and woodsy, and smell like an autumn forest underfoot? </p> <p> <strong> Baked mushrooms with tarragon mustard butter</strong> </p> <p> Serves 2 </p> <p><strong>4 large field mushrooms </strong> </p> <p> for the tarragon mustard butter</p> <p><strong>125g butter <br> 2 level tbsp smooth Dijon mustard <br> the leaves pulled from 8 or 9 stems of tarragon <br> the juice of half a lemon <br> olive oil </strong></p> <p>Cut the butter into cubes and mash it in a small bowl with a wooden spoon. You could use a food processor but I am not sure you really need to. Add the mustard, the roughly chopped tarragon leaves, and a few grinds of salt and pepper, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Mix to a thick paste. </p> <p>Lay the mushrooms in a roasting tin; they can be snug but only barely overlapping. Trim the stalks if they are woody, or even remove them entirely, then fill their hollows with the butter, dividing it up more or less equally, then drizzle with olive oil. </p> <p>Cover the tin with foil or baking parchment, then bake at 200 C/gas mark 6, basting the mushrooms from time to time with the melted butter and pan juices. When they are tender and sodden with juice - a matter of 25-30 minutes or so - serve with rice, toast or sandwiched between two soft baps. Take care not to waste any of the hot herb butter. </p> <p> <strong> Potatoes, baked mushrooms, cream and Parmesan</strong> </p> <p> Serves 3 as a principal dish, 6 as a side dish. </p> <p><strong>a plump, juicy clove of garlic, peeled and cut in half <br> 30g butter <br> 600g waxy yellow-fleshed potatoes <br> 150g white mushrooms <br> 600ml whipping cream <br> Parmesan for grating <br> a handful of fresh, white breadcrumbs </strong></p> <p>Take a shallow, earthenware dish, a good 30cm across, and rub it hard with the garlic (this discreetly seasons the dish). Rub the lump of butter around, leaving about half of it smeared on the dish. </p> <p>Peel and slice the potatoes - they should be a little thicker than a pound coin. Make a layer of overlapping slices in the bottom of the dish with half of the potatoes, then season with salt and pepper. Slice the mushrooms likewise, and lay them over the potatoes. Dust with salt and pepper, then place the rest of potatoes on top, covering up the mushrooms as best you can. Grind again with salt and pepper. </p> <p>Mix the cream with a faint dusting of nutmeg, if you have it, then pour it over the potatoes. It won't quite cover. Grate over a fine layer of cheese, then scatter with the breadcrumbs. Dot the rest of the butter on top and bake for 60 minutes at 150 C/gas mark 4, nudging the heat up to 180 C/gas mark 5 for a further 30 minutes. The potatoes and mushrooms should be soft enough to take the point of a knife, the crust golden and the cream bubbling. </p> <p> <strong> A green mushroom salad</strong> </p> <p> Enough for 2 as a side dish. </p> <p><strong>200g small mushrooms <br> the juice of a lemon <br> a small handful of basil leaves <br> a small handful of watercress leaves <br> 1 tbsp young tarragon leaves, or Thai (aniseed) basil <br> 6 tbsp olive oil </strong></p> <p>Cut the mushrooms in half, no matter how small, and put in a bowl. Squeeze in the lemon and set aside for at least 30 minutes (they will produce a lot of juice). Put the basil, watercress, tarragon, olive oil and a little salt into a blender. Drain the juice from the mushrooms and add that, then whiz to a thick green slush. Toss the mushrooms in the green sauce and serve. Jolly good with cold roast beef.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Early morning, open window, church bells, birdsong, Sunday papers, mushrooms on toast. Utter bliss. At least, I see it that way. Others may notice that last night's wine bottles and empty glasses are still on the table, the open window looks out on to someone else's bathroom and the peal of church bells is drowned out every time a bus passes. The birds are not nightingales, but city pigeons stuffing their faces with my elderberries, and who will relieve themselves in magnificent purple splatters down my freshly cleaned windows. Still, the mushrooms on toast are genuine enough. When I am asked (for the 200th time) to name my favourite food, I invariably mutter, 'Mashed potato.' In truth, that is more a comfort thing and has more to do with my state of mind than my tastebuds. What I should really say is, 'Mushrooms on toast.' But they need to be quite perfect; that is, cooked thoughtfully, tenderly and with almost obsessive attention to detail. The toast must be cut thick and from a good, old-fashioned white loaf. It should be crisp, even faintly burned around the edges, forming a soggy hollow towards the middle, on which will be perched one, two or three flat mushrooms as soft as velvet and as black as your hat. There must be butter and plenty of it. This is not bruschetta - olive oil and garlic have no place here. This is the best of the something-on-toasts. Crunchy, soggy, buttery, velvety and woodsy - that's a mouthful of mushrooms on toast. Remember the way Richard Bohringer buttered his baguette in Diva ? Well, I can, of a late-summer Sunday morning, get as fixated by making my mushrooms on toast. No fancy fungi, thank you. With due respect, you can keep your pleurottes, girolles, porcini and trompettes de la mort. Field mushrooms are what we want at this point, and as I am being a touch perfectionist about the whole thing, I think they should be the sort whose gills open flat rather than the ones that sit cup-shaped. Of course this is perfection we are talking about. But why not? There is more pleasure to be had in getting something right. The bread-and-mushroom idea is a pleasing enough way to start the day, but it can just as easily lapse into lunch, though by then it might well be using some of those posh toadstools I cannot face at breakfast. We could also involve a crushed clove of garlic or two, some olive oil and even a scattering of oregano or basil. Some tender salad can sit at the side, too, so that their fragile leaves virtually melt into the warm mushroom juices. I recommend that you try a mushroom bap. Bake the largest fungi you can lay your hands on with garlic butter and sandwich them between a floury bun. I use a bit more butter than I would normally here so that it moistens the soft, doughy bread. Baked mushrooms take on a warm, savoury depth if you include mustard and a palmful of tarragon or oregano leaves. Add to that a squeeze of lemon and we are approaching a supper of almost beefsteak toothsomeness. My father used to upend the Mushroom Ketchup bottle over his, which sounds like coals to Newcastle, yet he swore by its salty-sharp seasoning. I am sure he was right. Even now, I won't argue with him. Depending on how they are to be eaten, you can grill, fry or bake mushrooms with equal success. The trick is simply to keep them moist. This need not be with butter, although it is tempting. I have baked a terracotta dish of them with a spoonful of balsamic vinegar and a little water before now and not a knob of butter in sight, and they stayed silky, the vinegar for once having good reason to be there. Cream is an obvious choice when baking fungi, though one I turn to less often than I did. Such luxury - especially if you fry some finely chopped shallot first, taking care it doesn't colour, then introduce some white wine or, better still, Madeira. You can pour seasoned cream (salt, pepper, and don't forget the nutmeg) over some lightly fried chestnut mushrooms, then bake them in a moderate oven till bubbling. It takes about half an hour from start to sumptuous finish. But I am sounding a lush. If mushrooms alone are not enough, you might like to mix them with another ingredient. At this time of year, I suggest mussels. It is a fine, though slightly unexpected marriage and full of salty, earthy depth. Briefly, you could do worse than to steam the mussels and pick them from their shells, then tip them into a shallow pan of saut\u00e9ed button mushrooms, garlic and just a little cream. Thick toast to mop up the juice would be good. Other mycological marriages with bread include the large capped variety, now christened portabella or portabello in some shops, stuffed with crabmeat or minced prawns, seasoned with finely chopped fried onion, a little pepper and ground mace, then coated with a thin layer of fine, fresh breadcrumbs. I hadn't believed the crabmeat and mushroom match till I tried it, despite it being a favourite of the late Mrs Grigson. Which reminds me of that forgotten autumnal starter of deep-fried mushrooms in crisp breadcrumbs, the sort you used to dip into garlic mayonnaise before we discovered the far more flattering salsa verde. Oh, and did I mention that the mushrooms should have been in a bag in the fridge for a day or so, so that they become a bit damp and woodsy, and smell like an autumn forest underfoot? Baked mushrooms with tarragon mustard butter Serves 2 4 large field mushrooms for the tarragon mustard butter 125g butter 2 level tbsp smooth Dijon mustard the leaves pulled from 8 or 9 stems of tarragon the juice of half a lemon olive oil Cut the butter into cubes and mash it in a small bowl with a wooden spoon. You could use a food processor but I am not sure you really need to. Add the mustard, the roughly chopped tarragon leaves, and a few grinds of salt and pepper, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Mix to a thick paste. Lay the mushrooms in a roasting tin; they can be snug but only barely overlapping. Trim the stalks if they are woody, or even remove them entirely, then fill their hollows with the butter, dividing it up more or less equally, then drizzle with olive oil. Cover the tin with foil or baking parchment, then bake at 200 C/gas mark 6, basting the mushrooms from time to time with the melted butter and pan juices. When they are tender and sodden with juice - a matter of 25-30 minutes or so - serve with rice, toast or sandwiched between two soft baps. Take care not to waste any of the hot herb butter. Potatoes, baked mushrooms, cream and Parmesan Serves 3 as a principal dish, 6 as a side dish. a plump, juicy clove of garlic, peeled and cut in half 30g butter 600g waxy yellow-fleshed potatoes 150g white mushrooms 600ml whipping cream Parmesan for grating a handful of fresh, white breadcrumbs Take a shallow, earthenware dish, a good 30cm across, and rub it hard with the garlic (this discreetly seasons the dish). Rub the lump of butter around, leaving about half of it smeared on the dish. Peel and slice the potatoes - they should be a little thicker than a pound coin. Make a layer of overlapping slices in the bottom of the dish with half of the potatoes, then season with salt and pepper. Slice the mushrooms likewise, and lay them over the potatoes. Dust with salt and pepper, then place the rest of potatoes on top, covering up the mushrooms as best you can. Grind again with salt and pepper. Mix the cream with a faint dusting of nutmeg, if you have it, then pour it over the potatoes. It won't quite cover. Grate over a fine layer of cheese, then scatter with the breadcrumbs. Dot the rest of the butter on top and bake for 60 minutes at 150 C/gas mark 4, nudging the heat up to 180 C/gas mark 5 for a further 30 minutes. The potatoes and mushrooms should be soft enough to take the point of a knife, the crust golden and the cream bubbling. A green mushroom salad Enough for 2 as a side dish. 200g small mushrooms the juice of a lemon a small handful of basil leaves a small handful of watercress leaves 1 tbsp young tarragon leaves, or Thai (aniseed) basil 6 tbsp olive oil Cut the mushrooms in half, no matter how small, and put in a bowl. Squeeze in the lemon and set aside for at least 30 minutes (they will produce a lot of juice). Put the basil, watercress, tarragon, olive oil and a little salt into a blender. Drain the juice from the mushrooms and add that, then whiz to a thick green slush. Toss the mushrooms in the green sauce and serve. Jolly good with cold roast beef.",

The 10 days were the family summer holiday and Moonfleet Manor, a glorious place designed specifically for people with young kids (full-on baby listening in every room, hot and cold running milk, a sandpit the size of Shropshire), was where it was taken; I didn't have an enormous amount of choice in the matter. That aside, it was still a useful exercise. Every restaurant has its purpose and how well it succeeds will depend on how well it understands what that purpose is. </p> <p>There is little doubt, from a quick glance at the menu at Moonfleet's restaurant - a drizzle of balsamic here, a herb crust there - that it is keen to drag in a non-resident crowd looking for that special night out. At the same time it must serve old lags like me in for a longer stretch. Most restaurants deserve to be reviewed on the basis of one visit because that is how most of us experience them; Moonfleet deserves to be tried five times because that is how a lot of its punters will experience it. </p> <p>And, after a marathon day entertaining the kids, it can be a sublime experience. The long, white-washed dining room at Moonfleet overlooks the Fleet Lagoon, a stretch of water a dozen miles long which was cut off from the sea aeons ago by a massive drift of shingle called Chesil Beach.

There's a lot of fish on the menu. A starter of crisp crabcake on an orange saffron butter sauce, for example, could have stood as an advertisement for the quality of the seafood available in this part of the country. If there was anything other than sweet, fibrous crab in the cake it was hiding out of embarrassment. Main courses of roast cod, grilled talapia (a new one on me; it's a bit like bream) and scallops also made a serious virtue of local produce.

There is a fine list of rich puddings of the mandarin cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e and chocolate mousse variety and an equally well thought out wine list, almost entirely taken from the New World. </p> <p>It reads, I'm sure, like ambitious stuff and it is, sometimes overly so. Occasionally there was the feeling the kitchen was trying just a little too hard. Tony Smith appears, for example, to have a thing about wilting rocket. There is no point wilting rocket.

      "body": "<p>In Cambridge, I've graduated from estate agents to solicitors and financial advisers. My flat, on the other hand, has not been sold. It's summer, I'm told. No one's buying, they're all away. Apparently it isn't summer in Cambridge, because I'm not away and I've bought. So a vast loan has been arranged and my cuddly little Cambridge terraced house is being conveyed to me. The only real fear I have in my life is of dispossession. Now I will have two houses from which I could be dispossessed.</p> <p>I understand what Kierkegaard was on about at last. The leap of faith is not towards God, but love (for want of a better term) and housing. One leap of faith begets another, it seems. First, I throw myself on the mercy of love and risk betrayal, then on the mercy of the property market and risk penury. Never mind, I can be a mad, old, bag-lady instead of the mad, old hermit I had planned to be.</p> <p>To distract myself, I build castles in Cambridge. Much of the talk between the poet and myself is about how to arrange our elderly idyll on opposite sides of the road. Will we have keys to each other's houses? Of course. But must we phone or knock before we enter? No, no, it is as if we live in one house, but separated by a road which is nothing more than a corridor between us.</p> <p>I'm not sure about this: surely some system can be devised to indicate that we are working, sleeping, watching something moronic on the TV or sulking. Traffic lights on our front doors, perhaps, red and green, and amber for 'you decide'. A particular arrangement of the upstairs blinds. What about coded electric bells or a pair of whistles whose pitch only the poet and I can hear?</p> <p>All this is a worry. If my house is his house, and his house is my house, where is the private space we both agreed was essential for mature love to mature further? It begins to look as if one big house with an east and west wing might be more suitable. Sadly, for a poetry-making don and a novel-writing granddaughter of immigrants, the aristocratic way is not an option.</p> <p>I am inclined towards a covered walkway across the roofs, a kind of bridge of sighs, but the poet favours a tunnel, a netherworld connecting us like the linking of two unconsciousnesses. There you have the him and me of it. If planning permission is a problem we would both settle for a system of pneumatic tubes like they used to have in department stores in the old days. At a pinch, email would do.</p> <p>Or there is the phone. Or we could send invitations through the post.</p> <p>Still, this one house divided into two concepts has something to be said for it. It occurs to me that since the poet is a passionate cook and I am passionately not, I don't need a kitchen in my house at all. It could be entirely devoted to my pleasures and needs: a study, a reading room, a luxury bathroom, a dedicated bedroom (maybe two: one for private sleeping, one for sex).</p> <p>But how will he let me know when supper is ready? He could bring it over. Do I want a lover or a waiter?</p> <p>'Has it crossed your mind,' I say, 'that whenever we talk about this living almost together thing in Cambridge, we always imagine that you are in your house and I am in mine?'</p> <p>He is unfazed, explaining that being apart is our difficulty, not being together.</p> <p>Pshaw, I hiss, or something spelt very like that. I tell him once again that he is in the grip of middle-aged delusion, in love with being in love. And what about when he comes to his senses, and there we are staring angrily at each other from opposite windows?</p> <p>'But what if I'm not deluded?' he says calmly.This is very aggravating, because I know he is and all he has to do is agree with me. In any case, as he knows perfectly well, 'what if he's not deluded' is quite as alarming as what if he is.</p> <p>It's all very well countering my what if with his what if, but the fact that there's no certainty to be had this or that side of death, doesn't mean I don't want it. Cambridge has become the land of what if, and I, for reasons that I can't or won't quite put my finger on, am emigrating to it.</p> <p>'What if,' I mutter, 'after I've moved across the road from you, one of us gets creamed by a lorry as we're crossing it?'</p> <p>We're both quite overcome by the tragic irony I've just retrospected. We discuss who will play us when Stephen Frears makes the movie (the romantic drama having been transferred to New York and Harvard, naturally). I refuse to have Meryl Streep or Meg Ryan, but I know it's hopeless. The poet doesn't mind being played by Nick Nolte at all. (He would also like it to be known that he's beginning to develop great sympathy with Mrs Phil Hogan.)</p> <p>But talking of crossing the road. Do we have to get dressed when we go back to our own house? Will a dressing gown do? Or a towel? Can we skitter across in the buff? It puts Neighbourhood Watch in quite a different light. I think we'd probably better call a street meeting to thrash out the problem.</p>",

It occurs to me that since the poet is a passionate cook and I am passionately not, I don't need a kitchen in my house at all. It could be entirely devoted to my pleasures and needs: a study, a reading room, a luxury bathroom, a dedicated bedroom (maybe two: one for private sleeping, one for sex). But how will he let me know when supper is ready? He could bring it over. Do I want a lover or a waiter? 'Has it crossed your mind,' I say, 'that whenever we talk about this living almost together thing in Cambridge, we always imagine that you are in your house and I am in mine?' He is unfazed, explaining that being apart is our difficulty, not being together. Pshaw, I hiss, or something spelt very like that. I tell him once again that he is in the grip of middle-aged delusion, in love with being in love. And what about when he comes to his senses, and there we are staring angrily at each other from opposite windows? 'But what if I'm not deluded?' he says calmly.This is very aggravating, because I know he is and all he has to do is agree with me. In any case, as he knows perfectly well, 'what if he's not deluded' is quite as alarming as what if he is. It's all very well countering my what if with his what if, but the fact that there's no certainty to be had this or that side of death, doesn't mean I don't want it. Cambridge has become the land of what if, and I, for reasons that I can't or won't quite put my finger on, am emigrating to it. 'What if,' I mutter, 'after I've moved across the road from you, one of us gets creamed by a lorry as we're crossing it?' We're both quite overcome by the tragic irony I've just retrospected. We discuss who will play us when Stephen Frears makes the movie (the romantic drama having been transferred to New York and Harvard, naturally). I refuse to have Meryl Streep or Meg Ryan, but I know it's hopeless. The poet doesn't mind being played by Nick Nolte at all. (He would also like it to be known that he's beginning to develop great sympathy with Mrs Phil Hogan.) But talking of crossing the road. Do we have to get dressed when we go back to our own house? Will a dressing gown do? Or a towel? Can we skitter across in the buff? It puts Neighbourhood Watch in quite a different light. I think we'd probably better call a street meeting to thrash out the problem.",

He became a local branch secretary in Wigan, before taking an area job in Preston and moving to take responsibility for Merseyside and the North West in the Eighties.

      "body": "<p>Few things give the slobbish, unmotivated majority more satisfaction than hearing that people who've made strenuous efforts to be healthy may have been completely wasting their time. So one could be forgiven for a touch of schadenfreude at the news that organic food might not be all it's cracked up to be. </p> <p>According to Sir John Krebs, head of the Food Standards Agency, the bulk of organic produce isn't any safer or more nutritious than regular fare, mainly as 70 per cent is imported into Britain from countries where standards aren't so high. Supporters of organic farming have denounced this report, accusing Sir John of being out of touch with consumers and in thrall to the biotechnology industry. </p> <p>Just because they're probably right, we shouldn't let it spoil the moment. It seems to me that ordinary Britons have been terrorised and demoralised too long by the healthy elite, who swan around, eating well, exercising, drinking lots of water, looking great, and generally being much better than us. Sometimes it seems as if Alpha Beings in unstructured layers are taking over the world, and we haven't got the time or the energy to stop them. </p> <p>You're no one without a health regime these days. Just to complicate matters, modern keep fit seems to work on the microwave principle - from the inside out. This gives people the opportunity to say earnestly: 'It's not about vanity, it's about health, how I feel inside.' </p> <p>To be fair, very few of them actually go around spouting pompous guff like that. They'd love to, but they haven't got the time. They're too busy 'stretching' down at the gym and having sacks of organic produce delivered to their door by environmentally friendly White Van Men. Or taking you into their kitchens to watch their juicers in action. As it turns out, these machines are so inefficient, it's astonishing - they process about one carrot an hour, throb and roar like a tube train is running through the kitchen, then finally splurt out a thimbleful of obnoxious slime. It's the culinary equivalent to journalism, but in this case it's not only media-studies students who want in. </p> <p>To a certain extent, you feel like leaving them to it. On the other hand, why should we be left out like the fat kid in PE? We want some of that 'health and wellbeing' stuff, give it to us now! Sadly, it's not as simple as that. That's why Linda McCartney was such a boon to lazy vegetarians like myself - not only did she tell you about good food, she arranged for it to be cooked and transported to your local supermarket. It would have been even better if Linda had popped around personally to stick it in the oven for you, but she was a busy woman, with a large family, so we'll let it pass. Elsewhere, healthy living just seems such a drag - hunting down decent organic ranges, heaving Evian out of the fridge, trudging to yoga classes, knowing the difference between zinc and selenium. It never seems to end. In an age when most of us are already stressed to the max at work, being healthy is like signing up for an extra unpaid job. Voluntary work for the me-me-me generation. Which doubtless explains why only Alpha Beings can cope. </p> <p>So it is, so it has always been. Everybody is entitled to put their own time, money and effort into achieving a healthier lifestyle and diet, if they want to. The problem is, there's probably an awful lot of people out there who'd love to get fitter, but they don't stand a chance. The really scary thing about modern 'good health' is how socially divisive, how class-based, it has become. People say it doesn't cost anything to be healthy, but you only have to look at the price of gyms, vitamin pills and organic produce to realise that's codswallop. In truth, when you're time-poor, money-poor, energy-poor and every other kind of poor, being healthy is hellishly difficult to pull off. One could even argue that good health is on the verge of becoming politically incorrect, because only the relatively better off have the resources to indulge themselves. </p> <p>Bearing this in mind, instead of concentrating on who does buy organic produce, maybe we should start worrying about who doesn't, or, more specifically, who couldn't afford to. It would be interesting to find out how many stops at council estates Organic White Van Man makes on his rounds. Very few, if any, I'm sure.

      "bodyText": "Few things give the slobbish, unmotivated majority more satisfaction than hearing that people who've made strenuous efforts to be healthy may have been completely wasting their time. So one could be forgiven for a touch of schadenfreude at the news that organic food might not be all it's cracked up to be. According to Sir John Krebs, head of the Food Standards Agency, the bulk of organic produce isn't any safer or more nutritious than regular fare, mainly as 70 per cent is imported into Britain from countries where standards aren't so high. Supporters of organic farming have denounced this report, accusing Sir John of being out of touch with consumers and in thrall to the biotechnology industry. Just because they're probably right, we shouldn't let it spoil the moment. It seems to me that ordinary Britons have been terrorised and demoralised too long by the healthy elite, who swan around, eating well, exercising, drinking lots of water, looking great, and generally being much better than us. Sometimes it seems as if Alpha Beings in unstructured layers are taking over the world, and we haven't got the time or the energy to stop them. You're no one without a health regime these days. Just to complicate matters, modern keep fit seems to work on the microwave principle - from the inside out. This gives people the opportunity to say earnestly: 'It's not about vanity, it's about health, how I feel inside.' To be fair, very few of them actually go around spouting pompous guff like that. They'd love to, but they haven't got the time. They're too busy 'stretching' down at the gym and having sacks of organic produce delivered to their door by environmentally friendly White Van Men. Or taking you into their kitchens to watch their juicers in action. As it turns out, these machines are so inefficient, it's astonishing - they process about one carrot an hour, throb and roar like a tube train is running through the kitchen, then finally splurt out a thimbleful of obnoxious slime. It's the culinary equivalent to journalism, but in this case it's not only media-studies students who want in. To a certain extent, you feel like leaving them to it. On the other hand, why should we be left out like the fat kid in PE? We want some of that 'health and wellbeing' stuff, give it to us now! Sadly, it's not as simple as that. That's why Linda McCartney was such a boon to lazy vegetarians like myself - not only did she tell you about good food, she arranged for it to be cooked and transported to your local supermarket. It would have been even better if Linda had popped around personally to stick it in the oven for you, but she was a busy woman, with a large family, so we'll let it pass. Elsewhere, healthy living just seems such a drag - hunting down decent organic ranges, heaving Evian out of the fridge, trudging to yoga classes, knowing the difference between zinc and selenium. It never seems to end. In an age when most of us are already stressed to the max at work, being healthy is like signing up for an extra unpaid job. Voluntary work for the me-me-me generation. Which doubtless explains why only Alpha Beings can cope. So it is, so it has always been. Everybody is entitled to put their own time, money and effort into achieving a healthier lifestyle and diet, if they want to. The problem is, there's probably an awful lot of people out there who'd love to get fitter, but they don't stand a chance. The really scary thing about modern 'good health' is how socially divisive, how class-based, it has become. People say it doesn't cost anything to be healthy, but you only have to look at the price of gyms, vitamin pills and organic produce to realise that's codswallop. In truth, when you're time-poor, money-poor, energy-poor and every other kind of poor, being healthy is hellishly difficult to pull off. One could even argue that good health is on the verge of becoming politically incorrect, because only the relatively better off have the resources to indulge themselves. Bearing this in mind, instead of concentrating on who does buy organic produce, maybe we should start worrying about who doesn't, or, more specifically, who couldn't afford to. It would be interesting to find out how many stops at council estates Organic White Van Man makes on his rounds. Very few, if any, I'm sure. However, this doesn't mean that poorer citizens are choosing cheap, genetically modified varieties for the fun and thrill of ingesting dodgy pesticides and chemicals. While a lot of us are just too plain lazy to get it together, for many others, 'achieving a healthier lifestyle' could be quite literally beyond their means.
