Set up by 808 State's own techno pioneer, Graham Massey, the club night (which rotates around Mancunian venues) provides a platform for local and visiting musicians. Massey's own Toolshed Allstars are the house band. In the current climate of Stereophonics and Steps, seeing them feels like walking out of the Conservative Party conference into a strange, post-nuclear soundworld full of little green men with fabulous, unearthly tunes. </p> <p>The Allstars certainly look different. There are 12 of them, including three drummers, a five-piece brass section and a Yoko Ono/ Shirley Bassey-ish singer, See Ming. Instruments range from Massey's heap of keyboards to a whirring ball on string. The band frequently don hard hats, presumably to protect themselves from the fireworks in their music. </p> <p>Their entrance is stunning. Following the introductory chords of Michael Jackson's Ben, See Ming strides on and suddenly shrieks \"Ben!\" as the band explode into a futuristic punk rock freakout. Following this jape, the Allstars manage to be a blistering fusion of, say, Frank Zappa's Hot Rats, John Zorn and the Plastic Ono Band, and they just get better. </p> <p>The voodoo soundtrack created by the drummers is terrifying but exhilarating. This percussion force is crucial, blasting the band off from dance music. The other key component is the brass section, whose enormous stabs of melody ensure that no matter how weird the Allstars get - and they certainly get weird - they are always orbiting around a killer tune. Everyone from avant jazzheads to techno kids should love them. </p> <p>Once everybody has recovered, the core of the Allstars (with a few extra violinists and cellists) return as Homelife. The music is totally different. Oriental folk nestles against vaguely Massive Attack dub-songs, and although they lack the Allstars' tumult, the sound is almost as unusual. As for the tag \"Toolshed\", nobody plays a lathe or a coping saw, but if they can find one that can be tuned, I wouldn't put it past them.</p>",

The Allstars certainly look different. There are 12 of them, including three drummers, a five-piece brass section and a Yoko Ono/ Shirley Bassey-ish singer, See Ming. Instruments range from Massey's heap of keyboards to a whirring ball on string. The band frequently don hard hats, presumably to protect themselves from the fireworks in their music. Their entrance is stunning. Following the introductory chords of Michael Jackson's Ben, See Ming strides on and suddenly shrieks \"Ben!\" as the band explode into a futuristic punk rock freakout. Following this jape, the Allstars manage to be a blistering fusion of, say, Frank Zappa's Hot Rats, John Zorn and the Plastic Ono Band, and they just get better. The voodoo soundtrack created by the drummers is terrifying but exhilarating. This percussion force is crucial, blasting the band off from dance music. The other key component is the brass section, whose enormous stabs of melody ensure that no matter how weird the Allstars get - and they certainly get weird - they are always orbiting around a killer tune. Everyone from avant jazzheads to techno kids should love them. Once everybody has recovered, the core of the Allstars (with a few extra violinists and cellists) return as Homelife. The music is totally different. Oriental folk nestles against vaguely Massive Attack dub-songs, and although they lack the Allstars' tumult, the sound is almost as unusual. As for the tag \"Toolshed\", nobody plays a lathe or a coping saw, but if they can find one that can be tuned, I wouldn't put it past them.",

If political realities are turned into virtual games, what images can artists create to share their discontent? How can artists creatively exploit needless and pointless suffering?

We are back to Theodor Adorno's line: is art possible after Auschwitz? Theorists say that all art is political, so how come so little of it dares to deal with politically significant events? The fact that Kennard is intrepid enough to tackle such questions makes him, against all expectations, almost fashionable.

Philip Prowse's design and direction pull Coward into the present with a sleek black and red set with splashes of animal hide - very this season. A television flickers; they play CDs; there is even a reference to Paul Daniels, presumably replacing a more obscure, aged allusion. </p> <p>Coward doesn't need all this, nor does the strong cast, including Ellen Sheean as a splendid, eccentric Madam Arcati and Sophie Ward as a suitably spectral Elvira. The comic situation and the writing are hardly impenetrable to a modern audience; the mannered upper-class civility he does so well is far from a puzzle. </p> <p>Still, this is a charming enough production, light and funny, turning darker when the spirits possess the house. By this point, Ruth has also gone to the other side and love has turned to spirited loathing. \"No one but a monumental bore would have thought of having a honeymoon in Budleigh Salterton,\" she yells, before confessing to an affair with one Mungo Gracegirdle. </p> <p>This is what you want from Coward: put-down one-liners, ludicrous comic situations, chaps with names like Gracegirdle. To tamper with this is to water him down, whether it's by adding references to television or inserting another interval. The second feels unnecessary, breaking up the comedic tension and leaving the last act underwhelming. In fashion, the 1940s are also very much this season, and it's a pity to have squandered this.

Tony Lock put Colchester in front at Ashton Gate only for Tony Thorpe, who had several chances, to equalise in a game where United's Alan White was carried off with an ankle injury only for the stretcher-bearers to drop him near the touchline. Luton made it seven without a win after Swindon left with a 3-2 victory. The home manager Ricky Hill, on being informed that a section of the crowd had barracked him and the team, commented: \"They were unhappy with what they saw, but so am I.\"",

      "body": "<p>Coventry's second earthquake of the day registered 0-3 on the Richter scale, barely enough to shrug the shoulders of home supporters, let alone shake trophies from cabinets. Though Gordon Strachan called it \"a disaster\", Coventry have gained only a point at home. To lose a third in four games was no surprise. </p> <p>More important, they have lost Gary McAllister and Robbie Keane. There is no one managing midfield, doing simple things well and making life easy for the rest; and, though Craig Bellamy made some bullocking runs, there is no one up front to make something out of nothing. The Moroccans have been dumbed down; they speak English now. </p> <p>Strachan, asked about special treatment for Paolo di Canio, who tore them apart in April, said beforehand that \"man-marking can pull your system out of shape\". There was no man-marking, no system, no shape - and no shock, despite West Ham's position at the foot of the table. As Harry Redknapp said, \"it was only a matter of time before we won\". </p> <p>For all that, for half an hour \"the best team West Ham have had for 20 years [Redknapp]\" contributed to \"the direst football I've seen here in 5 years [Strachan]\". At least Strachan added that Coventry \"played 80% of it\". </p> <p>Two players, two woeful bits of defending, two goals in three minutes sparked the change. The players were Di Canio and Joe Cole, who had more difficulty guessing what Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 was going to do next than did City's defenders. </p> <p>Di Canio, mostly wide, seemed to imagine extra licence in the city of \"Lady Godiver\". But, once his triple somersault with pike had failed to impress the judges, he turned to honest trickery. Then Cole, in the hole, paused to take a challenge on firm feet, darted away, still poised, to chip the advanced Magnus Hedman and drew a fine palming save. West Ham had found the mood and the measure. </p> <p>The goals followed. Di Canio feinted, slipped in the first and threatened to take his kit off like the Lady before remembering the consequences. More sleight of foot made room for the cross that Cole collected and drove in. </p> <p>Frank Lampard's third owed most to Nigel Winterburn's midfield tackle. The whole show owes everything to a manager who, like a collector of cars, enjoys beauty of performance as well as vintage curiosity. As if one old banger at left-back is not enough, he buys another, Winterburn, who at 37 is only a year younger than Stuart Pearce. He then makes use of both their whole hearts at once. </p> <p>In Di Canio he has a classic Spyder, in Cole a lovely little motor - or \"a frightening talent. It's all there, the head, the running, the work. But, if he's to be the player we want, he's got to get a dozen goals a year.\" When European frontiers first opened, Redknapp resembled a shopaholic. Now, when injuries might induce panic buying, he shops for pleasure and relishes his goods, if not always getting the best out of them. </p> <p>Early on he lost Rio Ferdinand. Rather than bring on the dependable Steve Potts, he moved Steve Lomas, no loss to midfield creativity, brought on Michael Carrick and looked forward in every sense, possibly to life without Ferdinand. Kevin Keegan has already lost Sol Campbell and maybe Tony Adams for next month's World Cup games. Now there is Ferdinand's groin. The tremor was felt all over England.</p>",

At least Strachan added that Coventry \"played 80% of it\". Two players, two woeful bits of defending, two goals in three minutes sparked the change. The players were Di Canio and Joe Cole, who had more difficulty guessing what Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 was going to do next than did City's defenders. Di Canio, mostly wide, seemed to imagine extra licence in the city of \"Lady Godiver\". But, once his triple somersault with pike had failed to impress the judges, he turned to honest trickery. Then Cole, in the hole, paused to take a challenge on firm feet, darted away, still poised, to chip the advanced Magnus Hedman and drew a fine palming save. West Ham had found the mood and the measure. The goals followed. Di Canio feinted, slipped in the first and threatened to take his kit off like the Lady before remembering the consequences. More sleight of foot made room for the cross that Cole collected and drove in. Frank Lampard's third owed most to Nigel Winterburn's midfield tackle. The whole show owes everything to a manager who, like a collector of cars, enjoys beauty of performance as well as vintage curiosity. As if one old banger at left-back is not enough, he buys another, Winterburn, who at 37 is only a year younger than Stuart Pearce. He then makes use of both their whole hearts at once. In Di Canio he has a classic Spyder, in Cole a lovely little motor - or \"a frightening talent. It's all there, the head, the running, the work. But, if he's to be the player we want, he's got to get a dozen goals a year.\" When European frontiers first opened, Redknapp resembled a shopaholic. Now, when injuries might induce panic buying, he shops for pleasure and relishes his goods, if not always getting the best out of them. Early on he lost Rio Ferdinand. Rather than bring on the dependable Steve Potts, he moved Steve Lomas, no loss to midfield creativity, brought on Michael Carrick and looked forward in every sense, possibly to life without Ferdinand. Kevin Keegan has already lost Sol Campbell and maybe Tony Adams for next month's World Cup games. Now there is Ferdinand's groin. The tremor was felt all over England.",

An own-goal by his Aston Villa team-mate, the young Turkish defender Alpay Ozalan, had robbed Merson of a deserved taste of victory just a minute from time - but his despair went deeper than that. </p> <p>Two years ago this month Merson, having helped Boro win promotion to the Premiership, turned his back on the club with a bitter defection, telling tales of a drinking and betting culture, never proven but never forgotten. </p> <p>His good deeds here, including a player of the season award, are seldom remembered, but the chance to barrack the Londoner is seized on with as much relish as those audiences who wanted blood in the Colosseum. </p> <p>Merson has been back before to suffer the slings and arrows, but Saturday's return seemed to provoke a greater degree of venom from the seats. Maybe Boro fans need a diversion from their own team's failings. Still looking for a first home league win, cracks are showing among a loyal fan base: this was the lowest attendance at the Riverside this season. They needed a target. </p> <p>The Villa manager John Gregory, who knows how his own home crowd can turn on players, has some sympathy for Merson. \"I don't mind it from 3pm onwards, but it's a bit harsh in the warm-up!\" </p> <p>Gregory knew his side could and should have put any reward out of Boro's reach if they had taken just one more of a catalogue of chances. </p> <p>Boro's on-loan goalkeeper Gary Walsh made the mistake that gave Villa a deserved edge, making a hash of a clearance under pressure from Dion Dublin. The striker's neat pass to the substitute Joachim was converted with a well-angled shot in the 74th minute. </p> <p>The Boro manager Bryan Robson believed his side deserved a point for their second-half rally, though he was candid enough to admit a number of his players \"lacked confidence\" at home. </p> <p>His own confidence must be wavering, despite his ranking at No4 in the league's longest-serving managers list (appointed May 1994), as his expensively assembled team still miss a truly creative talent, like Merson. </p> <p>Robson, though, cannot be faulted for trying to find the right blend. His is not so much a rotation system as much as a revolving-door version, with the Argentinian substitute Carlos Marinelli becoming the 26th player he has used in eight games. </p> <p>The two managers could not agree on the future of Villa's longest-serving player, Ugo Ehiogu, either. Rated at \u00a38 million, the defender bought from West Brom for a mere \u00a340,000 sat on the Villa bench unsure where he will be playing next week. </p> <p>Gregory insisted: \"Nothing's resolved, the ball's in Middlesbrough's court.\" Robson reckoned: \"It's up to Villa, we've made our final offer.\" </p> <p>Stalemate again.</p>",

Two years ago this month Merson, having helped Boro win promotion to the Premiership, turned his back on the club with a bitter defection, telling tales of a drinking and betting culture, never proven but never forgotten. His good deeds here, including a player of the season award, are seldom remembered, but the chance to barrack the Londoner is seized on with as much relish as those audiences who wanted blood in the Colosseum. Merson has been back before to suffer the slings and arrows, but Saturday's return seemed to provoke a greater degree of venom from the seats. Maybe Boro fans need a diversion from their own team's failings. Still looking for a first home league win, cracks are showing among a loyal fan base: this was the lowest attendance at the Riverside this season. They needed a target. The Villa manager John Gregory, who knows how his own home crowd can turn on players, has some sympathy for Merson. \"I don't mind it from 3pm onwards, but it's a bit harsh in the warm-up!\" Gregory knew his side could and should have put any reward out of Boro's reach if they had taken just one more of a catalogue of chances. Boro's on-loan goalkeeper Gary Walsh made the mistake that gave Villa a deserved edge, making a hash of a clearance under pressure from Dion Dublin. The striker's neat pass to the substitute Joachim was converted with a well-angled shot in the 74th minute. The Boro manager Bryan Robson believed his side deserved a point for their second-half rally, though he was candid enough to admit a number of his players \"lacked confidence\" at home. His own confidence must be wavering, despite his ranking at No4 in the league's longest-serving managers list (appointed May 1994), as his expensively assembled team still miss a truly creative talent, like Merson. Robson, though, cannot be faulted for trying to find the right blend. His is not so much a rotation system as much as a revolving-door version, with the Argentinian substitute Carlos Marinelli becoming the 26th player he has used in eight games. The two managers could not agree on the future of Villa's longest-serving player, Ugo Ehiogu, either. Rated at \u00a38 million, the defender bought from West Brom for a mere \u00a340,000 sat on the Villa bench unsure where he will be playing next week. Gregory insisted: \"Nothing's resolved, the ball's in Middlesbrough's court.\" Robson reckoned: \"It's up to Villa, we've made our final offer.\" Stalemate again.",

But in a break with his previous dry and \"prudent\" public performances, the chancellor made a lengthy attack on Michael Portillo, his Tory shadow, and on the Tory leader, William Hague. Mr Brown said that Mr Portillo had been in the Treasury during the final cycles of \"Tory boom and bust\" - and in the Department of the Environment when the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was introducing the unpopular poll tax.</p> <p>And all this time, he said, Mr Hague was \"drinking 14 pints\" - to laughter from the floor.</p>",

Mr Brown gave a blunt warning that he would not change policy.\"There will be no relaxing of our fiscal rules. We will not put the hard-won Labour economic stability at risk. No return to short-termism. No return to Tory boom and bust.\" Earlier in the day, party activists had called on the government to restore the link the between pensions and earnings. At a packed fringe meeting today, veteran left-wing MP Tony Benn told delegates that that pensioners have a right to share in \"rising wealth\" to which they have contributed. Much to their dismay - but probably not surprise - Mr Brown ruled out an across-the-board rise in the state pension. \"It's precisely because, with your support, we have resisted short-term lurches in policy that we can today steer a course of stability at a time of uncertainty in the world economy, without putting growth at risk,\" he told delegates. The chancellor acknowledged that the government had \"much more to do\" on pensions but defended the policy of targeting the poorest. \"It is a progressive principle that we should do more for those who have the greatest needs. So if we are to plan for the future, our priority cannot be that the wealthiest get exactly the same as the neediest,\" he said. On fuel, Mr Brown said he understood the difficulties many people faced with high petrol prices, and promised to deal with it. However, he said he would work towards international pressure to step up oil production and lower its price on the world markets in preference to cutting tax. The chancellor also confirmed that there would be no change in the government's policy on the euro. But in a break with his previous dry and \"prudent\" public performances, the chancellor made a lengthy attack on Michael Portillo, his Tory shadow, and on the Tory leader, William Hague. Mr Brown said that Mr Portillo had been in the Treasury during the final cycles of \"Tory boom and bust\" - and in the Department of the Environment when the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was introducing the unpopular poll tax. And all this time, he said, Mr Hague was \"drinking 14 pints\" - to laughter from the floor.",

      "body": "<p>As I get older and perhaps wiser, I realise more and more what I do not know. I still don't know what makes people happy although I am a good deal more knowledgeable about what makes them sad. I don't know now whether there is a God, when once I did believe and with a passionate conviction. I don't know whether good mothers are born or made, what turns some people into leaders and others into the led, nor whether in my lifetime we will see the cure for cancer, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p> What I do know is what it is like to be a man. However, as I reflect on how I learned about masculinity and manhood, I realise that almost all the teaching was implicit and all the learning by way of a kind of osmotic process. I don't recall anyone, my father, my mother, my teachers, my peers, saying 'This is what it means to be a man, a son, a brother, a lover, a dad'. Yet I learned very early on that what a man does; his work is as important as, even more important than, who he is; that a man is defined in modern capitalistic society in terms not of being but doing. </p> <p> My career, particularly my medical career, was always portrayed and interpreted, by others as much as by myself, as more important than spouse, family, friends. During my undergraduate and postgraduate training, first in medicine, then in psychiatry, I never ever witnessed a male colleague admitting to putting his family first. Male colleagues would blithely arrange late evening meetings of this or that committee and be surprised and irritated when female colleagues pointed out that domestic duties made their attendance impossible. For a male to make such a statement would have marked him as someone not committed to his job. Most male colleagues were busy demonstrating how they worked all the hours God gave them. It was like chimps beating their chests and baring their teeth. Often, it was just about as productive. </p> <p> In an interview published in the New York Times back in 1912, Carl Jung observed that the libido of American men: </p> <p>is focused almost entirely on his business, so that as a husband he is glad to have no responsibilities. He gives the complete direction of his family life over to his wife. This is what you call giving independence to the American woman. It is what I call the laziness of the American man. That is why he is so kind and polite in his home and why he can fight so hard in his business. His real life is where his fight is. The lazy part of his life is where his family is. Jung was writing of American men at the turn of the last century. He could as easily have been writing of manhood, career and family life some 80 years later. He certainly could have been writing about mine. Yet, given the nature and extent of the feminist analysis and the sexual revolution of the second half of the twentieth century, much would appear to have changed for - women. But what has happened to men? </p> <p> As a young psychiatrist in the late 1960s and 1970s I regularly encountered the phenomenon then known as the 'empty-nest syndrome'. It afflicted married women who, having given their lives to the rearing of their families, found when they reached their fifties that their children had grown up and gone and their spouses were off living a life of work and golf. Now, in the 1990s, I don't see so many women from empty nests. Rather I see middle-aged men, who gave their lives loyally to this company or that corporation, who sacrificed everything for it, now ruthlessly put out to grass, compulsorily retired, downsized, rendered redundant. Bewildered, they look around but their children have flown and their spouses are otherwise occupied. It is the women who now play the golf, who have jobs and friends at work. It is the men who cower in the empty nest, nervously facing what an eloquent Irish businessman friend has termed 'the forgotten future'. </p> <p> From the outset of public life as a male - at school, university, medical school, debating union, postgraduate research centre, hospital - I learned to compete and pretend to a confidence I didn't often (didn't ever) feel. That is what men are required to do. As a result, one of the commonest fears of mature men is that they will be 'found out' in some mysterious fashion. As a young father, I shouted at my children in order to feel powerful, and covertly and sometimes overtly declared that manly boys didn't complain but had to be strong and responsible and suppress vulnerability, particularly if they were to avoid being bullied by other boys. As a young husband, I loved my wife and was, or so I believed, a sympathetic and liberated 'new' male. Now I am not so sure. She sacrificed much to be a committed and full-time mother. I sacrificed little to be a peripheral and very part-time dad. But I was the family provider and that counted for a great deal - to me at any rate - and I was a father to my children, even if I would have been hard put to define precisely what being a father was. </p> <p> Now, the whole issue of men - the point of them, their purpose, their value, their justification - is a matter for public debate. Serious commentators declare that men are redundant, that women do not need them and children would be better off without them. At the beginning of the twenty-first century it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that men are in serious trouble. Throughout the world, developed and developing, antisocial behaviour is essentially male. Violence, sexual abuse of children, illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, gambling all are overwhelmingly male activities. The courts and prisons bulge with men. When it comes to aggression, delinquent behaviour, risk taking and social mayhem, men win gold. </p> <p> And yet, for all their behaving badly, they do not seem any the happier. Throughout North America, Europe and Australia, male suicides outnumber female by a factor of between 3 and 4 to 1. The rise in the number of young men killing themselves in much of the developed world has been rightly termed an epidemic. For the old, the situation is no better. For every 6 elderly women in every 100,000 who kill themselves each year, 40 elderly men take their own lives. And these suicide figures are viewed as the tip of an iceberg of male depression, an iceberg hidden only because men are seen to be either too proud or too emotionally constipated to admit when their feelings are out of control. Men renowned for their ability and inclination to be stoned, drunk or sexually daring, appear terrified by the prospect of revealing that they can be - and often are - depressed, dependent, in need of help. </p> <p> It will be said that it has always been thus and that all that is changing is that men are coming out of the emotional closet. Men, so this argument goes, having ridiculed, demeaned and patronised women's supposed emotionality, now accept the importance, the maturity, of not merely acknowledging feelings but expressing them in a civilised and open way. </p> <p> Others argue that there is a genuine rise in male dissatisfaction for which there is no shortage of suggested causes. Top of the list is the growing assertiveness of women. As a consequence of the feminist revolution, so this argument goes, women are no longer prepared to be the property of patriarchal men. In this feminist revolution, male power is being overthrown. Men, like colonists seeing their empire crumble, don't like what is happening. Few women have much time for such an argument. After all, the gains that have accrued to women remain pretty miserly. Men still outnumber women in positions of power across the globe, still glower downwards through the glass ceiling, still strut the cabinet and boardrooms in every developed country in the world, the seeming masters of their fate and everybody else's. In the developing world the situation is even more unequal. The gender disparity in sharing the burden of unpaid work is stark, and for all the talk of equality women throughout the world continue to work longer hours than men and are paid very much less for it. The colonists are still in command. </p> <p> In the circumstances, female impatience with male sensitivities is understandable. But it may be missing the point. It is true that patriarchy has not been overthrown. But its justification is in disarray. The colonists have not been displaced but the colonised are planning, discussing, organising, and, in a number of small, well-planned uprisings, have demonstrated their capability. There is a sense, certainly in the outlying areas of the patriarchal empire, that the time for male authority, dominance and control is up. Beneath the surface, male power is being subverted. Throughout Europe - in primary schools, through secondary education and right into the universities - girls are outperforming boys. In the European Union, 20 per cent more women are graduating than men. On leaving school and university, women's prospects of employment exceed men's. In Germany, for example, between 1991 and 1995 twice as many men as women lost their jobs. Women actually gained 210,000 jobs while men lost 400,000. Some teenage boys reassure themselves that later on, in their twenties and thirties, the right order reasserts itself, and men regain their rightful place - on top. But that reassurance, for a variety of reasons, is sounding increasingly hollow. Women are on the march and, even if they still have a long way to go, many men, already threatened, are reacting with aggression directed at women and at themselves. </p> <p> And if changes in education, training and work are not sufficient to demoralise the average man, there is the sorry, dismal, public soap opera of man's relationship with his penis. Men, who in most other areas of their lives make such a fetish of being in control, seem unable to remain masters of their sexual appetites. More darkly, there is little respite from exposure to the more savage side of male sexuality - rape, molestation, sexual violence - manifested overwhelmingly in aggression by men against women and children. Not surprisingly, many innocent men, like the relatives of torturers and killers, find themselves apologising for crimes they have not themselves committed. </p> <p> But are men fearful of their feelings and, if they are, have they good reason to be? Do men feel contempt for women and, if they do, what is fuelling such contempt? It has been argued that misogyny, the hatred of women, is an inescapable element in the development of men and that, quite simply, there are no good men. Might the fear and contempt be related to a deeper fear, a more profound anxiety about male sexuality itself? Here one is treading on dangerous ground. Put a foot wrong and one risks being accused of blaming women for men's inability to control their sexual feelings and to harness their aggression. That is what many men believe and some act upon it. Women are feared, despised and sometimes even destroyed because of what men perceive women to be doing to them. To such men, their own sexuality is exciting precisely because it is unpredictable, capricious, dangerous - and women end up being blamed for provoking it. To such men, women, by their very presence, represent a most disturbing challenge to self-control. Given the extent to which control is for many men the defining mark of their masculinity, any suggestion or threat of being out of control challenges the very essence of what being a male is all about. Bill Clinton's sexual behaviour revealed that the Garden of Eden myth is alive and well and flourishing in the heart of the American empire. Men fall because women tempt them. This remains the explanation of male sexual behaviour most favoured by men. Rather than expose to a genuinely rigorous analysis the nature of male sexuality and its relationship to power, social status, aggression and control, most male commentators retreat into a self-pitying and ultimately depressing moan about the difficulty of being a full-bloodedly sexual man in a dynamic relationship with a woman in the new post-feminist world of gender equality. </p> <p> In an interview with Germaine Greer in 1989 I wondered whether she accepted that behind the bluster and the posturing many men were not really as confident as they might appear. 'I don't care much about phallic insecurity', she tartly replied, adding that, after all, men created the dream of the phallus. It's men who are worried about whether the phallic department is adequate. The women are perfectly happy with all the other stuff - with social status, power, intelligence. She is absolutely right. Men do remain preoccupied with 'whether the phallic department is adequate'. They worry about the size, shape and erectile potential of their genitalia. Men, young and old, are disconcerted by mocking references to what Sylvia Plath dismissively referred to as 'old turkey neck and gizzards'. The highly successful British film, The Full Monty, explicitly drew an analogy between male inadequacy consequent on the loss of a job and male anxiety concerning genital potency. Men must bond, share, emotionally relate, must reveal themselves in full nakedness to each other and to women if they are to be fully human; so went the movie's message. Then came the ultimate copout in which everything was indeed revealed to the cinema audience - save 'old turkey neck and gizzards'! </p> <p> Male preoccupation with their penises would appear to be based on fear, right enough: not on the Freudian fear of castration, but on the Adlerian fear of ridicule. Are we up to it? ask today's men anxiously, peering at their shrivelled cocks and analysing their social skills; are we up to competing, succeeding, achieving, conquering, controlling, asserting, pontificating, as well as getting it up? And there is of course the unavoidable gender inequality, the fact that, unlike the female orgasm, the male erection cannot be faked. The obvious visibility of the male genital organs, their state and size, roused and flaccid, are readily measurable and comparable. Hardly surprising, therefore, that the arrival of Viagra has been accompanied not merely by dodgy humour and gruesome double entendres but also by po-faced and panicky political discussions about the possible bankrupting of health finances due to a stampede by men to get their hands on the latest 'old turkey gizzard' stimulant. </p> <p> The one biological difference between the sexes on which everybody is agreed is that whereas women possess two X-shaped sex chromosomes, men possess one X and a little Y-shaped chromosome. The Y chromosome accounts for superior male strength, stature, mass of muscle, sleight of hand, speed of foot. These attributes have been of considerable value in a world dominated by a need for physical power and energy and a raw, brutal, martial strength. We have become accustomed to thinking of 'real' men as those who labour in the iron, steel and coal industries, in shipbuilding, lumberjacking, pre-mechanised farming. Our martial heroes have been almost entirely male, in the fantasies and the realities of hand-to-hand combat, of sheer physical guts, the will to survive, athletic derring-do. What price all that brute strength, might and energy now, when more people are employed making Indian curries than mining coal, when computerised robots and not sweating men assemble cars and when the male predilection for violence, far from saving national pride, threatens world survival? </p> <p> There is hardly anything to be done in today's society that cannot be done by women. 'So what!' say women, not unreasonably, given the age it has taken to establish such a state of affairs. So what, indeed. The problem is one for men and particularly for those men - and they have been the majority - who have defined their lives, their identities, the very essence of their masculinity in terms of professional and occupational achievement and have prided themselves on the work that only they as men could do. My father's generation prided themselves on being providers - for their spouses, families and themselves. Today, providing seems no longer required. Married women increasingly reap the benefit of education, harness their intelligence and generate their own incomes. In one-parent families women press hard for workplace creches and better childcare facilities, as well as social security payments to compensate for male-generated finances. Not merely is the role of provider under siege, the role of father is threatened. The second millennium has ended with man's claim to a significant role in procreation and child-rearing seriously diminished. The rise in the number of single mothers suggests not merely that men are inadequate as partners and fathers but that they are simply redundant. Women are asserting that they can conceive and rear children on their own. They don't need men to father their children. The development of assisted reproduction, including techniques such as in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination by anonymous donor and surrogate motherhood, together with the highly political and controversial assertion that single parenting is as good as that provided by two parents, raise the question - whither fatherhood? If conception, pregnancy, delivery and child-rearing can be perfectly well accomplished without the active participation of the male, then why bother with him at all, given the heartache, the trouble, the sheer cussedness of today's man? Once so proud of his penis (Freud, after all, argued that women envied it), contemporary man now finds he is being reduced to the role of support seed carrier, as women occupy centre stage not merely in the creation of new life (they have always been there) but in its nurturing. It is hardly surprising that there are some men who seriously suggest that the only way they can again play a reproductive and parental role of any significance is if they can be assisted by science to have babies themselves! </p> <p> A century ago, a peevish Sigmund Freud, perplexed by a seeming epidemic of hysterical, depressed, lethargic and dissatisfied women, asked, 'What do women want?' He asked it at a time when to be a woman was to be pathological, to be male was to be health personified. A century later it is not women who are seen to be pathological, but men; it is not women's wants, but men's, that mystify us. But before we can begin to answer what men want, deserve or need, it is necessary to reassess what we know about men. What is it that the Y chromosome, the cause of all the trouble, is up to? Are men innately and incorrigibly violent? Must the issue between the sexes be for men a case of dominate or be dominated, for women a choice between being resistant or submissive? In a world of equal opportunity for the sexes, can men renegotiate the relationship with themselves and with women? Is there anything left of the male role as provider and protector? Do we need men? Do we need fathers? And if we do, what kind of men, what kind of fathers do we need? </p> <p> The contemporary world is still, for the most part, divided into two spheres - the private sphere, inhabited for the most part by women, and a public sphere where men find and cultivate their identity and assert their dominance. The power of patriarchy, that set of relations of power that enable men to control women, is grounded in the belief that the public takes precedence over the private. Women struggling to escape the constraints of patriarchy are drawn into a tacit acceptance of the superior value of the public, the business, the profession and the office, and a devaluation of the private. Men, as a consequence, feel little need to reassess the priority they give to the public; indeed, the very desire of women to establish their own public legitimacy is interpreted as further proof that the public is indeed superior and the private is legitimately regarded as inferior. </p> <p> In exploring the challenged state of masculinity in this book, I have chosen the term 'phallus' very deliberately. The penis is an anatomical term referring to the male generative organ. The phallus is an anthropological and theological term referring to its image. The penis is an organ with biological functions, the phallus is an idea venerated in various religions as a symbol of male power. Phallic refers not merely to the penis but incorporates notions of potency, virility, manliness, strength and power. It has been seen as the 'signifier of signifiers', the mark which positions the individual as male and locates him in terms of authority, control, dominance'. The phallus 'signifies what men think they have and what women are believed to lack'. Man's penis is not at issue, except for its possible redundancy as a tool of procreation. But phallic man, authoritative, dominant, assertive - man in control not merely of himself but of woman - is starting to die, and now the question is whether a new man will emerge phoenix-like in his place or whether man himself will become largely redundant.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As I get older and perhaps wiser, I realise more and more what I do not know. I still don't know what makes people happy although I am a good deal more knowledgeable about what makes them sad. I don't know now whether there is a God, when once I did believe and with a passionate conviction. I don't know whether good mothers are born or made, what turns some people into leaders and others into the led, nor whether in my lifetime we will see the cure for cancer, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. What I do know is what it is like to be a man. However, as I reflect on how I learned about masculinity and manhood, I realise that almost all the teaching was implicit and all the learning by way of a kind of osmotic process. I don't recall anyone, my father, my mother, my teachers, my peers, saying 'This is what it means to be a man, a son, a brother, a lover, a dad'. Yet I learned very early on that what a man does; his work is as important as, even more important than, who he is; that a man is defined in modern capitalistic society in terms not of being but doing. My career, particularly my medical career, was always portrayed and interpreted, by others as much as by myself, as more important than spouse, family, friends. During my undergraduate and postgraduate training, first in medicine, then in psychiatry, I never ever witnessed a male colleague admitting to putting his family first. Male colleagues would blithely arrange late evening meetings of this or that committee and be surprised and irritated when female colleagues pointed out that domestic duties made their attendance impossible. For a male to make such a statement would have marked him as someone not committed to his job. Most male colleagues were busy demonstrating how they worked all the hours God gave them. It was like chimps beating their chests and baring their teeth. Often, it was just about as productive. In an interview published in the New York Times back in 1912, Carl Jung observed that the libido of American men: is focused almost entirely on his business, so that as a husband he is glad to have no responsibilities. He gives the complete direction of his family life over to his wife. This is what you call giving independence to the American woman. It is what I call the laziness of the American man. That is why he is so kind and polite in his home and why he can fight so hard in his business. His real life is where his fight is. The lazy part of his life is where his family is. Jung was writing of American men at the turn of the last century. He could as easily have been writing of manhood, career and family life some 80 years later. He certainly could have been writing about mine. Yet, given the nature and extent of the feminist analysis and the sexual revolution of the second half of the twentieth century, much would appear to have changed for - women. But what has happened to men? As a young psychiatrist in the late 1960s and 1970s I regularly encountered the phenomenon then known as the 'empty-nest syndrome'. It afflicted married women who, having given their lives to the rearing of their families, found when they reached their fifties that their children had grown up and gone and their spouses were off living a life of work and golf. Now, in the 1990s, I don't see so many women from empty nests. Rather I see middle-aged men, who gave their lives loyally to this company or that corporation, who sacrificed everything for it, now ruthlessly put out to grass, compulsorily retired, downsized, rendered redundant. Bewildered, they look around but their children have flown and their spouses are otherwise occupied. It is the women who now play the golf, who have jobs and friends at work. It is the men who cower in the empty nest, nervously facing what an eloquent Irish businessman friend has termed 'the forgotten future'. From the outset of public life as a male - at school, university, medical school, debating union, postgraduate research centre, hospital - I learned to compete and pretend to a confidence I didn't often (didn't ever) feel. That is what men are required to do. As a result, one of the commonest fears of mature men is that they will be 'found out' in some mysterious fashion. As a young father, I shouted at my children in order to feel powerful, and covertly and sometimes overtly declared that manly boys didn't complain but had to be strong and responsible and suppress vulnerability, particularly if they were to avoid being bullied by other boys. As a young husband, I loved my wife and was, or so I believed, a sympathetic and liberated 'new' male. Now I am not so sure. She sacrificed much to be a committed and full-time mother. I sacrificed little to be a peripheral and very part-time dad. But I was the family provider and that counted for a great deal - to me at any rate - and I was a father to my children, even if I would have been hard put to define precisely what being a father was. Now, the whole issue of men - the point of them, their purpose, their value, their justification - is a matter for public debate. Serious commentators declare that men are redundant, that women do not need them and children would be better off without them. At the beginning of the twenty-first century it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that men are in serious trouble. Throughout the world, developed and developing, antisocial behaviour is essentially male. Violence, sexual abuse of children, illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, gambling all are overwhelmingly male activities. The courts and prisons bulge with men. When it comes to aggression, delinquent behaviour, risk taking and social mayhem, men win gold. And yet, for all their behaving badly, they do not seem any the happier. Throughout North America, Europe and Australia, male suicides outnumber female by a factor of between 3 and 4 to 1. The rise in the number of young men killing themselves in much of the developed world has been rightly termed an epidemic. For the old, the situation is no better. For every 6 elderly women in every 100,000 who kill themselves each year, 40 elderly men take their own lives. And these suicide figures are viewed as the tip of an iceberg of male depression, an iceberg hidden only because men are seen to be either too proud or too emotionally constipated to admit when their feelings are out of control. Men renowned for their ability and inclination to be stoned, drunk or sexually daring, appear terrified by the prospect of revealing that they can be - and often are - depressed, dependent, in need of help. It will be said that it has always been thus and that all that is changing is that men are coming out of the emotional closet. Men, so this argument goes, having ridiculed, demeaned and patronised women's supposed emotionality, now accept the importance, the maturity, of not merely acknowledging feelings but expressing them in a civilised and open way. Others argue that there is a genuine rise in male dissatisfaction for which there is no shortage of suggested causes. Top of the list is the growing assertiveness of women. As a consequence of the feminist revolution, so this argument goes, women are no longer prepared to be the property of patriarchal men. In this feminist revolution, male power is being overthrown. Men, like colonists seeing their empire crumble, don't like what is happening. Few women have much time for such an argument. After all, the gains that have accrued to women remain pretty miserly. Men still outnumber women in positions of power across the globe, still glower downwards through the glass ceiling, still strut the cabinet and boardrooms in every developed country in the world, the seeming masters of their fate and everybody else's. In the developing world the situation is even more unequal. The gender disparity in sharing the burden of unpaid work is stark, and for all the talk of equality women throughout the world continue to work longer hours than men and are paid very much less for it. The colonists are still in command. In the circumstances, female impatience with male sensitivities is understandable. But it may be missing the point. It is true that patriarchy has not been overthrown. But its justification is in disarray. The colonists have not been displaced but the colonised are planning, discussing, organising, and, in a number of small, well-planned uprisings, have demonstrated their capability. There is a sense, certainly in the outlying areas of the patriarchal empire, that the time for male authority, dominance and control is up. Beneath the surface, male power is being subverted. Throughout Europe - in primary schools, through secondary education and right into the universities - girls are outperforming boys. In the European Union, 20 per cent more women are graduating than men. On leaving school and university, women's prospects of employment exceed men's. In Germany, for example, between 1991 and 1995 twice as many men as women lost their jobs. Women actually gained 210,000 jobs while men lost 400,000. Some teenage boys reassure themselves that later on, in their twenties and thirties, the right order reasserts itself, and men regain their rightful place - on top. But that reassurance, for a variety of reasons, is sounding increasingly hollow. Women are on the march and, even if they still have a long way to go, many men, already threatened, are reacting with aggression directed at women and at themselves. And if changes in education, training and work are not sufficient to demoralise the average man, there is the sorry, dismal, public soap opera of man's relationship with his penis. Men, who in most other areas of their lives make such a fetish of being in control, seem unable to remain masters of their sexual appetites. More darkly, there is little respite from exposure to the more savage side of male sexuality - rape, molestation, sexual violence - manifested overwhelmingly in aggression by men against women and children. Not surprisingly, many innocent men, like the relatives of torturers and killers, find themselves apologising for crimes they have not themselves committed. But are men fearful of their feelings and, if they are, have they good reason to be? Do men feel contempt for women and, if they do, what is fuelling such contempt? It has been argued that misogyny, the hatred of women, is an inescapable element in the development of men and that, quite simply, there are no good men. Might the fear and contempt be related to a deeper fear, a more profound anxiety about male sexuality itself? Here one is treading on dangerous ground. Put a foot wrong and one risks being accused of blaming women for men's inability to control their sexual feelings and to harness their aggression. That is what many men believe and some act upon it. Women are feared, despised and sometimes even destroyed because of what men perceive women to be doing to them. To such men, their own sexuality is exciting precisely because it is unpredictable, capricious, dangerous - and women end up being blamed for provoking it. To such men, women, by their very presence, represent a most disturbing challenge to self-control. Given the extent to which control is for many men the defining mark of their masculinity, any suggestion or threat of being out of control challenges the very essence of what being a male is all about. Bill Clinton's sexual behaviour revealed that the Garden of Eden myth is alive and well and flourishing in the heart of the American empire. Men fall because women tempt them. This remains the explanation of male sexual behaviour most favoured by men. Rather than expose to a genuinely rigorous analysis the nature of male sexuality and its relationship to power, social status, aggression and control, most male commentators retreat into a self-pitying and ultimately depressing moan about the difficulty of being a full-bloodedly sexual man in a dynamic relationship with a woman in the new post-feminist world of gender equality. In an interview with Germaine Greer in 1989 I wondered whether she accepted that behind the bluster and the posturing many men were not really as confident as they might appear. 'I don't care much about phallic insecurity', she tartly replied, adding that, after all, men created the dream of the phallus. It's men who are worried about whether the phallic department is adequate. The women are perfectly happy with all the other stuff - with social status, power, intelligence. She is absolutely right. Men do remain preoccupied with 'whether the phallic department is adequate'. They worry about the size, shape and erectile potential of their genitalia. Men, young and old, are disconcerted by mocking references to what Sylvia Plath dismissively referred to as 'old turkey neck and gizzards'. The highly successful British film, The Full Monty, explicitly drew an analogy between male inadequacy consequent on the loss of a job and male anxiety concerning genital potency. Men must bond, share, emotionally relate, must reveal themselves in full nakedness to each other and to women if they are to be fully human; so went the movie's message. Then came the ultimate copout in which everything was indeed revealed to the cinema audience - save 'old turkey neck and gizzards'! Male preoccupation with their penises would appear to be based on fear, right enough: not on the Freudian fear of castration, but on the Adlerian fear of ridicule. Are we up to it? ask today's men anxiously, peering at their shrivelled cocks and analysing their social skills; are we up to competing, succeeding, achieving, conquering, controlling, asserting, pontificating, as well as getting it up? And there is of course the unavoidable gender inequality, the fact that, unlike the female orgasm, the male erection cannot be faked. The obvious visibility of the male genital organs, their state and size, roused and flaccid, are readily measurable and comparable. Hardly surprising, therefore, that the arrival of Viagra has been accompanied not merely by dodgy humour and gruesome double entendres but also by po-faced and panicky political discussions about the possible bankrupting of health finances due to a stampede by men to get their hands on the latest 'old turkey gizzard' stimulant. The one biological difference between the sexes on which everybody is agreed is that whereas women possess two X-shaped sex chromosomes, men possess one X and a little Y-shaped chromosome. The Y chromosome accounts for superior male strength, stature, mass of muscle, sleight of hand, speed of foot. These attributes have been of considerable value in a world dominated by a need for physical power and energy and a raw, brutal, martial strength. We have become accustomed to thinking of 'real' men as those who labour in the iron, steel and coal industries, in shipbuilding, lumberjacking, pre-mechanised farming. Our martial heroes have been almost entirely male, in the fantasies and the realities of hand-to-hand combat, of sheer physical guts, the will to survive, athletic derring-do. What price all that brute strength, might and energy now, when more people are employed making Indian curries than mining coal, when computerised robots and not sweating men assemble cars and when the male predilection for violence, far from saving national pride, threatens world survival? There is hardly anything to be done in today's society that cannot be done by women. 'So what!' say women, not unreasonably, given the age it has taken to establish such a state of affairs. So what, indeed. The problem is one for men and particularly for those men - and they have been the majority - who have defined their lives, their identities, the very essence of their masculinity in terms of professional and occupational achievement and have prided themselves on the work that only they as men could do. My father's generation prided themselves on being providers - for their spouses, families and themselves. Today, providing seems no longer required. Married women increasingly reap the benefit of education, harness their intelligence and generate their own incomes. In one-parent families women press hard for workplace creches and better childcare facilities, as well as social security payments to compensate for male-generated finances. Not merely is the role of provider under siege, the role of father is threatened. The second millennium has ended with man's claim to a significant role in procreation and child-rearing seriously diminished. The rise in the number of single mothers suggests not merely that men are inadequate as partners and fathers but that they are simply redundant. Women are asserting that they can conceive and rear children on their own. They don't need men to father their children. The development of assisted reproduction, including techniques such as in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination by anonymous donor and surrogate motherhood, together with the highly political and controversial assertion that single parenting is as good as that provided by two parents, raise the question - whither fatherhood? If conception, pregnancy, delivery and child-rearing can be perfectly well accomplished without the active participation of the male, then why bother with him at all, given the heartache, the trouble, the sheer cussedness of today's man? Once so proud of his penis (Freud, after all, argued that women envied it), contemporary man now finds he is being reduced to the role of support seed carrier, as women occupy centre stage not merely in the creation of new life (they have always been there) but in its nurturing. It is hardly surprising that there are some men who seriously suggest that the only way they can again play a reproductive and parental role of any significance is if they can be assisted by science to have babies themselves! A century ago, a peevish Sigmund Freud, perplexed by a seeming epidemic of hysterical, depressed, lethargic and dissatisfied women, asked, 'What do women want?' He asked it at a time when to be a woman was to be pathological, to be male was to be health personified. A century later it is not women who are seen to be pathological, but men; it is not women's wants, but men's, that mystify us. But before we can begin to answer what men want, deserve or need, it is necessary to reassess what we know about men. What is it that the Y chromosome, the cause of all the trouble, is up to? Are men innately and incorrigibly violent? Must the issue between the sexes be for men a case of dominate or be dominated, for women a choice between being resistant or submissive? In a world of equal opportunity for the sexes, can men renegotiate the relationship with themselves and with women? Is there anything left of the male role as provider and protector? Do we need men? Do we need fathers? And if we do, what kind of men, what kind of fathers do we need? The contemporary world is still, for the most part, divided into two spheres - the private sphere, inhabited for the most part by women, and a public sphere where men find and cultivate their identity and assert their dominance. The power of patriarchy, that set of relations of power that enable men to control women, is grounded in the belief that the public takes precedence over the private.

      "body": "<p>Let me say first of all: it is because since 1997 we have put our Labour values and our priorities into action that Britain has greater economic stability, rising investment in health, education and our public services, a national minimum wage for the first time, and the lowest unemployment for a generation.</p> <p>And here in Brighton today, again speaking the language of priorities, I want to discuss with this conference and, from this conference, to discuss with the British people the economic challenges our country still faces. The difficulties we must still surmount, the new world pressures we now have to tackle and the long term choices we as a country have to make on the future of our economy, the future of public spending, the future of pensions and the future of taxes</p> <p>Choices that we must make by heeding the call of principle and hearing the voices of the people as we listen and, as is our ambition and duty, to put ourselves at the service of the hard working people of Britain.</p> <p>And I want the message to go out from Brighton this afternoon that if we, the Labour party, make the case for our values; and if by our service we show the British people we are worthy of trust then we can aim higher, and in our time and generation build a Britain of full employment. One where there is educational opportunity for all. A Britain where we abolish child and pensioner poverty, create a safe environment for all our children and show that the best health service for each of us is a national health service run for all of us.</p> <p>A Britain where, true to our values, not just a few people but everyone has the chance to fulfil their potential and share in national prosperity.</p> <p>In 1997 we said that the future depended upon first building strong and long term foundations for economic stability.</p> <p>We all remember the early 90s.</p> <p>It was Britain's hard working families -the one million who lost jobs in manufacturing, the one million businesses that went under, the million homeowners with negative equity. It was hard working families who paid the price and bore the brunt of economic failure. And by 1997 with the deficit nearly 30 billion, the national debt doubled, debt payments bigger than the schools budget, inflation rising, and the economy on the way back to the old familiar cycle of boom and bust, we resolved to, and under Tony Blair had the strength to, take difficult long term decisions</p> <p>Bank of England independence. Tough controls on public spending. The difficult decision to raise fuel taxes. The decision to pay back debt and cut the costs of debt.</p> <p>Breaking from the chronic and flawed Conservative short-termism and implementing Labour values; planning for the long-term; economic responsibility; building from strong foundations. Determined to protect hard working families from a return to boom and bust.</p> <p>So it is not by accident, but by our actions, that we now have the lowest inflation for over 30 years and around the lowest long term interest rates for 35 years, and a mortgage bill on average \u00a31,000 lower than under Tory interest rates.</p> <p>And it is not by default but by design that unemployment among men is the lowest since 1980, unemployment among women the lowest since 1976, long term unemployment now the lowest since the 1970s, youth unemployment now the lowest since 1975. For the first time in years, unemployment among single parents and the disabled is now falling, as we make the right to work a reality. And I am determined that no one is excluded.</p> <p>And because we have cut the costs of unemployment and debt, it is not by coincidence, but by choice that we are now tackling the long-term neglect of under investment in Britain and spending on health is rising by 7 per cent, education this year by 10 per cent and public investment in Britain is rising this year by 30 per cent, years of Tory underinvestment now replaced by a Labour plan for sustained long term investment.</p> <p>These things did not just happen. The priorities and tough decisions of a Labour government made them happen.</p> <p>And it is precisely because we have taken the time and trouble to build the long term foundation for success, precisely because we have resisted short term lurches in policy, that we can today steer a course of stability at a time of uncertainty in the world economy without putting growth at risk.</p> <p>So we will not return to the old short-termism.</p> <p>There will be no sudden lurches in tax or spending policy.</p> <p>And there will be no irresponsible pre-election sprees or pay demands that put youth jobs or any jobs at risk. No change in our policy on Europe, support in principle for the single currency, in practise the five tests that have to be met. And no relaxing our fiscal rules.</p> <p>We will not put hard won economic stability at risk. No return to short-termism. No return to Tory boom and bust.</p> <p>Now, the Tories used to say a Labour government meant recession and unemployment but now Mr Portillo is pushing a new argument: to accept there is economic stability and growth but then to say this is nothing to do with the government.</p> <p>I ask Mr Portillo and these Tories: if economic stability was so simple to achieve, why did the Tory party give Britain twenty years of stop-go, twenty years of boom and bust? It is Labour that is now the party for stability and growth.</p> <p>If falling unemployment was so simple to achieve, why did their policies give us three million unemployed and why was it never below today's level on any single day in two decades of Conservative government?</p> <p>And if prudence in public finances is so simple, why did the Tories land us with a 50 billion deficit, the worst in our history and double the nation debt?</p> <p>These things didn't just happen. The flawed values of a Tory government made them happen.</p> <p>And amidst their mismanagement when all these mistakes were being made is it nor right that we ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p>When it came to imposing VAT on fuel, is it not right that all of us ask, where was Portillo?</p> <p>I'll tell you. At the treasury, imposing VAT on fuel.</p> <p>When it came to imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises, is it not right that we all ask, where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p>At the treasury, imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises.</p> <p>When it came to imposing the poll tax, is it not right that we all ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p>I'll tell you. A local government minister imposing the poll tax.</p> <p>When it came to the biggest ever cuts in public spending and public services, it is right that we ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p>At the treasury imposing cuts in public services.</p> <p>But our duty to the people of Britain is greater than avoiding Tory boom and bust, or even achieving stability for a year or two.</p> <p>So we will stick with our long-term task - to build for the first time in a generation in Britain a culture that, by entrenching low inflation and long term stability, builds prosperity for homeowners, small businesses and all those in work and in need of work.</p> <p>It is because we understand the difficulties that the weak Euro and strong pound has caused for manufacturers and exporters that we have introduced new tax incentives for manufacturers and exporters, and in every pre-budget report we look carefully at the needs of manufacturers and business.</p> <p>And I say to all who want to avoid a return to economic instability, even when events like rising oil prices and unstable exchange rates challenge us, we will do everything we can with our international partners to promote stability.</p> <p>A 300 per cent rise in oil price in 18 months cannot be justified and I understand the difficulties it is causing for motorists, business and consumers in Britain as it is in every continent of the world.</p> <p>That is why when I was in Prague, we fought for and secured an agreement from all countries, oil producers and oil consumers, that oil production had to increase and that oil prices had to come down.</p> <p>And I will report further on this and other issues in my pre-budget report and in the budget.</p> <p>And just as we have had the strength to make hard long term choices based on Labour values to build stability and growth, so too we have put in place a long term employment policy based on difficult choices, not just about the right to work but the responsibility to work. And we made the hard decisions the Tories would never make - to charge a windfall tax on the utilities, so that some of the richest companies helped the poorest communities.</p> <p>All my life I have seen in the town I grew up in, and in the constituency I serve, unemployment scar the lives of far too many people.</p> <p>In these years the unemployed people I met did not lack talent, did not lack initiative, did not lack the will to work, they lacked a government on their side.</p> <p>That is why in the first days in government David Blunkett, Andrew Smith and I went out and talked to young unemployed men and women about a new deal. I knew then our challenge was to prove to these young people they finally had a government on their side. A government that worked for them.</p> <p>With us today is Lee Ford, aged 23, from Barnsley.</p> <p>Unemployed under the Tories, now in work under Labour.</p> <p>And not just a job, but now with his fianc\u00e9 buying their first home.</p> <p>And we pledge that on behalf of Lee Ford and thousands like him,- what we have built up in the new deal we will never let the Tories destroy.</p> <p>Remember our pledge card, our posters about jobs for young people moving from welfare to work.</p> <p>I can report to this conference that we will next year be able to put on every billboard on the country: 250,000 young people who have moved from welfare to work.</p> <p>And I am now determined that we build not one million jobs but build full employment for our generation.</p> <p>Unemployment in Scotland, Wales, the north and midlands is the lowest for more than twenty years.</p> <p>But we will not rest our efforts as long as there are people and places excluded. With \u00a3500 million for the regional development agencies in every area of Britain, our aim is full employment not just in one region but in every region of the country.</p> <p>But if we are to achieve and sustain full employment, we must together - industry, unions, government, public services - address new world pressures and overcome the old British problems of short-termism and under investment, low productivity, inadequate skills and restrictive practises, wherever they are.</p> <p>Already, to promote enterprise, \u00a31 billion for science. A 10p rate of capital gains tax, a 10p small business tax rate. Employee shares for all, 180 billion for transport.</p> <p>And enterprise open to all. For high unemployment inner cities and regions our pre-budget report will propose new tax cuts allied to spending increases to replace deprivation by enterprise, poverty by employment, neglect by new business.</p> <p>Labour: the party of enterprise.</p> <p>And all the time demonstrating that enterprise is not at the cost of fairness but that enterprise and fairness go together.</p> <p>And because the Tories did not understand that efficiency and justice are not enemies but vital allies in the battle to raise productivity, they wrongly denied workers rights, women's rights, equal rights - and they said a minimum wage would cost a million jobs.</p> <p>Yes, a minimum wage, and yes, a million jobs.</p> <p>Let us tell them - in 3 years with the minimum wage in place we have not destroyed a million jobs, Britain has created one million jobs.</p> <p>And the only jobs the minimum wage cost were those of the Tory MPs who opposed it.</p> <p>And let us pledge here at this conference to work to make sure that these are jobs that are not coming back.</p> <p>And because the evidence now demonstrates that economic efficiency and social justice are not at odds but go hand in hand, I can tell this conference today of a further priority for next year: Steven Byres has asked the low pay commission to report next year on a further rise in the minimum wage as we secure fairness at work.</p> <p>And I give you this pledge as we celebrate 30 years of equal pay legislation, it is now the right time to ensure that in future no woman will have - as in the past -to wait years for their right to equal pay to be realised.</p> <p>And because family friendly employment is good for both employers and employees, there will be new measures for maternity pay and leave, and with new investment, our commitment to high quality accessible and affordable child care, a national childcare strategy for Britain.</p> <p>And never again do we want mothers and fathers refused time off to see their sick children, so the right to time off when a family member is ill. That is what a good family policy is all about.</p> <p>And one of the best family policies of all - the working families tax credit.</p> <p>With us today, Fozia Afzal from Preston, mother of three children. On poverty pay under the Tories. Now, as result of the working families tax credit, \u00a325 a week better off this year alone.</p> <p>The Tories would abolish the working families tax credit. I tell you today we will expand it.</p> <p>Let us pledge for Fozia and one million others we will never let the Tories abolish the credit and push her and one million others back into poverty.</p> <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of men and women over 50 were thrown on the employment scrapheap. Age discrimination is wrong. Today half a million people over 50 are back in work. And I give you this pledge - we will do all we can to end age discrimination in employment and help older workers back to jobs.</p> <p>Now when we came into power we decided that the right thing to do was to put the poorest pensioners first.</p> <p>And in this parliament we are spending \u00a36 billion more. More than the earnings link, most to those who need it most, most to help lift the poorest pensioners out of poverty</p> <p>It was not wrong to put the abolition of pensioner poverty first.</p> <p>But I know that we have more to do, much more to do.</p> <p>We have to do more not just for the poorest but for millions more, all those pensioners who have yet to share enough in the rising prosperity of the country.</p> <p>We will build upon the basic state pension: the basic state pension is now, and will remain, the foundation of everything we do.</p> <p>We will fight against the Tories' plan to opt out, to break up, to destroy the basic pension.</p> <p>And let me tell this conference today that in the pre-budget report, it will be a priority that we do more, with by 2003 a new pension credit that will get extra help not only to the poorest, but to the millions who have lost out in the rising prosperity of the country.</p> <p>And in the meantime as the statement to this conference which Alistair Darling and I put to the economic policy commission last week, says there will be transitional arrangements to the benefit of all pensioners. And we will publish a detailed plan in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Let me explain the new pension credit. Just as the working families tax credit is getting extra money directly to lower and middle income families, so too our new pension credit will reward saving and get cash directly to millions of lower and middle income pensioners.</p> <p>Each year, more cash than either an inflation rise or an earnings link would provide.</p> <p>More money for retired men and women with small works pensions, more money for widows with modest savings, more for men and women who have worked hard and saved all their lives, but who struggle to get by, and whose cause is our cause.</p> <p>Everybody knows that we are having to tackle extremes of pensioner poverty and also rising pensioner inequality that has demanded new thinking:</p> <p>Today in the year 2000, one in 6 pensioner couples retire on more than 4oo a week</p> <p>Soon that figure will become one in five, and in time, one in four and then one in three.</p> <p>It is a progressive principle that we should do more for those who have the greatest needs.</p> <p>So if we are to plan for the future, our priority cannot be that the wealthiest get exactly the same as the neediest.</p> <p>A flat rate increase will not do enough to help pensioners on modest incomes and do nothing to diminish growing inequalities but instead reinforce them.</p> <p>We will build upon the basic state pension.</p> <p>For the poorest pensioners, we are drawing up plans to raise the minimum income guarantee to \u00a390 a week.</p> <p>And our pension credit will ensure that we reward and do not penalise saving and will ensure that all lower and middle income pensioners will receive extra help, get more than the earnings link, year by year.</p> <p>We will spend more and we will spend more fairly.</p> <p>And I want it to be said of us:</p> <p>This was the generation that had the determination and commitment to abolish pensioner poverty in our country. But not only that, by all our measures taken together, we ensured every pensioner shared in the rising prosperity of the nation.</p> <p>I say to this conference, I want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to, but the potential you are born with, I want a Britain where what matters is not the school you went to but the skills you are prepared to acquire.</p> <p>It is a Britain where what is valued is not the connections you inherit but the contribution you are prepared to make.</p> <p>What drives us forward, what inspires us to action is not the Britain we are but the Britain we can become, the causes yet unworn, the potential yet unrealised, the vision yet unfulfilled, the future yet to be born.</p> <p>And because these values challenge us to higher efforts, I tell this conference that in the months ahead, the months up to the coming election we will work every day every week to convince the British people that we deserve a new mandate for a purpose: with already 1.2 million children lifted out of poverty, we can aim higher, we will seek a simple and fundamental mandate to eradicate child poverty in our generation. And give every child best possible start in life.</p> <p>So there is a Tory way - tolerating child poverty - and there is a Labour way - ending it.</p> <p>Already there are hundreds of thousands more students in higher and further education, but we can aim higher. We will seek a mandate to enable a majority of young people to go to college or university. And educational opportunity truly for all.</p> <p>So there is a Tory way - education for an elite, and there is a Labour way - lifelong education for all.</p> <p>With the health service now allocated more resources year on year than ever before, we can aim higher for an NHS true to its central founding ideal - that the best NHS for each of us is the health service free at the point of need for all of us in every part of Britain.</p> <p>So there is a Tory way - the road to privatisation and cuts and there is a Labour way - investing in a national service run in the public sectors by the best public servants as a public service, and Labour internationalism, not Tory isolationism is our goal.</p> <p>That is why yesterday in Prague led by Clare Short and by this party we pressed for and agreed a new plan to wipe out the debts of the 20 poorest countries by December this year. And unlock millions of the world's poor from the chains of unpayable debts. But as long as there is poverty suffering and injustice we must never relax our efforts our cause endures - a virtuous circle of debt relief, poverty reduction and economic development that helps all the worlds poor.</p> <p>The abolition of child poverty.</p> <p>An end to pensioner poverty.</p> <p>Full employment.</p> <p>Educational opportunity truly for all.</p> <p>The best health service for each of us.</p> <p>Great causes worthy of our party's ideals.</p> <p>Great causes today shared, I believe, by the British people.</p> <p>An essential foundation for our country's future.</p> <p>Causes that now challenge indeed call us as a party and as a country to action.</p> <p>Causes for which we will work every day to earn a new mandate from the people of Britain.</p> <p>But let no one be in any doubt - to achieve these goals requires the country to make a choice.</p> <p>It is a choice facing us, which goes beyond decisions on any individual tax or spending programme</p> <p>The choice is this.</p> <p>Is our national priority today to build long term stability and invest in hospitals, schools and strong public services for all?</p> <p>Or is it to put both stability and public services at risk by irresponsible tax promises, which if implemented will cut billions from hospitals, schools and our core services?</p> <p>And there should be a great national debate about this choice.</p> <p>When I became shadow chancellor I said to you then, as I say to you now, that we will never tax just for taxation's sake, that spending decisions will never again be made in isolation from how we pay for them, that all spending and tax decisions must have a sound justification in principle, and that we are prepared to make difficult decisions so that Britain can enjoy stability in our public finances and invest in our public services - the hospitals, schools, public transport and the policing the country needs.</p> <p>But it is because this country needs full employment that with the 10p rate, with cuts in employers and employees national insurance, and with the new working families tax credit, we have targeted tax cuts to encourage and reward work.</p> <p>It is because we want to promote investment and savings and encourage and reward entrepreneurs that we have introduced a new 10p small business tax rate, a new tax cut for innovation research and development and cut capital gains tax for long term investment to as low as 10p.</p> <p>It is because we want a tax system that is fair to working families and tackles poverty that we are introducing a new system of family support, which while giving \u00a315 to every child will give \u00a350 a week for the poorest child.</p> <p>It is because we want to safeguard the environment that we have cut pollution through the climate change levy and cut car tax on the 4m least polluting cars and targeted tax incentives on ultra low sulphur diesel.</p> <p>It is right that we target tax cuts on the countries priorities. And in future budgets we will have targeted tax cuts again.</p> <p>But what we rule out is blanket irresponsible tax promises that cut into the \u00a34 billion extra investment in transport, the \u00a312bn in education and training, the \u00a314bn in health, we will not put the long term future of our public services at risk.</p> <p>For however difficult the decisions we have to make, the country will never forgive us if we lurch from one opportunist tax decision to another and retreat to the old short termist ways of the past</p> <p>We will do nothing that puts this country's stability and public services at risk.</p> <p>So I tell you the country does face a choice. And there should now be a great national debate.</p> <p>Not a debate simply conducted in Westminster or Whitehall; this is a debate, the outcome of which will affect every part of this country, and so it must take place in every part of this country.</p> <p>As we debate this choice - and in the annual pre budget consultation - we will listen and we will also make our case.</p> <p>With the farmers and hauliers - and also with the nurses and health service workers, the teachers and public servants, people working in manufacturing service and exporting sectors, and all those who depend upon our public services...all the hard working families of Britain.</p> <p>This national debate is too important to ever be decided by those who shout the loudest or push the hardest. The British way, the Labour way is that every voice must be heard.</p> <p>Friends, they said in one term we could never simultaneously create stability, one million jobs, abolish 800 hereditary peers, create devolution for Scotland and Wales create a minimum wage for Britain and take a million children out of poverty.</p> <p>But we have.</p> <p>Now they will say we cannot achieve our priorities.</p> <p>Full employment. Abolish child and pensioner poverty. Build world class public services. Prosperity for all.</p> <p>I say we can and we will</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let me say first of all: it is because since 1997 we have put our Labour values and our priorities into action that Britain has greater economic stability, rising investment in health, education and our public services, a national minimum wage for the first time, and the lowest unemployment for a generation. And here in Brighton today, again speaking the language of priorities, I want to discuss with this conference and, from this conference, to discuss with the British people the economic challenges our country still faces. The difficulties we must still surmount, the new world pressures we now have to tackle and the long term choices we as a country have to make on the future of our economy, the future of public spending, the future of pensions and the future of taxes Choices that we must make by heeding the call of principle and hearing the voices of the people as we listen and, as is our ambition and duty, to put ourselves at the service of the hard working people of Britain. And I want the message to go out from Brighton this afternoon that if we, the Labour party, make the case for our values; and if by our service we show the British people we are worthy of trust then we can aim higher, and in our time and generation build a Britain of full employment. One where there is educational opportunity for all. A Britain where we abolish child and pensioner poverty, create a safe environment for all our children and show that the best health service for each of us is a national health service run for all of us. A Britain where, true to our values, not just a few people but everyone has the chance to fulfil their potential and share in national prosperity. In 1997 we said that the future depended upon first building strong and long term foundations for economic stability. We all remember the early 90s. It was Britain's hard working families -the one million who lost jobs in manufacturing, the one million businesses that went under, the million homeowners with negative equity. It was hard working families who paid the price and bore the brunt of economic failure. And by 1997 with the deficit nearly 30 billion, the national debt doubled, debt payments bigger than the schools budget, inflation rising, and the economy on the way back to the old familiar cycle of boom and bust, we resolved to, and under Tony Blair had the strength to, take difficult long term decisions Bank of England independence. Tough controls on public spending. The difficult decision to raise fuel taxes. The decision to pay back debt and cut the costs of debt. Breaking from the chronic and flawed Conservative short-termism and implementing Labour values; planning for the long-term; economic responsibility; building from strong foundations. Determined to protect hard working families from a return to boom and bust. So it is not by accident, but by our actions, that we now have the lowest inflation for over 30 years and around the lowest long term interest rates for 35 years, and a mortgage bill on average \u00a31,000 lower than under Tory interest rates. And it is not by default but by design that unemployment among men is the lowest since 1980, unemployment among women the lowest since 1976, long term unemployment now the lowest since the 1970s, youth unemployment now the lowest since 1975. For the first time in years, unemployment among single parents and the disabled is now falling, as we make the right to work a reality. And I am determined that no one is excluded. And because we have cut the costs of unemployment and debt, it is not by coincidence, but by choice that we are now tackling the long-term neglect of under investment in Britain and spending on health is rising by 7 per cent, education this year by 10 per cent and public investment in Britain is rising this year by 30 per cent, years of Tory underinvestment now replaced by a Labour plan for sustained long term investment. These things did not just happen. The priorities and tough decisions of a Labour government made them happen. And it is precisely because we have taken the time and trouble to build the long term foundation for success, precisely because we have resisted short term lurches in policy, that we can today steer a course of stability at a time of uncertainty in the world economy without putting growth at risk. So we will not return to the old short-termism. There will be no sudden lurches in tax or spending policy. And there will be no irresponsible pre-election sprees or pay demands that put youth jobs or any jobs at risk. No change in our policy on Europe, support in principle for the single currency, in practise the five tests that have to be met. And no relaxing our fiscal rules. We will not put hard won economic stability at risk. No return to short-termism. No return to Tory boom and bust. Now, the Tories used to say a Labour government meant recession and unemployment but now Mr Portillo is pushing a new argument: to accept there is economic stability and growth but then to say this is nothing to do with the government. I ask Mr Portillo and these Tories: if economic stability was so simple to achieve, why did the Tory party give Britain twenty years of stop-go, twenty years of boom and bust? It is Labour that is now the party for stability and growth. If falling unemployment was so simple to achieve, why did their policies give us three million unemployed and why was it never below today's level on any single day in two decades of Conservative government? And if prudence in public finances is so simple, why did the Tories land us with a 50 billion deficit, the worst in our history and double the nation debt? These things didn't just happen. The flawed values of a Tory government made them happen. And amidst their mismanagement when all these mistakes were being made is it nor right that we ask where was Mr Portillo? When it came to imposing VAT on fuel, is it not right that all of us ask, where was Portillo? I'll tell you. At the treasury, imposing VAT on fuel. When it came to imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises, is it not right that we all ask, where was Mr Portillo? At the treasury, imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises. When it came to imposing the poll tax, is it not right that we all ask where was Mr Portillo? I'll tell you. A local government minister imposing the poll tax. When it came to the biggest ever cuts in public spending and public services, it is right that we ask where was Mr Portillo? At the treasury imposing cuts in public services. But our duty to the people of Britain is greater than avoiding Tory boom and bust, or even achieving stability for a year or two. So we will stick with our long-term task - to build for the first time in a generation in Britain a culture that, by entrenching low inflation and long term stability, builds prosperity for homeowners, small businesses and all those in work and in need of work. It is because we understand the difficulties that the weak Euro and strong pound has caused for manufacturers and exporters that we have introduced new tax incentives for manufacturers and exporters, and in every pre-budget report we look carefully at the needs of manufacturers and business. And I say to all who want to avoid a return to economic instability, even when events like rising oil prices and unstable exchange rates challenge us, we will do everything we can with our international partners to promote stability. A 300 per cent rise in oil price in 18 months cannot be justified and I understand the difficulties it is causing for motorists, business and consumers in Britain as it is in every continent of the world. That is why when I was in Prague, we fought for and secured an agreement from all countries, oil producers and oil consumers, that oil production had to increase and that oil prices had to come down. And I will report further on this and other issues in my pre-budget report and in the budget. And just as we have had the strength to make hard long term choices based on Labour values to build stability and growth, so too we have put in place a long term employment policy based on difficult choices, not just about the right to work but the responsibility to work. And we made the hard decisions the Tories would never make - to charge a windfall tax on the utilities, so that some of the richest companies helped the poorest communities. All my life I have seen in the town I grew up in, and in the constituency I serve, unemployment scar the lives of far too many people. In these years the unemployed people I met did not lack talent, did not lack initiative, did not lack the will to work, they lacked a government on their side. That is why in the first days in government David Blunkett, Andrew Smith and I went out and talked to young unemployed men and women about a new deal. I knew then our challenge was to prove to these young people they finally had a government on their side. A government that worked for them. With us today is Lee Ford, aged 23, from Barnsley. Unemployed under the Tories, now in work under Labour. And not just a job, but now with his fianc\u00e9 buying their first home. And we pledge that on behalf of Lee Ford and thousands like him,- what we have built up in the new deal we will never let the Tories destroy. Remember our pledge card, our posters about jobs for young people moving from welfare to work. I can report to this conference that we will next year be able to put on every billboard on the country: 250,000 young people who have moved from welfare to work. And I am now determined that we build not one million jobs but build full employment for our generation. Unemployment in Scotland, Wales, the north and midlands is the lowest for more than twenty years. But we will not rest our efforts as long as there are people and places excluded. With \u00a3500 million for the regional development agencies in every area of Britain, our aim is full employment not just in one region but in every region of the country. But if we are to achieve and sustain full employment, we must together - industry, unions, government, public services - address new world pressures and overcome the old British problems of short-termism and under investment, low productivity, inadequate skills and restrictive practises, wherever they are. Already, to promote enterprise, \u00a31 billion for science. A 10p rate of capital gains tax, a 10p small business tax rate. Employee shares for all, 180 billion for transport. And enterprise open to all. For high unemployment inner cities and regions our pre-budget report will propose new tax cuts allied to spending increases to replace deprivation by enterprise, poverty by employment, neglect by new business. Labour: the party of enterprise. And all the time demonstrating that enterprise is not at the cost of fairness but that enterprise and fairness go together. And because the Tories did not understand that efficiency and justice are not enemies but vital allies in the battle to raise productivity, they wrongly denied workers rights, women's rights, equal rights - and they said a minimum wage would cost a million jobs. Yes, a minimum wage, and yes, a million jobs. Let us tell them - in 3 years with the minimum wage in place we have not destroyed a million jobs, Britain has created one million jobs. And the only jobs the minimum wage cost were those of the Tory MPs who opposed it. And let us pledge here at this conference to work to make sure that these are jobs that are not coming back. And because the evidence now demonstrates that economic efficiency and social justice are not at odds but go hand in hand, I can tell this conference today of a further priority for next year: Steven Byres has asked the low pay commission to report next year on a further rise in the minimum wage as we secure fairness at work. And I give you this pledge as we celebrate 30 years of equal pay legislation, it is now the right time to ensure that in future no woman will have - as in the past -to wait years for their right to equal pay to be realised. And because family friendly employment is good for both employers and employees, there will be new measures for maternity pay and leave, and with new investment, our commitment to high quality accessible and affordable child care, a national childcare strategy for Britain. And never again do we want mothers and fathers refused time off to see their sick children, so the right to time off when a family member is ill. That is what a good family policy is all about. And one of the best family policies of all - the working families tax credit. With us today, Fozia Afzal from Preston, mother of three children. On poverty pay under the Tories. Now, as result of the working families tax credit, \u00a325 a week better off this year alone. The Tories would abolish the working families tax credit. I tell you today we will expand it. Let us pledge for Fozia and one million others we will never let the Tories abolish the credit and push her and one million others back into poverty. In the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of men and women over 50 were thrown on the employment scrapheap. Age discrimination is wrong. Today half a million people over 50 are back in work. And I give you this pledge - we will do all we can to end age discrimination in employment and help older workers back to jobs. Now when we came into power we decided that the right thing to do was to put the poorest pensioners first. And in this parliament we are spending \u00a36 billion more. More than the earnings link, most to those who need it most, most to help lift the poorest pensioners out of poverty It was not wrong to put the abolition of pensioner poverty first. But I know that we have more to do, much more to do. We have to do more not just for the poorest but for millions more, all those pensioners who have yet to share enough in the rising prosperity of the country. We will build upon the basic state pension: the basic state pension is now, and will remain, the foundation of everything we do. We will fight against the Tories' plan to opt out, to break up, to destroy the basic pension. And let me tell this conference today that in the pre-budget report, it will be a priority that we do more, with by 2003 a new pension credit that will get extra help not only to the poorest, but to the millions who have lost out in the rising prosperity of the country. And in the meantime as the statement to this conference which Alistair Darling and I put to the economic policy commission last week, says there will be transitional arrangements to the benefit of all pensioners. And we will publish a detailed plan in the next few weeks. Let me explain the new pension credit. Just as the working families tax credit is getting extra money directly to lower and middle income families, so too our new pension credit will reward saving and get cash directly to millions of lower and middle income pensioners. Each year, more cash than either an inflation rise or an earnings link would provide. More money for retired men and women with small works pensions, more money for widows with modest savings, more for men and women who have worked hard and saved all their lives, but who struggle to get by, and whose cause is our cause. Everybody knows that we are having to tackle extremes of pensioner poverty and also rising pensioner inequality that has demanded new thinking: Today in the year 2000, one in 6 pensioner couples retire on more than 4oo a week Soon that figure will become one in five, and in time, one in four and then one in three. It is a progressive principle that we should do more for those who have the greatest needs. So if we are to plan for the future, our priority cannot be that the wealthiest get exactly the same as the neediest. A flat rate increase will not do enough to help pensioners on modest incomes and do nothing to diminish growing inequalities but instead reinforce them. We will build upon the basic state pension. For the poorest pensioners, we are drawing up plans to raise the minimum income guarantee to \u00a390 a week. And our pension credit will ensure that we reward and do not penalise saving and will ensure that all lower and middle income pensioners will receive extra help, get more than the earnings link, year by year. We will spend more and we will spend more fairly. And I want it to be said of us: This was the generation that had the determination and commitment to abolish pensioner poverty in our country. But not only that, by all our measures taken together, we ensured every pensioner shared in the rising prosperity of the nation. I say to this conference, I want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to, but the potential you are born with, I want a Britain where what matters is not the school you went to but the skills you are prepared to acquire. It is a Britain where what is valued is not the connections you inherit but the contribution you are prepared to make. What drives us forward, what inspires us to action is not the Britain we are but the Britain we can become, the causes yet unworn, the potential yet unrealised, the vision yet unfulfilled, the future yet to be born. And because these values challenge us to higher efforts, I tell this conference that in the months ahead, the months up to the coming election we will work every day every week to convince the British people that we deserve a new mandate for a purpose: with already 1.2 million children lifted out of poverty, we can aim higher, we will seek a simple and fundamental mandate to eradicate child poverty in our generation. And give every child best possible start in life. So there is a Tory way - tolerating child poverty - and there is a Labour way - ending it. Already there are hundreds of thousands more students in higher and further education, but we can aim higher. We will seek a mandate to enable a majority of young people to go to college or university. And educational opportunity truly for all. So there is a Tory way - education for an elite, and there is a Labour way - lifelong education for all. With the health service now allocated more resources year on year than ever before, we can aim higher for an NHS true to its central founding ideal - that the best NHS for each of us is the health service free at the point of need for all of us in every part of Britain. So there is a Tory way - the road to privatisation and cuts and there is a Labour way - investing in a national service run in the public sectors by the best public servants as a public service, and Labour internationalism, not Tory isolationism is our goal. That is why yesterday in Prague led by Clare Short and by this party we pressed for and agreed a new plan to wipe out the debts of the 20 poorest countries by December this year. And unlock millions of the world's poor from the chains of unpayable debts. But as long as there is poverty suffering and injustice we must never relax our efforts our cause endures - a virtuous circle of debt relief, poverty reduction and economic development that helps all the worlds poor. The abolition of child poverty. An end to pensioner poverty. Full employment. Educational opportunity truly for all. The best health service for each of us. Great causes worthy of our party's ideals. Great causes today shared, I believe, by the British people. An essential foundation for our country's future. Causes that now challenge indeed call us as a party and as a country to action. Causes for which we will work every day to earn a new mandate from the people of Britain. But let no one be in any doubt - to achieve these goals requires the country to make a choice. It is a choice facing us, which goes beyond decisions on any individual tax or spending programme The choice is this. Is our national priority today to build long term stability and invest in hospitals, schools and strong public services for all? Or is it to put both stability and public services at risk by irresponsible tax promises, which if implemented will cut billions from hospitals, schools and our core services? And there should be a great national debate about this choice. When I became shadow chancellor I said to you then, as I say to you now, that we will never tax just for taxation's sake, that spending decisions will never again be made in isolation from how we pay for them, that all spending and tax decisions must have a sound justification in principle, and that we are prepared to make difficult decisions so that Britain can enjoy stability in our public finances and invest in our public services - the hospitals, schools, public transport and the policing the country needs. But it is because this country needs full employment that with the 10p rate, with cuts in employers and employees national insurance, and with the new working families tax credit, we have targeted tax cuts to encourage and reward work. It is because we want to promote investment and savings and encourage and reward entrepreneurs that we have introduced a new 10p small business tax rate, a new tax cut for innovation research and development and cut capital gains tax for long term investment to as low as 10p. It is because we want a tax system that is fair to working families and tackles poverty that we are introducing a new system of family support, which while giving \u00a315 to every child will give \u00a350 a week for the poorest child. It is because we want to safeguard the environment that we have cut pollution through the climate change levy and cut car tax on the 4m least polluting cars and targeted tax incentives on ultra low sulphur diesel. It is right that we target tax cuts on the countries priorities. And in future budgets we will have targeted tax cuts again. But what we rule out is blanket irresponsible tax promises that cut into the \u00a34 billion extra investment in transport, the \u00a312bn in education and training, the \u00a314bn in health, we will not put the long term future of our public services at risk. For however difficult the decisions we have to make, the country will never forgive us if we lurch from one opportunist tax decision to another and retreat to the old short termist ways of the past We will do nothing that puts this country's stability and public services at risk. So I tell you the country does face a choice. And there should now be a great national debate. Not a debate simply conducted in Westminster or Whitehall; this is a debate, the outcome of which will affect every part of this country, and so it must take place in every part of this country. As we debate this choice - and in the annual pre budget consultation - we will listen and we will also make our case. With the farmers and hauliers - and also with the nurses and health service workers, the teachers and public servants, people working in manufacturing service and exporting sectors, and all those who depend upon our public services...all the hard working families of Britain. This national debate is too important to ever be decided by those who shout the loudest or push the hardest. The British way, the Labour way is that every voice must be heard. Friends, they said in one term we could never simultaneously create stability, one million jobs, abolish 800 hereditary peers, create devolution for Scotland and Wales create a minimum wage for Britain and take a million children out of poverty. But we have. Now they will say we cannot achieve our priorities. Full employment. Abolish child and pensioner poverty. Build world class public services. Prosperity for all. I say we can and we will",

      "body": "<b>Why is it time for change?</b> <br> London's underground network has its roots in the 1800s: the world's first underground railway - between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street - was opened by the Metropolitan Railway on January 10 1863, with trains hauled by steam engines. Although the existing infrastructure is not quite that old, much of it does date back to the 1920s and it is just not able to cope with today's daily commuters, which number in the hundreds of thousands. The government reckons several billion pounds are needed to update the network to one that can handle that volume of traffic. <p><b> Where will that kind of money come from?</b><br> That's the problem.

      "bodyText": "Why is it time for change? London's underground network has its roots in the 1800s: the world's first underground railway - between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street - was opened by the Metropolitan Railway on January 10 1863, with trains hauled by steam engines. Although the existing infrastructure is not quite that old, much of it does date back to the 1920s and it is just not able to cope with today's daily commuters, which number in the hundreds of thousands. The government reckons several billion pounds are needed to update the network to one that can handle that volume of traffic. Where will that kind of money come from? That's the problem. There are two opposing sides with two opposing plans. The government wants to raise the money through the public-private partnership scheme (PPP): by breaking the network into three parts and handing over its infrastructure and maintenance to private firms on 30-year contracts. However, London mayor Ken Livingstone believes that is the wrong way to do it and favours a scheme of a bond-financed public option instead. How will PPP work in practice? The public sector will remain responsible for operating an integrated passenger service on the whole underground network. It will continue to employ drivers, station staff and must ensure safety is maintained and improved. Once the PPP is signed, the underground will be answerable to the London mayor for the service it delivers.

It is all down to television. </p> <p>Many years ago, when cameras were heavy and unwieldy beasts and the most-covered sports were those which lent themselves easily to coverage from fixed points, swimming was a regular fixture on Grandstand (Those were the days when Grandstand had a virtual monopoly of viewers and sports.) It was not exactly riveting Saturday afternoon entertainment, but on cold, rainy days between the live rugby and the football results, it introduced millions of youngsters to the graceful art of competitive swimming.

There are many who date Britain's enthusiasm for this sport from its only gold medal of the 1952 games - in front of a growing television audience - soon followed by a dramatic Horse of the Year jump-off watched live by millions. </p> <p>I appreciate that there are flaws in this theory. Television can't really take the credit for our swimming medals in 1948, and television exposure of double trap shooting or canoeing has not been conspicuous over the past few years even on Sky Sports 31 or Eurosport. But even a few minutes of mass audience television coverage can have a dramatic impact on the numbers taking up a sport. A trivial example: the number of affiliated volleyball players increased by 500 per cent in the five years following the start of regular coverage of the sport on BBC and Channel 4 in 1984. In the five years before that, it had risen by 70 per cent. </p> <p>Which brings us to the main issue. Professional sport is big business, and commercial television is even bigger. You can't expect the BSkyBs and Granadas of this world to kick football aside to make way for tiddlywinks.

It was clear that some sports would not make an easy transition to the screen: neither orienteering nor archery quite managed to conjure up the drama of a thrilling soccer match. It did, however, give such underexposed activities as tenpin bowling, karate and even tug-of-war a wider audience. And who knows how many karate enthusiasts were spawned by those precious eight minutes? </p> <p>In its first 10 years, there was a vision and a purpose to Channel 4's sports coverage consistent with its statutory duty to innovate and cater for minorities.

All of which leaves the Express newspapers looking more than usually lonely. </p> <p>The residual United News and Media has plenty going for it. The business services division made more than \u00a3200m profit last year and powers on into an internet future. Lord Hollick's \"consistent focus on a select group of core assets with high growth potential\" still sounds single-minded enough. But nobody can quite put the two Expresses or the Daily Star into that high-growth basket. </p> <p>Are they up for sale again, to be traded off like the regional papers of yesteryear? There are rumours, of course, and Hollick bats them away. He sees a synergy between the fruit of the presses and the fruit of the web which shouldn't be relinquished whatever the analysts or the cynics say. Yet even he must occasionally feel that the dream which perished when Granada scooped away his ITV franchises needs replacing: and even he must wonder how Lord Beaverbrook's ancient crusader fits. </p> <p>What would a buyer, if one comes along, get for his money? A peerage, maybe, in the wake of Lords Stevens and Matthews. That seems to go with the Express patch. Two national dailies selling well over 1.5m copies each morning and a Sunday not too far off the million mark. Tolerable profits in the region of \u00a320m. It could be a bargain for \u00a3200m or so - until due diligence turns to history. </p> <p>The Daily Express has plenty of history - 100 often glorious years of it. Great cartoonists such as Osbert Lancaster and Giles. Great editors such as Arthur Christiansen. A great showman of a proprietor called Beaverbrook. After the Second World War, it - and its Sunday sister - dominated mid-market journalism, utterly eclipsing rivals such as the Daily Mail. Look at Beaverbrook's legacy when he died in 1964. The Express that August sold 4,342,378, while the Mail - despite swallowing the News Chronicle - was a fading 2,415,957. No contest. </p> <p>Last month the Mail stood at 2,357,778, but the Express was 1,039,738: a brutal reversal of fortunes made bleaker when you take Sundays into account. In 1964 the Sunday Express had a 4,286,727 sale all to itself: there wasn't a competitor. Last month that figure was 969,009 and the Mail on Sunday had 2,239,062. (And Matthews' old baby, the Star, which once almost touched 1.6m, was on 560,000.) </p> <p>There's no more calamitous story in modern Fleet Street history. The mighty have not merely fallen; it has collapsed in a heap of broken careers and crumpled aspirations. What went wrong? What didn't go wrong? Beaverbrook's son, Max, was a shadow of his father and presided over consistent failure until he sold to Trafalgar House in 1977 and the aforementioned Lord Vic, who knew nothing about newspapers. Enter (in 1985) United Newspapers and David Stevens: enter (in 1996) Hollick's MAI. </p> <p>Through those years of chop and change, editors came and went like managers of Chelsea. There have been 12 since Beaverbrook died, talents as various as Alastair Burnet and Larry Lamb. But none of them made much difference. Nor, crucially, were they given the resources to make a difference. The papers were shrinking year by year. The readership was ageing fast; the grim reaper took his sickle to circulation. The Express was a disaster happening before our eyes. </p> <p>And today? Hollick may modestly claim to have done better than his three predecessors. He's shown ambition to rescue the titles and, in particular, to back an editor who will tackle the fundamentals. For a broken brand on the graveyard shift read a brand remade which looks newish Labour rather than right, young rather than old, to the future rather than a decayed past. That was the point of hiring Rosie Boycott, and that is the point of sticking with her. </p> <p>She has made progress over the past couple of years - but whisper it gently, because there is nothing to shout about. Sales have continued to slip (down 2.66 per cent year on year last month). Readership is down as well. Yet there are a few signs of brighter times. The paper fared a little better through early summer - and (buoyed by 82,000 cut-price copies) has marginally recovered again after a dire July. </p> <p>Decline isn't inexorable any longer. The first young shoots of hope may (just about) be glimpsed in the detail of the readership statistics. More A and AB readers than last year. (The AB move from 24 per cent to 29 per cent is particularly heartening.) Advertisers may soon sit up and take notice if this continues. The age profile is also beginning to shift marginally - in the middle-aged reaches between 35 and 54. </p> <p>No euphoria. The Sunday Express won't easily get over 1m copies again. Only 784,000 domestic copies went at full cover price in August. The Star dipped to 490,000 at full price - though it produced some notably feisty performances earlier in the year. </p> <p>But this is, at least, a mixed picture. Ailing newspapers don't suddenly bounce back after decades of neglect. They're like oil tankers turning in some narrow channel, inching their way to the right direction. Editors and their proprietors have to stop the fall, hold their patience and then push for growth. You can't buy momentum; you have to toil for it. </p> <p>Have Hollick and his shareholders the faith for 'this very long haul? In a smaller group, stripped of its ITV franchises, the newspapers are more visible - and the contrast with the \u00a3370m United is ploughing into new media seems uncomfortably clearer. That's why selling is always an option on the analysts' list. </p> <p>To sell, however, you need a buyer. The Barclay brothers were sniffing around last year, but their appetite, sated by Scotsman haggis, may be less keen now. Jimmy Gold smith is no longer with us. Mohamed Fayed may prefer promotion with Fulham FC to relegation struggles at Blackfriars. Trinity Mirror is often mentioned (as is Gannett, the American owner of Newsquest) but newspaper professionals will always be looking for synergies which aren't apparent here. </p> <p>The Expresses do not need more cost-cutting; even to begin to dent the Mail they need more investment. Any buyer will need deep pockets - and will need to come to terms with the fact that further slippage could simply render this paper bundle non-viable, too small to matter. </p> <p>Problematically, too, the hole in New Labour's electoral balloon raises a few problems for Rosie's way. \"Utterly clueless\"... \"a student rabble\"... trying \"to destroy any reputation for competence it might have earned\". That doesn't sound like Clive and Tony sweeping onwards and upwards: that sounds like continuing headaches. </p> <p>Still, after Granada, Hollick cannot afford the humiliation of a high-profile failure here. His thesis about the net and print is valid enough, if only he can get the right young readers for the Express. Changing tack would only throw away the work of the past two years. There's no doubt who ought to own the Express hereafter, beavering away. Carry on United. But do, in the light of history and experience, hold your breath.</p>",

The Barclay brothers were sniffing around last year, but their appetite, sated by Scotsman haggis, may be less keen now. Jimmy Gold smith is no longer with us. Mohamed Fayed may prefer promotion with Fulham FC to relegation struggles at Blackfriars. Trinity Mirror is often mentioned (as is Gannett, the American owner of Newsquest) but newspaper professionals will always be looking for synergies which aren't apparent here. The Expresses do not need more cost-cutting; even to begin to dent the Mail they need more investment. Any buyer will need deep pockets - and will need to come to terms with the fact that further slippage could simply render this paper bundle non-viable, too small to matter. Problematically, too, the hole in New Labour's electoral balloon raises a few problems for Rosie's way. \"Utterly clueless\"... \"a student rabble\"... trying \"to destroy any reputation for competence it might have earned\". That doesn't sound like Clive and Tony sweeping onwards and upwards: that sounds like continuing headaches. Still, after Granada, Hollick cannot afford the humiliation of a high-profile failure here. His thesis about the net and print is valid enough, if only he can get the right young readers for the Express. Changing tack would only throw away the work of the past two years. There's no doubt who ought to own the Express hereafter, beavering away. Carry on United. But do, in the light of history and experience, hold your breath.",

      "body": "<p>Just as Bobby Ewing emerged from the shower in Dallas, Trevor McDonald should slide behind the ITN newsdesk at 10pm in January and everyone can pretend he was never away. Complete with bongs, And Finally and the Big Ben-style clock face in the opening titles, the programme that set the standard for television news around the world will be back. Like Victoria Principal's bad dream, the news nightmare will be over and the ratings will soar. At least, that's the theory. </p> <p>The author of the idea was ITV director of programmes David Liddiment. His astonishing U-turn averted a damaging court battle with TV regulators, stunned the BBC executives who thought their 10pm news plan was sewn up, and probably even shocked Patricia Hodgson, the unflappable chief executive of the independent television commission, when he proposed the deal. </p> <p>After more than a year of wrangling, and the judicial review due to start this week, no one expected an ITV climbdown. Just as surprising was the ITC's agreement to allow more peak-time advertising slots, which will easily pay for the promised \u00a342m increase in the ITV programme budget. So what happened? </p> <p>Simple. \"The ITC's chief executive changed,\" says Liddiment. It is hardly a secret that ITV found Peter Rogers, Hodgson's predecessor, impossible to deal with. Once he had gone, everything was back in play: Hodgson was the BBC's deal-broker when she was the director of policy and planning under John Birt, and knows a win-win compromise when she sees one. This deal allowed the ITC to claim it had secured the return of News at Ten - when only a few months ago it had thrown in the towel and was ready to accept a 10.30pm bulletin - and gave ITV a more flexible schedule on at least two days a week, with a substantial cash sweetener in the shape of the relaxation of advertising restrictions. Set that against the possibility of losing the judicial review, and Liddiment says it was \"pragmatic\" to take it. </p> <p>\"On balance it's a pretty good deal and it gives us the flexibility we want. It's the right solution,\" he says, before emphasising: \"For now.\" He adds, as if to convince himself: \"I'm pretty happy with it really.\" </p> <p>Pretty happy, pretty good: however much he attempts to paint a gloss on this deal, Liddiment is stung by having to concede the principle of rescheduling the news. He admits it is not the outcome he would have wanted in the \"ideal world\" - he still believes 6.30pm and 11pm are the right times for ITV's news bulletins. </p> <p>Indeed, it was a risky concession to make. He is already under pressure: ITV's audience share is unlikely to meet even the already-lowered self-set targets this year. Liddiment concedes that some aspects of the schedule introduced after the scrapping of News at Ten have not worked. And now he is being forced to tear up half his weekday schedule and start again. </p> <p>So has the news concession served only to undermine his own credibility as director of programmes? \"I don't feel that at all.\" His hands twitch - he's irked. \"I don't feel insecure in my position. And the people I work for haven't given me any indication that I should.\" Liddiment is determined to stamp his authority on this deal. </p> <p>There are still a few loose ends to tie up. For a start, there's the tricky business of what the new programme is going to be called. There was an assumption that it would be simply News at Ten. Or, to fit in with the corporate branding of the network's other programmes, the ITV News at Ten. That's what the viewers, advertisers, ITN journalists (and probably executives) expect. Even Steve Anderson, the controller of news at ITV, is known to favour the revival of the News at Ten brand. But his boss has other ideas. </p> <p>\"It will be called the ITV Nightly News.\" </p> <p>Not News at Ten? </p> <p>\"No.\" </p> <p>Is that your final answer? </p> <p>\"That's my final answer.\" </p> <p>With a bulletin at 10pm only three nights a week, it would make no sense, he argues. \"We would have to have different titles for the news on different days and that's even more confusing. We've had the Nightly News for nearly 18 months, by the end of this year for 20 months and I think it's a perfectly good name for the news.\" </p> <p>It may be that pride is at stake: changing the title of the programme would be a concession too far. But Liddiment will be put under great pressure within ITV to change his mind. After all, News at Ten was still called News at Ten even when football matches or films pushed it back. </p> <p>As for the presenter, we are on surer ground. He wants McDonald to do it; so does McDonald. But the nation's favourite newscaster is in Jamaica, and will not make a final decision until he returns home this week. But it's difficult to imagine that the lure of presenting News at Ten once again, not to mention the prospect of an extra day off a week, will not prove irresistible. </p> <p>For Liddiment, however, these are mere details: his relief is obvious. At last, he can get on with the job of running his channel. And it's more than just a job, it informs his life: there is no one more obsessed about television in general, and ITV in particular, than Liddiment. He has grown up with it, was nurtured by it at Granada, and now he's running it. He makes no excuse for taking his work home with him: \"When I'm at home I watch the channel go out, with the ad breaks, the continuity announcements.\" He takes the network deeply personally: \"If I don't keep an eye on it, I feel I'm not in touch with it.\" He must be a nightmare to live with. </p> <p>The resolution of the news issue has injected Liddiment with renewed vigour - and as another schedule upheaval looms, there is plenty to worry about. With Richard Eyre, the former chief executive who departed for Pearson last year, Liddiment formed a formidable partnership that shook up the tired commercial network, cleared the decks of outdated shows and revitalised others. There were imaginative new commissions, some surprising successes and, with Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, one of the most inspired scheduling moves of the decade. Audience share went up, younger viewers started turning back to ITV (at least tentatively) and the advertisers were ecstatic. </p> <p>But then Eyre left, just at the time when Liddiment felt that the job was only half done. While Liddiment, fiercely loyal, would never say it, you sense that he felt abandoned. </p> <p>The conspicuous failure of ITV to find a replacement for Eyre is a standing joke in the industry. Liddiment is reluctant to be drawn into the debate, but it is clear that he is deeply frustrated at how the network's strategic planning has simply ground to a halt. ITV is being caned in digital homes because it is not on Sky Digital, with no prospect of that changing any time soon. There is no online strategy, and ITV2 is being left to languish when it could be developed as a breeding ground for new network talent. </p> <p>But Liddiment believes that there will be a resolution soon, probably after the remaining issues around consolidation are sorted out. </p> <p>So now he has the chance to regain the upper hand. A two-year plan is emerging: \"We are looking not just at next year but beyond. Clearly getting the balance right between sustainable returnable shows that provide the foundation for the channel and the surprise of events - not just on single evenings but across weeks - is the trick. We should think differently about how we organise our schedule.\" </p> <p>Note the word \"events\". There will be more of these - Premier League football, big drama, Survivor. And the schedule will be more defined: no more Bob Martin one Sunday and a costume drama the next. It just confuses the viewer. \"It's all about ensuring that in certain slots on certain days we deliver a consistent experience. virtually year-round. So if you enjoyed watching Cold Feet on a Sunday night, if we then follow that with Oliver Twist in the same slot, are we missing an opportunity? Would it be better to follow a series of Cold Feet with a series of Metropolis, or Bob Martin, or whatever?\" </p> <p>His task at ITV is to satisfy what he terms the \"coalition of interests\" who come together for the big viewing experiences such as Coronation Street or Millionaire, but who split away into diverse groups that have to be satisfied elsewhere in the schedule. </p> <p> Liddiment says Britain's biggest commercial network is not going to risk its dominant position on whims: ITV is not about cutting-edge television. \"We will take the risks that we think are appropriate to include large numbers of people in the viewing experience. That requires us to innovate, but the notion that somehow ITV is about cutting-edge television is a misunderstanding of what we are about. Was Millionaire cutting-edge TV? No, it wasn't. It was bloody good popular TV. I'll settle for that any day.\" </p> <p>That means not alienating the ITV viewer with something for which they are totally unprepared. Lily Savage's weekly live show, for instance, has bombed on Saturday nights. But instead of axeing it, Liddiment has decided it will return in a post-news, 10.20pm weeknight slot next year, where its natural audience might expect to see it. </p> <p>Yet he insists that keeping an eye on the ratings does not mean he wants to water down ITV's public service commitments. \"I like them, because they are a challenge. I'm really proud of Tonight with Trevor McDonald. It has become Britain's most-watched current affairs programme, and that's no mean achievement.\" Tonight's run has been extended to almost every week of the year. With self-confident mischief, he gleefully clambers up to the moral high ground to taunt the BBC's decision to cut the number of Panorama editions: \"That means more episodes - more, not fewer.\" </p> <p>So, as McDonald flies back to Britain to decide whether he will see out the two or three years to his retirement in style at News at Ten, Liddiment will no longer be woken in the middle of the night by the ITN bongs, or whatever demons have kept him awake over the past year. \"I breathed a sigh of relief last night, and got a great night's sleep because this issue has been finally put to bed.\" </p>",

This way, eventually, they'll be able to undercut on price and offer images of just about anything, all from one place.\"</p> <p>Several well-known Sygma photographers - including Allan Tannenbaum and Andrew Lichtenstein - recently quit over what they describe as unacceptable market domination, poor contracts and representation: \"When Corbis took over [Sygma] there was a feeling they would attempt to restore it to its former glory,\" says Tannenbaum, staff photographer with the agency for almost 20 years. \"Instead they went on a search and destroy mission.\"</p> <p>He argues that far from using its size and influence to negotiate universally higher editorial rates, Corbis may have attempted to drive industry prices down in order to acquire greater market share; and in doing so it adversely affected the interests of photographers and squeezed out smaller, independent agencies. The situation was compounded earlier this month when Hachette Filipacchi Medias of France announced it was to buy the international Katz agency, \"to ward off alternative approaches from US market leaders.\"</p> <p>The defectors from Corbis claim that the big agencies' primary aim is to sell the greatest number of single photos to the greatest number of buyers in the shortest time scale, something not in keeping with the photojournalists' tradition of perfecting picture stories over a longer period of time. </p> <p>\"The photographers and - more importantly - the photographs, are becoming irrelevant. It's about profit and market share,\" one photojournalist \"just hanging on\" with Corbis-Sygma says. \"This is why photographers are taking the risk, getting wired and going it alone.\"</p> <p>\"The industry is in a state of flux,\" says Linda Royles, executive officer of the British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies (BAPLA). \"This is partly attributable to the recent mergers and acquisitions, but also due to the wider effects of digitisation. Many of the UK's [estimated 900] existing picture agencies are having to rethink their approach in light of the new technology, as are those setting up new agencies.\"</p> <p>Recent BAPLA figures illustrate the perceived importance of the web among those operating picture agencies: 70% have an online presence, 30% with fully searchable databases. </p> <p>\"The number of picture agencies launched is increasing, one recent month spawning 14 new outfits,\" says Royles. \"Many are single photographers looking to market their work so they're planning extensive, or at least partial, web presence.\" The photographers' bids for autonomy have been made possible by high street access to increasingly inexpensive technology. </p> <p>\"For as little as the cost of a decent computer, digital camera, scanner and - if you're prepared to do everything yourself - a server and basic software for a searchable database, you can be up and running as a small independent outfit,\" maintains Andrew Wiard, founder of his own <a href=\"http://www.reportphotos.com\">reportphotos.com</a> agency. \"If you've got money to spend, however, there's effectively no upper limit.\"</p> <p>While many freelance photographers use established internet service providers or web companies - Imagenet, for example - specifically geared towards the needs of online picture libraries, others are more creative. Photojournalist Howard Davies launched his own specialist online picture agency, <a href=\"http://www.exileimages.co.uk\">exileimages.co.uk</a>, in July, exploiting little more than a trusty computer and a colleague's web design skills to make available more than 15,000 images. </p> <p>\"I had to commission a database which is unique to the agency, but sales have already covered the [web] design and maintenance costs,\" he says. \"It was a case of utilising this newly available technology to undertake an idea that I'd had for years.\"</p> <p>Davies says the prime motivation for going it alone is control and being able to deal direct with clients. \"I'd become a bit disillusioned with sales from the big agencies, so pulled some stock images out. Now I take 100% rather than negotiate for 50% or 70%.\"</p> <p>Despite the online project he still maintains distribution deals with a couple of big agencies. \"I've not had too rough a deal - they do pay,\" he says but admits fears brought about by the recent string of acquisitions are becoming increasingly visible: \"A young photojournalist approached me to undertake work; when I asked why he'd chosen such a small, specialist agency, he said it would be better not to have to negotiate with the bigger, more traditional outlets - ten years ago that would have been unheard of.\"</p> <p>Such views are echoed by Gary Trotter, founder of Images Sans Frontieres (ISF) - the UK's first reportage agency to launch entirely via the web: \"I've built up a network of about 30 freelances who don't wish to work for major players where the struggle to retain intellectual [property] rights and control becomes harder than obtaining decent shots.\"</p> <p>Despite the apparent success of ISF and Exile, staff at the (decreasing) number of established agencies are sceptical about the long-term viability of freelance projects: \"There's not enough agencies willing to take on photojournalists anyway so it's logical they try to go it alone,\" says Network's Burgess. \"Unfortunately, without a glowing track record, they're likely to disappear - retain their editorial independence certainly, but run the risk of being forced off the market.\"</p> <p>One way round the problem, according to Andrew Wiard, is to identify a unique niche and specialise. \"If you can build up a reputation for covering a particular area - Scotland, for example - then people will come to know you for that and visit your web library before trying other 'one-stop shops'.\" Another answer, he says, is more fundamental. \"It's easy to forget that even with the best technology in the world for presentation and delivery, you have to deliver quality products.

We're developing a fascination with Ms Booth, the supermum par excellence, and the fact that she has agreed to chair such a meeting is a spectacular shot across her husband's bows. With the departures of Betty and Mo, Ms Booth is fast becoming the most prominent woman in British political life. And there are a lot of people around who do not like it.</p> <p>The right wing disapproves of her advocacy of the human rights agenda on the grounds that she stands to reap a handsome income from it. Now the hostility is spilling out on to the left. The cover of the New Statesman's conference issue makes the ambivalence plain: a photomontage of a 50s-style tupperware party has Cherie peeling apples along with Hillary Clinton and Madonna. Placing these powerful, ground-breaking women in the archetypal domestic set-up cuts them down to size. (It is also entirely gratuitous given that the article it illustrates has nothing to do with Cherie.)</p> <p>Hillary has been through this. Women on the political scene attract a disproportionate amount of attention. They can establish a much stronger emotional rapport with the electorate than men - for good or for ill. It's a precarious position, because women can become lightning conductors for the electorate's emotional response to a political party. And deep reserves of sexism are always there to be galvanised: suspicion of clever women and fear of the power-behind-the-throne syndrome. Look how both Laura Bush and Tipper Gore have been reassuring the US electorate that they are not interested in politics.</p> <p>Cherie's position is all the more difficult now because a significant proportion of the population has developed a visceral dislike of her husband. She could quickly find herself becoming additional ammunition. The extent and depth of Tony's unpopularity has taken the political class - commentators and politicians alike - by surprise. The collapse of his opinion poll lead indicates a volatility in politics which seems to be new, and no one is sure what has caused it or how significant it is.</p> <p>The British have never liked left-of-centre leaders; it is rightwing figures such as Thatcher or Churchill on whom we lavish loyal devotion. Despite the political achievements of Labour - the welfare state, the NHS - we ungratefully bundle them out of office at the first opportunity. Partly this is because in class-ridden Britain one of the greatest points of tension has been between middle-class intellectuals/professionals and the aspirant working-class. Disraeli was the first Tory to turn that to the advantage of Conservative politicians more than a century ago.</p> <p>It is one of the curious features of the British class system that those most committed to meritocracy are often the worst snobs. New Labour is falling into this trap. It is perceived as patrician and its populism appears patronising: the Dome is emblematic. It is seen as being dominated by ambitious, London, middle-class, university-educated professionals. A revolt is brewing against a metropolitan elite - spanning politics, the media, the economy - which is running the country. Such a person is not \"one of us\" is the view from outside the south-east. Hence the complaints about \"not listening\" when, a couple of months ago, the charge was that Blair listened to focus groups too much. New Labour's attempts in recent months to correct that trend centred around the need to tell a narrative. But no one wanted to be told a story: it only exacerbated the perception of being patronised - or indeed, lied to.</p> <p>But the new political volatility goes beyond these trends. It can only be explained by a kind of electoral psychology. Emotion has always been a hugely powerful force in politics and has traditionally been much underestimated on the left, with its essentially rationalist world view. But emotion is now centre stage in a therapeutic culture. Politicians are judged less on the quality of their policies, more on personality issues such as trust and credibility. They have happily played along, offering an ersatz intimacy with the electorate. So we get to hear of Blair turning for comfort to Longfellow in the early hours after his son was found drunk. Our political behaviour - voting, protesting, expressing opinions on call-in programmes - is driven by feelings towards a leader. The issue is not what is good for the country, but whether we find this prime minister irritating or likeable. Blair may have pulled off some remarkable political achievements - billions more for health and education, stable economic growth - but to the surprise of political advisers, that is not earning loyalty, let alone affection.</p> <p>The idea of a relationship with a political figure is palpably absurd. It requires constant media manipulation to maintain the fiction. And it is a dangerous kind of politics, Professor Andrew Samuels argues in a book to be published early next year, Politics On the Couch, because one of the commonest patterns in human relationships is the flip from idealisation to denigration. What we build up, we pull down. Blair's popularity could plunge to the depths in proportion to the heights it once scaled. On such a political rollercoaster, the only long term prognosis is bitter disillusionment and cynicism.</p> <p>Blair must in part blame himself for this. He modelled his style of leadership on Margaret Thatcher: heroic purposefulness and dramatic ambition. Both aimed to shift the mindset of a whole nation. (Whereas Thatcher wanted us to stiffen our backbone and stand proud again, Blair wanted to rejuvenate us, turn us into a young country.) They both desired idealisation: it lasted Thatcher three election victories, Blair will be lucky to get more than one. But as Bertolt Brecht has one of his characters comment: \"Unhappy is the country which needs a hero.\"</p> <p>The alternative, Samuels argues, is the \"good enough leader\" in which leadership is \"the study and practice of failure\". The politician is modest and realistic about what he/she can achieve.There is a truth here that we all understand but no one admits: politicians want to appear omnipotent and we want to berate them for not being so. What about Walter Bagehot's political ideal of \"animated moderation\" instead, asks Samuels. Interestingly, Samuels first mentioned these ideas at a fringe meeting at Labour's 1996 conference. New Labour wasn't interested, and went for the heroics. Now the failures of Blair and Brown are viewed not as the inevitable inadequacies of being human and subject to the limited nature of any government's power, but as a betrayal of the fantasy of omnipotence and perfection which we were promised. Such disillusionment can turn vicious, hence the uses to which Cherie could be put as emblematic of this metropolitan elite. Blair had better go for humble this week. <br><br><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This is an important week for all of us. The media are saying we are downbeat. Well I\u0092m not downbeat. The Party\u0092s not downbeat, and neither is the Labour government.</p> <p>And why? Because we\u0092re proud of what this Labour overnment has achieved. It has been delivery, delivery, delivery.</p> <p>On May 1st 1997, we won the election on a radical programme for the environment, transport and local government. As the first step, Tony Blair created a new government department, whose very purpose is a better quality of life for the people of this country. And I\u0092ve got an excellent team of ministers who are putting it into action.</p> <p>Conference, all our policies will count for little if they are not delivered centrally, regionally and locally. That is why it\u0092s so important to bring decision-making closer to the people it affects. We have brought devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And a strategic authority back to London. And we\u0092ve taken steps towards the sort of regional government I have always believed in. All English regions are enjoying greater prosperity. The new Regional Development Agencies have already saved 35,000 jobs.</p> <p>But the Tories want to abolish them. So let\u0092s ask them why they think development agencies are good for Scotland and Wales, but not for the English regions?</p> <p>And let me say this, I\u0092m proud of the work our 10,000 Labour councillors do for their local communities, up and down the country. I want to see the potential of local government liberated.</p> <p>We abolished compulsory competitive tendering.</p> <p>We ended the Tory \u0091capping\u0092 regime.</p> <p>We offered new modern choices in the way councils work, including a directly elected Mayor if local people want it.</p> <p>Of course there are still problems. But local councils are now better funded than ever before. They have new freedoms. And they have more responsibility too.</p> <p>Local government is our partner - no longer 'the enemy within'.</p> <p>That's Labour democracy in action.</p> <p>We\u0092ve given local councils new powers to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their communities. The environment is central to our quality of life. Under the Tories, Britain became known as 'the dirty man of Europe\u0092. We\u0092ve changed all that.</p> <p>I\u0092m proud of what this government has done for the environment, at home and abroad - cleaning up the air we breathe, the water we drink, our seas, our rivers and beaches \u0096 all far better under Labour. Cutting water leaks by a quarter-saving enough to supply London for a year. Protecting our wildlife and the beauty of Britain\u0092s countryside.</p> <p>But the environment doesn\u0092t just begin at the edge of town. It starts when you step out of the door.</p> <p>That\u0092s why we are improving people's homes, neighbourhoods, public services, how we travel, and how we live. Not just as individuals, but as part of a community.</p> <p>As our Constitution says: We believe that \"by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone\". We believe there is such a thing as society. We believe we do have responsibilities to others. That\u0092s why we\u0092ve set up a \u00a31 billion programme to help pensioners keep their homes warm, including brand new central heating.</p> <p>And we\u0092ve done more.</p> <p>We\u0092ve set a new goal to wipe out fuel poverty by the year 2010, because we in the Labour Party do not believe elderly people should die, just because they can\u0092t afford to keep warm. That's Labour social justice in action. And nowadays we have world responsibilities in a global environment, where pollution respects no national boundaries.</p> <p>The greatest environmental threat facing the world today is climate change. Britain led the way at the historic summit in Kyoto. In November I\u0092ll be going to the next round of talks in the Hague. The scientific evidence is clear. If we don\u0092t cut greenhouse gases, then climate change will cause havoc across the world.</p> <p>In Britain, floods in winter, drought in summer, low-lying areas swamped by the sea. And tropical diseases will spread - right here in Britain. In Britain. But in Bangladesh, millions of people face devastation from floods. Africa will be stricken by drought and famine. Small islands submerged forever. Ice caps melting. Already in America we see violent storms and the return of the dust bowls.</p> <p>All this and more will plague our world environment, unless industrialised countries stop poisoning the atmosphere. There\u0092s too much talk about the pain, not the gain, when it comes to our environment. Wasting less energy makes industry more competitive. Properly insulated homes are easier to warm. And cleaner cars cut our fuel bills.</p> <p>I know people want cheaper petrol. We hear them loud and clear. But we also hear people when they say they want cleaner air, a better environment. We hear people say they want money spent on schools and hospitals, not to mention farm subsidies, and relief for road haulage.</p> <p>Yes, of course there are real problems. Yes, of course we will listen. Yes, of course we do act. But we will deal with those problems through proper democratic representations in the budget process.</p> <p>And one thing is clear.</p> <p>No government, no prime minister, no chancellor can simply chop and change taxes by the month, Or renegotiate them at a refinery gate, under threat of 60 days notice. That is no way to make decisions in a democratic country.</p> <p>Some of the press might think so. But they sang a different tune when it came to the French blockades, and one or two legal industrial disputes I could mention. So you have to find the right balance in government (and as a nation) which is never easy. But who said politics was easy?</p> <p>I knew when I took this job, that it would take time to transform our transport, after decades of stop-go funding.</p> <p>As a former seafarer, I\u0092m proud that - while the Tories devastated our merchant fleet \u0096 now, under Labour, ships are coming back to the British Red Ensign flag - over a million tonnes so far.</p> <p>Across transport, we\u0092re providing new resources, new powers, new means of delivery \u0096 perhaps most crucially the Strategic Rail Authority, which will ensure private rail firms act in the public interest.</p> <p>The Policy Commission document is full of good ideas on transport and the whole range of issues, on which I\u0092m sure we\u0092ll all agree. And let me congratulate all those involved in the difficult and detailed work, which will give us a new framework for future policy.</p> <p>But let me deal with a point of disagreement on train protection.</p> <p>Let's be clear about this. On the road, on rail, in the air and at sea, safety always comes first in my priorities. One of the main reasons I came into politics was to make shipping safer. Earlier this year I set out a strategy to reduce deaths on the roads by 40%, and by 50% for children.</p> <p>And remember how the Tories ignored \u0096 for 8 years \u0096 pleas for a public inquiry after the sinking of the Thames boat the Marchioness, where 51 people died, causing so much suffering for their families? We restored some form of justice to those grieving families, and not before time.</p> <p>I wasted no time in calling public inquiries after the Southall and Paddington tragedies. After talking to the relatives and walking amongst the wreckage, I was determined they must mark a watershed in rail safety.</p> <p>That\u0092s why I appointed Lord Cullen \u0096 the man who transformed safety in the North Sea \u0096 to head a public inquiry covering the whole safety regime on the railways. We have taken over 30 separate measures to improve rail safety since coming to office, ranging from better driver training to safer rail carriages.</p> <p>Already the number of trains passing red signals has been cut by a quarter in one year.</p> <p>We took advice from Britain's most respected engineer, Sir David Davies. His recommendation was clear. He said install Automatic Train Protection on faster lines, and we\u0092re doing it. But install the Train Protection Warning System across the whole network first, and we\u0092re doing that too.</p> <p>Why? Because this can save more lives than alternative systems which would take ten years to install. That is the sort of difficult decision we face - save lives now or wait for better technology in ten years.</p> <p>Nevertheless I have asked Lord Cullen, together with the chairman of the Southall inquiry, to make specific recommendations on this very question. His public inquiry on this point started last week. But everyone \u0096 relatives, trade unions, lawyers and safety experts - has urged me not to do anything that would pre-empt Lord Cullen\u0092s inquiry. I agree.</p> <p>And I recommend to conference that you do the same and reject the alternative wording that would pre-empt Lord Cullen \u0096 as the National Policy Forum agreed at Exeter in July.</p> <p>Conference must understand that I have given my word that I stand ready to implement whatever is required as a result of Lord Cullen\u0092s proposals, and I will stand by that.</p> <p>But for most people, it\u0092s the daily business of travelling by road and rail that dominates. Our ten-year plan represents the biggest long-term investment in transport this country has ever seen. 180 billion pounds over ten years. In the next three years alone, public investment on transport will rise from \u00a35 billion to a record \u00a39 billion a year.</p> <p>But this is a joint effort between the public and private sectors. In public and private partnership. So, in railways, we\u0092ll see more invested in the next ten years than we saw in the last one hundred years. New track. New trains. New signalling. New services. New stations.</p> <p>More priority for buses in towns and more bus links in rural areas. More \u0091supertrams\u0092 and safer walking and cycling.</p> <p>On our roads, we will tackle the major bottlenecks. We can get more capacity out of the existing road network, but we recognise you can\u0092t simply build your way of congestion.</p> <p>It\u0092s all about balance. Through this and better public transport, we will actually reduce congestion below current levels. And the ten-year plan is not just about figures. It will roll out into real improvements in the years to come. Here are a few examples.</p> <p>This year, the SRA has negotiated the first new rail franchises with more guaranteed investment and better services. By 2001, we\u0092ll start 12 major road improvements. By 2002 half the country\u0092s rail fleet will be new or refurbished, the first phase of the West Coast Mainline will reduce journey times between London and Manchester or Preston to under two hours and the first phase of the channel tunnel rail link will be built and the second phase to St Pancras will begin.</p> <p>In 2003 we will finish 100 safety and congestion improvements to our trunk roads and complete the Nottingham Express transit. In 2004 two hundred more motorway cameras to help traffic flow and reduce congestion. In 2006 all three new Manchester Metrolink lines will be completed. In 2007 widening on motorway bottlenecks will begin. By 2008 we\u0092ve agreed with manufacturers that new cars will do 25% more miles to the gallon. By 2009 the East Coast mainline railway will be upgraded. In 2010 we will see 50% more passengers on trains and 80% more on rail freight.</p> <p>And the benefits will affect every corner of the country.</p> <p>That\u0092s integration in action. Not only better transport links, but integrated thinking that will make life better in our towns and cities.</p> <p>Many of you know from bitter experience, the Tories ripped the heart out of our cities. As the Rogers report, that I commissioned makes clear, this calls for nothing less than an 'urban renaissance'. As he said: \u0091 Cities make citizens and citizens make cities\u0092. How true. That means not just better housing, planning and design, but better jobs, transport, schools, policing and health. Because the quality of life is not contradictory to economic growth; it\u0092s critical to economic growth. If the local school is failing, or the streets are dirty and dangerous, people start to move away. Businesses and investment follow, leaving behind a cycle of poverty and rising crime.</p> <p>We need to think creatively.</p> <p>For example, our universities should not be ivory towers. They should be a resource for their communities, helping to bring skills, jobs and growth. We need social investment. We have released over \u00a35bn of capital receipts to renovate 2 million homes. We need imagination. We are preparing a new Starter Home Scheme to help key workers like nurses and teachers set up home in high cost areas.</p> <p>And for our coalfield communities, destroyed by the prejudice of theThatcher regime, we produced a \u00a3350m package, bringing jobs and hope where the Tories brought the dole and despair.</p> <p>That\u0092s a matter of honour, that we have delivered.</p> <p>And remember this, the greater the exodus from the towns, the greater the strain on the countryside. The Tories want to drive a wedge between the town and the country. We want a living, working countryside.</p> <p>I see the Countryside Alliance are outside to celebrate our hundredth birthday. They are very kind - they came to celebrate my 30th year as an MP for Hull. But I ask the protesters outside the Hall, when the Tories were shutting 2,000 post offices, selling off 10,000 council houses, ending bus services and closing village schools \u0096 why weren't you outside Tory Party conferences protesting for those 18 years?</p> <p>But I tell you this, every time I see the Countryside Alliance I redouble my determination to vote in the House of Commons to abolish fox hunting forever.</p> <p>And I reject claims that people who oppose fox hunting are out of sympathy with rural Britain. From the day my school took me as a boy to the Lake District, I have always loved the countryside. It was Labour, just over 50 years ago, that gave Britain its first national parks. Last year, I announced two new national parks in the South Downs and the New Forest - a great gift to the British people \u0096 especially on our 100th birthday. And we I\u0092ve introduced legislation to extend the right to roam in open countryside.</p> <p>Some of the Tories in the House of Lords don't like it. They think they know all about the open countryside. After all, they own most of it.</p> <p>But I say to members of the House of Lords, this is Government policy and we fully intend to implement it.</p> <p>We believe our natural heritage is not just for the privileged few, but for the whole of our people to respect and enjoy. That's Labour freedom in action.</p> <p>Now Conference, earlier I talked about transport safety. But a life lost in a factory accident is just as important as a life lost in a traffic accident. Labour\u0092s Health and Safety at Work Act has helped reduce accidents dramatically since the 1970s. But in some industries, like construction, lives are being lost through sheer bad working practices, and a degree of indifference.</p> <p>And I\u0092ve warned the construction industry this is totally unacceptable.</p> <p>So we are shaking up health and safety. Company directors must take responsibility for safety. Penalties will be tougher. And we\u0092ve begun consultation on the offence of corporate killing.</p> <p>Company directors whose negligence costs lives must not be allowed to hide behind workers and get away 'scot free'. So, once Lord Cullen has reported on rail, we\u0092ll take decisive action to strengthen our safety law, in transport and in the workplace.</p> <p>For the first time in 25 years, we will bring forward a new wide-ranging Act of Parliament to make Britain a safer place to travel and a safer place to work in. That's Labour caring for our people.</p> <p>So Conference, we have already begun our task: to clean up Britain. To bring new life to our cities and countryside. And to give Britain a transport system we can once again be proud of.</p> <p>We have laid the foundations. But there is still a lot to do.</p> <p>Our Policy Commission has proposed an exciting programme of work.</p> <p>Now we need to get out campaigning to win that second term, to put those ideas into practice. And if you want a good example of integrated thinking - here\u0092s one:</p> <p>From next April, we\u0092ll introduce half price concessionary bus fares for all pensioners, wherever they live, England or Wales, under Tory, Liberal or Labour councils.</p> <p>And whereas some councils charge as much as \u00a340 for the pass we will insist the pass is provided free of charge. In a few weeks we\u0092ll amend our legislation to extend this scheme to disabled people as well for the first time.</p> <p>That's Labour social justice in action. That\u0092s Labour helping the environment. That's Labour backing public transport.</p> <p>But we don\u0092t get those sort of benefits without taking the hard decisions which make it possible. With Tony Blair as Prime Minister, committed to long term decisions, and Gordon Brown as Chancellor sorting out the public finances and stabilising the economy, that\u0092s how we\u0092ve been able to plan for this major improvement in public services. And I would like to record my appreciation and support for what they have achieved.</p> <p>Too often in the past, politicians have dodged long-term responsibility for the sake of short-term expediency. I\u0092ve always been a bit of a conviction politician. I will always do what I believe is right. Sometimes I get attacked for it.</p> <p>So be it.</p> <p>Because when I decide policies, I decide them not for tomorrow's headlines, but for tomorrow's children.</p> <p>And that's the way I\u0092ll always be.</p> <p>And that\u0092s how this Labour government will be.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is an important week for all of us. The media are saying we are downbeat. Well I\u0092m not downbeat. The Party\u0092s not downbeat, and neither is the Labour government. And why? Because we\u0092re proud of what this Labour overnment has achieved. It has been delivery, delivery, delivery. On May 1st 1997, we won the election on a radical programme for the environment, transport and local government. As the first step, Tony Blair created a new government department, whose very purpose is a better quality of life for the people of this country. And I\u0092ve got an excellent team of ministers who are putting it into action. Conference, all our policies will count for little if they are not delivered centrally, regionally and locally. That is why it\u0092s so important to bring decision-making closer to the people it affects. We have brought devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And a strategic authority back to London. And we\u0092ve taken steps towards the sort of regional government I have always believed in. All English regions are enjoying greater prosperity. The new Regional Development Agencies have already saved 35,000 jobs. But the Tories want to abolish them. So let\u0092s ask them why they think development agencies are good for Scotland and Wales, but not for the English regions? And let me say this, I\u0092m proud of the work our 10,000 Labour councillors do for their local communities, up and down the country. I want to see the potential of local government liberated. We abolished compulsory competitive tendering. We ended the Tory \u0091capping\u0092 regime. We offered new modern choices in the way councils work, including a directly elected Mayor if local people want it. Of course there are still problems. But local councils are now better funded than ever before. They have new freedoms. And they have more responsibility too. Local government is our partner - no longer 'the enemy within'. That's Labour democracy in action. We\u0092ve given local councils new powers to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their communities. The environment is central to our quality of life. Under the Tories, Britain became known as 'the dirty man of Europe\u0092. We\u0092ve changed all that. I\u0092m proud of what this government has done for the environment, at home and abroad - cleaning up the air we breathe, the water we drink, our seas, our rivers and beaches \u0096 all far better under Labour. Cutting water leaks by a quarter-saving enough to supply London for a year. Protecting our wildlife and the beauty of Britain\u0092s countryside. But the environment doesn\u0092t just begin at the edge of town. It starts when you step out of the door. That\u0092s why we are improving people's homes, neighbourhoods, public services, how we travel, and how we live. Not just as individuals, but as part of a community. As our Constitution says: We believe that \"by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone\". We believe there is such a thing as society. We believe we do have responsibilities to others. That\u0092s why we\u0092ve set up a \u00a31 billion programme to help pensioners keep their homes warm, including brand new central heating. And we\u0092ve done more. We\u0092ve set a new goal to wipe out fuel poverty by the year 2010, because we in the Labour Party do not believe elderly people should die, just because they can\u0092t afford to keep warm. That's Labour social justice in action. And nowadays we have world responsibilities in a global environment, where pollution respects no national boundaries. The greatest environmental threat facing the world today is climate change. Britain led the way at the historic summit in Kyoto. In November I\u0092ll be going to the next round of talks in the Hague. The scientific evidence is clear. If we don\u0092t cut greenhouse gases, then climate change will cause havoc across the world. In Britain, floods in winter, drought in summer, low-lying areas swamped by the sea. And tropical diseases will spread - right here in Britain. In Britain. But in Bangladesh, millions of people face devastation from floods. Africa will be stricken by drought and famine. Small islands submerged forever. Ice caps melting. Already in America we see violent storms and the return of the dust bowls. All this and more will plague our world environment, unless industrialised countries stop poisoning the atmosphere. There\u0092s too much talk about the pain, not the gain, when it comes to our environment. Wasting less energy makes industry more competitive. Properly insulated homes are easier to warm. And cleaner cars cut our fuel bills. I know people want cheaper petrol. We hear them loud and clear. But we also hear people when they say they want cleaner air, a better environment. We hear people say they want money spent on schools and hospitals, not to mention farm subsidies, and relief for road haulage. Yes, of course there are real problems. Yes, of course we will listen. Yes, of course we do act. But we will deal with those problems through proper democratic representations in the budget process. And one thing is clear. No government, no prime minister, no chancellor can simply chop and change taxes by the month, Or renegotiate them at a refinery gate, under threat of 60 days notice. That is no way to make decisions in a democratic country. Some of the press might think so. But they sang a different tune when it came to the French blockades, and one or two legal industrial disputes I could mention. So you have to find the right balance in government (and as a nation) which is never easy. But who said politics was easy? I knew when I took this job, that it would take time to transform our transport, after decades of stop-go funding. As a former seafarer, I\u0092m proud that - while the Tories devastated our merchant fleet \u0096 now, under Labour, ships are coming back to the British Red Ensign flag - over a million tonnes so far. Across transport, we\u0092re providing new resources, new powers, new means of delivery \u0096 perhaps most crucially the Strategic Rail Authority, which will ensure private rail firms act in the public interest. The Policy Commission document is full of good ideas on transport and the whole range of issues, on which I\u0092m sure we\u0092ll all agree. And let me congratulate all those involved in the difficult and detailed work, which will give us a new framework for future policy. But let me deal with a point of disagreement on train protection. Let's be clear about this. On the road, on rail, in the air and at sea, safety always comes first in my priorities. One of the main reasons I came into politics was to make shipping safer. Earlier this year I set out a strategy to reduce deaths on the roads by 40%, and by 50% for children. And remember how the Tories ignored \u0096 for 8 years \u0096 pleas for a public inquiry after the sinking of the Thames boat the Marchioness, where 51 people died, causing so much suffering for their families? We restored some form of justice to those grieving families, and not before time. I wasted no time in calling public inquiries after the Southall and Paddington tragedies. After talking to the relatives and walking amongst the wreckage, I was determined they must mark a watershed in rail safety. That\u0092s why I appointed Lord Cullen \u0096 the man who transformed safety in the North Sea \u0096 to head a public inquiry covering the whole safety regime on the railways. We have taken over 30 separate measures to improve rail safety since coming to office, ranging from better driver training to safer rail carriages. Already the number of trains passing red signals has been cut by a quarter in one year. We took advice from Britain's most respected engineer, Sir David Davies. His recommendation was clear. He said install Automatic Train Protection on faster lines, and we\u0092re doing it. But install the Train Protection Warning System across the whole network first, and we\u0092re doing that too. Why? Because this can save more lives than alternative systems which would take ten years to install. That is the sort of difficult decision we face - save lives now or wait for better technology in ten years. Nevertheless I have asked Lord Cullen, together with the chairman of the Southall inquiry, to make specific recommendations on this very question. His public inquiry on this point started last week. But everyone \u0096 relatives, trade unions, lawyers and safety experts - has urged me not to do anything that would pre-empt Lord Cullen\u0092s inquiry. I agree. And I recommend to conference that you do the same and reject the alternative wording that would pre-empt Lord Cullen \u0096 as the National Policy Forum agreed at Exeter in July. Conference must understand that I have given my word that I stand ready to implement whatever is required as a result of Lord Cullen\u0092s proposals, and I will stand by that. But for most people, it\u0092s the daily business of travelling by road and rail that dominates. Our ten-year plan represents the biggest long-term investment in transport this country has ever seen. 180 billion pounds over ten years. In the next three years alone, public investment on transport will rise from \u00a35 billion to a record \u00a39 billion a year. But this is a joint effort between the public and private sectors. In public and private partnership. So, in railways, we\u0092ll see more invested in the next ten years than we saw in the last one hundred years. New track. New trains. New signalling. New services. New stations. More priority for buses in towns and more bus links in rural areas. More \u0091supertrams\u0092 and safer walking and cycling. On our roads, we will tackle the major bottlenecks. We can get more capacity out of the existing road network, but we recognise you can\u0092t simply build your way of congestion. It\u0092s all about balance. Through this and better public transport, we will actually reduce congestion below current levels. And the ten-year plan is not just about figures. It will roll out into real improvements in the years to come. Here are a few examples. This year, the SRA has negotiated the first new rail franchises with more guaranteed investment and better services. By 2001, we\u0092ll start 12 major road improvements. By 2002 half the country\u0092s rail fleet will be new or refurbished, the first phase of the West Coast Mainline will reduce journey times between London and Manchester or Preston to under two hours and the first phase of the channel tunnel rail link will be built and the second phase to St Pancras will begin. In 2003 we will finish 100 safety and congestion improvements to our trunk roads and complete the Nottingham Express transit. In 2004 two hundred more motorway cameras to help traffic flow and reduce congestion. In 2006 all three new Manchester Metrolink lines will be completed. In 2007 widening on motorway bottlenecks will begin. By 2008 we\u0092ve agreed with manufacturers that new cars will do 25% more miles to the gallon. By 2009 the East Coast mainline railway will be upgraded. In 2010 we will see 50% more passengers on trains and 80% more on rail freight. And the benefits will affect every corner of the country. That\u0092s integration in action. Not only better transport links, but integrated thinking that will make life better in our towns and cities. Many of you know from bitter experience, the Tories ripped the heart out of our cities. As the Rogers report, that I commissioned makes clear, this calls for nothing less than an 'urban renaissance'. As he said: \u0091 Cities make citizens and citizens make cities\u0092. How true. That means not just better housing, planning and design, but better jobs, transport, schools, policing and health. Because the quality of life is not contradictory to economic growth; it\u0092s critical to economic growth. If the local school is failing, or the streets are dirty and dangerous, people start to move away. Businesses and investment follow, leaving behind a cycle of poverty and rising crime. We need to think creatively. For example, our universities should not be ivory towers. They should be a resource for their communities, helping to bring skills, jobs and growth. We need social investment. We have released over \u00a35bn of capital receipts to renovate 2 million homes. We need imagination. We are preparing a new Starter Home Scheme to help key workers like nurses and teachers set up home in high cost areas. And for our coalfield communities, destroyed by the prejudice of theThatcher regime, we produced a \u00a3350m package, bringing jobs and hope where the Tories brought the dole and despair. That\u0092s a matter of honour, that we have delivered. And remember this, the greater the exodus from the towns, the greater the strain on the countryside.

      "body": "<p> As in the rest of the world, World Bank, IMF and donor policy advice and lending in transition countries has two potentially contradictory directions in relation to social services. On the one hand, investment in social services is upheld as essential for building and maintaining a healthy, educated population. On the other, concerns about fiscal deficits lead to strong pressure to reduce public spending . While social services expenditure fell most severely immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in many countries the decline continues. In Kyrgyzstan, for example, public expenditure on health and education has fallen approximately 50 per cent in real terms since 1993. Uzbekistan, which has not substantially reformed its economy, is the only Central Asian country where education expenditure has not declined to a third of its pre-independence level. </p> <p>In many transition countries, user charges - fees for medical treatment or school attendance -have been introduced. This is part of an explicit strategy to reduce public expenditure on social services and to increase the contribution of families, communities and the private sector. In addition, parents usually have to provide children's books and stationery, and often to contribute to school maintenance, and in many countries, patients must provide their own drugs. Official exemptions for poor families and for certain vulnerable groups - seen by donors as guaranteeing poor people access to key social services - are often poorly designed and not implemented in practice, as service staff demand additional or informal payments, administrators find exemptions too bureaucratic and time-consuming, or people are ashamed to claim their exemptions. Significant increases in user charges for utilities such as gas, electricity and water are limiting households' ability to pay for essential services for children. </p> <p>In Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia, privatisation and decentralisation has left some public services such as pre-schools in the hands of local authorities. With no budget to run pre-schools and a limited tax base, coupled with the mandate to sell or \"privatise\" assets, many pre-schools - formerly community assets - have been sold to private investors for housing, commercial use or other development. In Kyrgyzstan by 1996, there were approximately one third the number of pre-schools there had been in 1991. </p> <p><strong>Effects of these policies:</strong> </p> <p>Where user fees have been introduced as part of reform packages, such as in Africa and Latin America, school and clinic/ hospital attendance has fallen while some health problems have spread: \u00b7 in Mongolia, where extensive school subsidies were abolished, fees introduced, and the demand for children's labour as herders increased, school attendance declined 25 per cent from 1990-1994. There are signs of literacy rates decreasing among young people. \u00b7 school infrastructure has deteriorated considerably over the last 10 years. Lack of heating is a major reason for children's non-attendance in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Armenia and Georgia. \u00b7 The quality of education is declining in many countries, as budgets cannot stretch to educational materials and salaries, which motivate teachers. Many parents feel their children are receiving a worse education than they themselves received. \u00b7 in Kyrgyzstan, the incidence of tuberculosis - a disease strongly related to poverty - now affects over 120 per 100,000 of the population. \u00b7 49 per cent of people surveyed in Kyrygzstan in 1997 said they would not seek treatment when sick because they expected the costs to be too high. </p> <p><strong>Recommendations</strong> </p> <p>1. User fees should only be charged for non-essential health services and for tertiary education.

      "bodyText": "As in the rest of the world, World Bank, IMF and donor policy advice and lending in transition countries has two potentially contradictory directions in relation to social services. On the one hand, investment in social services is upheld as essential for building and maintaining a healthy, educated population. On the other, concerns about fiscal deficits lead to strong pressure to reduce public spending . While social services expenditure fell most severely immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in many countries the decline continues. In Kyrgyzstan, for example, public expenditure on health and education has fallen approximately 50 per cent in real terms since 1993. Uzbekistan, which has not substantially reformed its economy, is the only Central Asian country where education expenditure has not declined to a third of its pre-independence level. In many transition countries, user charges - fees for medical treatment or school attendance -have been introduced. This is part of an explicit strategy to reduce public expenditure on social services and to increase the contribution of families, communities and the private sector. In addition, parents usually have to provide children's books and stationery, and often to contribute to school maintenance, and in many countries, patients must provide their own drugs. Official exemptions for poor families and for certain vulnerable groups - seen by donors as guaranteeing poor people access to key social services - are often poorly designed and not implemented in practice, as service staff demand additional or informal payments, administrators find exemptions too bureaucratic and time-consuming, or people are ashamed to claim their exemptions. Significant increases in user charges for utilities such as gas, electricity and water are limiting households' ability to pay for essential services for children. In Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia, privatisation and decentralisation has left some public services such as pre-schools in the hands of local authorities. With no budget to run pre-schools and a limited tax base, coupled with the mandate to sell or \"privatise\" assets, many pre-schools - formerly community assets - have been sold to private investors for housing, commercial use or other development. In Kyrgyzstan by 1996, there were approximately one third the number of pre-schools there had been in 1991. Effects of these policies: Where user fees have been introduced as part of reform packages, such as in Africa and Latin America, school and clinic/ hospital attendance has fallen while some health problems have spread: \u00b7 in Mongolia, where extensive school subsidies were abolished, fees introduced, and the demand for children's labour as herders increased, school attendance declined 25 per cent from 1990-1994. There are signs of literacy rates decreasing among young people. \u00b7 school infrastructure has deteriorated considerably over the last 10 years. Lack of heating is a major reason for children's non-attendance in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Armenia and Georgia. \u00b7 The quality of education is declining in many countries, as budgets cannot stretch to educational materials and salaries, which motivate teachers. Many parents feel their children are receiving a worse education than they themselves received. \u00b7 in Kyrgyzstan, the incidence of tuberculosis - a disease strongly related to poverty - now affects over 120 per 100,000 of the population. \u00b7 49 per cent of people surveyed in Kyrygzstan in 1997 said they would not seek treatment when sick because they expected the costs to be too high. Recommendations 1. User fees should only be charged for non-essential health services and for tertiary education. Failing to ensure all children's access to a good quality education and to guarantee basic health services to all is mortgaging the welfare of present and future generations, and jeopardising countries' economic development. User fees in poor countries have been shown to be a tragic experiment with poor people's lives . With exemption systems largely ineffective, it is by no means clear that formal charges will replace informal charges, and it is extraordinary that donors and international financial institutions have not learnt from this experience. The World Bank has signed up to the Dakar Framework for Action on Education for All which aims to ensure free primary education for all children - this is clearly incompatible with user fees. Through processes such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and the Comprehensive Development Framework, the Bank can play a key role in urging governments and donors to implement this commitment to children in transition countries. 2. Short to medium term donor support for free social services. If countries cannot finance free essential health and education services in the short to medium term, donor assistance should focus on budgetary support. This may well mean greater coherence and rationalisation of technical assistance, rather than each donor providing their own consultants on similar issues. Reform policies need to be widely discussed rather than pushed through without adequate public debate. 3. Debt relief should be explored. Many transition countries e.g. Kyrgyzstan are highly indebted and poor. However, they have mostly been ignored by debt relief campaigns. Debt relief should urgently be explored as a mechanism for social services financing in poor transition economies.

      "body": "<p>What do you do after starring in one of the most successful British films of all time? If you are Ewan McGregor, you grab your light sabre and sign a long-term deal for Star Wars. If you are Bobby Carlyle you take a turn as a James Bond villain. And Ewen Bremner? If you're the man who as Spud mainlined into the Trainspotting audience's funny bone, you take roles in a number of low-budget, little-seen flops, before opting for art-house kudos with American wunderkind Harmony Korine, and mainstream glamour with the forthcoming blockbuster Pearl Harbor. </p> <p>Unusually for a film star, Bremner is better looking in real life than on screen. Still in his 20s, fresh-faced, with hair closer to strawberry blond than ginger, his features are drawn in bold, angular lines. Bremner made his film debut as a dim-witted schoolboy in the comedy Heavenly Pursuits, 10 years before Trainspotting. With a resum\u00e9 ranging from Shakespeare to Judge Dredd, he has also produced a string of unforgettable cameo appearances, most recently in Snatch, when Vinnie Jones shuts the car window on his head and drives off. </p> <p>Bremner first met writer-director Harmony Korine several years ago. Korine had shocked public opinion with Kids, a portrait of underage sex and drug use which he wrote in his teens. Bremner had been \"blown away\" by Korine's directorial debut Gummo, a low-budget drama about white-trash Ohio kids who kill cats and sell the corpses to a supermarket. </p> <p>\"I'm making a movie that's going to be like nothing else,\" was Korine's modest pitch for Julien Donkey-Boy, the \"plot\" of which was inspired by his Uncle Eddie, who had been in a mental institution for years. The finished script was simply a description of a series of scenes. The actors would mix with members of the public, improvising their lines and being recorded on tiny \"spy cameras\". </p> <p>Korine had been impressed by Bremner's performance as Archie, the inarticulate, twitchy Scots headbanger in Naked, and he suggested Bremner play the supporting role of Julien's brother, an aspiring wrestler and misfit in a film entirely populated by misfits. \"I said, 'I want to play Julien,'\" Bremner recalls, \"and I think he was delighted that I had the audacity to say that I wanted to do it.\" </p> <p>Initially, however, Bremner had grave reservations about his ability to pull off the American accent that would be required. \"I believed that I would be capable of it, but I'm not an actor who is gifted with that aptitude for accents. It was a real struggle for me to lose my Scottish accent. That was the hardest part, it wasn't the psychological aspects of Julien.\" Bremner tried out his accent when he went to visit Korine's Uncle Eddie. \"It was quite difficult to get access to him, but they sneaked me in as a relative.\" He listened to Eddie's fantastical stories, studied his speech patterns - \"so fast and so slurred\" - and crafted a character. He maintained his accent off-set and refused to see Scots friends, for fear those Rs would start rocking and rolling again. \"My girlfriend was losing her patience with me when I was on the telephone... I didn't think I was in character, I was just trying to be American.\" Bremner also totally changed his appearance for Julien and is almost unrecognisable with black, loosely-permed hair and metal teeth. </p> <p>Julien Donkey-Boy is unlike any other film, not just in content, but in tone and ambiguity. In the opening scene, Julien appears to attack and possibly kill a boy at a pond. The incident is never referred to again. Julien works as an assistant at a blind school and is part of a dysfunctional family that includes Chloe Sevigny as his pregnant sister, and the German director Werner Herzog as the father who forces Julien to slap himself for being stupid, and hoses down his other son with cold water because it is character-forming. </p> <p>The film is composed of seemingly dislocated scenes, including a nun masturbating and spanking herself, but a loose storyline eventually starts to emerge, and there is considerable black comedy. \"Stop that shivering,\" says the father, aiming the hose at his son. \"A winner doesn't shiver.\" Meanwhile Julien asks passersby which tree is his family tree. </p> <p>The San Francisco Chronicle called Julien Donkey-Boy a \"self-indulgent mess\", while Entertainment Weekly compared it to the poetry of Robert Frost. \"It's probably the thing that I feel most proud of,\" says Bremner, who, in Julien, has created a character both touching and appalling. He admits it was a huge relief when it was over. \"I had been living in a different world,\" he says. \"Personally I had really isolated myself to do that job. It took me a couple of weeks or so to get it out of my system.\" </p> <p>The film left Bremner not only physically and mentally exhausted, but skint, having spent five months working for next to nothing. It did, however, get him an American agent and a reputation as a Brit who can do an American accent - which ultimately led him to director Michael Bay, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and their take on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Bremner doubts the makers of The Rock and Armageddon saw Julien Donkey-Boy. \"I'm sure it's not a film that they would want to watch,\" he says. </p> <p>Going from a no-budget, straight-to-video film to a $145m movie must have been quite a culture shock. \"I don't see Julien as a product,\" says Bremner. \"But I see this as a product, a very custom-built blockbuster, a classic of the genre. I don't always have hundreds of options and this was a pretty good one.\" </p> <p>In Pearl Harbor Bremner plays Affleck's co-pilot, but he laughs at the notion that they might replace Cruise and Kilmer as the top guns for the 21st Century. \"There's a lot of stunts and special effects,\" he says. \"We're running around firing guns and that sort of thing, but I'm not putting myself in much danger.\" </p> <p>He did have to go to boot camp, however. \"They really broke us down, me particuarly. The last night of boot camp they were sending someone in to check on me every few minutes, to check I was still breathing.\" He maintains his character is not so different from his previous hapless supporting characters. \"I play an American pilot with a speech impediment, who falls in love and goes to war and becomes a man or a hero. I'm just making Ben Affleck look good, ha-ha.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Julien Donkey-Boy opens on Friday. Pearl Harbor will be released next year.</p>",

The more violent option is that he brazens it out, claims to have won, and puts down opposition protests with force. But that is unlikely to work. The fact that there is so much dissension within Milosevic's own camp over the results makes it hard for the police and army to be used as a political tool. Senior officers could mutiny. After more than a decade, Serbia is finally in the end game of Milosevic's destructive rule. It took the west until the Kosovo crisis came to the boil two years ago to realise that he is not a reliable partner with whom to do business. Now at last a significant part of the Serbian electorate has come to the same view. Milosevic has long tried to manipulate their emotions through his nationalistic wars and his control of the state-owned media. The lesson of this election is that urban voters and the younger generation who have access to alternative sources of news as well as those Serbs who have close contacts with the huge Serbian diaspora abroad have given the dictator the thumbs-down.",

These days there simply isn't time to spend three days at The EuroDisney Hilton learning about the new IBM storage solution. But do tech PR agencies really deserve such a bad rap from their buddies in the press?</p> <p>Kate Nicholas, editor of the industry bible PR Week, says: \"PR has evolved and media relations is just one element of the industry these days. In the past five years we've seen PR companies taking a more strategic role and acting almost as management consultants to client CEOs, but journalists often don't see that.</p> <p>\"The problem has come, Nicholas says, because PR agencies have traditionally promoted their brightest talent into these strategic positions from the front line of media relations - which leaves the inexperienced, less knowledgeable or plain inept to pitch the media every day. No wonder Whackaflack has become so popular.</p> <p>Stan Woods, MD of tech agency Brodeur, says: \"Media relations is a punishing job. You have to deal with a lot of arrogance and rudeness. It's really no place for a college leaver.\"</p> <p>Simon Hill, MD of Connors UK, is a gamekeeper turned poacher, having spent 13 years working as a journalist. \"Most PR pros suffer from having not worked in journalism,\" he says. \"Like all journalists I received my fair share of bad pitches, and one thing I will say is that journalists have long memories and tend to remember times when flacks have pitched them a stupid story, not known the subject, or just called at the wrong time.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the greatest cause for amusement, apathy and anger among the journalistic fraternity is the poor standard of writing churned out by PR agencies. At the lower levels of the PR totem pole, client-agency pressure is often to blame for poor writing skills, says Jo Chipchase a freelance journalist who left PR. \"The editorial agenda is set either by the client or by the in-house account directors who just want to churn out press releases as efficiently as possible with a cookie-cutter style approach. That lack of creativity was one reason why I left the industry and became a writer.\"</p> <p>Chipchase is not alone in her opinion. Buzzkiller.net is yet another site that has sprung up, naming and shaming hapless flacks, along with their inane pitches and frequent murdering of the English language. Only now, it seems, is the tech PR industry coming round to the fact that they cannot execute any type of PR strategy without excellent writing and media relations. Chipchase says she knows of several agencies which now use creative writing as their major selling point.</p> <p>Hill admits that his company is perfectly willing to employ people who do \"nothing but write\" so great is its importance, and Nicholas is witnessing agencies devoting more talent and experience to media relations every week.</p> <p>Daryl Wilcox, a former IT journalist, now chief executive of Sourcewire.com - an online resource for both journalists and PR pros which posts journalistic enquiries to the PR community - points out that it's not all one-way traffic. \"I hate to say it, but the performance threshold for journalism is simply not as high as in a PR agency where you have pressure from all sides - clients, the agency's management and the press,\" Wilcox says. \"Even in these days of intense competition between titles, many journalists are inherently lazy and rely on PRs massively, even though they hate to admit it. I've heard hacks yell down the phone at flacks because they were 'not being serviced properly'.\"</p> <p>It's what Woods calls the \"sausage factory\" approach: You put out a press release, the journalist rewrites it and publishes it the following day. Is Wilcox suggesting we should feel sorry for the flacks? \"When I was an IT journalist I'd be meeting VPs of large companies every week, and while they rambled on, I'd just be thinking, \"I wonder how many multiples of my wage you earn?\" While PR agencies scramble to transform themselves inside and out, some things at least will never change. You can whack a flack, but you can't whack their salary. </p> <p>Damon Crane and Bridget Fishleigh are co-founders of Nomad Communications Ltd, a PR and marketing agency serving Internet start-ups, dot.coms and technology companies (www.nomadcomms.com)</p>",

In the past five years we've seen PR companies taking a more strategic role and acting almost as management consultants to client CEOs, but journalists often don't see that. \"The problem has come, Nicholas says, because PR agencies have traditionally promoted their brightest talent into these strategic positions from the front line of media relations - which leaves the inexperienced, less knowledgeable or plain inept to pitch the media every day. No wonder Whackaflack has become so popular. Stan Woods, MD of tech agency Brodeur, says: \"Media relations is a punishing job. You have to deal with a lot of arrogance and rudeness. It's really no place for a college leaver.\" Simon Hill, MD of Connors UK, is a gamekeeper turned poacher, having spent 13 years working as a journalist. \"Most PR pros suffer from having not worked in journalism,\" he says. \"Like all journalists I received my fair share of bad pitches, and one thing I will say is that journalists have long memories and tend to remember times when flacks have pitched them a stupid story, not known the subject, or just called at the wrong time.\" Not surprisingly, the greatest cause for amusement, apathy and anger among the journalistic fraternity is the poor standard of writing churned out by PR agencies. At the lower levels of the PR totem pole, client-agency pressure is often to blame for poor writing skills, says Jo Chipchase a freelance journalist who left PR. \"The editorial agenda is set either by the client or by the in-house account directors who just want to churn out press releases as efficiently as possible with a cookie-cutter style approach. That lack of creativity was one reason why I left the industry and became a writer.\" Chipchase is not alone in her opinion. Buzzkiller.net is yet another site that has sprung up, naming and shaming hapless flacks, along with their inane pitches and frequent murdering of the English language. Only now, it seems, is the tech PR industry coming round to the fact that they cannot execute any type of PR strategy without excellent writing and media relations. Chipchase says she knows of several agencies which now use creative writing as their major selling point. Hill admits that his company is perfectly willing to employ people who do \"nothing but write\" so great is its importance, and Nicholas is witnessing agencies devoting more talent and experience to media relations every week. Daryl Wilcox, a former IT journalist, now chief executive of Sourcewire.com - an online resource for both journalists and PR pros which posts journalistic enquiries to the PR community - points out that it's not all one-way traffic. \"I hate to say it, but the performance threshold for journalism is simply not as high as in a PR agency where you have pressure from all sides - clients, the agency's management and the press,\" Wilcox says. \"Even in these days of intense competition between titles, many journalists are inherently lazy and rely on PRs massively, even though they hate to admit it. I've heard hacks yell down the phone at flacks because they were 'not being serviced properly'.\" It's what Woods calls the \"sausage factory\" approach: You put out a press release, the journalist rewrites it and publishes it the following day. Is Wilcox suggesting we should feel sorry for the flacks? \"When I was an IT journalist I'd be meeting VPs of large companies every week, and while they rambled on, I'd just be thinking, \"I wonder how many multiples of my wage you earn?\" While PR agencies scramble to transform themselves inside and out, some things at least will never change. You can whack a flack, but you can't whack their salary.

London's reputation as a poor relation of the fashion capitals of Milan and Paris is about to be vanquished with two designers vying for the cachet of showing the most expensive dress ever on a British catwalk. Julien Macdonald and Maria Grachvogel are two of the most publicity-hungry characters in the London fashion scene. Macdonald's revealing clothes ensure him plenty of publicity: he created the dress and matching knickers that Kelly Brook wore to the premiere of the film Snatch. In February Grachvogel, who is popular among society ladies but seldom listed among fashion's most innovative talents, made the front pages by persuading Victoria Beckham to grace her catwalk. It was Grachvogel who fired the opening shot yesterday in the race to reveal the million-pound dress. Her show, staged in Harrods, was originally due to take place on Wednesday but was brought forward at the last minute. The dress everyone had come to see was modelled by Jodie Kidd, and comprised a seamed black bodice fastened with belt buckles, and floor- length black chiffon skirt, slit thigh-high. Scattered over the dress were 2,000 cut diamonds, each set in 18 carat white gold. Because of the value of the diamonds, which had been lent by jewellers Van Peterson, the dress was to be driven away in a security van within minutes of Kidd taking it off. Tonight Macdonald, a 29-year-old Welshman, will attempt to steal back the limelight with a black lace minidress featuring a shoulderpiece of more than 1,000 cut diamonds. It is rumoured that Elizabeth Jagger, 16-year-old daughter of Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, will wear the gown. There is some dispute over the value of Grachvogel's dress, which will now be auctioned in aid of the Nelson Mandela children's fund. The designer's spokespeople said that it was \"the equivalent of 1,000 pairs of VanPeterson.com diamond stud earrings, which retail at \u00a3800 each\", giving a value of \u00a3800,000 for the stones alone. Other sources, however, put the value at \u00a3250,000. Macdonald claims that his dress, which is the result of a collaboration with De Beers, is worth \u00a31m, although even this does not beat the record for the most expensive dress on a catwalk. That is held by the Italian designer Antonio d'Amico, companion of the late Gianni Versace, who last year showed a dress featuring \u00a31.3m worth of jewels.

      "body": "<p>Who were the stars of New York fashion week? There was simply no contest. Neither Ralph nor Calvin, Donna nor Gisele, nor even front row compadres Puff Daddy and Donald Trump could compete with four diminutive actresses who have American fashion at their feet. Stars of every front row they graced, Sarah Jessica Parker and her co-stars in HBO's hit TV show Sex and the City are without doubt having a fashion moment. The whole of New York wants to dress like Sex and the City. In fact, the whole of America wants to dress like Sex and the City. </p> <p>Oscar de la Renta could not have hoped for better publicity than Parker, who plays the show's protagonist Carrie, telling the reporters hanging on her every word after his show that she \"loved it\", wanted \"to wear it all\". </p> <p>Kristin Davis, aka uptight art dealer Charlotte, gracefully acknowledged the extent of her influence by diplomatically rushing home to her Upper West Side apartment between shows to change from the head-to-toe Ralph Lauren she wore for Ralph's show into a Michael Kors red satin and tweed ensemble for Michael's show. \"I'm only going to shows I like,\" she declared regally, smoothing her MK logo pencil skirt for the cameras. The only woman who could divert the attention of the American press from Parker, Davis et al was Patricia Field - not an actress, nor even a model, but chief costume designer for the show and, therefore, a king-maker. </p> <p>The Sex and the City look is sophisticated but not uptight, provocative but knowing. Short skirts worn with tiny vintage T-shirts or rock-chick glam coats. Stratospherically high, spindly sandals in bright colours worn with lean hipster trousers. Slivers of body-hugging cashmere. Touches of ironic trashiness, like the gold name necklaces that had to be dropped because they launched such a huge following that they turned into a clich\u00e9. America wants this look and in economic boomtime is prepared to pay through the nose for it. And the designers are more than happy to oblige. The upshot, as seen on this week's catwalks: hemlines that would make Kelly Brook blush. Evangelical devotion to the modern woman's religion, shoe fetishism. And an obsession with marrying cash with trash for the requisite \"groupie on spring break from finishing school\" look. </p> <p>Like Stella McCartney, Daryl Kerrigan has the knack of knowing exactly how young women want to look. \"She just gets it,\" as one devotee sighed after her show. Clever and cool, the Daryl Klabel epitomises the femininity-with-an-edge look of which Sarah Jessica Parker is the poster girl and this collection was right up to speed: a spine of tight pleats down a pair of low-rise, long-legged trousers, a tiny pelmet skirt balanced by an easy off-the-shoulder top, neutral cream and black offset with metallic gold and rust. </p> <p>Similarly, at DKNY a sharp, sassy collection pivoted on slim, low-rise trousers gathered at the ankle and belt-width skirts in denim or leather. Instead of 80s-style bustiers or boob tubes, these were worn with fluid, sequin-smothered vests in bronze or sky blue. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the 80s revival that fashion has for some seasons now seemed unable to shake off wielded a heavier hand. There were ra-ra skirts at Marc Jacobs and mini puffballs at Oscar de la Renta, while at Anna Sui, the combination of long lace gloves, leather belts on the hips, poodle bows in the hair and Camden Market dangly earrings was alarmingly similar to Bananarama singing Robert De Niro's Waiting on Top of the Pops. Helmut Lang, however, achieved the seemingly impossible by producing a heavily 80s-referenced show that was both modern and sexy. Known for somewhat austere, cerebral designs, Lang turned up the sex appeal with this collection, entitled When Love Comes To Town. The tight, bandage-strapped jersey dresses and vest tops were reminiscent of Azzedine Ala\u00efa and Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger, but the shades of cream, black, flesh and beige, and the precision-cut leather coats and dresses, were pure Lang. </p> <p> Within two days of the start of the collections, the trade press were pronouncing turquoise the new black. Randolph Duke themed his collection around the colour of the sea in different parts of the world, while turquoise also featured in two of the most colourful shows of the week, the nostalgic candy-store palette of Marc Jacobs and Hussein Chalayan's block-printed designs for Tse. The vivid geometry of the Tse collection was inspired, Chalayan explained with characteristic directness, by \"a circle, a square and a triangle\". </p> <p>At Joop!, prints were a similar combination of sweeping curves and hard angles, creating what looked like a colourful astronomical map, reminiscent of the abstract patterns of classic Louis Feraud. At Oscar de la Renta, Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, the graphics were restricted to diagonal stripes. </p> <p>Ralph Lauren bucked the colour trend with a collection entirely in white, black and chocolate brown. Shapes were elegant and simple, brought to life with contrast trims and the addition of \"Coco Chanel at Deauville\" touches, pearls and neckerchiefs. Compared with some of the more left-field shows, this was hardly edge of the seat stuff - shift dresses just don't make great theatre. But judging from the reaction of the audience, who met every pencil skirt and turtleneck with gasps of rapture, it is sure to sell and sell. </p> <p>Michael Kors is another hugely successful American designer whose clients have a taste for discreet luxury and the money to indulge it. If you have several thousand dollars to spend on a powder-puff soft cashmere wrap cardigan, perfect for turning an evening in front of the TV into a style statement, Kors is your man. This collection, entitled Desert Divas, was the week's strongest showcase for a Wild West theme which is tipped to dethrone fashion's long-term love affair with all things oriental. Buttery suede palazzo pants, duck-egg blue bikinis, stetsons and mink-lined leather jackets were perfect for Upper East Side cowgirls. </p> <p>Last but not least, fashionistas played the inevitable game of \"spot the decade\". With designers seemingly picking out and chewing up decades like penny sweets, it can be hard to keep up - unless, of course, you have a team of wardrobe assistants out there scouring charity stores day and night to find the perfect oh-my-god-where-did-you-get-that vintage Yves Saint Laurent for your next episode. With the 80s still breathing down our necks, another era is emerging for spring: the 50s. Marc Jacobs' collection, his most effervescent for some seasons, had a milkshake-sweet 50s flavour with satin bomber jackets, girlish French horizontal striped T-shirts and full-skirted day dresses with sweetheart necklines. </p> <p>Chaiken, best known for their hip-slimming trousers, showed demure circle skirts; Christina Perrin featured cropped trousers and St Tropez cap-sleeve shirts; Michael Kors and Oscar de la Renta both did flirty broderie anglaise sundresses; and even Betsey Johnson's Playmate models squeezed gamely into gingham dresses and sailor-striped tops. The million dollar question, of course, is will it catch on? Well, you'll just have to wait until the next series to find out.</p>",

I'm excited.\" There were 7,861,327 eligible voters in Yugoslavia, of whom 444,130 were in Montenegro, Serbia's smaller sister republic. There were around 10,000 polling stations in all. A candidate needs more than 50 percent of the vote to win outright without having to contest a second round.",

She later remarked this was \"not a bad background for philosophy\".</p> <p>In 1923 she went to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, to study classics and philosophy. She was influenced by AD Lindsay (whose concern to link intellectual and practical issues in political philosophy made such a lasting impression that she once described herself as \"a step- daughter of Balliol\"), RG Collingwood, HA Pritchard (whose agonising over moral problems appealed to her), and J Macmurray. During the general strike of 1926, she heard RH Tawney speak on behalf of the miners, and towards the end of her life she said that this gave her \"the nearest thing I have ever had to a conversion experience\". From then on her interest in philosophy was combined with a serious concern about political and social issues.</p> <p>For several years she spent part of her vacations tutoring for the WEA summer school at Balliol. After graduation, she joined the Maesynhaf Settlement in the Rhondda valley, teaching classes, largely based on Plato, to unemployed miners, many of whom were strongly influenced by Marxism. There were vigorous arguments about morals, politics and economics. One student looked after the books she had brought from Oxford; he was George Thomas, later Speaker of the Commons.</p> <p>From 1928 to 1930, Emmet held a Commonwealth Fellowship at Radcliffe College and attended a graduate seminar held by AN Whitehead, whose thought attracted her to Cambridge, Massachusetts. On returning to England, she held a temporary teaching post at Somerville College, Oxford, had another spell in the Rhondda, and produced her first book, Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism (1932), in which she attempted to demystify his puzzling terminology and ideas.</p> <p>Emmet was appointed lecturer in philosophy at Armstrong College, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (now the University of Newcastle) in 1932. She later described the department as one man and his dog: she was the dog. The department had to cover the whole range of philosophy, but she also managed to include several courses in political philosophy.</p> <p>In 1938, she moved to Manchester as lecturer in the philosophy of religion, becoming reader in philosophy in 1945 and the Sir Samuel Hall professor of philosophy in 1946. During her early wartime years at Manchester, she took her turn fire-watching, and used to describe how classes began with people sharing their air-raid stories of the night before. She used the quieter nights towards the end of the war to write The Nature of Metaphysical Thinking (1945). In it, she responded to the criticisms of logical positivists by suggesting that metaphysics uses concepts analogically to develop a plausible way of interpreting the world.</p> <p>In more than 20 years at Manchester, she showed grace and charm as well as practical wisdom and firmness in dealing with the business of the department and, as dean of arts from 1962 to 1964, with that of the faculty. At a time when philosophy was becoming obsessed with understanding the minutiae of supposedly ordinary language, she was unpersuaded by colleagues who tried to avoid basic questions of truth by holding that all claims were internal to a \"language game\". Her question was: \"But, then, why play the game?\"</p> <p>Since Emmet was convinced that philosophy had much to contribute to the study of other subjects, she encouraged the establishment of joint honours schools and enthusiastically developed links with colleagues in the departments of government, economics and anthropology. Her activities were not confined to Manchester.

In The Moral Prism (1979), she returned to the complexity of individual moral decisions, considering how reliable moral judgments are to be made when there is no single moral theory that adequately solves all problems. Later, she returned to earlier interests in The Effectiveness of Causes (1986), The Passage of Nature (1992), and The Role of the Unrealisable (1994). In 1996 she produced a series of delightful cameos and penetrating comments in her book Philosophers and Friends: Reminiscences of 70 Years in Philosophy.</p> <p>In September 1966, she resigned her chair at Manchester and went to live in Cambridge.

      "byline": "Peter Bazalgette",

      "body": "<p>Today's reading is taken from the Book of Dyke, chapter 16, verse 2: \"If in the commercial world you lose share year after year, you either change your cost base dramatically or fall off the cliff. And when you combine channel fragmentation with the introduction of new technology, which makes recording programmes and skipping ads easy, the medium-term economics start to look fragile.\" </p> <p>In his recent MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh, Greg Dyke argued that if advertiser-funded television declines then the BBC will increasingly be the main financier of British programming. At first this sounds like the usual BBC megalomania, but behind the cheekiness is an interesting point. If technology erodes the income of commercial channels, how will we pay for programming? All this time we have been beating our breast about how the licence fee will become unacceptable. But were we looking in the wrong direction? After all, subscription income will outstrip advertising revenues within a couple of years. So the habit of paying directly for television is growing, not diminishing. The only difference between the new services and the licence fee is the element of compulsion - not something there is as yet any discernible resentment about. </p> <p>However, in the short term, even as ITV's share declines, the effect is to increase its income. Advertisers have to pay more to reach what is still the last mass audience available. As my media-buyer-on-the-Clapham-omnibus put it to me this week, ITV is more resilient than it has a right to be. But every programme maker should be pondering the medium term because, despite the BBC's efforts to paint itself as the only white knight, the investment of the commercial channels in content is a crucial part of our ecology. We all need to work out how to continue harnessing advertisers' money. </p> <p>In the immediate future there will need to be an increase in programme sponsorship. It is rising by 20% a year but still accounts for only 2.5% of the cake. The advantage here is that the advertiser's brand gets attached to the programme that is watched rather than ads that might be skipped. But sponsorship messages are going to have to be delivered with more skill. At the moment ad agencies too often commission stand-alone creative briefs that do not blend with the programme and are often at odds with it. The Vauxhall stings for Euro 2000 were cringe-making. Yes, young men like humour, but not when they're watching football (was it Bill Shankly who said soccer is more important than life or death?). </p> <p>Product placement will also become more important. Like prostitution, it currently exists in a twilight world, harassed by the authorities. But one of the first tasks of the new, post-white paper regulators should be to rehabilitate this particular vice and make it a virtue. </p> <p>Broadcasting is getting narrower all the time. Witness Channel 4 and Sky's success in delivering more focused audience groups to advertisers. And it will get narrower still. In the broadband, online world, the advertisers may well become broad/narrow casters themselves. The likes of Ali G might be directly funded by Nike and exclusively available on Nike's channel. This \"sticky content\" could, alternatively, be funded by its producer and syndicated to other non-competing content services from companies such as Lynx or Gap. What this means is that content creators will need to start forging direct links with advertisers rather than merely relying on the midwifery of the traditional broadcasters. </p> <p>Producers of high-cost material, particularly drama, also have to increase their co-production skills. The programme distributors' association, BTDA, held an instructive conference about this last week. It demonstrated that creators and sellers can work much more closely. </p> <p>Finally, there is the bounty from the sell-off of analogue spectrum to be fought over. Government \"sources\" have floated the idea of spending it in advance to assist all homes to go digital. But what about a content fund, too? Far from being on the way out, perhaps the idea of spending public money on programming is just coming into its own. </p> <p>\u0095 Peter Bazalgette is creative director of Endemol Entertainment UK.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Today's reading is taken from the Book of Dyke, chapter 16, verse 2: \"If in the commercial world you lose share year after year, you either change your cost base dramatically or fall off the cliff. And when you combine channel fragmentation with the introduction of new technology, which makes recording programmes and skipping ads easy, the medium-term economics start to look fragile.\" In his recent MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh, Greg Dyke argued that if advertiser-funded television declines then the BBC will increasingly be the main financier of British programming. At first this sounds like the usual BBC megalomania, but behind the cheekiness is an interesting point. If technology erodes the income of commercial channels, how will we pay for programming? All this time we have been beating our breast about how the licence fee will become unacceptable. But were we looking in the wrong direction? After all, subscription income will outstrip advertising revenues within a couple of years. So the habit of paying directly for television is growing, not diminishing. The only difference between the new services and the licence fee is the element of compulsion - not something there is as yet any discernible resentment about. However, in the short term, even as ITV's share declines, the effect is to increase its income. Advertisers have to pay more to reach what is still the last mass audience available. As my media-buyer-on-the-Clapham-omnibus put it to me this week, ITV is more resilient than it has a right to be. But every programme maker should be pondering the medium term because, despite the BBC's efforts to paint itself as the only white knight, the investment of the commercial channels in content is a crucial part of our ecology. We all need to work out how to continue harnessing advertisers' money. In the immediate future there will need to be an increase in programme sponsorship. It is rising by 20% a year but still accounts for only 2.5% of the cake. The advantage here is that the advertiser's brand gets attached to the programme that is watched rather than ads that might be skipped. But sponsorship messages are going to have to be delivered with more skill. At the moment ad agencies too often commission stand-alone creative briefs that do not blend with the programme and are often at odds with it. The Vauxhall stings for Euro 2000 were cringe-making. Yes, young men like humour, but not when they're watching football (was it Bill Shankly who said soccer is more important than life or death?). Product placement will also become more important. Like prostitution, it currently exists in a twilight world, harassed by the authorities. But one of the first tasks of the new, post-white paper regulators should be to rehabilitate this particular vice and make it a virtue. Broadcasting is getting narrower all the time. Witness Channel 4 and Sky's success in delivering more focused audience groups to advertisers. And it will get narrower still. In the broadband, online world, the advertisers may well become broad/narrow casters themselves. The likes of Ali G might be directly funded by Nike and exclusively available on Nike's channel. This \"sticky content\" could, alternatively, be funded by its producer and syndicated to other non-competing content services from companies such as Lynx or Gap. What this means is that content creators will need to start forging direct links with advertisers rather than merely relying on the midwifery of the traditional broadcasters. Producers of high-cost material, particularly drama, also have to increase their co-production skills. The programme distributors' association, BTDA, held an instructive conference about this last week. It demonstrated that creators and sellers can work much more closely. Finally, there is the bounty from the sell-off of analogue spectrum to be fought over. Government \"sources\" have floated the idea of spending it in advance to assist all homes to go digital. But what about a content fund, too? Far from being on the way out, perhaps the idea of spending public money on programming is just coming into its own. \u0095 Peter Bazalgette is creative director of Endemol Entertainment UK.",

DoubleClick is introducing Boomerang into the UK, an e-commerce marketing tool that uses cookies to encourage people back to the retail site, converting browsers into buyers. British Airways is the first UK client to sign up. The restructure will create four new vertical divisions, sorting sites - for which DoubleClick handles sales - by type into business, leisure, consumer and technology and auto. Each will have a separate publisher, a business development person and a sales team. A group publisher who reports to the managing director will oversee all four divisions. These vertical networks will work alongside a separate agency team, a sponsorship team, a marketing team and customer services. Mr Stein is currently recruiting two publishers for the leisure and consumer divisions and has promoted Anne-Catrin Sallaba, director of business development, to group publisher. Paul Goad, senior account manager, has been put in charge of the business network and Ben Auchettl, business development manager, has been promoted to publisher of the technology and auto network. The appointments will take the staff tally at DoubleClick to 34. The changes, which are expected to roll out to other European offices in the coming months, will come into effect on October 1.",

      "body": "<p>France has decided to elect its next president for a five-year rather than a seven-year term. But at what cost to democracy and the public's faith in the country's political elite?</p> <p>Very nearly 70% of the French electorate failed to vote in yesterday's referendum on whether to to shorten the presidential term and bring it in line with the French parliament's and most of the rest of western Europe.</p> <p>The change, France's most important constitutional reform in the past 40 years, was approved by about 73% of those who bothered to cast a ballot. But it was the abstention rate - a record for the nine referendums held during the fifth republic - that preoccupied the commentators.</p> <p>\"A little yes, but a big slapdown\", was the verdict of le Parisien, while Liberation and France Soir referred to \"the vote strike\" and the conservative le Figaro called the poll \"a huge political and symbolic failure\".</p> <p>The value of the reform, most commentators agreed, was not in doubt. The presidential mandate is out of step with the five-year lifetime of parliament, and three times in the past 14 years there have been paralysing \"cohabitations\" between presidents and prime ministers of different political persuasions that have effectively stymied major institutional change.</p> <p>Most were also agreed that it was President Jacques Chirac's chosen method for ratifying the reform that was at fault.</p> <p>France's constitution can be changed by a special joint congress of the upper and lower houses of parliament, and putting such an arcane issue to the people - which Chirac did in an attempt to make French democracy \"more open\" - was simply inappropriate.</p> <p>Because all major parties and a sizeable majority of the public backed the long-discussed change, the campaigning was uninspired if not non-existent. In addition, public attention was far more concerned by more practical issues, such as soaring petrol prices, a heavy tax burden and growing accusations of corruption levelled at Chirac and his Gaullist RPR party.</p> <p>\"The referendum was a fiasco,\" said one political analyst, Alain Duhamel. \"It was bad for Chirac, who chose the referendum, and above all, it was very bad for democracy. Our institutions have been improved by the referendum, but democracy has been weakened.\"</p> <p>Besides the president, Lionel Jospin also comes out of the debacle with his image blackened. The prime minister was firmly in favour of the reform but failed to make campaigning for it a priority. He said it was \"a necessary step towards further important reforms\", but failed to say exactly what those further reforms might be and why they were important.</p> <p>\"One of the chief lessons of this must be that you cannot play with universal suffrage,\" said another commentator, Jacques Esperandieu. \"France is not Switzerland, where referendums are commonplace. Here, putting an issue before the people should be sacred, a tool used to decide true national debates, not politico-technical quarrels.\"</p> <p>For it is not that the French dislike referendums as such. When the issue is one that inspires passion, the turnout is high: Some 70% of the electorate voted on the Maastricht treaty in 1992. And in an opinion poll published in le Figaro today, 67% of respondents said they favoured more referendums - but only on major political issues such as taxation or pension reform.</p> <p>So yesterday's record low turnout may not be a crisis in French democracy. Just a warning to the country's political elite that the French do not take kindly to being consulted about issues that only really concern politicians, particularly when those politicians should be thinking about rather more important things.</p>",

      "bodyText": "France has decided to elect its next president for a five-year rather than a seven-year term. But at what cost to democracy and the public's faith in the country's political elite? Very nearly 70% of the French electorate failed to vote in yesterday's referendum on whether to to shorten the presidential term and bring it in line with the French parliament's and most of the rest of western Europe. The change, France's most important constitutional reform in the past 40 years, was approved by about 73% of those who bothered to cast a ballot. But it was the abstention rate - a record for the nine referendums held during the fifth republic - that preoccupied the commentators. \"A little yes, but a big slapdown\", was the verdict of le Parisien, while Liberation and France Soir referred to \"the vote strike\" and the conservative le Figaro called the poll \"a huge political and symbolic failure\". The value of the reform, most commentators agreed, was not in doubt. The presidential mandate is out of step with the five-year lifetime of parliament, and three times in the past 14 years there have been paralysing \"cohabitations\" between presidents and prime ministers of different political persuasions that have effectively stymied major institutional change. Most were also agreed that it was President Jacques Chirac's chosen method for ratifying the reform that was at fault. France's constitution can be changed by a special joint congress of the upper and lower houses of parliament, and putting such an arcane issue to the people - which Chirac did in an attempt to make French democracy \"more open\" - was simply inappropriate. Because all major parties and a sizeable majority of the public backed the long-discussed change, the campaigning was uninspired if not non-existent. In addition, public attention was far more concerned by more practical issues, such as soaring petrol prices, a heavy tax burden and growing accusations of corruption levelled at Chirac and his Gaullist RPR party. \"The referendum was a fiasco,\" said one political analyst, Alain Duhamel. \"It was bad for Chirac, who chose the referendum, and above all, it was very bad for democracy. Our institutions have been improved by the referendum, but democracy has been weakened.\" Besides the president, Lionel Jospin also comes out of the debacle with his image blackened. The prime minister was firmly in favour of the reform but failed to make campaigning for it a priority. He said it was \"a necessary step towards further important reforms\", but failed to say exactly what those further reforms might be and why they were important. \"One of the chief lessons of this must be that you cannot play with universal suffrage,\" said another commentator, Jacques Esperandieu. \"France is not Switzerland, where referendums are commonplace. Here, putting an issue before the people should be sacred, a tool used to decide true national debates, not politico-technical quarrels.\" For it is not that the French dislike referendums as such. When the issue is one that inspires passion, the turnout is high: Some 70% of the electorate voted on the Maastricht treaty in 1992. And in an opinion poll published in le Figaro today, 67% of respondents said they favoured more referendums - but only on major political issues such as taxation or pension reform. So yesterday's record low turnout may not be a crisis in French democracy. Just a warning to the country's political elite that the French do not take kindly to being consulted about issues that only really concern politicians, particularly when those politicians should be thinking about rather more important things.",

Nonetheless, I was the one being interviewed. Sitting in my best, hideously warm Jigsaw suit, as a fan whirled above our heads chopping the hot lunchtime air, I smiled back at the school's director Mr Kenny. He was right: I did not have a post- graduate qualification. But might he consider taking Tilly anyway?</p> <p>It came as something of a blow when we were told that Tilly was, alas, too old for Tender Feet's programme, which begins at two. In effect the rejection meant our daughter was already on life's scrapheap.</p> <p>We shared this dismal news with our neighbour, a famous Indian painter recently decorated by the Indian government, whose grand-daughter had just left the school. She agreed to put in a good word for us. Within hours Mr Kenny had performed a nimble volte-face: Tilly would of course be welcome at Tender Feet and could start on Monday.</p> <p>The next step was to purchase Tilly's uniform. Like all the other children she had to wear white plimsolls, and have a clean handkerchief pinned to her dress every morning. She required a tiffin box for late-morning tiffin which consisted of a cheese or jam sandwich without - as the prospectus made clear - stuffings.</p> <p>It would be nice to think that our experience of school entry was atypical. In fact, we appear to have got off lightly. With a middle-class of around 200 million people, it is the handful of successful Indian schools that choose the parents, rather than the other way round.</p> <p>The same demographic pressure can be felt everywhere in India: in cinemas, on trains, and in the perpetually crowded and surprisingly upmarket branches of McDonald's. Another of our neighbours was grilled with his wife for four hours before their small son was accepted at a pre-school. Further along the system, the pressure grows intolerably. Middle-class Indian teenagers rarely leave the house, such is the competition to succeed, and only those with the very top grades make it into university. In such a frenzied atmosphere, it is hardly surprising that rumours flourish of certain headmasters willing to accept \"donations\".</p> <p>In the end, Tender Feet proved to be well worth the effort. Tilly's morning walk to school takes her past the ironing stall, where two men labour over crumpled saris with giant charcoal-powered irons, past the young beggar woman with no legs, who gets around on a cart. We see vegetable stalls selling aubergines and okra, and a children's playground which is too hot most days to use. At the school gates I hand Tilly over - parents are strictly forbidden from entering the school. At going home time, India's enduring caste system prevails: parents collect their children from the front gate, while ayahs or nannies have to queue at a side door.</p> <p>After four months of taking her to Tender Feet we still have little idea what exactly Tilly does inside, but it is clear she is happy and stimulated. Her Hindi-speaking playmates are the sons and daughters of Delhi's bourgeoisie - garment exporters, building contractors and government officials. She is the only foreign child. What is more, Tilly has a special friend, Karla, who may or may not exist. Karla, she tells us, \"is forty hundred fat\" and \"gets into trouble with the teachers for eating his tiffin too quickly\".</p>",

At going home time, India's enduring caste system prevails: parents collect their children from the front gate, while ayahs or nannies have to queue at a side door. After four months of taking her to Tender Feet we still have little idea what exactly Tilly does inside, but it is clear she is happy and stimulated. Her Hindi-speaking playmates are the sons and daughters of Delhi's bourgeoisie - garment exporters, building contractors and government officials. She is the only foreign child. What is more, Tilly has a special friend, Karla, who may or may not exist. Karla, she tells us, \"is forty hundred fat\" and \"gets into trouble with the teachers for eating his tiffin too quickly\".",

      "body": "<p>Standing in a night club in Banja Luka in the Republic of Serbska, I'm starting to feel a wee bit nervous. We've bunked out of Nato's vast metal factory base with five pissed squaddies for a Friday night on the town, and the locals have got wise to the fact that we're Brits, mainly because the squaddies are wearing Sheffield United shirts. Three terrifying Serb boneheads are gathering nearby, getting just that bit too close for comfort. No one is talking to us. We stand out like sore thumbs. </p> <p>The promoter, clearly sensing trouble, moves over to talk to the safest face among us - Julie Dawson, who manages British DJs for UK production and management company Wise Buddah. The two of them quickly reach the international language of dance music - hard house, trance, Tong, Rampling and Cox. Then she reveals that she's over here because her company produces Boy George's radio show Clubversive, and the promoter erupts with joy. </p> <p>\"Yes, yes, Clubversive, I hear it on Oxsigen.\" And then he's clapping us on the back and getting us drinks and asking if Boy George would play his club. I think to myself - if only Captain David Bailey were here. He'd practically be in tears by now. </p> <p>Captain Bailey is the man who created Oxsigen for the British army's element of Nato's stabilisation force SFOR. He almost single-handedly built the station's prefab hut studios on the metal factory base. Oxsigen is a dance station, programmed and scheduled just like Kiss, Galaxy or Radio 1, although with curious ad breaks which carry only advice and information on mine clearance and learning to live together again. When Radio 1 says One Love on air, it's a corporate slogan. When Oxsigen's local Serbian, Croat and Bosniac Muslim DJs say it, they mean let's all stop shooting each other. </p> <p>Bailey has been working on the station for two years - an unusually long period in Bosnia where most soldiers only do a six-month tour - but he clearly loves radio. It was his desperate enthusiasm which got Boy George to play on the station: Bailey contacted Wise Buddah which - with George - was so impressed by the outfit that it basically gave him the show for nothing. </p> <p>\"It sounds a bit naive in the UK to talk about dance music changing things, but there's something about it that really brings people together,\" says Boy George. \"That's why we were so happy to give them the show. The generation in Britain before acid house was uptight, homophobic and unsophisticated. Clubbing was about ultra-hip exclusivity and knowing the right people. Since acid house, kids from Britain are now far more sophisticated. I get no one giving me grief because I'm queer and happy, so that can work out in Bosnia too. We're hoping to do some DJ dates there - I'll be the first western DJ out since the war - and it'd be great if Serbian, Croatian and Muslim kids could all be dancing together in the same nightclub.\" </p> <p>Captain Bailey credits George's show with building the station's success. \"Out here there's no radio research, so we have to do what the rest of the local stations do - calculate how many listeners we have from the calls, letters and emails we get,\" he explains. \"That method gives us a 19% share and makes us the most popular station in our area, which I think is a bit optimistic. I reckon we've probably got around 16%, and I'm quite happy with that.\" </p> <p>It's curious for, well, how many reasons do you want? For a start, this is the British army we're talking about. The unit responsible for creating Bosnia's own Kiss FM is called info ops, or in the American army's terrifying newspeak, psyops - psychological operations. This is the section of the military that spent the second world war dropping leaflets over Germany urging all soldiers to overthrow Hitler and surrender. Given the outstandingly poor results that the leaflets delivered, it's no surprise that the section was pretty hard hit in the army's popularity charts and by the time the Gulf war rolled round it didn't really exist. </p> <p>The Americans had kept this whole business going, however, and spent much of the cold war broadcasting \"join capitalism\" messages into places such as Cuba and eastern Europe. Their Gulf war operations had some success and the Brits were impressed. Come the occupation of Bosnia, info ops was back up and running and trying to work out what best to do with its radio frequencies as delivered by the international media commission before Bailey's radio enthusiasm offered an answer. </p> <p>The French and the Americans were also given frequencies for their stations and the Americans are doing just what you'd expect the Brits to do. Their station is very formal and laced with ads for peace that would make a media novice cringe. In one advert, a couple are doing a crossword and the bloke's stumped on a clue. \"Six letters meaning peace...\" he wonders. \"Why darling, that's Dayton,\" she coos. And you can almost hear the militia laying down their arms. </p> <p>The Brits appear to have embraced clubland for inspiration, using Oxsigen. It has also created a free weekly magazine called Mostovi which is handed out by patrolling soldiers and distributed around shops and town centres. </p> <p>Mostovi similarly eschews any sort of heavy-handed SFOR propaganda. Instead, it has a diet of celebrity interviews and lifestyle features with news about all areas of Bosnia Herzegovina - as local media in the Republic of Serbska refuse to write about the Bosnian Croat Federation and vice versa. Of course, there's also mine-clearing information and stories about war criminals which jar to my British eyes when placed next to a feature on George Clooney. </p> <p>\"Our job is to support the mission for SFOR,\" explains Major Nigel Jones, whose job title runs to the delicious SO2 information campaign, HQ multi national division south west. \"And that's to maintain a safe and secure environment. To me, that means stopping people going back to war. To do that, we have to try and change the way they see each other and change what they think is an acceptable way to resolve disputes. With the radio, we're targeting the young. We've got multi-ethnic presenters, give unbiased news - including news that is critical of SFOR - and we work on the premise that if the magazine we produce is boring and worthy then no one's going to read it.\" </p> <p>Up in Prijador - the town where ITN filmed those infamous concentration camp-like scenes of starving Croats behind barbed wire - two of the station's 18-year-old listeners chat about its popularity. \"I listen because it gets the new music quicker than local stations,\" says Rada, a Serbian girl. \"I listen to it because it is the only station where I can speak my mind,\" says Alecsandra. \"There's almost 300 radio stations out here and all of them are controlled by political factions,\" she explains. \"I call Oxsigen's phone-ins because I've seen and heard things I shouldn't have and I need to tell someone.\" </p> <p>And so she tells me. Her dad is Serbian and her mum is Muslim. When she was 11 years old, the locals burned down her next-door neighbours' house because they were Muslims. She lay awake that night hearing her neighbours' screams as they burned to death, wondering if her mother was next. Now she wants to leave. It all looks grim to her and she's the sort of person the station needs to reassure. </p> <p>Back in the club, you could believe there is some hope. The squaddies have split and they're all in the middle of the dance floor, hands in the air as the DJ builds a storming set. There are Croats and Serbs and Bosnians here and people may be slagging off SFOR but they're buying the squaddies rounds of Amstel. The guy on the podium with the lurid green glo-sticks steps down and chats to me about music, always music, and doesn't want to know when I get on to politics, so that just for one, naive, 1988 Summer Of Love moment you actually do think that music could make a difference. Or maybe that's just the beer talking. </p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Last week in Media Guardian, Tim Luckhurst, a former editor of the Scotsman, claimed the Scottish newspaper scene was overburdened with second-rate titles. Here, Scotsman editor in chief,  Andrew Neil, hits back</p>",
      "byline": "Andrew Neil",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is always interesting (though not necessarily instructive) to read the media musings of former editors like Tim Luckhurst, even though he lasted only two weeks in the editorial chair of the Scotsman. This short experience was an unhappy one for all concerned and, judging from last week's article in Media Guardian, has left him with a bitter and distorted view of the vibrant Scottish newspaper scene. </p> <p>You would never guess from what he wrote that since his departure as editor and the launch of the new Scotsman on May 8, sales of Scotland's most famous and distinguished newspaper have soared by more than 30%. The Scotsman, with independently-audited sales of almost 105,000 in August, is now selling more than it has ever done and, for the first time in its 183-year history, has become the largest-selling daily broadsheet in Scotland. </p> <p>The success of the relaunch of the Scotsman has been achieved by eschewing incremental change, which had done nothing to reverse a quarter century of steady decline (in common with every other Scottish broadsheet), in favour of radical reform. </p> <p>This was accompanied by a price cut to 20p to encourage new readers to sample the new Scotsman and an extensive promotion campaign which repositioned it as a truly national paper for all of Scotland, not just Edinburgh and its environs. Luckhurst is living in the past when he claims that the Scotsman is still just a \"city-state product\". Over 60% of our sales are now outside Scotland's capital. We are no more an Edinburgh paper than the Times is a London-only paper. </p> <p>Luckhurst is also behind the times when he writes that \"The Scotsman and the [Glasgow] Herald are engaged in a feud which can only end in disaster.\" It is true that sales of the venerable but ailing Herald have recently slumped to around 92,000 (from a 70s peak of more than 126,000) and that our circulation has almost doubled in the Strathclyde region. But the Herald's sales were falling long before our relaunch. We are aiming at a different target. </p> <p>The Scotsman's competition is no longer the local big-city papers of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. The English invaders which have made recent inroads into the Scottish market are now the enemy and the early signs are that they are already retreating across the border. The Scotsman now outsells the tartan editions of all the London-based broadsheets (including the Financial Times) combined. </p> <p>I do agree with Luckhurst, however, that Scotland's new parliament \"has not sold a single additional copy\". That is why I used to urge him and his predecessor not to lead the paper almost every day with the latest devolutionary wrinkle. They ignored this advice and, between them, managed to cut sales of the Scotsman during the first session of the parliament from a healthy 80,000 last August to a record low of 72,000 by December. </p> <p>The radical and rapid transformation of the Scotsman would not have been possible, however, without the threat of a new paper on an already-crowded Scottish scene. If you are minded to protect your franchise, there is nothing like the prospect of fresh competition to open your chequebook and galvanise you to force through major changes; I will be forever grateful to Bonnier, the Swedish publishing group, for inducing both at the Scotsman. Their new Scottish business daily, Business am, was launched last Wednesday. For most of this year, its imminent arrival has steeled and spurred us to do to the Scotsman what should have been done years ago. </p> <p>Much has been made by those who would undermine us, including Luckhurst, of the recent exodus of staff from the Scotsman, much of it to the new Scandinavian title. Luckhurst writes that our paper has \"shed almost 50% of the Scotsman team since April\". In fact, though the exodus began under his watch (when several key figures left), it has been nothing like as massive as he suggests and a loss has been almost entirely therapeutic and beneficial. </p> <p>The insistence on radical change at the Scotsman and the arrival of a Swedish safe haven has encouraged around 20% of editorial staff to leave in recent months. There are always a few casualties in such circumstances - journalists you would rather not lose - but overall the exodus has been a godsend. </p> <p>Luckhurst writes about the \"shedding of quality staff\" and others have talked about the Scotsman \"haemorrhaging talent\".

      "bodyText": "It is always interesting (though not necessarily instructive) to read the media musings of former editors like Tim Luckhurst, even though he lasted only two weeks in the editorial chair of the Scotsman. This short experience was an unhappy one for all concerned and, judging from last week's article in Media Guardian, has left him with a bitter and distorted view of the vibrant Scottish newspaper scene. You would never guess from what he wrote that since his departure as editor and the launch of the new Scotsman on May 8, sales of Scotland's most famous and distinguished newspaper have soared by more than 30%. The Scotsman, with independently-audited sales of almost 105,000 in August, is now selling more than it has ever done and, for the first time in its 183-year history, has become the largest-selling daily broadsheet in Scotland. The success of the relaunch of the Scotsman has been achieved by eschewing incremental change, which had done nothing to reverse a quarter century of steady decline (in common with every other Scottish broadsheet), in favour of radical reform. This was accompanied by a price cut to 20p to encourage new readers to sample the new Scotsman and an extensive promotion campaign which repositioned it as a truly national paper for all of Scotland, not just Edinburgh and its environs. Luckhurst is living in the past when he claims that the Scotsman is still just a \"city-state product\". Over 60% of our sales are now outside Scotland's capital. We are no more an Edinburgh paper than the Times is a London-only paper. Luckhurst is also behind the times when he writes that \"The Scotsman and the [Glasgow] Herald are engaged in a feud which can only end in disaster.\" It is true that sales of the venerable but ailing Herald have recently slumped to around 92,000 (from a 70s peak of more than 126,000) and that our circulation has almost doubled in the Strathclyde region. But the Herald's sales were falling long before our relaunch. We are aiming at a different target. The Scotsman's competition is no longer the local big-city papers of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. The English invaders which have made recent inroads into the Scottish market are now the enemy and the early signs are that they are already retreating across the border. The Scotsman now outsells the tartan editions of all the London-based broadsheets (including the Financial Times) combined. I do agree with Luckhurst, however, that Scotland's new parliament \"has not sold a single additional copy\". That is why I used to urge him and his predecessor not to lead the paper almost every day with the latest devolutionary wrinkle. They ignored this advice and, between them, managed to cut sales of the Scotsman during the first session of the parliament from a healthy 80,000 last August to a record low of 72,000 by December. The radical and rapid transformation of the Scotsman would not have been possible, however, without the threat of a new paper on an already-crowded Scottish scene. If you are minded to protect your franchise, there is nothing like the prospect of fresh competition to open your chequebook and galvanise you to force through major changes; I will be forever grateful to Bonnier, the Swedish publishing group, for inducing both at the Scotsman. Their new Scottish business daily, Business am, was launched last Wednesday. For most of this year, its imminent arrival has steeled and spurred us to do to the Scotsman what should have been done years ago. Much has been made by those who would undermine us, including Luckhurst, of the recent exodus of staff from the Scotsman, much of it to the new Scandinavian title. Luckhurst writes that our paper has \"shed almost 50% of the Scotsman team since April\". In fact, though the exodus began under his watch (when several key figures left), it has been nothing like as massive as he suggests and a loss has been almost entirely therapeutic and beneficial. The insistence on radical change at the Scotsman and the arrival of a Swedish safe haven has encouraged around 20% of editorial staff to leave in recent months. There are always a few casualties in such circumstances - journalists you would rather not lose - but overall the exodus has been a godsend. Luckhurst writes about the \"shedding of quality staff\" and others have talked about the Scotsman \"haemorrhaging talent\". This is self-serving drivel: most of those who have gone are the \"talent\" which presided over the relentless decline of the Scotsman for over two decades. Let us hope they do for the sales of the Scandinavians what they did for the Scotsman's. They have been replaced by journalists of the quality that the paper could never attract before (such as Ian Watson and Bill Jamieson) and exciting new talent (like Charlotte Ross, Steve McGinty and Rona Johnson) more attuned to the culture and attitudes of the 21st century than the 1970s.

And though the date passed uncelebrated the surprise decision to reinstate News at Ten (sort of), dominating front pages and bulletins, seemed fitting and symbolic. </p> <p>In fact, ITN, whose shareholders have advanced plans to float it on the stock exchange, emerges as more valuable, back at 10pm on ITV from January with its brand enhanced - and with the BBC's governors forced to reconsider the plan to move BBC1's news to 10pm. </p> <p>So how was the deal struck after six months of unprecedented and bitter deadlock? Well, it was nail-bitingly touch and go. Rightly criticised for being a bit of a fudge, the outcome is a just-in-time pragmatic repair job, putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. The key figure was Patricia Hodgson, the new chief executive of the independent television commission (ITC). Elated by the defusing of the crisis, she says: \"There has been generosity and realism on both sides. There is no victory. We were solving the issue. But I think it creates a new relationship between us and ITV, which can ensure aspects of public service broadcasting will continue into the digital age.\" </p> <p>On Tuesday August 29, the day after the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival - where Greg Dyke's announcement of the projected BBC News at Ten, backed by the BBC governors, had dominated press coverage - she began exploratory talks with Charles Allen, chief executive of Granada Media. He is the most powerful figure in ITV following the summer's merger agreement with United News &amp; Media's TV franchises. The meeting stemmed from his honest assessment at Edinburgh two days earlier that ITV had taken its eye off the ball in letting the dispute get out of hand - to the point of seeking an unprecedented high court judicial review when the ITC ordered the return of News at Ten at its July meeting. </p> <p>Hodgson, about to take up her new post, seized the moment in Edinburgh to say publicly the two sides could talk \"up to the courtroom door\". But she needed an acceptable proposal by September 21, the last ITC members' meeting before the high court hearing pencilled in for this week. Together that Tuesday they reviewed frankly how divisions during the tense takeover battle absorbing Carlton, Granada and United - when the barons vied to undermine each other in the struggle to come out on top - had meant the ITV network's interests had been damaged. </p> <p>Hodgson made it clear she was prepared to back a single ITV under the right conditions, finally ending the key problem - the \"London split\" of weekday and weekend licence-holders. Then, with the clock ticking away, Hodgson led talks with David Liddiment, programme director of the ITV Network, to explore the options for bringing forward the 11pm Nightly News, though not to 10pm. A 10.30pm compromise worked on during the summer was now impossible because of the BBC's decision to move to 10pm. </p> <p>But on Friday September 15, negotiations suddenly fell apart as conflict between Carlton and Granada flared up again. Hodgson retired from this battlefield, feeling she had done her best, while at ITN the tension mounted. Then Hodgson tried another tack, holding meetings with ITV's commercial directors and sales houses, seeking to reduce their hostility towards news in the prime-time schedule. This was sensible. </p> <p>Advertisers and airtime sales chiefs were alarmed by the sour stalemate. Nick Phillips, director general of the institute of practitioners in advertising, rushed to welcome the 10pm agreement last week because the alternative - a court case, bad blood, a weakened ITV - was worse. Powerful airtime buying agency Zenith Media had already shifted, denying ever supporting an end to News at Ten two years ago. And with the BBC planning to colonise 10pm and pump immense new resources into more popular programmes before it, advertisers were alarmed. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, with only two days to go, Hodgson was suddenly called by the ITV Network, and to her surprise found that a return of News at Ten, with conditions, was being offered. Detailed but good-natured haggling then ensued all through the day. The concession of an extra two and half minutes of prime advertising airtime will roughly offset the loss of the \u00a370m over a year ITV reckons to have gained from ending News at Ten. The ITC is happy, since \u00a342m goes into programmes, taking the network's annual budget to \u00a3747m. </p> <p>And although the revived News at Ten is a third shorter at 20 minutes, it will not suffer the disruption of a commercial break. The agenda is unlikely to be dumbed down, despite the loss of longer reports, and the bulletin will extend to a full half-hour during elections and when big news stories are breaking. A delighted Stewart Purvis, chief executive of ITN, says that the flexibility, allowing ITV to move the bulletin later on Friday and one other night a week, should be seen as a potential strength: in the run-up to News at Ten's abolition in 1999 it was moved frequently to 10.15pm to accommodate Champions League matches and Coronation Street, but notched up bumper viewing figures. As for Friday nights: well, people go to bed later, parliament breaks up early.</p> <p>Underpinning ITV's confidence in reinstating News at Ten is that in the past three months there has been a marked stability in commercial news audiences. After years of gentle decline, figures for all three of ITV's news programmes (lunchtime, evening and nightly) have either held steady or gone up slightly when compared to last year, while Channel 4's news is up nearly 20%. </p> <p>ITV will now have two prime-time news services, at 6.30pm (instead of 5.40pm before News at Ten's axeing) and 10pm, from January: what remains un-fixed is the late-night regional news, stuck at 11.20pm and seen by viewers as irrelevant and far too late. Other potential problems are evident: as the decision was rushed through, catching even ITN by complete surprise, Hodgson's celebrated political skills deserted her. She failed to brief powerful critics, specifically Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the culture, media &amp; sport select committee, who has led the attack over News at Ten. </p> <p>On Friday a defiant Greg Dyke was flying off to Sydney, and had the long flight to ponder his next move. The political guns are firing. Dyke rashly predicted the move would win higher audiences for news; yet going head to head at 10pm - as he still seems determined to do - is bound to cut audiences overall, and open up a huge opportunity for rivals Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky. As Purvis points out, \"Greg's problem is that he thinks he knows ITV, when he doesn't. He has failed to read ITV correctly, just as he did with the summer's football deals.\" </p> <p>Top BBC executives are sticking to the line that ITV's plans are strangely half-hearted, and that the reinstated news will be driven by ITV's entertainment agenda. But they nevertheless know there will have to be a frank reappraisal. A key commercial sector critic says: \"We don't tax every household \u00a3100-plus a year for the BBC to mount a spoiling operation. Dyke must back down.\" ITV bosses are watching the BBC like hawks to make sure ITN moves to 10pm first, by January at the latest, but if they scent trouble News at Ten could return earlier than that - \"we can move quickly,\" Purvis promises. </p> <p>Hodgson, meanwhile, is off to the remaining party conferences, to lobby hard. The ITC's past week could not contrast more sharply with the disaster experienced by Oftel, often cited as the model for a replacement communications regulator, which remains in disgrace over its lax approach to BT. With the white paper on communications still fluid, the ITC is decisively back in the game. </p>",

Powerful airtime buying agency Zenith Media had already shifted, denying ever supporting an end to News at Ten two years ago. And with the BBC planning to colonise 10pm and pump immense new resources into more popular programmes before it, advertisers were alarmed. Last Tuesday, with only two days to go, Hodgson was suddenly called by the ITV Network, and to her surprise found that a return of News at Ten, with conditions, was being offered. Detailed but good-natured haggling then ensued all through the day. The concession of an extra two and half minutes of prime advertising airtime will roughly offset the loss of the \u00a370m over a year ITV reckons to have gained from ending News at Ten. The ITC is happy, since \u00a342m goes into programmes, taking the network's annual budget to \u00a3747m. And although the revived News at Ten is a third shorter at 20 minutes, it will not suffer the disruption of a commercial break. The agenda is unlikely to be dumbed down, despite the loss of longer reports, and the bulletin will extend to a full half-hour during elections and when big news stories are breaking. A delighted Stewart Purvis, chief executive of ITN, says that the flexibility, allowing ITV to move the bulletin later on Friday and one other night a week, should be seen as a potential strength: in the run-up to News at Ten's abolition in 1999 it was moved frequently to 10.15pm to accommodate Champions League matches and Coronation Street, but notched up bumper viewing figures. As for Friday nights: well, people go to bed later, parliament breaks up early. Underpinning ITV's confidence in reinstating News at Ten is that in the past three months there has been a marked stability in commercial news audiences. After years of gentle decline, figures for all three of ITV's news programmes (lunchtime, evening and nightly) have either held steady or gone up slightly when compared to last year, while Channel 4's news is up nearly 20%. ITV will now have two prime-time news services, at 6.30pm (instead of 5.40pm before News at Ten's axeing) and 10pm, from January: what remains un-fixed is the late-night regional news, stuck at 11.20pm and seen by viewers as irrelevant and far too late. Other potential problems are evident: as the decision was rushed through, catching even ITN by complete surprise, Hodgson's celebrated political skills deserted her. She failed to brief powerful critics, specifically Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the culture, media &amp; sport select committee, who has led the attack over News at Ten. On Friday a defiant Greg Dyke was flying off to Sydney, and had the long flight to ponder his next move. The political guns are firing. Dyke rashly predicted the move would win higher audiences for news; yet going head to head at 10pm - as he still seems determined to do - is bound to cut audiences overall, and open up a huge opportunity for rivals Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky. As Purvis points out, \"Greg's problem is that he thinks he knows ITV, when he doesn't. He has failed to read ITV correctly, just as he did with the summer's football deals.\" Top BBC executives are sticking to the line that ITV's plans are strangely half-hearted, and that the reinstated news will be driven by ITV's entertainment agenda. But they nevertheless know there will have to be a frank reappraisal. A key commercial sector critic says: \"We don't tax every household \u00a3100-plus a year for the BBC to mount a spoiling operation. Dyke must back down.\" ITV bosses are watching the BBC like hawks to make sure ITN moves to 10pm first, by January at the latest, but if they scent trouble News at Ten could return earlier than that - \"we can move quickly,\" Purvis promises. Hodgson, meanwhile, is off to the remaining party conferences, to lobby hard. The ITC's past week could not contrast more sharply with the disaster experienced by Oftel, often cited as the model for a replacement communications regulator, which remains in disgrace over its lax approach to BT. With the white paper on communications still fluid, the ITC is decisively back in the game.",

It was, she trilled, the first-ever interview with Linda McCartney. I recall it being difficult to concentrate on the amateurish article which the 20-year-old Paula Yates placed in front of me. She was underdressed, sporting a striking tattoo on her arm (then a novelty), talkative and unable to sit down for longer than a few seconds at a time. </p> <p>There was something about the piece - or was it about her? - that struck me as quirkily original and Linda certainly wasn't speaking to anyone at the time, so I decided it was worth the effort. With Paula at my side, and a gaggle of male reporters rubber-necking the glass cubicle that passed for my office, I spent an hour rewriting the interview. </p> <p>After she had gone, one of the guys asked if I wanted, nudge nudge, to see \"the Penthouse set\". I wouldn't have even known about the raunchy pictures of Paula draped across leather chairs in a gentleman's club but for her having mentioned it within the first 10 minutes of our meeting. </p> <p>She had been astonished, and perhaps even a little miffed, that I hadn't seen them. She appeared keen to cast herself as the wayward, sexy, blonde daughter of the disgraced Stars on Sunday presenter Jess Yates. \"Look at me, aren't I naughty!\" Now, she explained, she was cleaning up her act. At the time I didn't realise she cleaned and dirtied her act every other week. </p> <p>She claimed to have run a gossip column at the Record Mirror, and wanted to become a \"proper journalist\". In those pre-Wapping days, without union membership, that wasn't at all easy. Since she wasn't in the NUJ that first article carried a bizarre byline: \"Exclusive interview with Linda McCartney by Paula Yates as told to Roy Greenslade.\" </p> <p>She also caught the attention of editor Derek Jameson and I seem to recall he gave her a column a couple of years later at the News of the World before he lost patience with her unreliability. By that time she was \"a celebrity\", having presented the notorious Tube on Channel 4 and become Bob Geldof's partner. I met her again when I bought the serial rights to her first silly book, Rock Stars in their Underpants. Again, I found her fun to be with. All those things people have said about her being a smart girl pretending to be an airhead were true, she was a wacky woman with a self-deprecating sense of humour and oodles of charm. I have never been so charmed by someone who swore so much. </p> <p>In 1986, when I was assistant editor at the Sun, her fame had reached such proportions that I bought the serial rights to her next book, Sex with Paula Yates, after reading only a synopsis. Unfortunately, the finished manuscript turned out to be a turkey, too trivial and too controversial even for our august organ. But I had agreed to pay a lot, Paula's name was good enough to sell anything, so I arranged with her that - just for the Sun - we would write a new version. So I turned up at the house she and Geldof shared in Chelsea ready to enjoy an afternoon with Paula. </p> <p>Instead, Bob came in, introduced himself, said the book was \"a load of shite\", that Paula wasn't up to the task of re-doing it and that he and I should tackle the job. Paula could leave us to it. She, as chirpy as ever, accepted this slight and vanished upstairs while we did indeed cobble together a reasonable load of nonsense. A smiling Paula delivered cups of tea occasionally and though we tried to interest her in what we were doing in her name, she seemed blithely unconcerned. Anyway, the serial went off successfully, although I always wished the byline could have read: \"Sex with Paula Yates by Bob Geldof, as told to Roy Greenslade.\" </p> <p>In telling that anecdote, by the way, I'm not trying to infer anything sinister, or otherwise, about the nature of the relationship between Paula and Bob. The point I'm seeking to make is about the casual way Paula treated herself and the way we in newspapers treated her. She was one of our commodities, a famous person whom we used to sell more copies. Yet, of course, we were also the carriage she boarded on her route to fame and wealth. It is this duality which is so fascinating. </p> <p>I fully realise there were traumas specific to Paula. In the past week, her obituary writers have properly drawn attention to the psychological blows she suffered due to a loveless childhood, her acrimonious split with Geldof, the discovery that the man she thought was her father was not, and the sordid death of the father of her fourth child. At some stage the kookiness that set her apart, her disorienting habit of changing clothes and personality, sometimes two or three times a day, probably tipped over into disorder. But was that because of her own emotional problems or due to the pressures of living life in a goldfish bowl? </p> <p>Mary Kenny in the Daily Express was in no doubt, suggesting that Paula was murdered by a lethal substance called celebrity. The Guardian's Yvonne Roberts took a similar stance, arguing that the cult of the celebrity has now become a blood sport: \"for our entertainment,\" she wrote, \"we watch as a mentally ill individual 'blessed' by fame disintegrates before us.\" </p> <p>There can be little doubt that the cult of celebrity, which is both the raw material and end product of modern media, devours many of those people who struggle so hard to attain fame. For a while, a very short while, it's fun to be recognised in the street, to sign autographs in the supermarket, to be invited to the parties and premieres, to be primped and praised. The Big Brother contestants, the archetypical media-created celebrities, are in that phase just now. </p> <p>But Kenny and Roberts are right when they point to the darker side that inevitably follows, the moment when, to borrow that excellent Australian phrase, the media deem it time to cut down the tall poppies. How many times have I read in tabloids that someone is \"just famous for being famous\" as if the papers themselves had not been responsible for generating that fame? For a variety of reasons - a moment's indiscretion, perhaps, a waning of the stardom, an insult to a photographer, or just Buggins' turn - the celebrity begins to get the treatment. We've had enough of the saccharine. We can't sell on that any longer. If you want the publicity then we need more exposure: that rocky private life, the dalliance with your best friend's wife, the flirtation with drugs, the rift with your parents. Come on, give us all you've got, and then some. </p> <p>Appealing to public prurience, tabloid newspapers and tabloid TV eat their own children with undisguised relish. The dehumanisation of \"the celebrity\" is one of the most cynical of media acts. They make them and they break them. As Princess Diana, that classic media-heroine-cum-victim, discovered, whether the story is good or bad, it's always news if you are famous. Your misfortune is manna from heaven for a tabloid, and the greater the misfortune, the better. </p> <p>Hey, wait a moment, say the editors. When these people are wannabes, they seek us out. They use us as their springboard to fame. Once we've granted them their 15 minutes, it's our turn. But does a moth understand the danger of flying too close to the candle? Do those who crave fame realise the consequences? Was Paula, the exhibitionist daughter of a famous father with some notion of the celebrity circus, able to understand what she was letting herself in for? </p> <p>There are mature, sensible people who handle fame without becoming creatures of the tabloids. We know a lot about, say, Anne Robinson or Michael Parkinson, but they retain their privacy and their dignity. Not so the young and the glamorous - models, rock singers, actors, TV presenters - who are required to reveal every one of their intimate secrets in order to satisfy the passing whims of press and public. It may not have been the only reason for Paula Yates's degeneration, but it sure played its part. As, of course, did I. </p>",

In a document that makes the Magna Carta look like a bus ticket, the BBC's Expenses Committee gives \"guidelines\" to staff for understanding the new regime. Staff will no longer be entitled to advance expenses, and overnight accomodation will be subject to a cap of \u00a355. And if you were thinking of taking your other half along on a lig, think again. The guidelines stipulate: \"Your accommodation should be a single, standard room with bathroom facilities.\" Lunch, staff are told, should not exceed \u00a316, with breakfast coming in at \u00a36. But suggestions that Dyke's new broom may mask a return to Dalek culture are unfounded. \"It is recognised that at certain times of the year a social occasion for all staff to mix informally may be appropriate,\" say the guidelines. \"It is usual for you to make a contribution towards the cost of such an occasion, but where your contribution does not cover the actual cost, the business unit may meet the difference. Provided the BBC's annual contribution is no more than \u00a375 per head, no tax liability arises.\" Phew.",

      "body": "<p>Though terrible for loved ones, the early death notoriously solves certain late career problems. Escaping or surviving Oswald's bullet, President Kennedy would probably have been blamed for Vietnam and divorced by Jackie. Princess Diana in her 40s - remarried to a heart surgeon or playboy and obsessively consulting cosmeticians as the vital capital of her glamour dwindled - would have struggled to maintain the love of her middle England constituency. </p> <p>John Winston Lennon was born in Liverpool on October 9 1940. Among the events to mark his ghostly landmark birthday is the republication in book form - with the restoration of material previously deleted for reasons of legality, tact or (in the case of Yoko's interventions) tedium - of a marathon interview Lennon gave in December 1970 to Jann Wenner, the editor of Rolling Stone magazine. Almost exactly a decade after speaking to Wenner, Lennon was freeze-framed at 40 by Mark Chapman's bullet, but the book and the birthday taunt us to look forward. </p> <p>Lennon at 60? Imagine... A Parkinson or South Bank Show Special? Possibly, although, provided he was clear of drugs, the pop star would surely realise how silly the bed-ins and bag-ins and primal scream therapy could be made to seem now. The 30th wedding anniversary with Yoko? Unlikely, given the failure rate of rock marriages. And the published interviews show him bickering with Yoko even deep in new love. Perhaps John would now be having a fling with Patsy or Meg on their rebounds from Noel and Liam. </p> <p>A Beatles reunion concert? Perhaps only if he had broken with Yoko because the strongest material in these interviews is the hatred of his band-mates for their treatment of his wife. Imagine... it really is very hard to do. Probably the only certain project would have been the Greatest Hits album in which, you fear, Lennon would have played down the Beatles songs and played up the Plastic Ono collaborations. It also seems likely that - alive in the year 2000 - Lennon would have mobilised attorneys against the publication of this fuzzy, troubled, bitter conversation from the 70s. </p> <p>This isn't because the book is bad but because the chats put Lennon's reputation in a context which it has been spared by the reverence inevitably given to those slain young. </p> <p>It's clear that Lennon had exceptional verbal talents. These are present most obviously in the song lyrics (although his \"poetry\" collections consist mainly of facetious puns) but also in some magnificent ad-libs. Asked once if Ringo Starr was the best drummer in the world, Lennon answered that he wasn't \"even the best drummer in the Beatles\", a response which reveals true comedic gifts. In the same way, his remark that the Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\" - which was widely seen at the time as a deliberately shocking teasing of the priests - contains a far more subtle acknowledgment of the power and passion of the crowd: a fear of what the Beatles were getting into. One of the best stretches of the Rolling Stone interviews recalls that the sick and the crippled would be placed in the front row at Beatles concerts and then brought round to their dressing rooms. Lennon recalls that the band had an uneasy running joke about how they were being asked to heal them. </p> <p>But little of what comes from Lennon's clever tongue in these interviews matches either the Ringo joke or the Jesus insight. This was probably because, at the time he grudgingly agreed to the grilling, Lennon was adjusting to the end of one significant relationship - with Paul, George and Ringo - and the beginning of two newish ones: with drugs and Yoko Ono. </p> <p>When the 30-year-old Lennon and Wenner, six years younger, sat down in Manhattan before the Christmas of 1970, the Beatles' lawyers were gathering for the final splitting of the spoils - on December 31, McCartney would file suits against Starr, Harrison and Lennon - and John was increasingly going solo with Yoko. </p> <p>Lennon several times tries to abandon the conversation - citing boredom - and seems to continue only because he wishes to settle scores. He word-playingly called one of his verse collections In His Own Write and, in the same spirit, these interviews might have been titled Putting His Spokes In. </p> <p>The most important restored passage for Beatles admirers and music historians is the one dealing with the reaction of the other three to Yoko. When Wenner asks \"How would you characterise George Paul and Ringo's reaction to her?\", Lennon replies: \"It's the same. You can quote Paul, you can look it up in the papers. He's said it many times: at first he hated Yoko and then he got to like her. It's too late for me. And for Yoko. Why should she take that sort of shit from those people? They were writing about her looking miserable in Let It Be. </p> <p>\"You sit through 60 sessions with the most big-headed uptight people on earth and see what it's fuckin' like, and be insulted just because you love someone... I'll never forgive them. I don't care a fucking shit about Hare Krishna and God and Paul... I don't forgive 'em for that.\" </p> <p>For the original publication, Wenner apparently extended the quote with a soothing coda in which Lennon admits \"although I can't help still loving them either\". The truthfulness of this version matters because Anthology, written by the surviving three, suggests that the boys eventually got over the Yoko coldness. Perhaps there was a rapprochement in the final decade of Lennon's life but, in 1970, his hatred of McCartney in particular spatters from these transcripts. The others \"got fed up with being sidemen for Paul\". Paul was impressed by Linda's dad because \"he's got Picassos hanging on the wall and because he's some kind of East Coast suit. Form and not substance. And that's McCartney.\" </p> <p>There has always been psychological interest in the extent to which the boy band was shattered by the incursion of girls. This sexual sub-text is further illuminated in these interviews. Angry with his colleagues for their suspicion of Yoko, Lennon seems most obsessed in the finally terminal business wranglings with the fact that Paul wants to bring Linda's family into the management of the band. </p> <p>This lack of self-knowledge also applies to the star's discussion of gurus. He is witheringly funny about the Maharishi Maresh Yogi, who counselled the Beatles in the late 60s. He is with them in Bangor when news of Brian Epstein's death comes through and advises them to \"be happy\". And yet, even as he sees through the Maharishi in this interview, Lennon is being psychologically blindfolded by the \"primal scream therapy\" of Dr Arthur Janov. He tells Wenner: \"It's a process going on - we primal almost daily... and, in a nutshell, primal therapy allowed us to feel feelings continually, and these feelings usually make you cry.\" </p> <p>This book captures a moment on the cusp between the 60 and the 70s when the religion of celebrity - now our everyday faith - was taking seed. Interviewers seriously expected pop stars to speak wisdom and the performers responded to this pressure by fleeing to gurus and pharmacists. </p> <p>But there are many intriguing incidental details here. Lennon explains that the opaque lyrics of Norwegian Wood were not attributable to drugs - although the poetic streak in his writing elsewhere often did have a chemical provocation - but to the fact the the song describes an affair and he couldn't let his then wife know that. It's also fascinating to hear him insist that he knew he was a genius at the age of eight or nine and railed against the aunt who raised him for throwing away some early verse because \"it'll be worth millions when I'm famous\". The problem with printed interviews, however, is that we can't be sure of the tone of this. Lennon may be sending up himself - or Wenner. </p> <p>Although the Lennon legend has undoubtedly been helped by martyrdom, it was also crucial to his allure that, unlike former colleagues, he had done nothing as embarassing as Mull of Kintyre or Thomas the Tank Engine voiceovers. </p> <p>His death kept him cool. Though influenced by the music of the Beatles in general, Noel and Liam Gallagher copied Lennon in appearance and attitude. It was the writer of Imagine's fame which Chris Evans tried to aggrandise in the mobile phone ad. </p> <p>But only under the influential of acute nostalgia or strong narcotics could a reader get through these interviews with a straight face. </p> <p>A lyricist whose words on many occasions touched poetry here spews angry and amnesiac ramblings. The Rolling Stone conversations are his Mull, his Thomas. Yoko Ono, in her introduction, suggests that John would have loved the internet because \"he liked to experiment with new media\". Perhaps. But it's hard to weep too deeply for this website we missed and there's always the alternative possibility that Lennon would have been in court with today's living pop stars protecting his royalties from unauthorised downloading. The life of John Lennon had a tragic shape but - as so often in these cases - it can seem a kinder shape than the alternative. </p> <p>\u0095 Lennon Remembers by Jan S Wenner is published by Verso at \u00a313</p>",

      "bodyText": "A sweeping indictment of John Prescott's plans to part-privatise London Underground - commissioned at Labour's insistence - will be published today, threatening to upstage the deputy prime minister's keynote party conference speech on the simmering transport crisis. The government's public-private partnership (PPP) plan for the Tube system should be abandoned in favour of a bond-financed public option, unless tougher safeguards on safety, contract compliance and value-for money are introduced, according to an in dependent report for the London mayor, Ken Livingstone. The review, led by the head of the Industrial Society think tank, Will Hutton, was commissioned as a condition of Labour politicians joining Mr Livingstone's administration. It is based on criteria suggested by Frank Dobson, Labour's London mayoral candidate, and had been welcomed by the party's leadership. But it provides no comfort for the government's scheme, which involves breaking the network into three parts and handing over its infrastructure and maintenance to private firms on 30-year contracts. Mr Prescott's PPP plan, says the report, has been pushed through on the basis of unwarranted assumptions about cost, risk and efficiency advantages; involves potentially serious safety problems; is based on badly-designed contracts and would lead to a loss of democratic accountability. Speaking at a supporters' rally in Brighton yesterday, Mr Livingstone - who will only be given responsibility for the Tube once the private contracts are locked in place - described the Hutton report as \"devastating\" and said it would now be \"almost impossible for the government to go ahead\". He later said the report showed that PPP \"as presently constituted would be unsafe and poor value for money, giving some of the world's nastiest private sector monopolies intolerable leverage over London's elected government\". Although the contracting process is behind schedule, the government currently shows no signs of backing off, despite PPP's unpopularity among core Labour supporters and the hostility of trade unions. The review by Mr Hutton, the former Observer editor, took evidence from all sides, but also commissioned research from a contract theory expert, David Ulph, of University College London, and transport economist Peter White, of Westminster University. Their report is scathing about the state of the Underground and its management, but points out that performance targets for the PPP have been set 5% below even what is being achieved now. It is also sceptical about the extent to which investment risk will really be transferred to the private sector. The design of the PPP has been loaded to favour the private contractors against a notional \"public sector comparator\", Mr Hutton argues, and the government has unreasonably assumed that a public sector option could only secure 6% efficiency gains, compared with over 20% under PPP. The public sector bond option is cheaper unless the private scheme delivers 21% efficiency gains on investment, the reports says. But much higher efficiencies could be expected in the public sector using outside management under a stable investment regime. The report says that under PPP contracts, safety can be traded off against other improvements and warns of recently-leaked health and safety executive fears: \"We insist its concerns be addressed in full if PPP is to go ahead\". Calling for the current national audit office investigation into PPP to be broadened to examine the assumptions behind the scheme, Mr Hutton says: \"Negotiations are effectively being made over the head of the elected mayor in secrecy, notwithstanding the fact that it will be he and his successors for 30 years who will have to operate the PPP.\" \"We conclude,\" the report says, \"that PPP should not proceed\" unless \"it meets much more rigorous safety and value criteria, and if it is substantially amended to protect against the risk that contracts are incomplete and overgenerous.\" Otherwise, Tube modernisation should be financed within the public sector.",

      "bodyText": "A devastating portrait of a wilful and manipulative Princess Diana emerged yesterday from extracts of a book written by her former private secretary, Patrick Jephson, printed in the Sunday Times. Publication of Shadows of a Princess, due to come out in Britain and the US next month, has already been condemned as deplorable by the Queen and the Prince of Wales. But from the extract published yesterday the royal family could take comfort from the fact that the outlines and much of the detail are already well known - and much more damaging to the memory of the princess than to themselves. That may be of small comfort to Mr Jephson, who, although standing to make a great deal of money, knows he will be cast into outer darkness by the Palace and may be stripped of an honour bestowed on him for his service. Both the palace, which sought for two years to stop the book being published, and the newspaper which purchased the revelations may feel they could have been much worse. Mr Jephson was the princess's equerry and then private secretary for more than seven years until January 1996. He watched the breakdown of her marriage and was instrumental in handling the divorce. The author claimed that his book would give a more rounded portrait of the princess than previous publications and that it would be \"entirely positive\" for her sons, Princes William and Harry. \"For them there will be nothing new to learn from this that's harmful and a lot of new stuff that's good,\" the paper quoted him as saying. The book claims the princess referred to the Duke of Edinburgh as \"Stavros\", mocking his Greek roots, and said at one point that her royal jewellery was a reward for \"years of purgatory with this f***ing family\". The book suggests nevertheless that \"a small handful of sugar lumps\" could have wooed her back to the royal family. She \"did not set out to rebel. What in the end was seen as her disaffection was what she did to compensate for a chronic feeling of rejection\". The book claims that Diana found the family emotionally cold and unfriendly and became increasingly reckless in her behaviour, taking a string of lovers - including one smuggled into Kensington Palace in the boot of her car - and becoming paranoid about non-existent plots to bug her conversations or even assassinate her. The author claims she told him that the letter from the Queen in 1995, telling the couple to get a divorce following Diana's Panorama interview, was the first letter her mother-in-law had ever sent her. Mr Jephson says the princess told him she had confronted Camilla Parker-Bowles at a party and asked her to leave Charles alone, but had received a stony response which left her in tears. The princess's 43-year-old former secretary - originally seconded from the Royal Navy, and now running a public relations consultancy and living in Fulham - divulges Diana's ruthless treatment of her staff and her love of dirty jokes. He claims she once exulted in accusing Tiggy Legge-Bourke, her sons' nanny, at a party of having had an abortion. Mr Jephson claims she sent him and other staff members hurtful messages by pager. But he says: \"For all the squandered chances, the stupidity, the occasional downright wickedness, there was something heroic about her just as there was something essentially brutal about those gathered against her.\" Last night a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \"We have said everything we are going to say about this book.\"",

But Mr Brown, the man who can head off a conference revolt on pensions on Wednesday, was far from Brighton at the IMF/World Bank conference in Prague - from where he again signalled his determination not to be stampeded into premature action on either big issue ahead of his Budget next March. The chancellor's absence has hampered negotiations but he will be in Brighton this afternoon to deliver his economic report - stressing that there will be \"no return to the old short-term issues, no sudden lurches in tax or spending policy, no irresponsible pre-election sprees or pay demands we cannot afford\". Wrapped up in his familiar message about economic stability as the key to growth, better public services and social justice, that stern message will not be enough - unless the chancellor also manages to signal that his mid-November pre-Budget report will show flexibility in response to grassroots anger.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of women caught up in a missing frozen embryos scandal have contacted an emergency helpline fearing that their children are not theirs or that their stored embryos have been given to other women, it emerged yesterday. As the embryologist at the centre of the blunder remained in hiding, the two infertility clinics involved confirmed that they had been swamped with calls from distraught women who fear they were either given the wrong embryos or have been told that their hopes of using their stored frozen embryos to conceive a child have been dashed. Some women have had their fertility treatment suspended because the clinics have discovered errors in their patient records relating to their stored embryos. They have been offered the chance to start treatment afresh using a new embryo cycle. Tim Hedgley of Issue, the national fertility association brought in to counsel patients, said there was a strong likelihood that women had been implanted with the wrong embryos . He said the legal ramifications of the mix-up were \"extremely serious\". Parents might be raising children who were not theirs, he said, while women who had embryos stored before undergoing ovarian cancer treatment could face the prospect that their only hope of conceiving had been dashed. The scientist, Paul Fielding, well-known in the world of embryology, has not been seen since being suspended from his post at North Hampshire hospital after human fertility and embryology inspectors found \"inconsistencies between the recording and storage of frozen embryos\" at the hospital's assisted conception unit and at the nearby private Hampshire clinic, where he also worked. The hospital yesterday refused to discuss his whereabouts as women from both clinics underwent counselling. The embryologist's home in the Hampshire village of Whitchurch remained deserted. Visible through the windows were floral tributes marking the recent birth of Benjamin, a second child for Mr Fielding and his wife Alison and a brother for three-year-old Jonathan. The head of the Hampshire clinic, the infertility expert Robert Bates, was said to be devastated by the errors. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, has asked the chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, to prepare an urgent report on the fiasco. The NHS trust hospital, where 10 couples are affected, refused to comment on suggestions that women may have been implanted with the embryos from other couples. The blunder raised the prospect of a potentially massive court case if women gave birth to babies from an embryo which was not theirs. It also raised serious concerns about auditing and inspections by the HFEA, the organisation which monitors and licenses fertility clinics, Issue added. \"If they have a child from embryo transfer then they are saying can we be sure the child is ours, and if they had embryos stored they are asking are their embryos still there,\" said Mr Hedgley. \"This situation could get much worse, given that this embryologist held his post for 10 years.\" The problem came to light two weeks ago when staff at the Hampshire clinic, which treats 140 patients a year, went to retrieve frozen embryos from a cryovessel ready for implantation. Carol Friend, spokeswoman for the clinic, confirmed that they had received calls from several hundred patients who were \"scared witless\" after reading newspaper reports. But she insisted there was \"categorically no possibility\" that any patient had become pregnant with another couple's embryos, given the stringent checks made at each stage of fertility treatment and the fact that the number of patients opting for frozen embryo treatment was small because of the lower success rate. The clinic had stopped using Mr Fielding two months ago although it declined to say whether there had been previous concerns about his performance.",

Most of the attention since the Rawnsley publication has centred on whether Mr Brown misled the public, but Mr Mandelson's critics claim he is also in the dock. On the Dimbleby programme three years ago, he claimed: \"We did not get the first journalist's inquiry about the donation originally made by Mr Ecclestone until Thursday afternoon, evening.

In a provocative intervention on the first day of the Labour conference, the deputy prime minister said Labour had never benefited from co-operation with Liberals. \"Just let it slide away,\" Mr Prescott said about Lib Dem demands for the introduction of proportional representation. I mean what I've seen certainly wasn't to the advantage of the Labour party, was it? \"Put it in a boat and send it away along with the Lib/Labs.\" Mr Prescott was careful not to name the prime minister. But his remarks were aimed directly at Mr Blair whose cherished dream is to realign the centre left by forging closer links between Labour and the Lib Dems. At his first party conference after the 1997 election, Mr Blair spoke of his hopes that the 21st century would be the \"radical\" century as the centre left joined forces to keep the Tories out of power. As a first step, the prime minister appointed a commission under the chairmanship of Lord Jenkins to examine options for reforming Westminster's first past the post electoral system. Mr Prescott was scathing about proportional representation (PR) yesterday and dismissive of Lord Jenkins.

The Bernie Ecclestone row appears to have done little to dampen his party's appetite for cash from corporations and wealthy individuals to fund its election campaign. After rubbing shoulders with the prime minister at a champagne reception, those seeking or selling influence will be called at 8.15pm to enjoy roast rack of lamb or pasta with the Labour leader. Mr Blair, fresh from making the most important conference speech of his political life, is to say a few more words as Lady Jay, Labour's leader in the Lords, plays the party's host for the evening. Strategically placed on each table for 10 in the Oxford suite of the Brighton Hilton Metropole hotel will be an \"eleventh\" guest the diners asked Millbank to deliver. Ministers and MPs ordered to attend will swap gossip with their fellow diners, while defending the government's record and attacking the Tories. The evening formally ends at 10.30pm and 10 minutes later a fleet of coaches leave for Brighton station and the 11.04pm fast train back to London Victoria. Sponsored by Manchester airport, the Blair dinner will generate more than \u00a3200,000 for a party \u00a32m in the red last year and struggling to raise the \u00a320m needed to fight the next election. Since the \u00a33,500 cost per table is below the \u00a35,000 threshold for declaring political donations, Labour need never publish a list of who paid and the companies can write it off as entertainment. Tomorrow night's dinner is the centrepiece of a week-long fundraising drive that will pull in \u00a34m, according to one party official, which even after deducting costs means the Labour conference is likely to turn in a profit. Millbank is defensive as the Ecclestone row rumbles on, but a spokesman maintained that all parties organised fundraising dinners and attending secured no favours for those paying. Labour's goal is to raise 10% of its income from commercial activities, 20% from big donors, 30% from unions and 40% from small donors and members. One corporate executive, dinner invitation in hand, said: \"No one asks for anything or tries to influence ministers but never underestimate what the Americans call 'face power', the value of meeting them face to face.\" Within an hour of finishing his crucial conference speech tomorrow, Mr Blair is due to rub shoulders with valued donors over Earl Grey and cakes to thank them for their past, and probably future, financial support. A two-day blue riband corporate programme is expected to raise in excess of \u00a3100,000 at a cost of \u00a31,351 per head after attracting 80 or so takers who will be granted briefings by parliamentary aides to Gordon Brown, Helen Liddell, Hilary Armstrong and other ministers. Anne Cesek, Labour's corporate relations manager, said in a letter to potential visitors that \"...the aim of the event is to provide an opportunity for business to engage in, both formal and informal, dialogue and discussion with Labour politicians. \"The event includes briefing sessions, seminars, a reserved seat for the leader's speech and a place at the conference dinner\". But the really big money is to be made from charging corporations up to \u00a325,000 to squat for six days in the sprawling exhibition area with the 189 stands leaving the area outside the main hall resembling a trade fair more than a political gathering. Camelot, Virgin Atlantic, Connex, Railtrack, Vodafone, Nestle, Pfeizer, National Express, Transco and the other household names on parade will stump up an estimated \u00a33m between them. Stuart Render, PR manager of the FristGroup bus and train company, said firms attended because it gave them a chance to put their case to opinion formers. \"This is an important way, not a cheap one I agree, to put your message to a wide audience.\"",

      "body": "<p>The whereabouts of the 2,500 most persistent teenage tearaways in England and Wales are to be checked on at least twice a day as part of a major new anti-crime package unveiled yesterday by the home secretary, Jack Straw.</p> <p>The 50 most hardcore repeat young offenders in each city are to be kept under surveillance 24 hours a day seven days a week using electronic tags and voice verification call systems. Some will even be issued with pagers to ensure they call in at the right times and others will find themselves accompanied by probation staff at certain times of the day.</p> <p>The new intensive supervision and surveillance programme was part of a package of measures unveiled by Mr Straw yesterday, designed to blunt the Conservatives' political attack on his record in the run-up to the election, in the face of rising crime figures.</p> <p>Other measures included cutting the reoffending rates of those coming out of prison, improving police detection rates and updating the victim's charter - first introduced in 1996 - with an ombudsman to deal with cases where victims do not get the service they deserve.</p> <p>The home secretary praised the remarkable courage of Sarah Payne's parents and confirmed that a new sex offenders order is to be introduced to ensure they cannot go back and live near their child victims.</p> <p>Mr Straw also defended his record on asylum, insisting that he passionately believed in the rights of those fleeing persecution to seek refuge in Britain. Later this week the home secretary will face a challenge from within his own party to scrap his much criticised \"degrading\" asylum voucher scheme.</p> <p>But it was his new programme for dealing with the hard core of persistent juvenile offenders which proved the centrepiece of his speech yesterday. Cracking down on teenage tearaways has always been a popular measure for home secretaries facing a party conference. Mr Straw's announcement differed from those of his predecessors in that he did not say he was going to lock more of them up.</p> <p>Instead he said better ways of dealing with them outside of prison needed to be found:</p> <p>\"So from next April, a new national programme will make sure that 2,500 hardcore young criminals are supervised in the community not once or twice a fortnight - but every day; seven days a week, 24 hours a day if necessary.</p> <p>\"And we'll make sure they tackle head on their offending behaviour and give them the skills and education they need to turn their backs on crime. That's our approach. Firm supervision, tough standards - yes. But the offer of a helping hand as well.\"</p> <p>Home Office researchers claim that 25% of all youth crime is committed by 3% of young offenders - about 3,500 teenagers.</p> <p>Home Office sources say \u00a345m will be spent over 3 years from next April on this new intensive supervision and surveillance programme.</p> <p>The money will go to about 50 young offending teams in the biggest cities and towns who will each select 50-60 teenagers who have been charged or warned for a serious offence four or more times in the previous 12 months.</p> <p>The programme will last at least six months for each teenager who will have to undergo an education and supervision programme lasting five hours a day on weekdays for the first three months.</p> <p>\"The whereabouts of each young offender will be checked at least twice daily with 24 hours a day, seven days a week surveillance where this is necessary.</p> <p>\"Surveillance techniques, including in the late evenings and the weekends, may include electronic tagging, voice verification, tracking by probation and social work staff and policing,\" said a Home Office source.</p> <p>The 'voice verification' system involves a young offender ringing in at an appointed time to an automatic call machine which is programmed to recognise his voice. Some offenders will be given pagers to remind them to call in and calls would only be accepted from predetermined numbers - such as their home phones - and not mobile numbers.</p> <p>Mr Straw said the scheme was part of his package to ensure that overall crime figures will be lower at the end of Labour's first term than when it came to power. The official recorded crime figures are still six points below their level in May 1997 but the trend has turned upwards in recent months.</p> <p>Last night Harry Fletcher of the National Association of Probation Officers expressed serious doubts about whether keeping a constant eye on the most persistent teenage offenders would do anything to tackle the poverty, social exclusion, and disadvantage that caused their offending.</p>",

The 50 most hardcore repeat young offenders in each city are to be kept under surveillance 24 hours a day seven days a week using electronic tags and voice verification call systems. Some will even be issued with pagers to ensure they call in at the right times and others will find themselves accompanied by probation staff at certain times of the day. The new intensive supervision and surveillance programme was part of a package of measures unveiled by Mr Straw yesterday, designed to blunt the Conservatives' political attack on his record in the run-up to the election, in the face of rising crime figures. Other measures included cutting the reoffending rates of those coming out of prison, improving police detection rates and updating the victim's charter - first introduced in 1996 - with an ombudsman to deal with cases where victims do not get the service they deserve. The home secretary praised the remarkable courage of Sarah Payne's parents and confirmed that a new sex offenders order is to be introduced to ensure they cannot go back and live near their child victims. Mr Straw also defended his record on asylum, insisting that he passionately believed in the rights of those fleeing persecution to seek refuge in Britain. Later this week the home secretary will face a challenge from within his own party to scrap his much criticised \"degrading\" asylum voucher scheme. But it was his new programme for dealing with the hard core of persistent juvenile offenders which proved the centrepiece of his speech yesterday. Cracking down on teenage tearaways has always been a popular measure for home secretaries facing a party conference. Mr Straw's announcement differed from those of his predecessors in that he did not say he was going to lock more of them up. Instead he said better ways of dealing with them outside of prison needed to be found: \"So from next April, a new national programme will make sure that 2,500 hardcore young criminals are supervised in the community not once or twice a fortnight - but every day; seven days a week, 24 hours a day if necessary. \"And we'll make sure they tackle head on their offending behaviour and give them the skills and education they need to turn their backs on crime. That's our approach. Firm supervision, tough standards - yes. But the offer of a helping hand as well.\" Home Office researchers claim that 25% of all youth crime is committed by 3% of young offenders - about 3,500 teenagers. Home Office sources say \u00a345m will be spent over 3 years from next April on this new intensive supervision and surveillance programme. The money will go to about 50 young offending teams in the biggest cities and towns who will each select 50-60 teenagers who have been charged or warned for a serious offence four or more times in the previous 12 months. The programme will last at least six months for each teenager who will have to undergo an education and supervision programme lasting five hours a day on weekdays for the first three months. \"The whereabouts of each young offender will be checked at least twice daily with 24 hours a day, seven days a week surveillance where this is necessary. \"Surveillance techniques, including in the late evenings and the weekends, may include electronic tagging, voice verification, tracking by probation and social work staff and policing,\" said a Home Office source. The 'voice verification' system involves a young offender ringing in at an appointed time to an automatic call machine which is programmed to recognise his voice. Some offenders will be given pagers to remind them to call in and calls would only be accepted from predetermined numbers - such as their home phones - and not mobile numbers. Mr Straw said the scheme was part of his package to ensure that overall crime figures will be lower at the end of Labour's first term than when it came to power. The official recorded crime figures are still six points below their level in May 1997 but the trend has turned upwards in recent months. Last night Harry Fletcher of the National Association of Probation Officers expressed serious doubts about whether keeping a constant eye on the most persistent teenage offenders would do anything to tackle the poverty, social exclusion, and disadvantage that caused their offending.",

      "bodyText": "A new warning issued by the Medicines Control Agency, stating that people may feel suicidal in the first few weeks of taking Prozac and similar antidepressants, is dangerously misleading and could lead to more deaths, according to a leading authority on the drugs. David Healy, director of the North Wales Department of Psychological Medicine in Bangor, has told the MCA that among those who are not severely depressed - who are the majority of those now being given antidepressants - it is the drugs, and not the illness, that make people want to kill themselves. The warning will lead to doctors keeping their patients on the drugs in the assumption that the medication will eventually make them better, when they need to be taken off. The new warning is the MCA's response to increasing public concern over suicides among people on drugs in the Prozac class. The agency has instructed manufacturers to include it in the drug datasheets for doctors and information leaflets for patients. It states that suicidal thoughts may occur or increase in the early weeks of treatment, and may continue for some time until the drug takes effect. But Dr Healy, the UK's leading historian of antidepressant medication, believes it is the drugs themselves that are causing some people to feel like killing themselves - not depression. And if, as the patient leaflet warning states, there is an increase in suicidal thoughts, he says, it can only be due to an effect of the drug. But increasingly the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are being given to adults and children who are not depressed, but merely anxious and who should therefore have no suicidal feelings. Dr Healy has written to Keith Jones, director of the MCA, pointing to two studies - one of them carried out by his own team - showing that healthy volunteers with no history of depression have become dangerously suicidal after taking one of the SSRI class of drugs for a couple of weeks. \"This will lead to deaths,\" he told Dr Jones in a letter. \"Your advice will lead to a situation where patients who worsen on treatment will be kept on that treatment by their GPs in the belief that it is only in this way that the suicide risk can ultimately be lowered. This is mistaken advice that is going to increase the rate at which patients move from emergent suicidality[beginning to feel suicidal] to suicidal acts.\" Earlier this year, Dr Healy published a study of the effects of one of the SSRIs, sertraline, on 20 healthy volunteers.

Yet the MCA will not accept that this, and other SSRIs, can cause people to feel suicidal as a side-effect. The MCA's decision to require a new warning with the SSRIs was taken after a review of the data by the Committee on the Safety of Medicines. The MCA said in a statement that the CSM had considered both the healthy volunteer studies as part of the overall risk assessment. \"The CSM concluded that reports of suicidal thoughts in healthy volunteers were difficult to explain, however, other data were reassuring.

Only this time it was a pair of unfortunate Germans who were at the centre of a hot air emergency. It began on Friday as Peter Wittman, 32, and Heinrich Brachtendorf, 67, climbed into their basket in the German town of Marl, north of Essen, and took to the skies alongside fellow ballooning enthusiasts as part of a competition to see who could stay in the air the longest - but at least they won. The pair, however, probably did not intend to stay up quite as long as they did. In the early hours of Saturday morning, a radar operator at a military air traffic control centre in London spotted an unexpected blip on his screen. Noting that something was awry, the operator informed the RAF. Immediately, the air rescue co-ordination centre, at Kin loss, swung into action. A Sea King helicopter was scrambled and at around 9.30pm it was able to define exactly what had caused the blip. In the stormy skies over the coast of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, the German balloonists, who had by now sent out a distress signal, were more than a few miles off course - and were heading even further afield. \"A search and rescue helicopter followed the balloon up the east coast until it went into the area of RAF Boulmer in Northumberland,\" said a Min istry of Defence spokesman. As strong winds blew the balloon up the coast, it became apparent that the Germans were now heading for Scotland, if not out to sea. Forth coastguard scrambled its rescue team from Carnoustie, near Dundee, and RNLI lifeboats from Arbroath and Broughty Ferry were launched. But amid the poor visibility of mist and clouds, an RAF pilot succeeded in making contact with the German crew. \"Near Dundee an RAF helicopter managed to talk the crew down and they were met on the ground by police,\" said the MoD spokesman. The pair landed near a beach at Carnoustie at 3.40am on Saturday, though an RAF spokesman pointed out things could have been far worse. \"If they had continued they would have run into a storm in the Cairngorms and then the next spot they would have been able to put down would have been the Faroe Islands,\" he said. Mr Wittman and Mr Bracht endorf say they were not scared. \"We just concentrated on keeping ourselves up,\" said Mr Wittman. They were, however, surprised by where their competition finally brought them. Mr Wittman said: \"There is no set flight path, you just go up, but we didn't mean to end up over Scotland.\" The pair were airborne for almost a day and they did, at least, manage to win their competition, though perhaps not quite in the style they would have wished.",

      "bodyText": "The Canadian government tried to breathe new life into the west's faltering programme of debt forgiveness yesterday, calling on other creditor countries to support an immediate halt to debt repayments by the world's poorest states. Leaders from the Group of Seven main industrial countries promised last June that 24 states would be offered help in paying off their debts by the end of 2000. But with less than four months to go, only 10 have begun receiving relief under the heavily indebted poor countries programme (HIPC). \"At a time of unprecedented prosperity in many industrialised economies, it is unacceptable that the promised debt relief has not been delivered,\" Paul Martin, the Canadian finance minister, said. \"The HIPC process has been too slow. We made a commitment last year to faster action and we must make good on this commitment.\" The delays are one of the issues drawing protesters to the streets of Prague this week for the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Mr Martin added that an immediate debt moratorium would free resources for heavily indebted poor countries to spend on health and education programmes. Britain gave a cautious welcome to the idea, but a treasury source said the Canadian proposal to speed things along would have to be studied in more detail. Aid agencies suppored a moratorium, saying it would be a chance for a complete overhaul of the HIPC programme. \"Canada's call for a moratorium is indicative of the need to take HIPC back to the drawing board,\" said Karen Joyner, a spokeswoman for Christian Aid. The programme as it stands, she said, \"provides too little debt relief to too few countries too slowly.\" The new managing director of the IMF, Horst K\u00f6hler, has promised to ease the requirements countries must meet to qualify for the debt programme, one of the main causes of delay. But aid agencies say the pledge from Mr Kohler has yet to filter through his organisation which they claim is still prescribing detailed reform programmes which countries must achieve before they can receive debt relief. The Canadian plan would exclude states such as Liberia and Sudan which it says are \"not currently committed to the principles of good governance, including protection of human rights\".",

But it also underlined the welcome return to a more activist approach. </p> <p>A cynical view would be that the west can act when it is in its interests. America's support for intervention to reduce the value of the dollar was prompted by the earbashing the Clinton administration has been getting from multinationals unhappy about the impact of a weak euro on export earnings from Europe. But when Canada's finance minister, Paul Martin, urged creditor countries to support a moratorium on debt repayments from the world's poorest countries there was no obvious selfish motive. </p> <p>The importance of the actions on Friday and Saturday is that they legitimise intervention in other spheres, from trade to the environment. Once it has been accepted that markets need to be managed by strong and effective institutions, all sorts of possibilities open up. Policymakers have been made painfully aware in the past couple of weeks how easy it is for a combination of fuel shortages and just-in-time production methods to bring a modern economy to a standstill. There is far greater willingness for action - both individually and collectively - to tackle market imperfections and market failures. </p> <p>The IMF's half-yearly world economic outlook, released last week, provided an excellent overview of the state of play. While the dark clouds that hovered over the global economy two years ago have lifted, the fund warned that there could be more on the horizon. In particular, it expressed concern about the \"misalignments among major currencies\", the risk of a supply shock caused by higher oil prices and that there could be a sharp correction in US share prices. </p> <p>To be fair to the fund, it has been highlighting the risks of a hard landing in the US for some time, but until now nobody took its comments seriously. The status of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan as the man who can master markets has left Americans convinced that a soft landing is inevitable. They have just started to grasp the idea that nobody - not even the redoubtable Mr Greenspan - is perfect and that in recent years soft landings have all too often turned into crash landings. </p> <p>The strength of the dollar has allowed Americans to believe that the good times can go on for ever. A strong currency has kept inflation low and attracted enough foreign capital to allow the US to continue living beyond its means and to keep the stock market over-valued. When Mr Greenspan cut interest rates two years ago, that helped save the global economy from meltdown, but gave a boost to the US economy at a time when it should have been getting a touch on the brakes. </p> <p>Monetary policy was subsequently tightened, however, and is now having an effect. Higher interest rates and an over-valued currency mean that the economy is slowing pretty rapidly, something which has been lost on foreign exchange dealers but not on the men and women who run American corporations. As Larry Summers, the US treasury secretary, made clear on Friday, Washington is not abandoning its strong dollar policy, but its support for the intervention to defend the euro suggests that it would like a euro-dollar exchange rate of between 90 and 95 cents. </p> <p><strong> Shortening the odds</strong><br> </p> <p> Markets will test the resolve of the G7 this week, and it is crucial that the authorities are not found wanting. Intervention is not like a poker game where you can fold early; having gambled, you have to stick it out. It is true that investment flows reveal great confidence in the US economy, but there is a long history of investors piling into countries just at the moment when the economy is about to take a turn for the worse. </p> <p>Rising oil prices are an added complication, because they cause a loss of real incomes at a time when the labour market in the US is tight. Inflation will rise if workers try to compensate for the reduction in purchasing power by bargaining for higher pay. In those circumstances, interest rates would go up still further, shortening the odds on a hard landing. The communique issued by the G7 at the end of its meeting on Saturday underlined the concern about escalating energy costs, but that is a less significant problem than misaligned exchange rates. Much of the recent rise has been the result of speculation in the futures markets and will unwind once it becomes apparent that the US and Europe are slowing. </p> <p>So, if the US can see some merit in co-ordinated action on the world stage, so much the better. Now is the time for those who have campaigned hard for debt relief, for fairer trade rules, for a more democratic system of international governance, and for reform of the bank and the fund to redouble their efforts. Globalisation has spawned its own opposition in the form of non-governmental organisations that have proved effective in exposing the weakness and inadequacies of the current international order. The NGOs are right to say that much still needs to be done to curb the violent excesses of the global financial markets, protect the environment and to tackle poverty in the developing world. The series of catastrophes - financial, political and environmental - that started in Thailand in 1997 and culminated in Seattle only served to underline the point. </p> <p>Some of these developments appear to have been lost on those who have turned up in Prague with the hope that they can abolish the bank and the fund as the first stage in putting an end to globalisation. Even in its basic conception, this plan makes little sense because the real power in the global economy is vested with the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7, not the bureaucrats in the Bretton Woods institutions. The bank and the fund act for the G7 in much the same way as Whitehall does for the Cabinet; they translate decisions into actions. Ultimately they take their orders from their big shareholders, the G7. Anybody who tried to argue that Britain would be better off without a civil service would be given short shrift, and rightly so. </p> <p>However, the real objection to those who propose smashing up the international system is that they do not have any idea what should replace it. The vague hankering for a pre-industrial utopia may appeal to well-heeled eco-toffs, for whom real hardship is when the gardener fails to turn up twice a week, but it is the politics of sixth-form common rooms, not the real world.

Ms Thomson, Colin's girlfriend, was due to be a key prosecution witness in a drugs case faced by the brothers.</p> <p>Wood was granted parole last week and a Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that he would be back in Britain by the end of the month.</p> <p>\"Philip Wood is due to be released around the end of September and the instruction from the Canadian authorities is that he will be deported,\" she said. She could not say when Wood would arrive in Britain or where he would stay. A prisoner release organisation was helping him find accommodation.</p> <p>David Wood is also eligible for parole but he is reported to have agreed to stay in prison for a further three months to complete psychiatric treatment. It is understood he will also return to Britain when released.</p> <p>Colin Wood escaped from prison in 1994 and spent three years on the run before he was tracked down in Alabama. He is due to spend three more years in prison before he is deported to Britain.</p> <p>A row broke out in 1997 when it emerged that the men were likely be deported. Canadian immigration officials said the brothers were not technically Canadian citizens and, under Canadian law, anyone serving more than 10 years in prison can be returned to their country of origin.</p> <p>As Wood and his brothers have not been convicted of a crime in Britain, they will not be subject to any form of supervision. Three years ago the MP Henry McLeish, then a Scottish Office minister, said he would petition Jack Straw, the home secretary, for changes in the immigration law regarding parole.</p> <p>Mr McLeish said he wanted to ensure that criminals returning to Britain were subject to the same constraints as those released from British prisons. But the law has not yet been changed.</p> <p>The Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman, Phil Gallie, said the deportation of Wood was deeply worrying. \"I think Canada is backing out of its moral responsibility by sending him here but we do not have the right to interfere in another country's processes, so we have to cater for the situation we are stuck with.\"</p> <p>The Wood brothers became involved with a notorious gang in Toronto in their teenage years. By the time they reached their 20s, they ran a drugs and crime syndicate. Between them they have more than 100 convictions for drugs offences, assaults and theft.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of a group of gangland brothers, dubbed the Canadian Krays, is to be deported to Britain this month after he is released on parole. Scots-born Philip Wood, 44, has served 14 years of a life sentence for murdering a 21-year-old woman who was due to give evidence against him in a drugs trial. He emigrated to Canada as a child from Ayrshire in 1965, but he does not have full citizenship and the Canadian authorities insist he must return to Britain. In 1986, Wood and his brothers, David, 47, and Colin, 42, murdered Karen Thomson by attacking her then throwing her into Lake Ontario to drown. Ms Thomson, Colin's girlfriend, was due to be a key prosecution witness in a drugs case faced by the brothers. Wood was granted parole last week and a Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that he would be back in Britain by the end of the month. \"Philip Wood is due to be released around the end of September and the instruction from the Canadian authorities is that he will be deported,\" she said. She could not say when Wood would arrive in Britain or where he would stay. A prisoner release organisation was helping him find accommodation. David Wood is also eligible for parole but he is reported to have agreed to stay in prison for a further three months to complete psychiatric treatment. It is understood he will also return to Britain when released. Colin Wood escaped from prison in 1994 and spent three years on the run before he was tracked down in Alabama. He is due to spend three more years in prison before he is deported to Britain. A row broke out in 1997 when it emerged that the men were likely be deported. Canadian immigration officials said the brothers were not technically Canadian citizens and, under Canadian law, anyone serving more than 10 years in prison can be returned to their country of origin. As Wood and his brothers have not been convicted of a crime in Britain, they will not be subject to any form of supervision. Three years ago the MP Henry McLeish, then a Scottish Office minister, said he would petition Jack Straw, the home secretary, for changes in the immigration law regarding parole. Mr McLeish said he wanted to ensure that criminals returning to Britain were subject to the same constraints as those released from British prisons. But the law has not yet been changed. The Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman, Phil Gallie, said the deportation of Wood was deeply worrying. \"I think Canada is backing out of its moral responsibility by sending him here but we do not have the right to interfere in another country's processes, so we have to cater for the situation we are stuck with.\" The Wood brothers became involved with a notorious gang in Toronto in their teenage years. By the time they reached their 20s, they ran a drugs and crime syndicate. Between them they have more than 100 convictions for drugs offences, assaults and theft.",

The acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, leaves for Cairo today, where he is to sound out Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, on a proposal to transfer sovereignty of the Temple Mount, or Haram al-Sharif - 86 hectares of hallowed ground on the most fiercely contested hilltop in the Middle East - to the supervision of the five permanent members of the UN security council. He is also due to talk later in the week with King Abdullah of Jordan, who has played a pivotal role in the tantalisingly slow search for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr Ben Ami's mission coincides with American efforts to convene a new meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Of the 460 hours devoted to peacemaking at the Camp David summit attended by both last July, the two men only spent one hour together. The very notion that the UN could be part of the solution for the Haram al-Sharif, where history, emotion and religion collide, represents a staggering change in Israeli government policy. The idea is believed to have resurfaced now as an attempt by Israel to counter a proposal by the Palestinians earlier this month, to lodge sovereignty for the site with the Jerusalem committee of the Organisation of Islamic Countries. The Haram is sacred to Muslims for the shimmering gold Dome of the Rock that marks the spot where the prophet Mohammed is said to have ascended to heaven; and to Jews, who revere it as the site of their temple, which was destroyed in 70AD, and where God is meant to have called Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. From insisting that Israel would remain sole sovereign of Jerusalem, including all areas of Arab East Jerusalem occupied since 1967, the prime minister, Ehud Barak, has abandoned a whole series of shibboleths in the space of two months. Since the Camp David meeting ended without agreement in the summer, Israeli officials have floated a bewildering number of proposals for resolving the status of the Haram al-Sharif. The most ingenious include divine sovereignty - handing the whole site over to God's control; and vertical sovereignty - with Palestinians the absolute rulers above ground, and Israelis the master of what lies beneath. Since 1967, Muslim authorities appointed by Jordan have controlled the mosques.

A tent city set up in Strahov stadium in the west of the city to house up to 15,000 people had attracted only about 200 campers by yesterday afternoon, causing its manager to cut the entry price. Many said they chose not to stay there out of fear that the police would trap them inside. The Czech president, Vaclav Havel, held a meeting to bring together elements from both sides. James Wolfensohn and Horst K\u00f6hler, heads of the IMF and World Bank, joined Mary Robinson, the former Irish president, and financier George Soros to debate with NGOs. Mr Havel said the dialogue was vital, because \"we are all doomed to live on this planet, we cannot emigrate elsewhere\". Later, during a walk in the gardens of Prague castle, Indonesian and African activists had some heated exchanges with Mr Havel and other leaders. The protesters' strategy for tomorrow was being finalised at a former ship-building yard on Libensky island in the north of Prague where several hundred people gathered. Representatives laid out plans of the city to decide how they would surround the conference centre. There were lessons in using non-violent direct action and on using gas masks. Ex-army shops have reported brisk sales of the masks in recent days.",

The medicines were part of a consignment of 1.4m Ventolin inhalers - a treatment for asthma and other respiratory conditions - ordered by Iraq from Glaxo-Wellcome. Iraq said recently that more than 10,000 people had died during July as a result of sanctions, and cited respiratory problems as one of the main causes of death. There have been many claims that Iraq is re-exporting its humanitarian aid while complaining about the impact of sanctions on its own people, but this is believed to be the first time that a manufacturer has positively identified a batch of re-exported medicines. Glaxo-Wellcome sent the Ventolin to Beirut where it was handed over to the Iraqi ministry of transport to be taken to Iraq in nine lorries Soon afterwards, aggrieved Lebanese pharmacists reported that cut-price Ventolin was on sale in Beirut.

      "bodyText": "The world's leading industrial nations stepped up pressure on oil producers last night to increase supplies of crude oil to the west after expressing serious concern about the impact of higher energy prices on rich and poor countries. A strongly worded statement from the International Monetary Fund's key decision-making committee warned of the dangers of higher inflation and slower growth resulting from more expensive oil and put the onus on Opec to announce fresh output increases at its summit in Caracas, Venezuela, this week. The IMF's move followed tough language on Saturday from the G7 nations which called on the oil cartel to take immediate action to reverse the recent trend in oil prices, which has seen the cost of a barrel of crude triple from around $10 to $32.60 since the start of last year. Horst K\u00f6hler, the managing director of the IMF, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, who chairs the fund's international monetary and finance committee, met Hamad Al-Sayari, governor of Saudi Arabia's central bank, yesterday in an attempt to broker a deal with oil producers. This will be followed up by the French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, who will write to all producer countries this week pressing for action to increase production. Mr K\u00f6hler said he was confident that progress would soon be made, adding that both oil producers and oil consumers among the IMF's 182 member governments were worried about recent trends in prices. A statement issued at the end of yesterday's meeting of the IMF committee - which includes Saudi Arabia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates among its 24 members - underlined the concerted attempt by the west to bring prices down. It said: \"The committee is concerned that current oil prices, if sustained, could hamper global growth, add to inflationary pressures, and adversely affect prospects for many countries.\" The communique added that there was joint agreement on the need to stabilise oil markets around reasonable long-term prices. \"The committee notes the steps the oil-producing countries have taken this year to increase production and calls on them to take further steps to create conditions in oil markets conducive to healthy global growth.\" Mr Brown said he was encouraged by the amount of common ground between oil consuming and producing countries. Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said that Britain was better placed than many to absorb the impact of higher oil prices because inflation was below the government's 2.5% target. But he said the Bank's monetary policy committee would be watching closely to make sure that higher oil prices did not feed through into higher prices in the rest of the economy. In a communique released after its meeting on Saturday, the G7 welcomed the US decision to release oil from its strategic stockpile, adding: \"It is important that world oil prices return to a level consistent with lasting global economic prosperity and stability for both oil producing and consuming countries and, in particular, for the poor developing countries. \"In the light of continuing high prices and low level of stocks, it is crucial for the world economy that Opec and other oil producing countries take actions to contribute to a reduction in oil prices and greater stability in oil markets.\" Stung by the virulence of fuel protests and fearful that higher oil prices could lead to a recession, the G7 said it had to make more efficient use of energy. But it made it clear that Opec was being held primarily responsible for bringing prices down to a range of between $22 and $28 a barrel.

This latest docu-drama by Peter Kosminksy - whose previous news-driven dramas include the multi-prize-winning Warriors, about the British army in Bosnia - reconstructs events at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, when the unusually high death-on-the-table rate of two heart surgeons operating on babies was followed by the revelation that the tiny hearts stopped during surgery had been removed from the corpses for research. </p> <p>Many previous Kosminsky films have dealt with equivocal material.

Unless King Herod happens to be watching British television next Sunday night, there's no dramatic conflict in the piece. A boxing referee would have stopped it the moment the contestants rose from their stools. </p> <p>This is only a small weakness, though, because this isn't a \"what happened?\" but a \"how did it happen?\" piece. While the question in Shoot To Kill was \"Who is right?\", the central question here is this: how were the qualms of parents and doctor colleagues ignored for so long? And while, the drama is inevitably heart-rending, Kosminsky's direction and Neil McKay's script aren't actively sentimental. They bomb no milk factories. </p> <p>The Hollywood possibilities - shots of favourite teddies looking sad, speeches about the babies being with the angels now, soprano choirs on the soundtrack - are entirely avoided. The terror of all parents - the death of children - is, for once, presented cold and bleak and clinical without dramatic manipulation or soppy consolation. </p> <p>This is especially impressive when you remember that Kosminsky is dealing with the heartland material of TV soap opera: the most shameless ratings-chasing storylines in Casualty or Holby City involve the medical peril of young children. In fact, this director's brilliance might be defined as using the worlds of popular drama to tell important stories without the sentimental conventions of those genres. </p> <p>Drama-documentary has always seemed to me a problematic form. The script can only ever be a compromise between the mouths of the real-life subjects, the ears of the dramatist and the eyes of both sides' lawyers. During any brilliant dramatic scene - the moment here, for instance, when Dhasmana watches a video made by another surgeon in the hope of learning where he's going wrong - you worry about whether the moment was as neat and powerful as this in reality. The viewer must trust the director and writer like a patient trusts the surgeon. But Kosminsky has by now earned our trust. The Bristol doctors were finally found out by their hit rates. Kosminsky's hit rate is his best defence. </p> <p>There'll be much more to say in future weeks about Simon Schama's epic Millennial series History Of Britain (Beginnings, Sunday, 8.05pm, BBC2) but, by coincidence, it contains an extraordinary moment in which the historian stands before a display case of baubles given by Victorian mothers to the children they were handing over to foundling hospitals. One gift is a walnut with a hole drilled into it, intended to be worn as a pendant. Many viewers will have a rather teary gaze at the screen by the time Schama reveals that the making of these pieces was an emotional placebo: they were never given to the children. </p> <p>By coincidence, I watched this sequence just before viewing Innocents. And if it seemed as if the Schama scene should carry a warning for those with children, there would be a case for blocking transmission of Innocents to houses in which parents are slumped on sofas listening to the deep-sleep breathing from upstairs.

Best line: \"Suck my nose till my head caves in.\" Sorry. Cringe factor: In the 13 years since The Gate, Dorff's acting skills haven't developed a jot... Other wannabes: The subsequent career of Louis Tripp, who plays Glen's friend Terry, extends to playing Terry again in Gate II: The Trespassers (1990). Critical judgement: \"A worthless first half,\" opines Leonard Maltin, \"is somewhat redeemed by amusing/scary special effects in the second.\" Also not starring in: Dorff had a recurring role in Roseanne, and popped up in the 1989 TV movie Do You Know The Muffin Man?

      "body": "<p>Nicholas Edwards was finally found guilty of rape at the Old Bailey last week. It was his eighth trial on rape charges, but what was unusual was that this time the jury knew something of his history. In most rape trials the 12 men and women who have to decide the accused's fate are kept in the dark, unaware whether the man before them has a long history - in Edwards' case, 19 years - of forcing women to have sex with him. Edwards had been twice before convicted of rape and acquitted five times.</p> <p>Each time he admitted that sexual intercourse took place, but claimed that the women consented. As his story shows, by no means all men acquitted of rape are innocent. Some are serial rapists and many, like Edwards, have repeatedly got away with it. But a landmark ruling by the law lords, which saw the 39-year-old welder put away for life last week, could put many more behind bars.</p> <p>Edwards was one of the serial rapists documented in a 1993 edition of Channel 4's Dispatches programme, Getting Away with Rape, after he was acquitted for the fourth time. In the latest trial he claimed to have had sex with 2,000 women. But how many of his conquests consented? After the trial started, two more women came forward to say Edwards had raped them too. A nurse who accused Edwards of raping her in the early 1990s replied when she was accused of lying in the witness box: \"Do you think I'm going to put myself through this ordeal and waste all the time of the police and courts if it didn't happen?\"</p> <p>Yet Edwards was acquitted. He smiled and clapped when the not guilty verdict was announced, and bowed to the jurors, saying: \"Thank you very much. Cheers.\"</p> <p>Far more men are acquitted of rape than convicted. The conviction rate for reported rapes has dropped from 24% in 1985 to a mere 7% today. This is in spite of advances in DNA analysis which enable separate rapes to be linked. At the same time, the proportion of rapes committed by strangers has dwindled to a mere 12% of reported cases, according to the Home Office's most recent analysis, published in 1999. Stranger rapists use the defence of identification rather than consent and with advances in DNA analysis, identity can now usually be proved.</p> <p>Serial rapists may well be learning different tactics once they realise that they are much more likely to get off if they chat up their victim beforehand and then argue that the woman consented. This could explain, at least in part, the drop in the proportion of stranger rapes. Edwards was not the mythical unknown rapist who leaps on his victims in the dark. His crimes, like most rapes, could be categorised as \"date rape\" - a term often used loosely and inappropriately to cover any rape between acquaintances. The term implies that the rape is somehow less serious, that it happened almost accidentally when the man misread the signals given by the woman. But Edwards did not misread signals. He planned his rapes carefully and they fell into a common pattern. His victims were not long-standing girlfriends but women he had met only a short time before and apparently targeted.</p> <p>In the latest trial, four of the women who had accused him and had their accusations dismissed by previous juries were allowed to testify following a historic ruling of the House of Lords last June. They were joined by another woman whose story had led to one of his two previous convictions. All recounted being raped by him in strikingly similar circumstances.</p> <p>In each case, he first went up to the woman in a public place. He adopted a low-key approach to gain her confidence, making a date for another meeting. At the second meeting, he continued to chat her up and then isolated her, in most cases by driving her to a secluded spot - in two cases to the same churchyard. Then he changed from Jekyll to Hyde. His mood, previously calm, became angry and he became a domineering, terrifying bully, forcing his victims to give in to his demands. He refused to use a condom and intercourse was accompanied in each case by comments and instructions from him, telling the girl what to do. Afterwards he reverted to friendliness, often denying that anything untoward had occurred.</p> <p>Like many serial rapists, Edwards has adopted more sophisticated tactics and become more adept at avoiding conviction. In the first case that came to court, in 1983, he held a knife to the victim's throat. The knife was produced in court and this led to his conviction. He never used a weapon again. In the latest case, he managed to persuade the woman to go to his south London flat. As he would know, juries rarely convict where a woman is raped after accepting an invitation to the man's home. This case would probably not even have come to trial if the other women had not been allowed to give evidence.</p> <p>That breakthrough followed a legal battle by the crown prosecution service to get the evidence in front of the jury. Judges have a discretion to allow juries to hear evidence that the accused has behaved in a similar way in other cases - so called \"similar fact\" evidence - if the details show a strikingly similar pattern of behaviour. The judge has to decide whether the value of the evidence in proving the charges is so strong that it outweighs the prejudice to the accused. If so, and if admitting the evidence will not make the trial unfair, it can be allowed in.</p> <p>But there was a stumbling block. In a 1950 case the privy council had ruled that a jury verdict was binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings. For the past 50 years that had been interpreted to mean that once an accused was acquitted, no evidence to show that he had actually committed the offence could be brought forward at a later trial. To do so, it was thought, would breach the \"double jeopardy\" rule by which no one can be tried twice for the same crime, a cornerstone of the British justice system.</p> <p>The trial judge disallowed the evidence. The prosecution took the matter to the appeal court, which dismissed it, ruling that a prior acquittal not only precluded a second prosecution for the same offence but also barred the crown from citing evidence in a later prosecution that showed that the defendant was actually guilty of the charge of which he had been acquitted. The court reached this decision \"with regret\" and gave permission for an appeal to the Lords.</p> <p>The law lords allowed the prosecution's appeal, overruling the 1950 judgment and setting a new precedent. The five judges said that allowing the women to give their evidence would not breach the double jeopardy rule because Edwards was not now at risk of conviction on the earlier rape charges, but only on the charge for which he was standing trial. The evidence was relevant and came within the ambit of the \"similar fact\" rule, and was not inadmissible just because it tended to show that the defendant was in fact guilty of offences of which he had earlier been acquitted.</p> <p>It is a controversial change and not all lawyers agree with it. The law lords' ruling was in line with a recent Law Commission report on double jeopardy, but Andrew Trollope QC, who chaired the Criminal Bar Association group that responded to the Law Commission paper, believes the change breaches the principle that underlies the rule of double jeopardy. \"You may easily draw the conclusion that because a man's been accused of rape eight times over, he must be guilty. That's a very dangerous road to go down. You have to remember that in those instances, or a number of those instances, the facts have been closely examined by previous courts and that there has been a doubt in each case.\" Bruce Houlder QC, vice-chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, argues on the other hand that it \"defies common sense\" to exclude such evidence.</p> <p>The change in the law can be seen as an acknowledgment that multiple rapists are going free and that something needs to be done about the high acquittal rate. The acquittal of serial rapists is far more common than often imagined.</p> <p>Very few men rape only once, and with this change more guilty men will be brought to justice. Perhaps at last the dramatic drop in the conviction rate will be reversed. Women should be encouraged to report rapes and to give evidence in court after this landmark decision.</p> <p>\u0095 Sue Lees is professor of women's studies at the University of North London and author of Carnal Knowledge: Rape on Trial.

      "body": "<p>It was a little sneaky of the Lord Chancellor's department to release their most important publication of the year when they knew I was away on a crucial summer research trip in the south of France. I refer, of course, to the long-awaited and much-speculated-on Media Guide for the Judges, which had gone through more revisions than James Joyce's Ulysses. To take a typical issue that had been bothering me for years: what should a judge do on finding a reporter outside his or her house? Should he follow the imaginative example of the now retired Mr Justice Harman, whose solution was to kick the reporter in the goolies, only to be told that the chap was in fact the cabbie driving him to court? Try unsuccessfully to hide his face with a poorly positioned white handkerchief or newspaper (also a Harman ploy)? Swear at the reporter, coupling it with an invitation to settle the matter right there and then, pugilistically? Alas, all the above have found their way to the \"don't\" section of the advice, although I believe that some of them were controversially transferred from the \"do\" only at the last minute.</p> <p>The \"do\" section urges judges to stay calm and polite, and look friendly. But one piece of advice goes further, urging the judges, virtually in so many words, to behave like a lone Clint Eastwood unexpectedly confronted by a band of outlaws: \"If you find yourself at the centre of a media scrum - stop walking momentarily. You will find that the reporters and photographers will naturally back off to give you space. Having established a degree of control, continue on.\" Wow, that's what I call judicial fightin' talk. But what if we don't back away?</p> <p>\u0095 The law lords sitting on the privy council also managed to slip in a dramatically important judgment in my absence. In an appeal from Jamaica by prisoners on death row, the judges ruled - overturning a long line of previous decisions - that the prisoners should not be executed until their petitions to international bodies such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had been ruled on. The point is that death row prisoners in almost all Caribbean countries make pleas to such bodies; until now the state could disregard them and execute even when the cases were still pending. Potentially, the privy council decision will save many lives and change the face of capital punishment in the Caribbean.</p> <p>The decision wasn't unanimous. Lord Hoffman dissented. Not for the first time - I choose my words carefully - he has come out in favour of an interpretation of the law that has the effect of allowing the death penalty. In at least one case he was in a 3-2 majority, and prisoners were executed as a result. This time he was alone.</p> <p>\u0095 The National Film Theatre and Geoffrey Robertson QC's Doughty Street Chambers have compiled an interesting selection of courtroom dramas to be shown at the NFT during October, many of them introduced or discussed by John Mortimer and various QCs. The 15 films include some of the classics (Twelve Angry Men, Judgment at Nuremberg, Inherit the Wind, the underrated Anatomy of a Murder) and a televised version of the brilliant play about the Steve Biko inquest, with Albert Finney playing the barrister Sydney Kentridge. It's a pity that the organisers were (presumably) unable to get hold of what, for me, are the two most satisfying courtroom dramas of them all: To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution. On the other hand, I am much relieved that the programme doesn't include In the Name of the Father, the Hollywoodised story of the Guildford Four, the courtroom scenes of which are the most ludicrous and wildly inaccurate ever seen on a cinema screen. The film versions of Judge Dredd and the Queen of Hearts's sentencing process in Alice in Wonderland are models of careful research in comparison (though admittedly \"Off with her head\" was not a valid sentence at the time, due to lack of a guillotine).</p> <p>\u0095 I don't do plugs in this column, but I cannot remember the last time I was so impressed with a book about the law. It explains and demystifies the English legal system - how it works , who is in it - simply yet with authority, clearly yet comprehensively. \"A kind of upbeat legal mixture of Madame Bovary, As You Like It and La Traviata. I loved every page.\" (Albert Einstein). The title is The Law Machine (5th edition), published by Penguin, by Marcel Berlins (a columnist) and Clare Dyer, legal correspondent of this parish.</p>",

Alas, all the above have found their way to the \"don't\" section of the advice, although I believe that some of them were controversially transferred from the \"do\" only at the last minute. The \"do\" section urges judges to stay calm and polite, and look friendly. But one piece of advice goes further, urging the judges, virtually in so many words, to behave like a lone Clint Eastwood unexpectedly confronted by a band of outlaws: \"If you find yourself at the centre of a media scrum - stop walking momentarily. You will find that the reporters and photographers will naturally back off to give you space. Having established a degree of control, continue on.\" Wow, that's what I call judicial fightin' talk. But what if we don't back away? \u0095 The law lords sitting on the privy council also managed to slip in a dramatically important judgment in my absence. In an appeal from Jamaica by prisoners on death row, the judges ruled - overturning a long line of previous decisions - that the prisoners should not be executed until their petitions to international bodies such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had been ruled on. The point is that death row prisoners in almost all Caribbean countries make pleas to such bodies; until now the state could disregard them and execute even when the cases were still pending. Potentially, the privy council decision will save many lives and change the face of capital punishment in the Caribbean. The decision wasn't unanimous. Lord Hoffman dissented. Not for the first time - I choose my words carefully - he has come out in favour of an interpretation of the law that has the effect of allowing the death penalty. In at least one case he was in a 3-2 majority, and prisoners were executed as a result. This time he was alone. \u0095 The National Film Theatre and Geoffrey Robertson QC's Doughty Street Chambers have compiled an interesting selection of courtroom dramas to be shown at the NFT during October, many of them introduced or discussed by John Mortimer and various QCs. The 15 films include some of the classics (Twelve Angry Men, Judgment at Nuremberg, Inherit the Wind, the underrated Anatomy of a Murder) and a televised version of the brilliant play about the Steve Biko inquest, with Albert Finney playing the barrister Sydney Kentridge. It's a pity that the organisers were (presumably) unable to get hold of what, for me, are the two most satisfying courtroom dramas of them all: To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution. On the other hand, I am much relieved that the programme doesn't include In the Name of the Father, the Hollywoodised story of the Guildford Four, the courtroom scenes of which are the most ludicrous and wildly inaccurate ever seen on a cinema screen. The film versions of Judge Dredd and the Queen of Hearts's sentencing process in Alice in Wonderland are models of careful research in comparison (though admittedly \"Off with her head\" was not a valid sentence at the time, due to lack of a guillotine). \u0095 I don't do plugs in this column, but I cannot remember the last time I was so impressed with a book about the law. It explains and demystifies the English legal system - how it works , who is in it - simply yet with authority, clearly yet comprehensively. \"A kind of upbeat legal mixture of Madame Bovary, As You Like It and La Traviata. I loved every page.\" (Albert Einstein). The title is The Law Machine (5th edition), published by Penguin, by Marcel Berlins (a columnist) and Clare Dyer, legal correspondent of this parish.",

      "body": "<p>Great architecture has never been dependent on the expenditure of vast sums of money. It can be, yet there is no law that says it must be. I reminded myself of this by making a pilgrimage to what for me is one of the very greatest buildings of all time. This is the monastery of Sainte-Marie de la Tourette near Eveux-sur-l'Arbresle, Lyon, consecrated in 1960 and built cheaply from humble concrete. </p> <p>To make such an extravagant claim for the building is bold, given that this Dominican monastery, although designed in the spirit of the chaste Carthusian foundations of medieval Italy, may look to some like a brutalist refugee from London's South Bank. </p> <p>Yet here is a building that is at once as poor and as rich as the mendicant monks for whom it was designed and built. Poor in terms of cost and the stark poverty of the materials used to build it, rich in ideas and spirituality. Today, much new architecture is slick and polished, erected by teams of highly competent contractors and engineers working to designs fed through fairly reliable computer programs. The buildings, whether office blocks, shopping malls or distribution depots (or public libraries, hospitals or schools) are expensive in absolute terms, yet generally good value for money given what they are required to do. Most, however, are soulless or even cynical. </p> <p>La Tourette, by contrast, is a tour de force. Set high on a ridge overlooking the vineyards of Beaujolais country, this college and monastery, now essentially a lay study centre, was commissioned from the great architect Le Corbusier by the formidable priest P\u00e8re Couturier. This was in 1953. Le Corbusier had already, encouraged by Couturier, been working on the superb pilgrimage chapel of Notre-Dame du Haut at Ronchamp (1950-54). Buildings such as this and La Tourette marked a profound change in Le Corbusier's approach to architecture; a move away from the severe, white geometry of his pre-war years. They also represented a new architecture for a church trying to come to terms with a world of modernism and progress. </p> <p>An artist who was to live a monk-like existence in his later years, Le Corbusier had always been drawn to the powerful yet simple architecture of the most severe medieval monasteries. While learning to be an architect, back in 1907-11, he had travelled throughout the Mediterranean and central Europe, and had been particularly inspired by the Charterhouse of Ema at Galluzzo, Tuscany. That building, with its interplay of collective spaces and \"living cells\", influenced his later work, so that many of his famous buildings - long before he designed La Tourette - seem like monasteries in one form or other. The Pavillon Suisse (1930) and the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation housing block in Marseilles (1946-52) certainly have that look and feel. </p> <p>Le Corbusier had always been fascinated by religion and the religious experience. Swiss by birth, he was a descendant of the Cathars - the 13th-century Albigensian heretics - all but exterminated by St Dominic and his Inquisition shock-troops appointed to their gruesome task in the Languedoc by the Vatican. I felt, as I sat in the church at La Tourette, as if the architect must have been reconciled to that distant historical memory by the act of building so intelligently for those who would have burned him at the stake had he been alive seven centuries earlier. </p> <p>Le Corbusier pondered the design of La Tourette for three whole years before the concrete mixers turned. The result was a design of immense subtlety and grace. Planned around a central glazed cloister, three sides of the building comprise lecture rooms, refectory, chapter room, library and two storeys of cells, each with its own loggia. The fourth is dominated by the church. The complex yet contained geometry of the building is broken by two dramatic elements - the oratory with its pyramid roof that juts into the cloister, and the undulating wall of the lower church, its roof capped with sloping rooflights. </p> <p>The monastery is bathed in a wash of ever-changing daylight, except for the deliberate darkness of the oratory. After the dank rigours of 19th-century Gothic revival colleges, it must have been a relief to the Dominican novices who came here to be bathed in sun, light and air; to experience an architecture that was at once ancient and modern. Though La Tourette has unfinished ceilings and exposed pipework, though it is a little crumbly 40 years on, it still lifts the soul. </p> <p>Le Corbusier had come to believe that the beautiful, taut, white villas he had built in his 40s were for the eye only; now, in his 60s and into his 70s, he wanted to engage all the senses and the spirit, too. To do so, he made his architecture increasingly less pure, less slick. And into the design of La Tourette he poured a lifetime's learning - not just of architecture, but of the Bible, of Greek myths, of the scholastic philosophy propounded by the Dominicans (from St Thomas Aquinas). </p> <p>La Tourette is not just another bru talist concrete building. There is immense subtlety in its proportions, and in the way that light plays through its cells, lecture rooms and corridors. There is, too, a quiet virtuosity in the way that the monastery's spaces have been gently squeezed into what proves to be a much smaller building than its dominant position in its wine-growing landscape suggests. </p> <p>Here is an architecture of real maturity, but also of grace and, above all, of poverty. A freely chosen poverty very much at odds with our shiny new world, 40 money-grabbing and money-blowing years down the line. </p> <p>\u0095 Sainte-Marie de la Tourette, Eveux-sur- l'Arbresle, near Lyon, France, can be visited.

This is the monastery of Sainte-Marie de la Tourette near Eveux-sur-l'Arbresle, Lyon, consecrated in 1960 and built cheaply from humble concrete. To make such an extravagant claim for the building is bold, given that this Dominican monastery, although designed in the spirit of the chaste Carthusian foundations of medieval Italy, may look to some like a brutalist refugee from London's South Bank. Yet here is a building that is at once as poor and as rich as the mendicant monks for whom it was designed and built. Poor in terms of cost and the stark poverty of the materials used to build it, rich in ideas and spirituality. Today, much new architecture is slick and polished, erected by teams of highly competent contractors and engineers working to designs fed through fairly reliable computer programs. The buildings, whether office blocks, shopping malls or distribution depots (or public libraries, hospitals or schools) are expensive in absolute terms, yet generally good value for money given what they are required to do. Most, however, are soulless or even cynical. La Tourette, by contrast, is a tour de force. Set high on a ridge overlooking the vineyards of Beaujolais country, this college and monastery, now essentially a lay study centre, was commissioned from the great architect Le Corbusier by the formidable priest P\u00e8re Couturier. This was in 1953. Le Corbusier had already, encouraged by Couturier, been working on the superb pilgrimage chapel of Notre-Dame du Haut at Ronchamp (1950-54). Buildings such as this and La Tourette marked a profound change in Le Corbusier's approach to architecture; a move away from the severe, white geometry of his pre-war years. They also represented a new architecture for a church trying to come to terms with a world of modernism and progress. An artist who was to live a monk-like existence in his later years, Le Corbusier had always been drawn to the powerful yet simple architecture of the most severe medieval monasteries. While learning to be an architect, back in 1907-11, he had travelled throughout the Mediterranean and central Europe, and had been particularly inspired by the Charterhouse of Ema at Galluzzo, Tuscany. That building, with its interplay of collective spaces and \"living cells\", influenced his later work, so that many of his famous buildings - long before he designed La Tourette - seem like monasteries in one form or other. The Pavillon Suisse (1930) and the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation housing block in Marseilles (1946-52) certainly have that look and feel. Le Corbusier had always been fascinated by religion and the religious experience. Swiss by birth, he was a descendant of the Cathars - the 13th-century Albigensian heretics - all but exterminated by St Dominic and his Inquisition shock-troops appointed to their gruesome task in the Languedoc by the Vatican. I felt, as I sat in the church at La Tourette, as if the architect must have been reconciled to that distant historical memory by the act of building so intelligently for those who would have burned him at the stake had he been alive seven centuries earlier. Le Corbusier pondered the design of La Tourette for three whole years before the concrete mixers turned. The result was a design of immense subtlety and grace. Planned around a central glazed cloister, three sides of the building comprise lecture rooms, refectory, chapter room, library and two storeys of cells, each with its own loggia. The fourth is dominated by the church. The complex yet contained geometry of the building is broken by two dramatic elements - the oratory with its pyramid roof that juts into the cloister, and the undulating wall of the lower church, its roof capped with sloping rooflights. The monastery is bathed in a wash of ever-changing daylight, except for the deliberate darkness of the oratory. After the dank rigours of 19th-century Gothic revival colleges, it must have been a relief to the Dominican novices who came here to be bathed in sun, light and air; to experience an architecture that was at once ancient and modern. Though La Tourette has unfinished ceilings and exposed pipework, though it is a little crumbly 40 years on, it still lifts the soul. Le Corbusier had come to believe that the beautiful, taut, white villas he had built in his 40s were for the eye only; now, in his 60s and into his 70s, he wanted to engage all the senses and the spirit, too. To do so, he made his architecture increasingly less pure, less slick. And into the design of La Tourette he poured a lifetime's learning - not just of architecture, but of the Bible, of Greek myths, of the scholastic philosophy propounded by the Dominicans (from St Thomas Aquinas). La Tourette is not just another bru talist concrete building. There is immense subtlety in its proportions, and in the way that light plays through its cells, lecture rooms and corridors. There is, too, a quiet virtuosity in the way that the monastery's spaces have been gently squeezed into what proves to be a much smaller building than its dominant position in its wine-growing landscape suggests. Here is an architecture of real maturity, but also of grace and, above all, of poverty. A freely chosen poverty very much at odds with our shiny new world, 40 money-grabbing and money-blowing years down the line. \u0095 Sainte-Marie de la Tourette, Eveux-sur- l'Arbresle, near Lyon, France, can be visited.

Surtitles have increased my enjoyment of opera and for Mr Clements to suggest it will become \"museum art of a vacuous kind\" as a result of their use is ludicrous.</p> <p>Why should he mind? Many musical people follow instrumental works with a score on their knee. Does this transform the performances to mere \"engaging background music\"? <br><b>Gavin Bullock </b><br> Winchester<br><a href=\"mailto:gavin.bullock@dial.pipex.com\">gavin.bullock@dial.pipex.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 So Andrew Clements is outraged at the use of surtitles for an opera sung in English. This \"bizarre decision\" helps the one in seven of us who have a hearing loss and who are unable to make out lyrics in whatever language they are sung. Does he really find surtitles so intrusive that he would deny someone with a hearing disability the opportunity to enjoy opera? <br><b> Leigh Donnison </b><br> Leighton Buzzard, Beds</p> <p>\u0095 The last time I saw Billy Budd, a few years ago in Newcastle, again with the charismatic Simon Keenlyside as Billy, I was bowled over by the music but couldn't follow the words in the choruses and ensembles.</p> <p>This time I was able to refer when necessary to the non- intrusive screen which those in the side of the stalls circle were given to view the surtitles, and this enhanced my enjoyment of the whole opera. During the monologues and other solos I had no need of the surtitles and was able to ignore them. <br><b> Drusilla Calvert </b><br> London<br><a href=\"mailto:d.calvert@macrex.com\">d.calvert@macrex.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Clements's outrage is misplaced. Like him, I attended Billy Budd. Unlike him, I was glad of the surtitles when I was unable to understand the English that was being sung.</p> <p>My ire is reserved for the people who chose surtitling over the system available at the Metropolitan in New York. There, both Mr Clements and I would be satisfied - our differing needs served by an individual monitor mounted in the seatback in front of us. Mine would be on, his off. <br><b> Hywel Sims</b><br> London<br><a href=\"mailto:HandR@limehouse62. freeserve.co.uk\">HandR@limehouse62. freeserve.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Clements's note of despair over the use of surtitles is well taken and yet another sign of a dumbing down in the arts in the UK. I believe it was the Italians who started this practice at La Scala. We watch opera from Italy on satellite TV now and again. Even in this medium, where the words are perfectly clear, we get subtitles on the screen despite the libretto being in the vernacular. <br><b>Reg Williamson</b> <br>Kidsgrove, Staffs <br><a href=\"mailto:regwilliamson@beeb.net\">regwilliamson@beeb.net</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Clements is foaming at the mouth because surtitles are to be provided for an opera sung in English (Incomprehensible, September 23). Yet a visit to the cinema these days presents quite an aural challenge - and opera sung in our native tongue is more difficult. Surtitles have increased my enjoyment of opera and for Mr Clements to suggest it will become \"museum art of a vacuous kind\" as a result of their use is ludicrous. Why should he mind? Many musical people follow instrumental works with a score on their knee. Does this transform the performances to mere \"engaging background music\"? Gavin Bullock Winchester gavin.bullock@dial.pipex.com \u0095 So Andrew Clements is outraged at the use of surtitles for an opera sung in English. This \"bizarre decision\" helps the one in seven of us who have a hearing loss and who are unable to make out lyrics in whatever language they are sung. Does he really find surtitles so intrusive that he would deny someone with a hearing disability the opportunity to enjoy opera? Leigh Donnison Leighton Buzzard, Beds \u0095 The last time I saw Billy Budd, a few years ago in Newcastle, again with the charismatic Simon Keenlyside as Billy, I was bowled over by the music but couldn't follow the words in the choruses and ensembles. This time I was able to refer when necessary to the non- intrusive screen which those in the side of the stalls circle were given to view the surtitles, and this enhanced my enjoyment of the whole opera. During the monologues and other solos I had no need of the surtitles and was able to ignore them. Drusilla Calvert London d.calvert@macrex.com \u0095 Andrew Clements's outrage is misplaced. Like him, I attended Billy Budd. Unlike him, I was glad of the surtitles when I was unable to understand the English that was being sung. My ire is reserved for the people who chose surtitling over the system available at the Metropolitan in New York. There, both Mr Clements and I would be satisfied - our differing needs served by an individual monitor mounted in the seatback in front of us. Mine would be on, his off. Hywel Sims London HandR@limehouse62. freeserve.co.uk \u0095 Andrew Clements's note of despair over the use of surtitles is well taken and yet another sign of a dumbing down in the arts in the UK. I believe it was the Italians who started this practice at La Scala. We watch opera from Italy on satellite TV now and again. Even in this medium, where the words are perfectly clear, we get subtitles on the screen despite the libretto being in the vernacular. Reg Williamson Kidsgrove, Staffs regwilliamson@beeb.net",

      "body": "<p>Denmark's decision on joining the euro is both less important than British sceptics have been trying to make it and a great deal more significant than Labour and most other European Union governments would like. Polls show the Nos well ahead, providing sceptics here with Danish delight. But Denmark is a small country with a penchant for hard-fought referenda (Thursday's will be the sixth on Europe since Danish accession).</p> <p>A Danish No will make very little difference either to the fate of the euro on the exchanges or, since the krone is pegged to it, to the long-run value of the national currency. The campaign has highlighted a reactionary and racist element among a people the left here used to hold up as a kind of welfarist superego. Some Noes are fighting for \"national socialism\". The campaign shows opposition to the single currency sliding into rejection of the European Union, hostility to immigration and rejection of ethnic diversity within a single country. Danish nationalism is no oxymoron. Like all its kin, however meek and mild their spokespeople (see below for Scotland) part of its appeal lies in exclusion, aggression and hate.</p> <p>The Blair cabinet's silence over the Danes' decision might be diplomatic reticence or a sign of recent distraction. But let us hope their scouts have been out on the Skaggerat. It is not just the intensity of the campaign - \"normal\" politics has gone by the board for six weeks. Nor is it the way former alignments have come unstuck: the bulk of the No votes are likely to come from left-of-centre voters, as in 1992 when the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty. A principal lesson, all the more worrying after the petrol protests, is the rejection by people \"out there\" of the line adopted by the elites, stretching that term to include not just the ruling party but the rest of the political class, corporate business interests and trade unions.</p> <p>Regardless of the result, the Danish experience demonstrates that the euro is not and can never be an \"economic\" issue. Forget Gordon Brown's mantra about five tests. The Danes say it is a matter of national destiny and so it is here. The Danish economy is booming. Unemployment is 5%, half the EU average. Joining the single currency would merely legitimise a de facto union. Danes do not believe it is just about krone in their purses. The currency may be a symbol - but changing it still says something fundamental about who they are. A weakness of the pro campaign led by the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has been its reluctance to grasp that this is a key instance in the politics of identity that speaks about the shape of Denmark for decades to come, perhaps even its existence as an \"imagined community\".</p> <p>The foundations of the European house were neglected by the architects. It has to have people's adherence, heart and mind. And people live still inside nation states with all their dense (and sometimes oppressive) allegiances, histories and predilections.</p> <p>For some, for example Italians and Germans, Europe has been a kind of better self; national leaders have advanced the European cause with, often, popular acclaim. But in what member state are people not now confused, if not downright hostile? To enlargement (witness German polls), to \"integration\" (sentiments in the UK are shared in Scandinavia), to altered financial circumstances in which recipient countries become donors (look at recent changes of tune in Spain and the Irish Republic). However they decide this week, Danes have done the rest of us the great favour of bringing popular sentiment to bear on the EU. At last.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Denmark's decision on joining the euro is both less important than British sceptics have been trying to make it and a great deal more significant than Labour and most other European Union governments would like. Polls show the Nos well ahead, providing sceptics here with Danish delight. But Denmark is a small country with a penchant for hard-fought referenda (Thursday's will be the sixth on Europe since Danish accession). A Danish No will make very little difference either to the fate of the euro on the exchanges or, since the krone is pegged to it, to the long-run value of the national currency. The campaign has highlighted a reactionary and racist element among a people the left here used to hold up as a kind of welfarist superego. Some Noes are fighting for \"national socialism\". The campaign shows opposition to the single currency sliding into rejection of the European Union, hostility to immigration and rejection of ethnic diversity within a single country. Danish nationalism is no oxymoron. Like all its kin, however meek and mild their spokespeople (see below for Scotland) part of its appeal lies in exclusion, aggression and hate. The Blair cabinet's silence over the Danes' decision might be diplomatic reticence or a sign of recent distraction. But let us hope their scouts have been out on the Skaggerat. It is not just the intensity of the campaign - \"normal\" politics has gone by the board for six weeks. Nor is it the way former alignments have come unstuck: the bulk of the No votes are likely to come from left-of-centre voters, as in 1992 when the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty. A principal lesson, all the more worrying after the petrol protests, is the rejection by people \"out there\" of the line adopted by the elites, stretching that term to include not just the ruling party but the rest of the political class, corporate business interests and trade unions. Regardless of the result, the Danish experience demonstrates that the euro is not and can never be an \"economic\" issue. Forget Gordon Brown's mantra about five tests. The Danes say it is a matter of national destiny and so it is here. The Danish economy is booming. Unemployment is 5%, half the EU average. Joining the single currency would merely legitimise a de facto union. Danes do not believe it is just about krone in their purses. The currency may be a symbol - but changing it still says something fundamental about who they are. A weakness of the pro campaign led by the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has been its reluctance to grasp that this is a key instance in the politics of identity that speaks about the shape of Denmark for decades to come, perhaps even its existence as an \"imagined community\". The foundations of the European house were neglected by the architects. It has to have people's adherence, heart and mind. And people live still inside nation states with all their dense (and sometimes oppressive) allegiances, histories and predilections. For some, for example Italians and Germans, Europe has been a kind of better self; national leaders have advanced the European cause with, often, popular acclaim. But in what member state are people not now confused, if not downright hostile? To enlargement (witness German polls), to \"integration\" (sentiments in the UK are shared in Scandinavia), to altered financial circumstances in which recipient countries become donors (look at recent changes of tune in Spain and the Irish Republic). However they decide this week, Danes have done the rest of us the great favour of bringing popular sentiment to bear on the EU. At last.",

      "body": "<p>A radical shake-up of the John Lewis Partnership's department stores now under way will see the John Lewis brand extended across the country in the first stage of a \u00a3300m makeover of the 25-strong chain. </p> <p>The first sign that some of the oldest names on Britain's provincial high streets will disappear came this weekend as Tyrrell &amp; Green, the 103-year-old department store in Southampton, closed its doors for the last time. It will reopen on Thursday in a new location as John Lewis Southampton, the first store to change its name in the history of the partnership. </p> <p>The John Lewis name is now expected to be given a national focus as the uniquely structured partnership works frantically to tackle a sharp fall in profits despite rising sales. </p> <p>Intense competition from high street rivals and uncertainties surrounding the effect of the internet on shopping habits are heaping pressure on the group to update not only its outward appearance, but also internal procedures. </p> <p>Two years ago it was forced to fend off a move by rebels to break-up the partnership, so-called because the 40,000 employees share in its profits, and list on the stock market. </p> <p>Now, in the most visible sign of the group's desire to modernise itself, \u00a3300m will be spent over the next three years on the department stores, 11 of which are still known by the names of their individual founders. But the associated costs, coming in the wake of a 43% fall in first half pre-tax profits to \u00a338.5m, have put a halt to the long-awaited refurbishment of its London head office. Partners were informed of the abandoned facelift to the Victoria office last week. </p> <p>The name changes to remaining stores are expected to take place with the approval of partners locally after the completion of the makeover of the stores.

      "bodyText": "A radical shake-up of the John Lewis Partnership's department stores now under way will see the John Lewis brand extended across the country in the first stage of a \u00a3300m makeover of the 25-strong chain. The first sign that some of the oldest names on Britain's provincial high streets will disappear came this weekend as Tyrrell &amp; Green, the 103-year-old department store in Southampton, closed its doors for the last time. It will reopen on Thursday in a new location as John Lewis Southampton, the first store to change its name in the history of the partnership. The John Lewis name is now expected to be given a national focus as the uniquely structured partnership works frantically to tackle a sharp fall in profits despite rising sales. Intense competition from high street rivals and uncertainties surrounding the effect of the internet on shopping habits are heaping pressure on the group to update not only its outward appearance, but also internal procedures. Two years ago it was forced to fend off a move by rebels to break-up the partnership, so-called because the 40,000 employees share in its profits, and list on the stock market. Now, in the most visible sign of the group's desire to modernise itself, \u00a3300m will be spent over the next three years on the department stores, 11 of which are still known by the names of their individual founders. But the associated costs, coming in the wake of a 43% fall in first half pre-tax profits to \u00a338.5m, have put a halt to the long-awaited refurbishment of its London head office. Partners were informed of the abandoned facelift to the Victoria office last week. The name changes to remaining stores are expected to take place with the approval of partners locally after the completion of the makeover of the stores. New stores opening in out-of-town sites will be called John Lewis. The rebranding in Southampton is part of the partnership's plan to focus on an \"authoritative, distinctive and profitable\" network of shops, according to Luke Mayhew, director of trading. At a meeting last week Mr Mayhew told partners of plans to advertise nationally across Scotland for the first time, where three stores have opened recently. The partnership is also trying to tackle the way the internet could affect sales while also working on plans to use the web to improve logistics. Jessop &amp; Son, the Nottingham department store, is expected to be next in line to shed its founder's name, adopting John Lewis Nottingham instead, as part of a \u00a320m redesign. Only Peter Jones, the flagship store on Sloane Square in Chelsea, currently undergoing a \u00a380m refit over three years, is expected to buck the trend towards a single brand. Aside from Peter Jones in London, the former Tyrell &amp; Green in Southampton, and Jessop &amp; Son in Notting- ham, the John Lewis Partnership also owns stores which do not bear its name in Windsor, where it known as Caleys, Reading (Heelas), Southsea (Knight &amp; Lee), Watford (Trewin Brothers), Cambridge (Robert Sayle), Norwich (Bonds), Liverpool (George Henry Lee) and Newcastle upon Tyne (Bainbridge).",

He dropped out of courses in literature, in journalism, and at the Vaugirard photography school in Paris, before completing seven months at the Vevey photography school in Switzerland.</p> <p>Returning home in 1954, he attempted to get work in the cinema industry.

To Sieff's rage, the master inscrutably tipped the aspirant's photos this way and that, holding them upside down to assess form over content.</p> <p>Sieff stayed with Magnum for only a couple of years, leaving France for New York in 1960. There, he became caught up in fashion magazines, working for Harper's, Vogue and Esquire.

At one point, he contemplated a mock retrospective entitled \"Portraits of Seated Ladies and Indolently Weary Nudes, with Certain Selected Moments and Accompanied by Texts having no Connection with the Images\".</p> <p>Sieff was extremely articulate about his own work. When the great photographer of the Parisian moment, Robert Doisneau, visited him, and left Sieff a copy of his latest book, Trois Secondes d'Eternit\u00e9, Sieff wrote: \"All photography is a moment, of oneself and others, of things and of the world; it is, at one and the same time, the eternalising of an emotion and its erosion. Taking photographs is a strange occupation, daring to want to stop time.\"</p> <p>Sieff called this the freezing of the instant into the permanence of effigy, the creation of \"so many small whitestones helping us, according to our mood, rediscover feelings and forgotten faces\".</p> <p>Yet many of his own images are taken with a short-focus lens, their foregrounds filled by reminders of boring or brutal reality; a table jutting into the backview of a sinuous nude; a car dashboard obtruding on a desert landscape. He was always subverting the perfection of his own technique.</p> <p>His work is owned by major museums in France, Germany, Switzerland and the US, and he exhibited in all those places as well as in London (where he held his first show in 1967) and Tokyo (where the erotic aspect of his work was well regarded). Other books, which eschewed silly titles, were called The Ballet (1962) or Best Nudes (1980) - although he couldn't resist calling one volume Bottoms (1994).</p> <p>He was married to Barbara Williams, and had two children Sonia and Sasha.</p> <p><br>Jeanloup Sieff, photographer, born November 30 1933; died September 20 2000</p>",

When the great photographer of the Parisian moment, Robert Doisneau, visited him, and left Sieff a copy of his latest book, Trois Secondes d'Eternit\u00e9, Sieff wrote: \"All photography is a moment, of oneself and others, of things and of the world; it is, at one and the same time, the eternalising of an emotion and its erosion. Taking photographs is a strange occupation, daring to want to stop time.\" Sieff called this the freezing of the instant into the permanence of effigy, the creation of \"so many small whitestones helping us, according to our mood, rediscover feelings and forgotten faces\". Yet many of his own images are taken with a short-focus lens, their foregrounds filled by reminders of boring or brutal reality; a table jutting into the backview of a sinuous nude; a car dashboard obtruding on a desert landscape. He was always subverting the perfection of his own technique. His work is owned by major museums in France, Germany, Switzerland and the US, and he exhibited in all those places as well as in London (where he held his first show in 1967) and Tokyo (where the erotic aspect of his work was well regarded). Other books, which eschewed silly titles, were called The Ballet (1962) or Best Nudes (1980) - although he couldn't resist calling one volume Bottoms (1994). He was married to Barbara Williams, and had two children Sonia and Sasha. Jeanloup Sieff, photographer, born November 30 1933; died September 20 2000",

For many women who have taken a career break, this is the time to start thinking about returning to work. An increasing number of them are finding temping the ideal way to reacquaint themselves with office work, and often to find permanent employment.</p> <p>\"Not surprisingly, many women are very nervous about returning to work after a gap,\u0094 says Julia Killingbeck, a senior consultant at Tate Appointments. \"Even if they are obviously capable and previously held down a demanding job, they often lack confidence. This is mainly because they think that office technology has progressed to such an extent they\u00eall never be able to catch up. The reality is that advances in technology have made everything much easier and people are usually surprised how quickly they pick up new packages.\u0094</p> <p>Rachel Greenwood, who has not worked outside the home for eight years and has just started temping, says this was her experience: \"When I started to think about going back to work, it used to terrify me to look at job adverts. I didn't understand half of them; things seemed to have changed so much from when I worked in an office. Then I did a refresher course at a local college and I couldn't believe how much easier everything is now.\u0094</p> <p>Killingbeck points out that, although it might sound like a cliche, women who have been at home bringing up their children have developed useful, highly transferable skills. \"Women who have children are often terribly organised because they are so used to having to think about 16 things at once,\u0094 she says.</p> <p>It is helpful to sign up with an agency that is aware of your agenda and sympathetic to your needs. Killingbeck, who herself temped when she decided to return to work after having children, is aware that one of the main problems that women in this situation face is worrying about their children. \"This might be the first time they've been separated from their children for any length of time and, understandably, this can make them anxious. Temping is a way of gently testing the water. You haven't made a commitment to an employer so if things aren't working out as you planned you can extricate yourself.\u0094</p> <p>Pauline Ford-Smith approached recruitment consultancy Prime Time 11 years ago, when she registered as a temp after having a baby. She wanted to have time with her son but not neglect her career.</p> <p>\"I'd spent five years at home and lost a lot of confidence,\u0094 she says. \"Prime Time gave me some training and made sure that at first I was given only straightforward assignments. It was useful to work in a variety of places because I learnt a lot more that way. </p> <p>\"However, the chief reason for wanting to temp was that it would fit in with my son. I knew that if he was ill, or there was a problem with my childcare arrangements, it would be easier to deal with. I found that as long as people were happy with my work, they were often willing to compromise. For example, I worked through my lunch hour so I could get away early to pick up my son.\u0094 </p> <p>As her son demanded less of her time, Ford-Smith began to concentrate on her career. After years of relying on her as a temp, Prime Time spotted her potential and now, 13 years on, she is the branch manager of the temporary recruitment section at its Harrogate office. </p> <p>\"Most people find the transition far less traumatic than they initially thought it would be,\u0094 Killingbeck says. \"After all, looking after children all day is incredibly hard work.

      "body": "<p>To most people, guilds are reminiscent of a bygone age, a medieval netherworld of coffee houses, clerks and apprentices. The trade associations of the City of London, collectively known as the Livery, are unique in their survival, number and diversity. However, considering their pre-1066 origins, is there room in this ancient collective for a modern office worker? Answer: yes. Joanne Dunnachie, 29, is the young and vibrant assistant clerk to the \"Worshipful Company of Information Technologists\", performing an up-to-date administrative job with a profoundly historic twist. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt that this is an unusual role, as it's so tied up with the history of London. The early companies controlled the manufacturing services within the square mile and this regulation of professions has survived to the present day,\" explains Dunnachie from her modern, airy offices. Indeed, diverse livery companies still exist, from the Tallow Chandlers (founded in 1462, and originally candlemakers or dealers in tallow - rendered animal fat) to the Merchant Taylors (1327).

      "bodyText": "To most people, guilds are reminiscent of a bygone age, a medieval netherworld of coffee houses, clerks and apprentices. The trade associations of the City of London, collectively known as the Livery, are unique in their survival, number and diversity. However, considering their pre-1066 origins, is there room in this ancient collective for a modern office worker? Answer: yes. Joanne Dunnachie, 29, is the young and vibrant assistant clerk to the \"Worshipful Company of Information Technologists\", performing an up-to-date administrative job with a profoundly historic twist. \"There's no doubt that this is an unusual role, as it's so tied up with the history of London. The early companies controlled the manufacturing services within the square mile and this regulation of professions has survived to the present day,\" explains Dunnachie from her modern, airy offices. Indeed, diverse livery companies still exist, from the Tallow Chandlers (founded in 1462, and originally candlemakers or dealers in tallow - rendered animal fat) to the Merchant Taylors (1327). Livery involvement at Billingsgate fish market continues to ensure consistent standards, and there is even a company of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.
