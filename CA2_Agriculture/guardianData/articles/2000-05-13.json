For many, this is the last chance to get their retirement provisions into shape. </p> <p>As Donna Bradshaw of adviser Fiona Price and Partners points out, this involves taking a strategic view of your financial affairs. 'Pension planning means looking at more than just pension funds,' she says. 'It includes considering all your other investments, and also whether you can anticipate receiving any inheritance. You have a 10-year period or so to make the most of your investments. But 10 years is a good time scale, offering opportunities for equity investing.' </p> <p>As well as checking occupational or personal pension arrangements, it is worth remembering the possibility of using Individual Savings Accounts to save for retirement. Unlike pension schemes, Isas do not have tax advantages at the point where contributions are made, but thereafter they are outside the tax net and offer more flexibility than pensions. You should also not forget your state pension. </p> <p>This is not to say that people in their fifties spend all their time having earnest conversations with financial advisers. In fact, as Denise Knowles, a Relate counsellor, says, this period can be a time of quite radical changes. 'There's a kind of rebellion going on,' she says. 'People in their fifties still have a lot of life ahead, and may be doing things their parents might never have even dreamed of, like backpacking round Australia or buying a motorbike.' </p> <p>This process may involve re-evaluating work. Choosing to take early retirement and then setting up as an independent consultant is a well-established route - though the pension implications of leaving employment early need to be thoroughly considered. </p> <p>More radical, and more hazardous, is starting a business in an entirely new area. Even if you feel in retrospect that you chose the wrong career path (you would have preferred life as, say, an organic farmer rather than an actuary), any new business venture inevitably involves considerable financial risk. Buying a retail business needs particular care, as many small shops struggle to remain profitable. </p> <p>Life-changes may also extend to personal relationships. While the thirties are the time when most marriages break up, divorce rates for the over-50s have been increasing. Women may have particular problems in ensuring that they come out of the divorce with an adequate financial settlement, especially when the man has been the sole breadwinner. 'A large cash settlement may seem a lot of money, but people have to live on this for what may be a very long time,' Bradshaw says. </p> <p>Pension-sharing on divorce is expected to be introduced for new proceedings from 2001. When this is implemented, the courts will be able to give ex-spouses direct rights to a proportion of their partner's pension. </p> <p>Pension-sharing is expected to be an important element of divorce settlements, and may offer greater protection to spouses without pension provisions of their own. Spouses in this situation (usually women) could be better off waiting for a change in the law before beginning proceedings.</p> <p> <strong>Case studies</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Anne Tierney's life may be about to change radically. A manager for an IT company in the Thames valley, she turned 50 just over 18 months ago and - with her youngest about to leave university - has begun to emerge from several years of financial stringency. The plan now is to pay off her mortgage, realise the equity and buy a new, cheaper, house near Galway City in Ireland, where her family originally came from. </p> <p>Anne's personal finances were hit hard when she and her husband divorced in 1996 and she decided to take on the \u00a394,000 mortgage on the family home. 'It was very hard at first,' she says. 'But the hardest thing was getting my two daughters through university. I was pretty broke for three years.' </p> <p>But now the situation looks more promising. Her Berkshire home has been valued at just under \u00a3260,000. She has already identified a house in Ireland, in the countryside north of Galway. </p> <p>'As you get older, you have to question your quality of life. I've got a career but, to be honest, it's getting me down. I do more hours than I ever did - I'm at work often until 9.30 or 10 at night. I had a day off last week and still worked a 48-hour week,' she says. 'If I had no mortgage, I wouldn't have to earn so much money.' </p> <p>With relatives and friends in the west of Ireland, Anne already has close links with the area. She's attracted by the quieter pace of life there and, as she points out, with Ireland in the eurozone, the high sterling exchange rate makes this a sensible time to buy in Ireland. </p> <p>She hopes the deal will go through soon, though Anne does not plan to give up her job immediately . 'If I get the price I want for the house, I'll move into rented accommodation,' she says. </p> <p>Anne is fortunate to be in a well-funded occupational pension scheme, and has been making additional voluntary contributions for a number of years. The standard retirement age in the scheme is 60. </p> <p>However, her employer may be prepared to consider early retirement, as part of a redundancy package. Anne intends to wait and see what is on offer.</p> <p> \u0095 Colin Brennan, former director of human resources at TSB, took early retirement after the bank merged with Lloyds, when he was in his mid-fifties. Now 58, he works as a consultant for a number of clients in the banking sector but is also active in the voluntary sector, as a housing association director and as a regional contact for the charity Reach. </p> <p>Colin is fortunate in receiving a good executive pension - given to him without any actuarial reduction for early retirement. He could afford not to have to think of paid work again. However, he says 58 feels too young for full-time retirement: 'I don't feel retired at all. People in their late fifties still have a lot of energy. You can only play so much golf; you can only go fly-fishing so often.' </p> <p>The consultancy business developed after he left Lloyds TSB: he was drafted in by executive recruitment agency Morgan &amp; Banks to help a company which was temporarily without a personnel director. He now works primarily from home, using e-mail and fax to communicate with clients. </p> <p>However he also gives much of his time to Reach, an organisation that matches potential volunteers who have professional expertise or skills with charities in need of assistance. Reach originally worked only with retired people, but as Colin explains, the organisation has recently extended its remit. </p> <p>'The average age is 56 now. This is partly because people are retiring earlier, but also because Reach now works with people of any age who have time to give,' he says. Taken collectively, Reach volunteers' efforts are worth several million pounds to charities: 'They do make a difference,' he says. </p> <p>Reach: 020 7582 6543.</p>",

Taken collectively, Reach volunteers' efforts are worth several million pounds to charities: 'They do make a difference,' he says. Reach: 020 7582 6543.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong> Your mortgage</strong>  </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Your mortgage</strong> </p> <p> If for much of your adult life you have been paying a monthly mortgage, your fifties are when this long process is likely to end. It's a good feeling to own your house outright, but there are some issues to face before you make that last mortgage payment. </p> <p>First, it may actually not be such a good idea to wipe out your mortgage debt. Bradford and Bingley borrowers should ensure they remain customers until after flotation. (\u00a3100 minimum is necessary for voting rights, though smaller loans still qualify for payouts.) Borrowers with other mutual building societies may also want to keep a small mortgage loan outstanding, just in case of future windfalls. </p> <p>Controversially, when they close a mortgage account, many mortgage lenders levy a 'sealing fee' for the work involved in removing the legal charge. This may seem the ultimate example of greed and bad faith, but if you want to clear the debt you have little option but to pay up. </p> <p>The alternative is to continue with a small residual loan. The Halifax, for example, offers to freeze the last \u00a3125 on a mortgage account on an interest-free basis. This allows you to avoid the responsibility of looking after your own title deeds, since the documents will remain safely stored by the lender. Another possible advantage is that you can subsequently take out a further secured loan against the property at relatively little expense. </p> <p>However, with the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief this April, there is now no tax advantage for maintaining a mortgage loan unnecessarily. </p> <p> <strong> Trading down</strong> </p> <p> If your children have left home, you may consider moving to a smaller house. </p> <p>This makes good financial sense if your income is about to be reduced, perhaps through early retirement or redundancy. Household bills are likely to be smaller but, more importantly, you will release some of the capital tied up in your home, which can be reinvested to bring in interest. </p> <p>If retirement is still some way off, a house is a convenient store for excess capital. Unlike other investments, it is free of any potential capital gains tax liability. </p> <p> <strong> Lump sum investments</strong> </p> <p> This is the stage in life when you can find yourself with a substantial lump sum available to invest. Whether the money is the product of a 25-year savings slog with an endowment policy, a move to a smaller house or the result of an inheritance, the issue is what to do next. </p> <p>If you want professional financial advice, go to an independent financial adviser rather than a tied representative. You may also want to consider paying for the advice via a fee rather than indirectly through product commission. </p> <p>The rule is to build a balanced portfolio, spreading your risks. It may be better not to invest a lump sum all at once, but to spread the investment over a period of time - otherwise you risk entering the equity market at a time when the market is peaking and about to fall. </p> <p>There are other ways to invest a lump sum. One possibility is to buy a second home (perhaps with retirement ultimately in mind). If you are tempted to buy abroad, remember that house prices do not necessarily appreciate in value in the same way as in Britain, and that quaint old farm buildings can be difficult to resell. Unless you plan to retire abroad, you are also taking on an exchange rate risk. In France, make sure you understand the inheritance laws on property. </p> <p> <strong> Second careers and downshifting</strong> </p> <p> The fifties can be years when you feel you are marking time at work, having climbed as far as you will go in your present career. It is certainly not too late to consider something new. However, self-employment or setting up a business do need to be approached with caution. </p> <p>Take particular care if you are tempted to buy an existing business. Running a village pub or buying a small bookshop may have strong appeal, but will not generate much profit, and you should not assume that a business which is unprofitable has just been poorly managed and can be turned around. </p> <p>If you establish a business, you have the choice of running it on a self-employed basis or incorporating it as a limited company and paying yourself through a salary and/or dividend payments. There are advantages and pitfalls to both routes, and it is appropriate to take advice. You will be liable to register for VAT if your turnover is \u00a352,000 or above. </p> <p> <strong> Retirement income</strong> </p> <p> With retirement now in the foreseeable future, this may be the last chance to build up adequate arrangements to tide you through the years when you will be surviving on your pension and investment income. </p> <p>One possibility is to shovel as much spare cash as possible into a pension. For people in occupational pension schemes, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) made through the company scheme are normally better value than free-standing AVCs, where charges are often substantial. </p> <p>If you have income from self-employment or from non-pensionable employment, you can contribute up to 30 per cent of these earnings each year to a personal pension between the ages of 51 and 55, or 35 per cent between 55 and 60 (though for high earners, these percentages are capped at an income of \u00a391,800). </p> <p>Most people are best off maximising pension contributions by back-dating payments, using the complex carry-forward and carry-back rules. With the introduction of stakeholder pensions next year, the rules on earnings will be relaxed. </p> <p>Building up capital for your retirement is not necessarily restricted to pensions, however. While pension contributions attract tax relief, the capital (whether in a personal pension or AVC) is locked away until you come to retire, and your eventual pension will be subject to income tax. </p> <p>Isas are more flexible, and should also be considered. Isa contributions (a maximum of \u00a37000 during 2000-1), while made from after-tax income, are afterwards held in a tax-free environment. Isas can also be cashed in at any time (though it is unwise to hold equity-based Isas unless you expect to hold them for a period of several years). </p> <p>To receive a forecast of your likely state pension, complete form BR19, available from tax and Benefits Agency offices. </p> <p> <strong> Early retirement</strong> </p> <p> If you are taking early retirement, the implications for the pension you will draw for the rest of your life can be significant. </p> <p>Occupational pensions may be reduced in three different ways: firstly, you will have fewer qualifying years in the scheme. Secondly, in final salary schemes, you are likely to be leaving work on a lower salary than you would otherwise have achieved. Finally, your pension scheme is likely to impose an actuarial reduction on your pension, to acknowledge the fact that you have contributed towards it for a shorter-than-anticipated period, but will be drawing it for longer. </p> <p>If you take retirement on the grounds of ill health, most of these penalties will not apply. If early retirement is offered as part of a redundancy programme, much will depend on the exact pension terms you manage to negotiate. </p> <p>For people with personal pensions, Inland Revenue rules normally permit you to purchase your pension annuity and take your cash lump sum from age 50. </p> <p>The Government recently announced plans to raise the age for drawing on personal and occupational pensions from 50 to 55. This won't affect today's fiftysomethings as the change, if implemented, will be phased in between 2010 and 2020. For fiftysomethings of the future, however, early retirement may be just a dream unless they amass a fortune in earlier life. </p> <p>It may soon be easier to combine part-time work with a pension - an option that may suit many. At present it is not normally possible to draw a pension and continue working part time with the same employer, but the Inland Revenue is expected to alter this rule. </p> <p>Even for those who can retire at 50 today, there are practical drawbacks. Few people have enough money to retire comfortably at that age. You will have paid less in contributions and your pension capital will have had less time to grow. You will be drawing a pension for longer, so the annuity you buy will be reduced accordingly.

      "bodyText": "Your mortgage If for much of your adult life you have been paying a monthly mortgage, your fifties are when this long process is likely to end. It's a good feeling to own your house outright, but there are some issues to face before you make that last mortgage payment. First, it may actually not be such a good idea to wipe out your mortgage debt. Bradford and Bingley borrowers should ensure they remain customers until after flotation. (\u00a3100 minimum is necessary for voting rights, though smaller loans still qualify for payouts.) Borrowers with other mutual building societies may also want to keep a small mortgage loan outstanding, just in case of future windfalls. Controversially, when they close a mortgage account, many mortgage lenders levy a 'sealing fee' for the work involved in removing the legal charge. This may seem the ultimate example of greed and bad faith, but if you want to clear the debt you have little option but to pay up. The alternative is to continue with a small residual loan. The Halifax, for example, offers to freeze the last \u00a3125 on a mortgage account on an interest-free basis. This allows you to avoid the responsibility of looking after your own title deeds, since the documents will remain safely stored by the lender. Another possible advantage is that you can subsequently take out a further secured loan against the property at relatively little expense. However, with the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief this April, there is now no tax advantage for maintaining a mortgage loan unnecessarily. Trading down If your children have left home, you may consider moving to a smaller house. This makes good financial sense if your income is about to be reduced, perhaps through early retirement or redundancy. Household bills are likely to be smaller but, more importantly, you will release some of the capital tied up in your home, which can be reinvested to bring in interest. If retirement is still some way off, a house is a convenient store for excess capital. Unlike other investments, it is free of any potential capital gains tax liability. Lump sum investments This is the stage in life when you can find yourself with a substantial lump sum available to invest. Whether the money is the product of a 25-year savings slog with an endowment policy, a move to a smaller house or the result of an inheritance, the issue is what to do next. If you want professional financial advice, go to an independent financial adviser rather than a tied representative. You may also want to consider paying for the advice via a fee rather than indirectly through product commission. The rule is to build a balanced portfolio, spreading your risks. It may be better not to invest a lump sum all at once, but to spread the investment over a period of time - otherwise you risk entering the equity market at a time when the market is peaking and about to fall. There are other ways to invest a lump sum. One possibility is to buy a second home (perhaps with retirement ultimately in mind). If you are tempted to buy abroad, remember that house prices do not necessarily appreciate in value in the same way as in Britain, and that quaint old farm buildings can be difficult to resell. Unless you plan to retire abroad, you are also taking on an exchange rate risk. In France, make sure you understand the inheritance laws on property. Second careers and downshifting The fifties can be years when you feel you are marking time at work, having climbed as far as you will go in your present career. It is certainly not too late to consider something new. However, self-employment or setting up a business do need to be approached with caution. Take particular care if you are tempted to buy an existing business. Running a village pub or buying a small bookshop may have strong appeal, but will not generate much profit, and you should not assume that a business which is unprofitable has just been poorly managed and can be turned around. If you establish a business, you have the choice of running it on a self-employed basis or incorporating it as a limited company and paying yourself through a salary and/or dividend payments. There are advantages and pitfalls to both routes, and it is appropriate to take advice. You will be liable to register for VAT if your turnover is \u00a352,000 or above. Retirement income With retirement now in the foreseeable future, this may be the last chance to build up adequate arrangements to tide you through the years when you will be surviving on your pension and investment income. One possibility is to shovel as much spare cash as possible into a pension. For people in occupational pension schemes, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) made through the company scheme are normally better value than free-standing AVCs, where charges are often substantial. If you have income from self-employment or from non-pensionable employment, you can contribute up to 30 per cent of these earnings each year to a personal pension between the ages of 51 and 55, or 35 per cent between 55 and 60 (though for high earners, these percentages are capped at an income of \u00a391,800). Most people are best off maximising pension contributions by back-dating payments, using the complex carry-forward and carry-back rules. With the introduction of stakeholder pensions next year, the rules on earnings will be relaxed. Building up capital for your retirement is not necessarily restricted to pensions, however. While pension contributions attract tax relief, the capital (whether in a personal pension or AVC) is locked away until you come to retire, and your eventual pension will be subject to income tax. Isas are more flexible, and should also be considered. Isa contributions (a maximum of \u00a37000 during 2000-1), while made from after-tax income, are afterwards held in a tax-free environment. Isas can also be cashed in at any time (though it is unwise to hold equity-based Isas unless you expect to hold them for a period of several years). To receive a forecast of your likely state pension, complete form BR19, available from tax and Benefits Agency offices. Early retirement If you are taking early retirement, the implications for the pension you will draw for the rest of your life can be significant. Occupational pensions may be reduced in three different ways: firstly, you will have fewer qualifying years in the scheme. Secondly, in final salary schemes, you are likely to be leaving work on a lower salary than you would otherwise have achieved. Finally, your pension scheme is likely to impose an actuarial reduction on your pension, to acknowledge the fact that you have contributed towards it for a shorter-than-anticipated period, but will be drawing it for longer. If you take retirement on the grounds of ill health, most of these penalties will not apply. If early retirement is offered as part of a redundancy programme, much will depend on the exact pension terms you manage to negotiate. For people with personal pensions, Inland Revenue rules normally permit you to purchase your pension annuity and take your cash lump sum from age 50. The Government recently announced plans to raise the age for drawing on personal and occupational pensions from 50 to 55. This won't affect today's fiftysomethings as the change, if implemented, will be phased in between 2010 and 2020. For fiftysomethings of the future, however, early retirement may be just a dream unless they amass a fortune in earlier life. It may soon be easier to combine part-time work with a pension - an option that may suit many. At present it is not normally possible to draw a pension and continue working part time with the same employer, but the Inland Revenue is expected to alter this rule. Even for those who can retire at 50 today, there are practical drawbacks. Few people have enough money to retire comfortably at that age. You will have paid less in contributions and your pension capital will have had less time to grow. You will be drawing a pension for longer, so the annuity you buy will be reduced accordingly. Pension companies may impose penalties if you do not continue a policy until the time you originally intended. Inheritance planning This is the time of life when you may be coming to terms with the idea of being a grandparent. Gifts to grandchildren do not have the same tax restrictions which apply when parents make gifts to their own children (where interest over \u00a3100 is treated for tax purposes as still being the parents' own income). Gifts which you make out of your normal income - rather than from capital - are outside the inheritance tax (IHT) net, and there is an annual IHT exemption for the first \u00a33,000 worth of gifts. Other gifts could potentially be liable for IHT, but only if you were to die within seven years. (The threshold for IHT on estates is \u00a3234,000.) If you are wealthy enough for inheritance tax to be an issue (only about 4 per cent of estates do incur an IHT liability), there can be advantages in arranging to skip a generation by passing assets directly to your grandchildren. There are a number of ways to achieve through family trusts and if you are in this fortunate position you will probably already have taken professional advice. Your will Finally, you should ensure that your will is up to date. Many people first make a will when they start a family; as children grow older, the arrangements may need to be changed.",

      "bodyText": "A High Court decision could force the government to backtrack on intentions to leave advice from home loan brokers outside the scope of the statutory mortgage regulation it plans to introduce in summer 2001. The judgment may also give a legal remedy to endowment policy holders whose mortgage payments increased because they got poor advice from agents tied to insurance companies. The case of Martin vs Britannia Life last month could move the line between advice which needs Financial Services Act authorisation such as that on investments including endowments and Isas, and on other recommendations such as home loans. A court has held that associated transactions must be taken into account as well as those that are specifically regulated. The decision in January to leave mortgage brokers outside the regulatory net surprised the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which was \"disappointed that the government has decided not to rationalise the various different strands of regulation into a single system\". Lenders and brokers say that the absolute certainty over the lines previously drawn between regulated and unregulated advice has disappeared. Michael Martin brought a claim against Britannia Life, which took over the Life Association of Scotland. In 1991 the LAS's agent, Ivan Sherman had advised Mr Martin to remortgage his family's home with the Bank of Scotland and to take out a new endowment policy with LAS. The mortgage involved was a \"low start\" one, where relatively low early repayments often led to a devastating accumulation of arrears which had to be repaid later. When Mr Martin eventually complained, the Britannia was prepared to accept that neither the remortgage nor the endowments were in his best interests. Indeed after some pressure was brought to bear, the company accepted that it had to refund the losses, including interest, Mr Martin suffered as a direct consequence of the endowment. On the mortgage, however, it did not admit liability. Britannia relied upon events in 1993 after the Insurance Ombudsman (whose role in this is now subsumed by the PIA Ombudsman) had started investigating a complaint against Legal and General about the mis-selling of an endowment policy and mortgage in a similar manner. Legal and General, backed by most of the major life in surance companies, maintained the Ombudsman's powers did not allow him to investigate such complaints. An eminent QC was called upon to arbitrate and found that Legal and General's position was correct. However, in hearing Mr Martin's claim, Mr Justice Parker took a different approach. He held that for the purposes of the Financial Services Act 1986 \"investment advice\" had to include \"associated or ancillary transactions\", even if they were not directly covered by the Act. It was artificial, he held, to break down financial advice given in a single session into parts that were and were not \"investment business\". The judge did not in fact find for Mr Martin, as the court claim had commenced more than six years after the loss. This gave Britannia a defence under the Limitation Act, despite Mr Martin's argument that the loss had actually arisen later than that. The judge, however, had no doubt that the salesman had misled Mr Martin and that the company was otherwise liable for it. Solicitor and former assistant to the Insurance Ombudsman, Peter Tyldesley, says: \"It is inevitable that many complaints to Ombudsmen will not have received the mortgage related compensation to which they are entitled.\" Where the Ombudsman has already rejected a claim it is questionable whether he can reopen it. It may, however, be that in that situation the threat of court proceedings would be enough to make insurance companies pay compensation to anyone who has taken out an over-priced mortgage on the basis of agents' advice. And the Treasury, which has the final say on financial services regulation, has been left to ponder whether its decision to regulate mortgage information and the provider rather than the sales process complies with existing law. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister",

      "trailText": "<p>Bolton's Eidur Gudjohnsen talks about how he is aiming to make up for lost time starting tomorrow against Ipswich Town.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>He lets out the deepest of sighs as he is asked yet again to tell the story of what might have been. He must have told it a thousand times, to the point where he hates being reminded of it, but Eidur Gudjohnsen none the less recalls how he was once considered the equal of Ronaldo. </p> <p>\"We were at PSV Eindhoven together,\" he says, staring out into the middle distance. \"I wouldn't say I was necessarily as big a talent as him. Looking back I can say that I have played with the best player in the world, although it didn't seem so special at the time.\" </p> <p>Whereas Ronaldo went on to become the most expensive, the highest paid and the most prominent footballer on the planet, his young team-mate left the Netherlands with his dreams in tatters and his career in the balance. Only now, four years later, is Gudjohnsen rediscovering the form that once looked like making him a superstar. </p> <p>Tomorrow he will enjoy one of his increasingly frequent moments in the spotlight when his Bolton Wanderers team play Ipswich Town in the first leg of the First Division play-off semi-finals at the Reebok stadium, an exact repeat of last year's meeting between the sides at the same stage. Bolton won that tie before losing out to Watford at Wembley. A place in the Premiership is the prize on offer once again, but the growing feeling is that Gudjohnsen will be there sooner rather than later anyway, with or without Bolton. </p> <p>Three goals in six starts for PSV prompted favourable comparisons with Ronaldo and made Gudjohnsen, however briefly, one of the hottest properties in European football. All was going to plan until a serious ankle injury, sustained while on international duty with Iceland Under-18s in Dublin, brought his career to a shuddering halt. </p> <p>It is not intended as a slight on Bolton Wanderers, the club who signed him two summers ago when nobody else would go near him, but a fully fit Gudjohnsen would undoubtedly be worthy of a higher stage. He only occasionally hints as much himself, and he is not bitter about events which forced him to rehabilitate in modest Lancashire surroundings. </p> <p><strong> Not seeking a move</strong><br> </p> <p> \"Bolton is where I'm trying to restart my career,\" he says. \"Everyone knows I've played with some big names and that people back then were expecting a lot, but I can't be the best until I'm completely fit. </p> <p>\"At the moment I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying life. Having gone through what I did, I appreciate what I've got. Who knows what will happen in the future? I could be injured, or just gone, in two or three years.\" </p> <p>Again there is a weary sigh when the subject of his future is broached. Derby County tabled a \u00a33m offer for him, and Sam Allardyce's predecessor Colin Todd, an experienced manager who has no doubt the striker he signed two years ago will adapt to the Premiership with ease, also fended off inquiries from Sunderland and Tottenham. </p> <p>Recent weeks have seen him linked with Newcastle United and Aston Villa, and more tenuously with Liverpool, prompting his manager Allardyce to double an initial transfer valuation of \u00a35m for the 21-year-old. </p> <p>\"My future is that on Sunday I am playing for Bolton in the play-offs against Ipswich,\" he shrugs. \"There has been a lot of speculation lately but that has been going on since the start of the season. I haven't paid much, in fact hardly any, attention to it.

      "bodyText": "He lets out the deepest of sighs as he is asked yet again to tell the story of what might have been. He must have told it a thousand times, to the point where he hates being reminded of it, but Eidur Gudjohnsen none the less recalls how he was once considered the equal of Ronaldo. \"We were at PSV Eindhoven together,\" he says, staring out into the middle distance. \"I wouldn't say I was necessarily as big a talent as him. Looking back I can say that I have played with the best player in the world, although it didn't seem so special at the time.\" Whereas Ronaldo went on to become the most expensive, the highest paid and the most prominent footballer on the planet, his young team-mate left the Netherlands with his dreams in tatters and his career in the balance. Only now, four years later, is Gudjohnsen rediscovering the form that once looked like making him a superstar. Tomorrow he will enjoy one of his increasingly frequent moments in the spotlight when his Bolton Wanderers team play Ipswich Town in the first leg of the First Division play-off semi-finals at the Reebok stadium, an exact repeat of last year's meeting between the sides at the same stage. Bolton won that tie before losing out to Watford at Wembley. A place in the Premiership is the prize on offer once again, but the growing feeling is that Gudjohnsen will be there sooner rather than later anyway, with or without Bolton. Three goals in six starts for PSV prompted favourable comparisons with Ronaldo and made Gudjohnsen, however briefly, one of the hottest properties in European football. All was going to plan until a serious ankle injury, sustained while on international duty with Iceland Under-18s in Dublin, brought his career to a shuddering halt. It is not intended as a slight on Bolton Wanderers, the club who signed him two summers ago when nobody else would go near him, but a fully fit Gudjohnsen would undoubtedly be worthy of a higher stage. He only occasionally hints as much himself, and he is not bitter about events which forced him to rehabilitate in modest Lancashire surroundings. Not seeking a move \"Bolton is where I'm trying to restart my career,\" he says. \"Everyone knows I've played with some big names and that people back then were expecting a lot, but I can't be the best until I'm completely fit. \"At the moment I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying life. Having gone through what I did, I appreciate what I've got. Who knows what will happen in the future? I could be injured, or just gone, in two or three years.\" Again there is a weary sigh when the subject of his future is broached. Derby County tabled a \u00a33m offer for him, and Sam Allardyce's predecessor Colin Todd, an experienced manager who has no doubt the striker he signed two years ago will adapt to the Premiership with ease, also fended off inquiries from Sunderland and Tottenham. Recent weeks have seen him linked with Newcastle United and Aston Villa, and more tenuously with Liverpool, prompting his manager Allardyce to double an initial transfer valuation of \u00a35m for the 21-year-old. \"My future is that on Sunday I am playing for Bolton in the play-offs against Ipswich,\" he shrugs. \"There has been a lot of speculation lately but that has been going on since the start of the season. I haven't paid much, in fact hardly any, attention to it. I'm certainly not looking for a move.\" Whereas doubt persists about how players such as Manchester City's prolific goalscorer Shaun Goater will perform in the Premiership next season, Gudjohnsen's potential is beyond debate. He has been blessed with a tal ent which has set him and his team aside from much of the mediocrity in the First Division. A stunning goal against Wimbledon in the Worthington Cup just before Christmas was worthy of his more illustrious former PSV team-mate. Picking up the ball on the left-hand touchline he dribbled past four defenders, displaying pace, balance and trickery, before rounding off with the coolest of finishes. \"I'd like to kick Eidur up the backside sometimes,\" said Allardyce afterwards. \"He plays so well in the cup games, I'd like to see him do just as well in the league.\" A nod of agreement comes from his father Arnor, who is one of his country's most famous footballers and enjoyed a successful spell with Anderlecht during the 1980s. \"I'm not sure he is back to his best yet, but he is getting there,\" said Gudjohnsen Sr, who still turns out for the Icelandic club Valur at the age of 39. \"He hasn't yet regained the explosive pace he once had, but that too will return as he gets stronger.

We ask the simple question: is there sponds in it? </p> <p>Generally, experience has taught us that if an organiser is prepared to meet the Tackle fee, then that suggests the event itself has the ambition to match yours truly's expectations. So, therefore, I was fully anticipating that the opening night party for the new George Best movie would very much live up to the predictions of the PR girl what painted a picture of wall-to-wall faces, there to raise a glass to football's most famous son. And Bestie would be there as well as me. </p> <p>My appetite was particularly raised after Bill, my contact at the People, belled to tell me there'd be a long 'un in it for yours truly if I could aid him in a particular task. </p> <p>\"Listen up, Dazz, there's big money in the first snap of Bestie falling off the wagon,\" he says. \"There's a major league drink in it, mate, if you go up to him with a glass and get him to hold it while my snapper moves into position. You up for it, or what?\" </p> <p>Simple task, no probs. </p> <p><strong> Thursday</strong> </p> <p>After what happened at training, I is more than happy at the prospect of the Bestie party tonight. When I arrives I discovers that everyone is already horizontal on a Florida beach - Wattsy, Vic, Bob, both Bosnians, the lot - except, of course, Darren Tackle. When I clobbers Old Demo about it, reminding him that there is still a game left in the season and how come everyone else is Mousebound with the Beckhams, his reaction shocks me. </p> <p>\"There's nothing to play for Saturday,\" he says. \"Perfect opportunity to give the senior pros a rest and let the kids and fringe guys have a game.\" </p> <p>\"So how come I is playing?\" I says. </p> <p>\"I just told you,\" he says. </p> <p>Sod him, it's down the smoke for the party. Course I gives the film itself a wide berth. Who wants to waste time hearing about a bunch of geezers knocking a ball around back in the mists of old tosserdom? If I wants to know about that sort ofancient history I can just tune in to Old Grandad Mickey Scanlan's anecdotes about the time he played against Gary Lineker. </p> <p>But when I heads straight to the party I find it's a sweating heave of no-marks. So lacking in class is the entire event, the geezer on the door doesn't even know who I am. There's no one I recognise except him off of the telly with no neck, you know the one, babbling geezer, chat show, goes \"er-er-er\" all the time, Clive summat. </p> <p>And all he does when I'm standing next to him at the bar is gives us a long lecture on employment law. Takes me at least half a dozen trips bar-bound before I've located Bestie, standing in a corner on his own, totally unmithered. In fact, you might say, people is deliberately avoiding him. </p> <p>I'm on a winner here, I'm thinking, as he's already got a bottle of bevvy in his mitts. Takes me another half-hour after that (including four more unscheduled trips to the bar) to find Bill and tell him of my success. </p> <p>\"He's here, is he?\" says Bill. \"Brilliant news, because the PR girl says he's given it a wide one.\" </p> <p>\"Follow me, William,\" I says, picking up a spare bottle from the bar and heading Bestwards. To be honest, geezer looked very relieved someone was paying him some mind. Plus, he's a lot shorter than he looks on telly. </p> <p>\"Poptastic, mate,\" he says when I hand over the bev. \"Absolutely sensational party, mate.\" </p> <p>\"Sure,\" I says, and turns round expecting to see the bulbs flashing. Instead I've got Bill whispering in my ear. </p> <p>\"Er, Dazz, how many have you had?\" </p> <p>\"Eh, Bill, just the 10, mate, I'm a professional, there's a game Saturday.\" </p> <p>\"Only, Dazz, that's not Bestie. That's Bruno Brookes.\"</p>",

My appetite was particularly raised after Bill, my contact at the People, belled to tell me there'd be a long 'un in it for yours truly if I could aid him in a particular task. \"Listen up, Dazz, there's big money in the first snap of Bestie falling off the wagon,\" he says. \"There's a major league drink in it, mate, if you go up to him with a glass and get him to hold it while my snapper moves into position. You up for it, or what?\" Simple task, no probs. Thursday After what happened at training, I is more than happy at the prospect of the Bestie party tonight. When I arrives I discovers that everyone is already horizontal on a Florida beach - Wattsy, Vic, Bob, both Bosnians, the lot - except, of course, Darren Tackle. When I clobbers Old Demo about it, reminding him that there is still a game left in the season and how come everyone else is Mousebound with the Beckhams, his reaction shocks me. \"There's nothing to play for Saturday,\" he says. \"Perfect opportunity to give the senior pros a rest and let the kids and fringe guys have a game.\" \"So how come I is playing?\" I says. \"I just told you,\" he says. Sod him, it's down the smoke for the party. Course I gives the film itself a wide berth. Who wants to waste time hearing about a bunch of geezers knocking a ball around back in the mists of old tosserdom? If I wants to know about that sort ofancient history I can just tune in to Old Grandad Mickey Scanlan's anecdotes about the time he played against Gary Lineker. But when I heads straight to the party I find it's a sweating heave of no-marks. So lacking in class is the entire event, the geezer on the door doesn't even know who I am. There's no one I recognise except him off of the telly with no neck, you know the one, babbling geezer, chat show, goes \"er-er-er\" all the time, Clive summat. And all he does when I'm standing next to him at the bar is gives us a long lecture on employment law. Takes me at least half a dozen trips bar-bound before I've located Bestie, standing in a corner on his own, totally unmithered. In fact, you might say, people is deliberately avoiding him. I'm on a winner here, I'm thinking, as he's already got a bottle of bevvy in his mitts. Takes me another half-hour after that (including four more unscheduled trips to the bar) to find Bill and tell him of my success. \"He's here, is he?\" says Bill. \"Brilliant news, because the PR girl says he's given it a wide one.\" \"Follow me, William,\" I says, picking up a spare bottle from the bar and heading Bestwards. To be honest, geezer looked very relieved someone was paying him some mind. Plus, he's a lot shorter than he looks on telly. \"Poptastic, mate,\" he says when I hand over the bev. \"Absolutely sensational party, mate.\" \"Sure,\" I says, and turns round expecting to see the bulbs flashing. Instead I've got Bill whispering in my ear. \"Er, Dazz, how many have you had?\" \"Eh, Bill, just the 10, mate, I'm a professional, there's a game Saturday.\" \"Only, Dazz, that's not Bestie. That's Bruno Brookes.\"",

But it will still evoke painful memories when he leads the minute's silence tomorrow. \"I was not based in Bradford at the time but I remember my phone ringing constantly as friends called to tell me they were safe,\" he says. \"And nine months later, when I returned to the city, I discovered that three families in my parish had lost someone in the fire.\" Short, 45, has been City chaplain for more than 10 years and has become so close to players and officials that his support for them has overtaken that for his first footballing love, Sheffield Wednesday. \"I wondered how I would feel when we first played Wednesday but I found myself cheering on Bradford and I have every time since,\" he says. \"Even so I was sad when Wednesday went down and it will be a black season for me if Bradford go as well.\" His job as chaplain, he says, involves wandering around the corridors of Valley Parade and chatting to whomever he meets. \"That way I get to know a lot of people well and I am there if I can ever be of use to them. I see chaplaincy as the church playing away.\" Before the game he will say his normal prayer for the club, though he will not be seeking divine intervention for a penalty or a free-kick on the edge of the box. \"I always pray that the players come off the pitch knowing that they have given everything, and it is normally answered,\" he says. \"And I happen to think we will win tomorrow and stay up.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>Peter Lennon stays in the villa made famous by Lawrence Durrell in his memoir of the island</p>",
      "byline": "Peter Lennon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Lawrence Durrell first climbed the steep slope from the mountain village of Bellapais to the villa that was to be called Bitter Lemons, he wrote that the snaky path he negotiated in a rain storm \"resembled the bed of a torrent\". </p> <p>It says something about the sluggish tourist development of Northern Cyprus that, when we arrived, the conditions were much the same. The rain had stopped, but the path resembled a dried-up gully, which the taxi refused to negotiate. It halted, appropriately, by the Tree of Idleness, at the centre of Bellapais by the 14th- century Augustinian abbey. The elegant gothic remains, overhang citrus gardens stretching down to the harbour of Girne (Kyrenia). </p> <p>Durrell came here in 1953 with his two-year-old daughter, Sappho, to begin a new life and write his planned Alexandria Quartet. But within two years, Archbishop Makarios and the guerrilla chief, Colonel Grivas, had begun their war to evict the British. </p> <p>Durrell had settled into unpolitical village life at Bellapais. But, strapped for cash, he accepted the post of director of information services (spin doctor) for the British. Soon the masons and carpenters who had helped build the villa, the rowdy drinking company and the friendly farmers deserted him. Before the villa was finished, he moved into Nicosia (Lefkosa) and, within a year, retreated in misery to England. But he had completed Justine and out of this experience came Bitter Lemons. </p> <p>The villa now has a number of additional luxuries that Durrell did not enjoy, including a pool in the leafy courtyard where ripe avocados drop on your head as you dip. </p> <p>The Republic of Northern Cyprus, set up after the Turkish invasion of 1974, is not recognised by any country apart from Turkey and suffers further isolation under a Greek embargo that forbids flights over Greek airspace. So it takes eight hours to get there from London, via Izmir in Western Turkey. Neither is it the victim of foreign investment (much as it would like to be). </p> <p>It is not local madness that is turning beautiful coastlines across Europe into frantic rallytracks of mongrelised food houses elbow-to-elbow with rasping discos and tatty trinket stores; it is \"international investment\" that dictates the density, the style (to pathetically misuse the word) and the decibel environment of a tourist resort. </p> <p>So when you sit in the little port of Girne watching the boats tilt and bob in the April sun (April, May, September and October are the best months), you have the eerie experience of natural sounds allowed their full value. You hear the waves lap and slap; the birds sing unflustered; the wind is allowed its full silken whisper. For those nurtured on the raucous hubbub of the Costa this and the Cte de that, it must seem like a power failure. (They have nice power failures, too, in Girne, when the world at night assumes a liquid sinuosity by candlelight.) </p> <p>The prices are soothing too: four quid for a three-course meal; \u00a38 for a gourmet experience. Even Ken Livingstone could not offer a better fare's fair deal: a dolmush (minibus) will take you the 20 miles from Girne to Lefkosa for 60p. As you speed west to the orange and lemon groves around G\u00fczelyhurt, the roads have that old-fashioned, evacuated look. </p> <p>North Cyprus is a particularily beautiful region; there are the cosy beaches around Girne, well serviced by restaurants, and on the east coast between Gazimagusa (Famagusta) and Bogaz, there is a 15-mile stretch of sandy beach. Famagusta once a great port, the most spectacular victim of the division of the island, contains a ghostly memento of its great commercial days: section of abandoned high-rise hotels. </p> <p>On our last evening, we went further up our hill to the small restaurant, Guthrie's Bar, run by Deirdre Guthrie whose parents, doctors working in Kuwait, built their summer house here just one year before Durrell arrived. As a teenager, home from boarding school, Deirdre, along with her mother often visited Durrell down the road. \"He would talk for hours, but mostly about himself,\" she recalled. Thirty years ago, a Swedish film maker did a documentary on Bellapais, including interviews with Deirdre's father and mother. She ran the old film for us. </p> <p>It was curious to see our village unfurl before us in shadowy black and white: the caf\u00e9 owners, bread-makers, shopkeepers, acting out their past life around the Tree of Idleness. I tried to match the faces to those I had seen, giving latitude for age. Then I suddenly realised that, of course, this was a totally different population. These were the Greek villagers Durrell knew, replaced abruptly in 1974 by Turks. It was a dramatic reminder of the ravages of politics. </p> <p>When Deirdre's parents returned three months after the invasion, the village was totally depopulated, plaintive with the sound of abandonded animals. </p> <p>Now, time has done its work and Bellapais has grown a new history for itself that appears as rooted as the old.</p> <p><strong>Durrell on Cyprus</strong></p> <p> <strong>First impression of Bellapais and the run-down villa he was to buy and renovate: </strong> <br>\"Everywhere grew roses, and the pale clouds of almond and peach bloom; on the balconies grew herbs in window-boxes made from old petrol tins . . . My reverie was interrupted by a moan. A heifer was the cause of the noise. It stood, plaintively chewing something in the front room, tethered to a ring in the wall.\" </p> <p><strong> Settling in with the locals: </strong><br> \"The bottle of cognac was low and I now recognised in it, despite its colourless innocence, a formidable adversary which, if taken too lightly, would unhorse me completely. I seized my host's arms . . . and suggested a change to wine. 'Wine,' he said and his voice was charged with professional tenderness.\" </p> <p><strong> He comes to collect his belongings: </strong><br> \"As I turned the last corner and came to rest under the belfries of the Abbey, I saw that the whole village was there in the little square. But as the [car] engine fell silent I was aware of some altogether novel factor about the scene. It lacked all animation . . . I walked across to the little caf\u00e9 which was crowded but utterly silent. Everybody looked at the ground, awkwardly and with a shy, clumsy disfavour.\" </p> <p><strong>Five best restaurants</strong></p> <p>1 <strong> Abbey Tower</strong> Bellapais Splendid Turkish cuisine; \u00a310 a head approx, including wine. </p> <p> 2<strong> AGED</strong> Bellapais Honest, copious fare for about \u00a36 a head. </p> <p> 3<strong> Le Jardin</strong> Three miles east of Girne French restaurant with a high- class reputation, but we kept sneaking back to the Abbey. </p> <p> 4<strong> Courtyard Inn</strong> Off the coast road east of Girne Noted for its fillet stuffed with pat\u00e9 and prawns. \u00a310 a head. </p> <p> 5<strong> The harbour caf\u00e9s in Girne</strong> Good for snacks and salads for well under a fiver.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Lawrence Durrell first climbed the steep slope from the mountain village of Bellapais to the villa that was to be called Bitter Lemons, he wrote that the snaky path he negotiated in a rain storm \"resembled the bed of a torrent\". It says something about the sluggish tourist development of Northern Cyprus that, when we arrived, the conditions were much the same. The rain had stopped, but the path resembled a dried-up gully, which the taxi refused to negotiate. It halted, appropriately, by the Tree of Idleness, at the centre of Bellapais by the 14th- century Augustinian abbey. The elegant gothic remains, overhang citrus gardens stretching down to the harbour of Girne (Kyrenia). Durrell came here in 1953 with his two-year-old daughter, Sappho, to begin a new life and write his planned Alexandria Quartet. But within two years, Archbishop Makarios and the guerrilla chief, Colonel Grivas, had begun their war to evict the British. Durrell had settled into unpolitical village life at Bellapais. But, strapped for cash, he accepted the post of director of information services (spin doctor) for the British. Soon the masons and carpenters who had helped build the villa, the rowdy drinking company and the friendly farmers deserted him. Before the villa was finished, he moved into Nicosia (Lefkosa) and, within a year, retreated in misery to England. But he had completed Justine and out of this experience came Bitter Lemons. The villa now has a number of additional luxuries that Durrell did not enjoy, including a pool in the leafy courtyard where ripe avocados drop on your head as you dip. The Republic of Northern Cyprus, set up after the Turkish invasion of 1974, is not recognised by any country apart from Turkey and suffers further isolation under a Greek embargo that forbids flights over Greek airspace. So it takes eight hours to get there from London, via Izmir in Western Turkey. Neither is it the victim of foreign investment (much as it would like to be). It is not local madness that is turning beautiful coastlines across Europe into frantic rallytracks of mongrelised food houses elbow-to-elbow with rasping discos and tatty trinket stores; it is \"international investment\" that dictates the density, the style (to pathetically misuse the word) and the decibel environment of a tourist resort. So when you sit in the little port of Girne watching the boats tilt and bob in the April sun (April, May, September and October are the best months), you have the eerie experience of natural sounds allowed their full value. You hear the waves lap and slap; the birds sing unflustered; the wind is allowed its full silken whisper. For those nurtured on the raucous hubbub of the Costa this and the Cte de that, it must seem like a power failure. (They have nice power failures, too, in Girne, when the world at night assumes a liquid sinuosity by candlelight.) The prices are soothing too: four quid for a three-course meal; \u00a38 for a gourmet experience. Even Ken Livingstone could not offer a better fare's fair deal: a dolmush (minibus) will take you the 20 miles from Girne to Lefkosa for 60p. As you speed west to the orange and lemon groves around G\u00fczelyhurt, the roads have that old-fashioned, evacuated look. North Cyprus is a particularily beautiful region; there are the cosy beaches around Girne, well serviced by restaurants, and on the east coast between Gazimagusa (Famagusta) and Bogaz, there is a 15-mile stretch of sandy beach. Famagusta once a great port, the most spectacular victim of the division of the island, contains a ghostly memento of its great commercial days: section of abandoned high-rise hotels. On our last evening, we went further up our hill to the small restaurant, Guthrie's Bar, run by Deirdre Guthrie whose parents, doctors working in Kuwait, built their summer house here just one year before Durrell arrived. As a teenager, home from boarding school, Deirdre, along with her mother often visited Durrell down the road. \"He would talk for hours, but mostly about himself,\" she recalled. Thirty years ago, a Swedish film maker did a documentary on Bellapais, including interviews with Deirdre's father and mother. She ran the old film for us. It was curious to see our village unfurl before us in shadowy black and white: the caf\u00e9 owners, bread-makers, shopkeepers, acting out their past life around the Tree of Idleness. I tried to match the faces to those I had seen, giving latitude for age. Then I suddenly realised that, of course, this was a totally different population. These were the Greek villagers Durrell knew, replaced abruptly in 1974 by Turks. It was a dramatic reminder of the ravages of politics. When Deirdre's parents returned three months after the invasion, the village was totally depopulated, plaintive with the sound of abandonded animals. Now, time has done its work and Bellapais has grown a new history for itself that appears as rooted as the old. Durrell on Cyprus First impression of Bellapais and the run-down villa he was to buy and renovate: \"Everywhere grew roses, and the pale clouds of almond and peach bloom; on the balconies grew herbs in window-boxes made from old petrol tins . . . My reverie was interrupted by a moan. A heifer was the cause of the noise. It stood, plaintively chewing something in the front room, tethered to a ring in the wall.\" Settling in with the locals: \"The bottle of cognac was low and I now recognised in it, despite its colourless innocence, a formidable adversary which, if taken too lightly, would unhorse me completely. I seized my host's arms . . . and suggested a change to wine. 'Wine,' he said and his voice was charged with professional tenderness.\" He comes to collect his belongings: \"As I turned the last corner and came to rest under the belfries of the Abbey, I saw that the whole village was there in the little square. But as the [car] engine fell silent I was aware of some altogether novel factor about the scene. It lacked all animation . . . I walked across to the little caf\u00e9 which was crowded but utterly silent. Everybody looked at the ground, awkwardly and with a shy, clumsy disfavour.\" Five best restaurants 1 Abbey Tower Bellapais Splendid Turkish cuisine; \u00a310 a head approx, including wine. 2 AGED Bellapais Honest, copious fare for about \u00a36 a head. 3 Le Jardin Three miles east of Girne French restaurant with a high- class reputation, but we kept sneaking back to the Abbey. 4 Courtyard Inn Off the coast road east of Girne Noted for its fillet stuffed with pat\u00e9 and prawns. \u00a310 a head. 5 The harbour caf\u00e9s in Girne Good for snacks and salads for well under a fiver.",

      "body": "<p>The National Cycle Network, chosen as a landmark project to celebrate the millennium, was funded with \u00a342 million of Lottery money and consists of 5,000 miles of both off-road and traffic-calmed routes in Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as unmarked routes along mostly quite lanes. By 2005, a further 4,000 miles will be added and the network will be complete. This network is to do much of the work of making the UK a place in which cycling is something less than insanely dangerous and, hey, even health inducing. </p> <p>For those of us who daily suck down fumes as we cycle behind buses, waiting only for the moment when some clown in a white van opens his door and projects us into orbit, the growth of this network, though not in itself enough, is no bad thing. </p> <p>That said, it is inevitable that the National Cycle Network will primarily be a leisure facility. Most of it runs through beautiful rural districts that deserve to be savoured at a relaxed speed. The network has been designed by a small charity called Sustrans, which is short for Sustainable Transport. </p> <p>Typical is the new 200-mile section opening in early June called the Coast and Castles Cycle Route. It starts in Newcastle, runs along Hadrian's Wall for a stretch, then up the wonderful castly coastline of Northumbria, up and down the Tweed valley before reaching Edinburgh. </p> <p>This is one of the safe, attractive routes that should ideally be used in conjunction with the integrated public transport system. Which would be nice if there was one. True, many of the routes devised by Sustrans have rail connections. But that is not enough and the cumulative effect of cycle-unfriendliness on the railways is that many people feel obliged to transport their bikes by car, which is no way to carry on. </p> <p>But that's enough carping. Sustrans' work in negotiating with 400 councils, landowners, businesses and what can only be described as the British Railways Board to push cycle routes through this patchwork quilt of a multi-owner-occupied kingdom deserves a great deal of credit. </p> <p>Sustrans also deserves praise for setting up a pilot project called Safe Routes to Schools and aimed at doing something about these dreadful figures: 60% of children cycle to school in Denmark compared with 2% in Britain. </p> <p>Thanks to Sustrans and the city council, it is now a delight to cycle in and around Birmingham, along the industrial-archaelogical sites that line its towpaths. It's even more of a pleasure to roll into Glastonbury along the Willow Walk, a verdant artwork created by Katy Hallett. </p> <p>The charity has also acquired more than 200 miles of former railway routes and incorporated them into the network. It's heartening to know that a covenant ensures their possible future use as railway corridors, though, if that covenant is taken up, it's hard to know what will become of the millions of us who will be cycling along them in years to come. </p> <p>All of these former railways have gentle gradients which make them suitable for cycling families with young children, though not exclusively so. When I cycled from Barnstaple to Plymouth last year along the newly-opened cross-Devon route, much of which was along a disused railway, there was purple scabious around my ankles and lilac brushing my cycle helmet. If I had been any more relaxed, I would have crashed into the bushes. </p> <p><strong>White Rose Route: Hull to Middlesbrough. 123 miles, easy/moderate</strong> </p> <p> Route 65 presses north alongside the Ouse, then through the quiet country lanes of the Vale of York, before rising up into the foothills of the North Yorkshire Moors. There's money in those hills, the kind of cash that demands that pubs in the vicinity have impressive wine lists and patrons who speak in that singular dialect, Yorkshire posh, just like William Hague. </p> <p>It was a lovely ride, and so well signposted that I barely needed to consult my map. </p> <p>I picked up the route just north of York railway station last Saturday on a sunny spring morning. Rowers were lifting their craft into a sparkling river and gardeners had emerged from a row of semis to tend the hanging gardens that step down to the Ouse. </p> <p>I swept on through the water meadows alongside the Ouse and past the leisurely dog walkers of this contented, cycle-friendly little city, and then under the seething outer ring road. Then I left the cycle path that runs through fields and joined a country lane near Skelton, where an evocative weather vane of cyclist and dog marked the transition. </p> <p>At nearby Shipton, two railway carriages have been fitted up as restaurant and hotel, but I was too busy pedalling off a thumping breakfast to patronise the Sidings Hotel in all but the most notional sense. From York to Easingwold, it's flat terrain, and consequently a little windy for the wobbling cyclist on even the stillest day. </p> <p>Just on from the Sidings Hotel lies the baroque pile of Beningborough Hall, a nice place for a contemplative wander if you have \u00a33.50 about your person. \"Explore Victorian life in the Laundry and Potting Shed,\" advised the blurb , but instead I roamed the soothing gardens and the collection of more than 100 portraits from the National Portrait Gallery. </p> <p>They really know when to mow village greens in this part of Yorkshire. Daisies, like white Smarties sprinkled by a god with fine attention to detail, glittered at me from one such green at Newton-on-Ouse. More ruthless gardeners would have cut that green of all such interest. </p> <p>There was time to consider such details since this was an easy cycle. At Easingwold, though, things changed. Inclines got steeper. I was whisked, thanks to Sustrans' route, into the village's Millfields Park, opened by the mayor only last year, and then through a rinky-dink housing estate, complete with mock-Georgian carriage lamps. The ups and downs of this portion were a surprise to me. </p> <p>At Newburgh Priory, I saw triangular sign warning of looming ducks. It's so peaceful hereabouts that damp birds are the most prominent of traffic hazards. Mind you, they were quite burly ducks. </p> <p>At Coxwold, a twee village on a hill, I sank two litres of mineral water, only pausing to emit grateful noisy sighs that seemed to affront the genteel patrons of the adjacent Fauconberg Arms. At this village, Sustrans splits the route in two - a gentle low road direct to Kilburn, and the high road, which I took, that pushes deeper into the hills of the Moors. By the time I reached Byland Abbey, crossing hills and dales, I had sweated most of the water on to my skin surface, thus attracting all of the local insect life. </p> <p>It was time for lunch. The Abbey Inn, opposite the abbey ruins, is recommended by Egon Ronay and, to a lesser extent, me. It has a restaurant, a good wine list, a delightful garden and a very small bar. I was dehydrated and in urgent need of the sustenance that only a poached salmon sandwich and a pint of Black Sheep bitter can supply. </p> <p>Fed, watered and abluted, I hit the road again. The White Horse, sculpted into the moorland hills, had long been an uncertain friend, playing peek-a-boo with me as I rose and fell over the hills. At Kilburn, Sustrans offered me another choice: back down into the valley or up into the moors. It was at this point I realised that I urgently needed after-sun lotion, and so headed down towards civilisation. My arms were turning weasel red and so I customised a quick route to Thirsk railway station. I was, nonetheless, very much taken with Sowerby, whose avenues of limes and floral verges were everything they should be. </p> <p>At Thirsk, it was race day. As I cycled along the road parallel to the the two-furlong marker, a steel band struck up something carnivalesque that spirited me on to the station. Watch out for that right-hand turn into the ticket office, though. It's a doozy. The rail journey from Thirsk to York passed without incident. It's worth recording that all the GNER staff I encountered both on this local service and on the mainline to King's Cross were properly solicitous for me and my bike. In York, I got the attention my arms so needed.</p> <p><strong>Where to visit:</strong> Beningborough Hall, Newburgh Priory (only open on Sunday and Wednesday afternoons), the White Horse at Kilburn, the ruins of Byland Abbey. Where to eat and drink: The Sidings Hotel and restaurant, The Facuonberg Inn, Coxswold. The Abbey Inn, Byland Abbey.</p> <p><strong> Thames Valley: London to Oxford. 97 miles, easy/moderate</strong> </p> <p> I rode the Thames Valley Cycle Route from Putney Bridge to Windsor. If there were hills, my calves didn't notice them. </p> <p>This was never, nor was meant to be, a cardiovascular work out. There were herons who sat on the Thames path near Molesey Reservoirs and blocked my way until the last possible moment. They flapped into the air with insolent laziness before settling fatly in my path once more. I felt sure they were the psychic equivalent of sleeping policemen. \"Slow down! Slow down! You'll enjoy it more.\" That is what they would have said if they could have spoken. </p> <p>Admittedly, I became embroiled in a little altercation near the Ferrari outlet on the Egham by pass, and the one-way systems of places like Kingston, Staines, Weybridge and lots of other identikit towns, jolted me from my reverie back into irksome reality. At these points, where a single slip can mean a 20-mile detour around Slough, the Sustrans map of the cycle route became hot in my hands. It proved very easy to follow, colourful, waterproof, and with smart inserts on how to get through commuter town centres without upset. The only problem with fold-up maps for on-the-go cyclist, to my mind, is that after a little bit of folding and unfolding, a tear always emerges at the vital corner. Much better, surely, to print the maps in little ring binders, as for example they have done with the Hayes London Cycle Guide. If I'd had a ring binder for a map, that whole Egham debacle, I am certain, could have been avoided. </p> <p>As I cycled these 40-odd miles, I felt protected from the traffic roar all around me. Sustrans has created a route that is a miracle of calm, though north of Windsor there is not yet a quiet path through the dismal jungle of Heathrow buildings and motorways. But even along the Putney to Windsor stretch, 747s are always with us. Only they interrupt the serenity. </p> <p>From Putney, the route took me along the Thames path for a little while, then nipped through Barnes's interesting collection of Toucan crossings and cycle lanes, before switching, delightfully, into Richmond Park, where it proved necessary to stop for the first of series of unhealthy snacks at Pembroke Lodge. A Toucan crossing, it turns out, is like a Pelican crossing for bikes. The park route forms a by-pass around Richmond. As a result, I missed one more English one-way system and Quinlan Terry's Prince Charles-approved retro riverfront development, for both of which, Sustrans, much thanks. </p> <p>After Richmond Park, I rejoined the Thames and swept through Teddington, where Magpie was filmed. Then I fringed Hampton Court Park. I hugged the Thames path tight as we swept through the badlands of the commuter belt. I have watched my Ali G, after all, and know that the feud between the West Staines and East Staines massives means that they regularly get medieval on eachothers' bottoms and, perhaps, on those of passing cyclists. </p> <p>This is an overdetermined corner of England, where heritage history does battle with a frenzied suburban aspiration and just about survives, but only thanks to the suburbanite need to express its collective Englishness through frequenting cream-tea joints and wandering through courtly fields to stately homes. </p> <p>There was almost too much history to take in. I found Runnymede, for instance, too replete with suggestion: the Magna Carta Tea Room, on Windsor Road, for instance. Nonetheless, I rolled my bike deferentially through the meadows where King John met 25 rebellious barons and placed his reluctant seal on the articles that became the Magna Carta. I strove to feel what the Ameri can Bar Association felt when they erected the Magna Carta Memorial on a hill overlooking the meadows in 1957. Or what the government felt in 1963 when it gave over one acre of Runnymede to the US to commemorate the death of John F Kennedy. At the Kennedy monument in this little bit of America, I removed my cycle helmet. </p> <p>After Runnymede, I stopped for a drink at the Fox and Hounds at Bishopsgate on the fringes of Windsor Great Park. This has a nice garden for a well-earned sit, and is a good place to reflect on the equestrian culture that thrives royally around here. Then I descended from the tranquil heights of Windsor Great Park to Windsor Castle, that jewel in the crown of multiple fudge concessions, gourmet coffee shops and souvenir emporia. </p> <p>At the Theatre Royal opposite the Queen's pad, they are staging a new musical called Hard Times. Fudge-sated tourists and complacent locals mingled in the queues to hear the evils of Victorian capitalism expressed in easeful song. History has become harmless here and even our ancestors' sufferings are sold back to us for fun. I cycled on to the station, eager to leave.</p> <p><strong>Where to eat and drink:</strong> Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park. Magna Carta Tea Rooms, Runnymede. The Fox and Hounds, Bishopsgate.</p> <p><strong>Cycling essentials</strong></p> <p><strong> What to wear</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Loose clothing that allows freedom of movement is essential. Short, tight T-shirts, for instance, may look fetching, but they will result in an ugly sunburned rim in the small of your back. Trust me. Lycra, for some, is just the thing, though gentlemen who favour very tight Lycra shorts might do well to reflect that children and horses are easily disturbed by such sights. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Waterproof tops and trousers are a necessity. They roll up small in your pannier and are extremely light. Forget them and it will rain hard and you will be very miserable. Gore-Tex is a good breathable material. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Gloves. The wind and rain numb your knuckles, and if you take a tumble you are very likely to graze your hands. Gloves can help in both cases, though perhaps not knitted ones. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Helmet. Most of the routes on the National Cycle Network involve tricky little on-road switchbacks during which white van men and boy racers will try to put you in casualty. A helmet will help frustrate them and, to my mind, looks quite stylish.</p> <p><strong> What to take</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Accessories. You will need a pump, a puncture-repair kit and a spare inner tube. The last is fundamental if you don't want to spend desperate hours hunting for a puncture on an old inner tube as dusk sweeps across the moors. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't forget lights and reflective belts. If the weather turns, as it does in Britain, or you run out of daylight, these are essential, especially on dark country lanes. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Drinks. Even when it's cold you will need to drink because you will dehy drate. Take a water bottle, preferably one that you can attach to your bike frame. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Food. Cycling in Britain is hardly a gourmet experience and it's hard not to eat unhealthily, given the dictatorship of cream tea shops, real-ale boozers and fry-up devotees in our countryside. You might want to consider sandwiches, particularly those with a low likelihood of turning soggy during the morning. Bananas are good for energy. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sun-block is important if you don't want your arms, legs and - who knows - bald spot, to be red raw by the end of the day.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The first 5,000 miles of the National Cycle Network opens on June 21.This is only half the story though. Sustrans, the charity coordinating its building, has another 5,000 miles due for completion by 2005 and needs more funding to continue the work. If you want to make a donation, you can become a Sustrans supporter through its website: <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk\">www.sustrans.org.uk</a>, by calling the information line on 0117 9290888 or by writing to Sustrans, 35 King Street, Bristol BS1 4DZ. Any donations made now will still be matched by Millennium Commission funds.</p>",

At Kilburn, Sustrans offered me another choice: back down into the valley or up into the moors. It was at this point I realised that I urgently needed after-sun lotion, and so headed down towards civilisation. My arms were turning weasel red and so I customised a quick route to Thirsk railway station. I was, nonetheless, very much taken with Sowerby, whose avenues of limes and floral verges were everything they should be. At Thirsk, it was race day. As I cycled along the road parallel to the the two-furlong marker, a steel band struck up something carnivalesque that spirited me on to the station. Watch out for that right-hand turn into the ticket office, though. It's a doozy. The rail journey from Thirsk to York passed without incident. It's worth recording that all the GNER staff I encountered both on this local service and on the mainline to King's Cross were properly solicitous for me and my bike. In York, I got the attention my arms so needed. Where to visit: Beningborough Hall, Newburgh Priory (only open on Sunday and Wednesday afternoons), the White Horse at Kilburn, the ruins of Byland Abbey. Where to eat and drink: The Sidings Hotel and restaurant, The Facuonberg Inn, Coxswold. The Abbey Inn, Byland Abbey. Thames Valley: London to Oxford. 97 miles, easy/moderate I rode the Thames Valley Cycle Route from Putney Bridge to Windsor. If there were hills, my calves didn't notice them. This was never, nor was meant to be, a cardiovascular work out. There were herons who sat on the Thames path near Molesey Reservoirs and blocked my way until the last possible moment. They flapped into the air with insolent laziness before settling fatly in my path once more. I felt sure they were the psychic equivalent of sleeping policemen. \"Slow down! Slow down! You'll enjoy it more.\" That is what they would have said if they could have spoken. Admittedly, I became embroiled in a little altercation near the Ferrari outlet on the Egham by pass, and the one-way systems of places like Kingston, Staines, Weybridge and lots of other identikit towns, jolted me from my reverie back into irksome reality. At these points, where a single slip can mean a 20-mile detour around Slough, the Sustrans map of the cycle route became hot in my hands. It proved very easy to follow, colourful, waterproof, and with smart inserts on how to get through commuter town centres without upset. The only problem with fold-up maps for on-the-go cyclist, to my mind, is that after a little bit of folding and unfolding, a tear always emerges at the vital corner. Much better, surely, to print the maps in little ring binders, as for example they have done with the Hayes London Cycle Guide. If I'd had a ring binder for a map, that whole Egham debacle, I am certain, could have been avoided. As I cycled these 40-odd miles, I felt protected from the traffic roar all around me. Sustrans has created a route that is a miracle of calm, though north of Windsor there is not yet a quiet path through the dismal jungle of Heathrow buildings and motorways. But even along the Putney to Windsor stretch, 747s are always with us. Only they interrupt the serenity. From Putney, the route took me along the Thames path for a little while, then nipped through Barnes's interesting collection of Toucan crossings and cycle lanes, before switching, delightfully, into Richmond Park, where it proved necessary to stop for the first of series of unhealthy snacks at Pembroke Lodge. A Toucan crossing, it turns out, is like a Pelican crossing for bikes. The park route forms a by-pass around Richmond. As a result, I missed one more English one-way system and Quinlan Terry's Prince Charles-approved retro riverfront development, for both of which, Sustrans, much thanks. After Richmond Park, I rejoined the Thames and swept through Teddington, where Magpie was filmed. Then I fringed Hampton Court Park. I hugged the Thames path tight as we swept through the badlands of the commuter belt. I have watched my Ali G, after all, and know that the feud between the West Staines and East Staines massives means that they regularly get medieval on eachothers' bottoms and, perhaps, on those of passing cyclists. This is an overdetermined corner of England, where heritage history does battle with a frenzied suburban aspiration and just about survives, but only thanks to the suburbanite need to express its collective Englishness through frequenting cream-tea joints and wandering through courtly fields to stately homes. There was almost too much history to take in. I found Runnymede, for instance, too replete with suggestion: the Magna Carta Tea Room, on Windsor Road, for instance. Nonetheless, I rolled my bike deferentially through the meadows where King John met 25 rebellious barons and placed his reluctant seal on the articles that became the Magna Carta. I strove to feel what the Ameri can Bar Association felt when they erected the Magna Carta Memorial on a hill overlooking the meadows in 1957. Or what the government felt in 1963 when it gave over one acre of Runnymede to the US to commemorate the death of John F Kennedy. At the Kennedy monument in this little bit of America, I removed my cycle helmet. After Runnymede, I stopped for a drink at the Fox and Hounds at Bishopsgate on the fringes of Windsor Great Park. This has a nice garden for a well-earned sit, and is a good place to reflect on the equestrian culture that thrives royally around here. Then I descended from the tranquil heights of Windsor Great Park to Windsor Castle, that jewel in the crown of multiple fudge concessions, gourmet coffee shops and souvenir emporia. At the Theatre Royal opposite the Queen's pad, they are staging a new musical called Hard Times. Fudge-sated tourists and complacent locals mingled in the queues to hear the evils of Victorian capitalism expressed in easeful song. History has become harmless here and even our ancestors' sufferings are sold back to us for fun. I cycled on to the station, eager to leave. Where to eat and drink: Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park. Magna Carta Tea Rooms, Runnymede. The Fox and Hounds, Bishopsgate. Cycling essentials What to wear \u00b7 Loose clothing that allows freedom of movement is essential. Short, tight T-shirts, for instance, may look fetching, but they will result in an ugly sunburned rim in the small of your back. Trust me. Lycra, for some, is just the thing, though gentlemen who favour very tight Lycra shorts might do well to reflect that children and horses are easily disturbed by such sights. \u00b7 Waterproof tops and trousers are a necessity. They roll up small in your pannier and are extremely light. Forget them and it will rain hard and you will be very miserable. Gore-Tex is a good breathable material. \u00b7 Gloves. The wind and rain numb your knuckles, and if you take a tumble you are very likely to graze your hands. Gloves can help in both cases, though perhaps not knitted ones. \u00b7 Helmet. Most of the routes on the National Cycle Network involve tricky little on-road switchbacks during which white van men and boy racers will try to put you in casualty. A helmet will help frustrate them and, to my mind, looks quite stylish. What to take \u00b7 Accessories. You will need a pump, a puncture-repair kit and a spare inner tube. The last is fundamental if you don't want to spend desperate hours hunting for a puncture on an old inner tube as dusk sweeps across the moors. \u00b7 Don't forget lights and reflective belts. If the weather turns, as it does in Britain, or you run out of daylight, these are essential, especially on dark country lanes. \u00b7 Drinks. Even when it's cold you will need to drink because you will dehy drate. Take a water bottle, preferably one that you can attach to your bike frame. \u00b7 Food. Cycling in Britain is hardly a gourmet experience and it's hard not to eat unhealthily, given the dictatorship of cream tea shops, real-ale boozers and fry-up devotees in our countryside. You might want to consider sandwiches, particularly those with a low likelihood of turning soggy during the morning. Bananas are good for energy. \u00b7 Sun-block is important if you don't want your arms, legs and - who knows - bald spot, to be red raw by the end of the day. \u00b7 The first 5,000 miles of the National Cycle Network opens on June 21.This is only half the story though. Sustrans, the charity coordinating its building, has another 5,000 miles due for completion by 2005 and needs more funding to continue the work. If you want to make a donation, you can become a Sustrans supporter through its website: www.sustrans.org.uk, by calling the information line on 0117 9290888 or by writing to Sustrans, 35 King Street, Bristol BS1 4DZ. Any donations made now will still be matched by Millennium Commission funds.",

Consequently, he's delivered a string of dark-hued performances in the likes of To Die For, U-Turn and 8MM.

      "body": "<p>You can spot them in the student's union bar in fresher's week, even if they have already cut off their dreadlocks and binned the tie-dyed trousers. There is something about people who have taken a year out before going to university; they are likely to have a more cosmopolitan worldview, and will almost certainly have more confidence than many of their peers. And, of course, they will talk with evangelical zeal about their experiences, given the chance. </p> <p>Lucy McRoyal is as breathlessly enthusiastic as any. She went to Belize last year with Raleigh International, taking a diving course before working on a community project building a school in a remote village. \"It was amazing,\" she says, \"certainly a change from south London. I thought the diving would be the best part of going to Belize, but the village project was even better. \" </p> <p>McRoyal was unemployed before taking her trip abroad, but was so enthused on her return she organised a New Deal placement with Raleigh. She now hopes to train as a diving instructor. </p> <p>Just about everyone seems to agree that taking time off after school before going to university or looking for work is a good idea. University vice-chancellors, in fact, are some of the most enthusiastic: 93% told a recent survey that they believe a structured year out benefits students' personal development. </p> <p>Studies have also shown that year-out adventurers are less likely to drop out of college, and act as a motivating influence on their peers. Some 22,000 students defer their application to university or college by a year, about 5% of those entering higher education. </p> <p>Perhaps the people who need most convincing are parents. Even if their offspring sign up for a structured programme rather than venturing off where the wind (or their new travelling companions) takes them, problems can still arise with host organisations, finances or plain old Delhi belly. Travelling with a respected organisation should at least ensure someone is on hand to sort out the emergency airlift if things go really awry. </p> <p>The problem for would-be adventurers is where to start looking, and how to choose between organisations all offering the experience of a lifetime. \"I wouldn't like to say that there are cowboy organisations out there, but there has been a proliferation of providers, and there was concern that there wasn't any regulation,\" says Brian Tripp, chief executive of the Engineering Development Trust, which organises industrial placements in this country. There is no central register of organisations offering year out schemes, he says, \"but we're talking hundreds\". </p> <p>As a result, 20 of the leading year-out providers have joined forces as the Year Out Group, aiming to encourage each other to better standards in organising the schemes, and provide a quality stamp for young people struggling to decide how and where to spend their year abroad. </p> <p>\"What we are trying to do is put students and their advisors in the position where they have a checklist of key questions to think about,\" says Tripp. \"A structured programme should give support and ensure a quality of experience. It should also minimise risk.\" </p> <p>With year-out schemes costing up to \u00a34,000 (though few travellers pay for this themselves, meeting the cost through fundraising), it is also important to be certain that the organisation in question is a reputable one. </p> <p>\"Our advice is to take the issue seriously,\" Tripp says. \"Look at the range of opportunities that are available and make sure the organisation meets your needs.\" </p> <p>Liz Newbon would agree. She spent a year in Pakistan before going to university, teaching in a girls' school in a town near Islamabad. \"I wanted to travel and live as part of a different community,\" she says. </p> <p>Newbon admits, however, that she wasn't fully prepared for the Islamic state's constraints on women. \"It was quite restrictive. In some ways, it wasn't as exciting as some other people's year-out. People should try to get as much information about the options as possible, and really think about what they want to do, before they make their choice.\"</p> <p><strong>What you need to know</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Who can take part, and how are they selected?

      "bodyText": "You can spot them in the student's union bar in fresher's week, even if they have already cut off their dreadlocks and binned the tie-dyed trousers. There is something about people who have taken a year out before going to university; they are likely to have a more cosmopolitan worldview, and will almost certainly have more confidence than many of their peers. And, of course, they will talk with evangelical zeal about their experiences, given the chance. Lucy McRoyal is as breathlessly enthusiastic as any. She went to Belize last year with Raleigh International, taking a diving course before working on a community project building a school in a remote village. \"It was amazing,\" she says, \"certainly a change from south London. I thought the diving would be the best part of going to Belize, but the village project was even better. \" McRoyal was unemployed before taking her trip abroad, but was so enthused on her return she organised a New Deal placement with Raleigh. She now hopes to train as a diving instructor. Just about everyone seems to agree that taking time off after school before going to university or looking for work is a good idea. University vice-chancellors, in fact, are some of the most enthusiastic: 93% told a recent survey that they believe a structured year out benefits students' personal development. Studies have also shown that year-out adventurers are less likely to drop out of college, and act as a motivating influence on their peers. Some 22,000 students defer their application to university or college by a year, about 5% of those entering higher education. Perhaps the people who need most convincing are parents. Even if their offspring sign up for a structured programme rather than venturing off where the wind (or their new travelling companions) takes them, problems can still arise with host organisations, finances or plain old Delhi belly. Travelling with a respected organisation should at least ensure someone is on hand to sort out the emergency airlift if things go really awry. The problem for would-be adventurers is where to start looking, and how to choose between organisations all offering the experience of a lifetime. \"I wouldn't like to say that there are cowboy organisations out there, but there has been a proliferation of providers, and there was concern that there wasn't any regulation,\" says Brian Tripp, chief executive of the Engineering Development Trust, which organises industrial placements in this country. There is no central register of organisations offering year out schemes, he says, \"but we're talking hundreds\". As a result, 20 of the leading year-out providers have joined forces as the Year Out Group, aiming to encourage each other to better standards in organising the schemes, and provide a quality stamp for young people struggling to decide how and where to spend their year abroad. \"What we are trying to do is put students and their advisors in the position where they have a checklist of key questions to think about,\" says Tripp. \"A structured programme should give support and ensure a quality of experience. It should also minimise risk.\" With year-out schemes costing up to \u00a34,000 (though few travellers pay for this themselves, meeting the cost through fundraising), it is also important to be certain that the organisation in question is a reputable one. \"Our advice is to take the issue seriously,\" Tripp says. \"Look at the range of opportunities that are available and make sure the organisation meets your needs.\" Liz Newbon would agree. She spent a year in Pakistan before going to university, teaching in a girls' school in a town near Islamabad. \"I wanted to travel and live as part of a different community,\" she says. Newbon admits, however, that she wasn't fully prepared for the Islamic state's constraints on women. \"It was quite restrictive. In some ways, it wasn't as exciting as some other people's year-out. People should try to get as much information about the options as possible, and really think about what they want to do, before they make their choice.\" What you need to know \u0095 Who can take part, and how are they selected? How many participants will be on the programme? Can they choose between programmes? \u0095 Who benefits from the activity? What will participants gain, and who else will benefit? \u0095 What exactly will volunteers be doing? Do they live alone or in a group? Are they paid?

      "body": "<p>Chris Brasher's idea of a decent little walk to fill a spare weekend is a three-day trek in the heart of Snowdonia, starting and ending at railway stations and passing among the great peaks and ridges of five mountain ranges. </p> <p>\"It takes you through some of the most magnificent scenery in Britain,\" he says. \"And you can expand it to include the summit of Snowdon, for example, and the Carneddau ridge in the north. There's a whole set of wonderful variations.\" </p> <p>He did it his last September with Oboe, a group whose name was inspired by a remark by Bill Tilman - a famously nonchalant pre-war climber, who claimed that \"any worthwhile expedition can be organised on the back of an envelope\". </p> <p>Nowadays, Brasher is probably best known for the company that makes Britain's best-selling walking boots. But he was also one of the \"rabbits\" who paced Sir Roger Bannister to the first sub-four-minute mile in 1954, won a gold medal at the 1956 Olympics and founded the London Marathon in 1981. </p> <p>For this Oboe excursion, he met eight friends at Llandudno Junction and took a train south to Harlech, breaking the journey for a spin on the narrow-gauge slate railway at Blaenau Ffestiniog. Next morning, they looked round Harlech castle before climbing the northern tip of the Rhinog range. By the time they were descending a gorge on the far side, they were talking so hard they took a wrong turning. </p> <p>\"We ended up more or less swinging from tree to tree, crossing the river at least three times before emerging into lovely country above Maentwrog.

      "bodyText": "Chris Brasher's idea of a decent little walk to fill a spare weekend is a three-day trek in the heart of Snowdonia, starting and ending at railway stations and passing among the great peaks and ridges of five mountain ranges. \"It takes you through some of the most magnificent scenery in Britain,\" he says. \"And you can expand it to include the summit of Snowdon, for example, and the Carneddau ridge in the north. There's a whole set of wonderful variations.\" He did it his last September with Oboe, a group whose name was inspired by a remark by Bill Tilman - a famously nonchalant pre-war climber, who claimed that \"any worthwhile expedition can be organised on the back of an envelope\". Nowadays, Brasher is probably best known for the company that makes Britain's best-selling walking boots. But he was also one of the \"rabbits\" who paced Sir Roger Bannister to the first sub-four-minute mile in 1954, won a gold medal at the 1956 Olympics and founded the London Marathon in 1981. For this Oboe excursion, he met eight friends at Llandudno Junction and took a train south to Harlech, breaking the journey for a spin on the narrow-gauge slate railway at Blaenau Ffestiniog. Next morning, they looked round Harlech castle before climbing the northern tip of the Rhinog range. By the time they were descending a gorge on the far side, they were talking so hard they took a wrong turning. \"We ended up more or less swinging from tree to tree, crossing the river at least three times before emerging into lovely country above Maentwrog. We stayed at the Grapes, where the bar food is good and one of the barmaids is quite spectacular.\" Next day, a guide, Rob Collister, took them through a series of huge chambers made by slate miners in the mountain of Moel-yr-hydd. \"It's quite amazing to think they carved these vast caverns working in pairs with a candle, a rope and a bit of gunpowder,\" says Brasher. \"You could get St Paul's into some of them. \"We eventually emerged about 300ft higher than where we'd gone in, so it was the first time in my life I've climbed a mountain from the inside.\" From here, they followed paths through disused quarries below the ridge of the Moelwyn range, down to the banks of Lleyn Gwynant, and along one of the most beautiful valleys in Wales, where Brasher used to have a cottage, to the famous Pen-y-Gwyrd Hotel, the training base for the 1953 Everest expedition. \"Don't expect phones in every room.Don't expect TV,\" he says. \"Do expect good beer, wholesome food, and a marvellous atmosphere.

      "body": "<p>Hans said we were lucky, he could squeeze us in on one little table for two. Amsterdam on a bank holiday weekend and almost every dining space was filled.</p> <p>From the guidebook, Hans's place sounded quirky. The sort of restaurant that you go to and eat what you are told. Almost like school dinners except with white napery, silverware and lots of alcohol, Utrechtsedwarstafel is the type of place where you go to be gently bullied and come away satisfied, and with some new piece of culinary knowledge.</p> <p>Run by Hans and his partner Igor, the restaurant provides heavenly fare for all different types of budget. You can sit down and have three basic courses and wine, or move up the ranks to the five deluxe courses with a different glass of incredibly fine wine with each course.</p> <p>Of all the cities in the world, Amsterdam is not famed for its food. Other things - sex, drugs, canals, Van Gogh's paintings, Anne Frank's house - yes, but not its food.</p> <p>Native Dutch cuisine is not really memorable or inspiring, though it is influenced from cookery from all round the world. We had tried herring, pancakes, frites with mayonnaise, belegde broodjes - crusty rolls stuffed with a variety of fillings - and even chucked a shoarma kebab down our necks while standing on a canal bridge. All good but we had eaten nothing that we could use as food-bore dinner party conversation.</p> <p>We did learn that by combining ingredients from Indonesia, Surinam and Turkey, Amsterdam had fusion cuisine before other chefs even invented it. The famous Rijstaffel - a plate of rice or noodles accompanied by lots of little spicy side dishes - can be wonderful, and the Portuguese tapas proved to be better than some of the Spanish tapas found in London.</p> <p>But it was Igor and Hans who gave Amsterdam a mark as a place for good food. First there was the glass of ros\u00e9 pergolino, perfect for a warm night. Then the question put to every guest: is there any type of food you do not like?</p> <p>Then there was a little duck rillette with cournichons, some terrine of Irish smoked salmon and sole with marinated Dutch asparagus and fillet of Aberdeen Angus beef with broad beans, asparagus and a red wine reduction.</p> <p>Each course was hand delivered and explained in detail by Igor, who works alone in the kitchen, and accompanied by a wine specially selected and progeny dissected by Hans. The dessert wine - a Riesling from the Kuentz-Bas vineyard - could only be produced every four years, he said, because that was when a fine mist descended on the grapes, causing a fungus to form on the skin that allows the juices to ferment and producing a sweet confection.</p> <p>Simply watching these two men whirl around in the middle of this strange restaurant left school-kid grins on our faces. We seemed to like being bullied.</p> <p>Later, Hans told us a story that made us realise that he didn't take too kindly to people who didn't like doing what they were told. Just days before he had thrown four culinary journalists out after they decided to leave his restaurant without eating his food or paying a cover charge. After locking them in and calling the police, Hans decided to let them go.</p> <p>One of the journalists had asked for a salad. Hans and Igor don't do salads. You take what you get at Utrechtsedwarstafel, but what you get is fantastic.</p> <p>Over at the Supper Club, you get a different but equally bizarre experience. This is Amsterdam's new hotspot: a place that combines fine food, funky grooves and cutting-edge design. Here, you eat a six- or seven-course meal reclining on a bed.</p> <p>Dancers as well as waiters manoeuvre between the tables and when you have finished your supper and had a little rest on your mattress, you can get up and dance. Guests arrive at 8pm, slowly make their way through their meal and don't have to leave until 2am.</p> <p>This was different than Hans's place. We were unlucky: we couldn't get a table (or bed space). It looks like we'll have to go back to Amsterdam because we want to be able to bore the dinner party people about the Supper Club.</p> <p><strong> Eating out</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Utrechtsedwarstafel</strong><br> Utrechtsedwarsstraat 107-109</p> <p>Eat and drink what you are given in this fantastically eclectic restaurant with no menu.

      "bodyText": "Hans said we were lucky, he could squeeze us in on one little table for two. Amsterdam on a bank holiday weekend and almost every dining space was filled. From the guidebook, Hans's place sounded quirky. The sort of restaurant that you go to and eat what you are told. Almost like school dinners except with white napery, silverware and lots of alcohol, Utrechtsedwarstafel is the type of place where you go to be gently bullied and come away satisfied, and with some new piece of culinary knowledge. Run by Hans and his partner Igor, the restaurant provides heavenly fare for all different types of budget. You can sit down and have three basic courses and wine, or move up the ranks to the five deluxe courses with a different glass of incredibly fine wine with each course. Of all the cities in the world, Amsterdam is not famed for its food. Other things - sex, drugs, canals, Van Gogh's paintings, Anne Frank's house - yes, but not its food. Native Dutch cuisine is not really memorable or inspiring, though it is influenced from cookery from all round the world. We had tried herring, pancakes, frites with mayonnaise, belegde broodjes - crusty rolls stuffed with a variety of fillings - and even chucked a shoarma kebab down our necks while standing on a canal bridge. All good but we had eaten nothing that we could use as food-bore dinner party conversation. We did learn that by combining ingredients from Indonesia, Surinam and Turkey, Amsterdam had fusion cuisine before other chefs even invented it. The famous Rijstaffel - a plate of rice or noodles accompanied by lots of little spicy side dishes - can be wonderful, and the Portuguese tapas proved to be better than some of the Spanish tapas found in London. But it was Igor and Hans who gave Amsterdam a mark as a place for good food. First there was the glass of ros\u00e9 pergolino, perfect for a warm night. Then the question put to every guest: is there any type of food you do not like? Then there was a little duck rillette with cournichons, some terrine of Irish smoked salmon and sole with marinated Dutch asparagus and fillet of Aberdeen Angus beef with broad beans, asparagus and a red wine reduction. Each course was hand delivered and explained in detail by Igor, who works alone in the kitchen, and accompanied by a wine specially selected and progeny dissected by Hans. The dessert wine - a Riesling from the Kuentz-Bas vineyard - could only be produced every four years, he said, because that was when a fine mist descended on the grapes, causing a fungus to form on the skin that allows the juices to ferment and producing a sweet confection. Simply watching these two men whirl around in the middle of this strange restaurant left school-kid grins on our faces. We seemed to like being bullied. Later, Hans told us a story that made us realise that he didn't take too kindly to people who didn't like doing what they were told. Just days before he had thrown four culinary journalists out after they decided to leave his restaurant without eating his food or paying a cover charge. After locking them in and calling the police, Hans decided to let them go. One of the journalists had asked for a salad. Hans and Igor don't do salads. You take what you get at Utrechtsedwarstafel, but what you get is fantastic. Over at the Supper Club, you get a different but equally bizarre experience. This is Amsterdam's new hotspot: a place that combines fine food, funky grooves and cutting-edge design. Here, you eat a six- or seven-course meal reclining on a bed. Dancers as well as waiters manoeuvre between the tables and when you have finished your supper and had a little rest on your mattress, you can get up and dance. Guests arrive at 8pm, slowly make their way through their meal and don't have to leave until 2am. This was different than Hans's place. We were unlucky: we couldn't get a table (or bed space). It looks like we'll have to go back to Amsterdam because we want to be able to bore the dinner party people about the Supper Club. Eating out Utrechtsedwarstafel Utrechtsedwarsstraat 107-109 Eat and drink what you are given in this fantastically eclectic restaurant with no menu. Matrix price list varying from fl75 (\u00a321) for three basic courses with wine, to fl195 (\u00a354) for five deluxe courses with wine.Our dinner for two including wine cost fl280 (\u00a377). Caf\u00e9 Tapas Bar de Portugees Zeedijk 28a Portuguese tapas bar serving cockles in wine sauce and fried anchovies to die for. Various tapas and a half-litre of delicious sangria costs fl80.50 (\u00a322). Tuju Maret Utrechtsestraat 73, Try the traditional Indonesian/ Dutch rijstaffel: fl150 (\u00a340). The Supper Club Jonge Roelnsteeg 21 Lie back on a bed while gorging on a five-course feast in this restaurant-cum-nightclub. Caf\u00e9 Americain American Hotel, Leidseplein. Have tea and cake or a club sandwich in this wonderful art-deco hotel that is only slightly overtouristy. Between meals Cruise the canals There's no better way to get your bearings in this watery city than by cruising its canals. Both daytime and candlelit cruises operate throughout the year. Reservations are not required for individuals. Prices vary from fl8 (\u00a32.20) for children and fl12 (\u00a33.30) for adults for a daytime cruise, to approx fl145 (\u00a340) for a luxurious dinner cruise. World Press Photo Exhibition De Oude Kerk, Oudekerksplein 23 Apr 18-May 28, Mon-Sat 11am-5pm, Sun 1-5pm. The best of the annual competition for photo-journalists plus a retrospective exhibition proves harrowing and inspiring. It gives an overview of news-related images published worldwide during the second half of the 20th century. Secret Gardens June 16-18 Twenty-five historic canal houses will be opening their private gardens to the public for three days in June. Ancient trees and rare plants are among the attractions in the gardens normally hidden from the public gaze behind beautiful 17th- and 18th-century houses lining the city's canals. A special admission ticket allowing entry to all the gardens over the three days costs fl15 (\u00a34). Don't miss these Rijksmuseum Stadhouderskade 42 Open daily 10am-5pm Admission fl15 (\u00a34) The gateway to Amsterdam's museum quarter, the Rijksmuseum (above) is the country's premier art museum and houses the national collection of paintings and sculptures.

Japanese prints that influenced Van Gogh can be seen as well as work by his contemporaries. Stedelijk Museum Paulus Potterstraat 13 Open daily 11am-5pm Admission fl9 (\u00a32.50) A lively municipal museum that focuses on art from 1850 to the present. Anne Frank Huis The Frank family's wartime hideout has been restored to its condition when the family tried to escape deportation during Nazi occupation.

      "body": "<p>Investors worldwide are practising their deep breathing. Next Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee could shift financial markets into a different gear. Trouble is, no one is sure which one. Until then, relaxation techniques are order of the day. </p> <p>The committee's remit is to control US inflation. Its principal policy instrument is short-term interest rates. By adjusting the cost of money, economic growth is slowed or accelerated as appropriate, in turn cooling or stoking the inflationary fires. </p> <p>That is the theory. It has always been recognised that the time lags between rate changes and their impact on inflation are lengthy and cloud analysis of the effectiveness of monetary policy. The rapid technological development of modern economies chucks a further spanner into the analytical works. </p> <p>The Fed has been raising US interest rates steadily since mid-1999. Thus far it has had no discernible impact on the pace of expansion. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.3% in the first three months of this year.

      "bodyText": "Investors worldwide are practising their deep breathing. Next Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee could shift financial markets into a different gear. Trouble is, no one is sure which one. Until then, relaxation techniques are order of the day. The committee's remit is to control US inflation. Its principal policy instrument is short-term interest rates. By adjusting the cost of money, economic growth is slowed or accelerated as appropriate, in turn cooling or stoking the inflationary fires. That is the theory. It has always been recognised that the time lags between rate changes and their impact on inflation are lengthy and cloud analysis of the effectiveness of monetary policy. The rapid technological development of modern economies chucks a further spanner into the analytical works. The Fed has been raising US interest rates steadily since mid-1999. Thus far it has had no discernible impact on the pace of expansion. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.3% in the first three months of this year. Smoking! Occasionally economic releases pop up on traders' screens that hint at a slowing of the economy. The latest such statistic arrived on Thursday. Retail sales dropped by 0.2% in April.

Duvet with cotton covers. The bathroom test Light, large, well outfitted. Classy toiletries: bergamot aromatherapy soap, jasmine and geranium hair wash The restaurant The food is French with a twist (chicken liver partfait with fig jam; tarte tatin of feta cheese), \u00a325 to \u00a335 a head, but worth it. Efficient service. The lounge It's not a lounge sort of place. But there's a dark, cool bar. What is there to see within walking distance? At night: wobbly men, shrieking women and all the delights of the self-styled 24-hour city.

      "body": "<p>How is this for method acting? The Texan star Renee Zellweger who was cast to play Bridget Jones in the film version of the book, has been living incognito in London for the past two months as the heroine of Helen Fielding's bestseller. </p> <p>Ms Zellweger, tipped for a best actress award for Neil LaBute's comedy Nurse Betty, yesterday revealed how she had thrown herself into the part by getting a job at the publisher Picador. </p> <p>\"It is the first time I've actually used my degree,\" she admitted. Helen Fielding was initially unhappy the part was not going to a British actress but is now said to be thrilled with the kooky American. \"I have been practicing hard to speak British,\" Zellweger joked. </p> <p>Meanwhile, her co-star in Nurse Betty, the American comedian Chris Rock, gave a typically outlandish insight into working with Morgan Freeman. \"When he was not feeling my ass, he was pretty cool.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Even in the long history of behind-the-scenes bitching, Cannes has never seen a row like this. The pop star Bjork has been branded a \"mad woman\" by the notoriously demanding Danish director Lars Von Trier after the pair fell out on the set of the musical Dancer In The Dark, one of the favourites for the Palm D'Or. Von Trier makes no secret of his contempt, dubbing his leading lady \"a nut\". He also accused her of trying to eat her costume in a fit of rage. The Icelandic chanteuse replied in kind and accused him of reducing his cast to nervous wrecks. </p> <p>Bjork blocked the showing of the film until a fortnight ago as she demanded final approval of the scenes that included her music. Their relationship did not get off to a good start. Bjork missed their first meeting because she was at a party. After a week of tense shooting, Bjork had a fit, tore up her costume and left. She was persuaded back after much brandishing of writs. Fireworks are predicted if they share a platform at next week's premiere. </p> <p>\u0095 It is at times like that it's handy to have someone like Jean-Claude Van Damme, the greatest living Belgian, around. However, when a colleague yesterday challenged the muscles from Brussels to a fight as he emerged from the gym of the Carlton, his tough guy image fell away in front of my eyes. \"I'm a sissy,\" he said. \"God gave me a great body and it is my duty to take care of my temple.\" Jean-Claude told me that he has \"never been so focused on happiness\" since he got back with his ex wife and did I know that \"Charlie Chaplin was the first real action hero\". </p> <p>\u0095 Even without the festival, Cannes is a shrine to bad taste and, worse, cosmetic surgery. But standards drop several more notches every May when Hollywood arrives. Among its more tasteful offerings so far are Elian - the Gonzalez Boy Story, From Cuba To Miami and Back? and Cannibal! The Musical from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. </p> <p>\u0095 Baise-Moi, by French director Virginie Despentes, is a \"bad girl\" road movie which explores the \"emptiness at the core of contemporary France\". In case your French is a little rusty, Baise-Moi is a subtle entreaty to join loins, or \"fuck me\". It was originally called Rape Me and the final version has run into problems with the French censor. Festival-goers have been urged to show solidarity with the censored Despentes by wearing her Baise-Moi T-shirts. Amazingly, there have been quite a few takers. There is nothing it seems these people will not do to safeguard freedom of expression. </p> <p>\u0095 Biggles, the most British of action heroes, is back after several abortive attempts to revive the flying ace and scourge of the Huns. But a stunt to launch Biggles Flies North, the first of what could be several films, backfired when the party-pooping mayor of Cannes, Maurice Delauney, who has already banned late-night beach parties, blocked a flypast by Spitfires in a typical display of Gallic ingratitude.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How is this for method acting? The Texan star Renee Zellweger who was cast to play Bridget Jones in the film version of the book, has been living incognito in London for the past two months as the heroine of Helen Fielding's bestseller. Ms Zellweger, tipped for a best actress award for Neil LaBute's comedy Nurse Betty, yesterday revealed how she had thrown herself into the part by getting a job at the publisher Picador. \"It is the first time I've actually used my degree,\" she admitted. Helen Fielding was initially unhappy the part was not going to a British actress but is now said to be thrilled with the kooky American. \"I have been practicing hard to speak British,\" Zellweger joked. Meanwhile, her co-star in Nurse Betty, the American comedian Chris Rock, gave a typically outlandish insight into working with Morgan Freeman. \"When he was not feeling my ass, he was pretty cool.\" \u0095 Even in the long history of behind-the-scenes bitching, Cannes has never seen a row like this. The pop star Bjork has been branded a \"mad woman\" by the notoriously demanding Danish director Lars Von Trier after the pair fell out on the set of the musical Dancer In The Dark, one of the favourites for the Palm D'Or. Von Trier makes no secret of his contempt, dubbing his leading lady \"a nut\". He also accused her of trying to eat her costume in a fit of rage. The Icelandic chanteuse replied in kind and accused him of reducing his cast to nervous wrecks. Bjork blocked the showing of the film until a fortnight ago as she demanded final approval of the scenes that included her music. Their relationship did not get off to a good start. Bjork missed their first meeting because she was at a party. After a week of tense shooting, Bjork had a fit, tore up her costume and left. She was persuaded back after much brandishing of writs. Fireworks are predicted if they share a platform at next week's premiere. \u0095 It is at times like that it's handy to have someone like Jean-Claude Van Damme, the greatest living Belgian, around. However, when a colleague yesterday challenged the muscles from Brussels to a fight as he emerged from the gym of the Carlton, his tough guy image fell away in front of my eyes. \"I'm a sissy,\" he said. \"God gave me a great body and it is my duty to take care of my temple.\" Jean-Claude told me that he has \"never been so focused on happiness\" since he got back with his ex wife and did I know that \"Charlie Chaplin was the first real action hero\". \u0095 Even without the festival, Cannes is a shrine to bad taste and, worse, cosmetic surgery. But standards drop several more notches every May when Hollywood arrives. Among its more tasteful offerings so far are Elian - the Gonzalez Boy Story, From Cuba To Miami and Back? and Cannibal! The Musical from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. \u0095 Baise-Moi, by French director Virginie Despentes, is a \"bad girl\" road movie which explores the \"emptiness at the core of contemporary France\". In case your French is a little rusty, Baise-Moi is a subtle entreaty to join loins, or \"fuck me\". It was originally called Rape Me and the final version has run into problems with the French censor. Festival-goers have been urged to show solidarity with the censored Despentes by wearing her Baise-Moi T-shirts. Amazingly, there have been quite a few takers. There is nothing it seems these people will not do to safeguard freedom of expression. \u0095 Biggles, the most British of action heroes, is back after several abortive attempts to revive the flying ace and scourge of the Huns. But a stunt to launch Biggles Flies North, the first of what could be several films, backfired when the party-pooping mayor of Cannes, Maurice Delauney, who has already banned late-night beach parties, blocked a flypast by Spitfires in a typical display of Gallic ingratitude.",

Makhmalbaf shows them trudging stoically across this unforgiving landscape, bearing their blackboards on their backs, like the signature of some fundamental religious group, or the carapace of some hardy, exotic animal. </p> <p>Two teachers become detached from the group.

The second teacher offers to guide a group of people trying to reach their unspecified mountain homeland in return for a bag of walnuts, and gets married to a young woman in the group in a bizarre, impromptu ceremony, after which he tries to teach her to say the words \"I love you\". </p> <p>Like the Russian cinema of an earlier generation, Makhmalbaf's Iranian cinema negotiates its relationship to restrictive government orthodoxy by the use of fable and fancy, specifically here with oblique reference to the stateless Kurds whose national identity cuts across many boundaries. (And this film is in a burgeoning family tradition: Makhmalbaf's father, the director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, worked on the screenplay with her.) </p> <p>The images in The Blackboard have a startling quality, almost like an art installation in the desert. There is something distinctively surreal and almost ludic about Makhmalbaf's vision that envelops its elements of pathos and political anger in a sheen of mystery and enigma. The poetry and tenderness of her film are compelling. </p> <p>The shadows of Chabrol and Hitchcock darken Dominik Moll's <strong> Harry: He Is Here to Help</strong> , a black comedy thriller about a married father-of-three in his mid-30s, Michel (Laurent Lucas), who meets Harry (Sergi Lopez), a strange man who reveals himself to be an old classmate and insinuates himself into Michel's life with horrifying results. There is something very familiar about this situation, but much sinister comedy in its execution, particularly Michel's overbearing dentist father (Dominique Rozan) who insists on giving Michel a check-up every time he comes to visit. </p> <p>Lopez's performance is most effective at the beginning, when he greets Michel with a strangely supercilious smile in the men's washroom; and Sophie Guillemin is artlessly sexy as Harry's girlfriend, Plum.

Jacky is entirely unaware of his new friend Gary's fervour, as he drifts and moons about, with his new fianc\u00e9e Chi-Chi an uneasy houseguest, playing with his air-pistol and dreamily putting up in his room a poster of an aeroplane. </p> <p>This weird m\u00e9nage comes to a crux when Gary shows up at Jacky's mother's birthday party dressed in feminine clothes to sing a traditional song: a scene of terrible and hilarious humiliation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mad Pride: a Celebration of Mad Culture ed Ted Curtis, Robert Dellar, Esther Leslie and Ben Watson (Spare Change Books, \u00a37.95) HAMLET: Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? FIRST CLOWN: Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there. \"It is important to get inside the heads of the mad,\" said Roy Porter in Mind Forg'd Manacles, his study of the treatment of the insane in Restoration to Regency England. \"For one thing, their thought-worlds throw down a challenge... for another, if we are to understand the treatment of the mad, we must not only listen to pillars of society... their charges must be allowed a right of reply.\" And here it is: an anthology of 24 authors describing their internal condition, the treatments they've been put on, and how they have (or have not) coped. From the blurb: \"Mad Pride is set to become the first great civil liberties movement of the 21st century. Sick of discrimination, marginalisation, medication and being treated like shit, psychiatric patients are preparing to rise from the ghettos and make the world a fit place to live in.\" The introduction points out: \"This book is published at a time when the British government is proposing to enact one of the most despicable and shocking threats to civil liberties in living memory,\" in which Jack Straw promises to save us from all the loonies by locking them up before they've even done anything wrong. (\"We are all born mad,\" said Beckett; \"some of us remain so.\") The surprising thing about this book is how compelling it is. Real madness, I thought, was not that interesting; and one of its most depressing attributes is the tendency of the mad to write any old thing, at ostentatious length.

But it does something that I have not seen literature do for a while: it gives a section of society (or, rather, a sectioned society) a voice which we can hear and listen to, if we choose. Meanwhile, think on one of the verses from Robert Burton's Frontispiece to The Anatomy of Melancholy: But see the Madman rage downe right With furious lookes, a gastly sight. Naked in chaines bound doth he lye, And roares amaine he knows not why? Observe him, for as in a glasse, Thine angry portraiture it was.

The public prosecutor's office in Neufchateau, where Dutroux is being held for his alleged part in the abduction, rape, torture and murder of four young girls, appealed against the ruling. The Court of First Instance in Neufchateau ruled that legal action was inadmissible because media coverage had prejudiced the case. In an affair where police ineptitude was staggering, the decision will provoke anger. Dutroux, a convicted paedophile, has been held in custody for the last four years.

The escape horrified a country still reeling from reports of police incompetence and a judicial system more concerned with bureaucracy than the plight of missing children. Before the escape, a parliamentary report said police errors had allowed Dutroux to operate unhindered for years.

      "body": "<p><strong> 1</strong> Even when sunbathing nude, wear at least a watch so you have a white patch to compare the rest of your tan with at the end of the holiday! <strong> Rosalind Harvey </strong></p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Soak a cotton neckerchief in cold water and tie it around your neck to keep cool in the heat. <strong> Barbara Stewart </strong></p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Rather than photocopying you passport etc, scan all your important documents and then e-mail them to yourself at a hotmail address. You will then be able to be retrieve them any time any where. <strong> Neil Gibson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 4</strong> While travelling in Asia, always keep a few sheets of tissue in your pocket. If you need it, you need it! <strong> Mark Thornton</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 5</strong> Always take a small pack of handy wipes, particularly when going to a Developing Country. Often, you don't have a chance to find clean water and soap to wash your hands before a meal (and you don't want to waste your precious drinking water). <strong> Deborah Doane</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 6</strong> Never pay full price to get into a theme park. Check out one of the local supermarkets or petrol station chains a few days before you go. Almost all theme parks offer promotions with either that country's or region's biggest brands, which will usually allow you to get two tickets for the price of one (known in the business as BOGOF's). Or simply phone the theme park, and they'll tell you who they're doing discounts with. <strong> Matt Ward</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 7</strong> If you're taking a mosquito net with you, don't forget to include hooks to hang it up. Many hotels don't have them, but they often have wooden beams or ceilings! <strong> Diana Warren</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 8</strong> In a new town or city, always check out the public library. You often get the best information about local events and local history, more interesting postcards to buy, and a comfortable chair to relax in when the pressure of the streets gets too much to take. <strong> Ken Worpole</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 9</strong> A used film canister c an hold enough detergent for your daily hand wash. They are small, air-tight and easy to keep. <strong> Li Koon Ong </strong></p> <p><strong> 10</strong> Getting to the visa queue first in the US makes sense, but in Beijing you want to pass through last. Luggage takes a long time to be unloaded and there are no seats, so wait in the transit area, use the toilets (much cleaner there than landside) and then 20 minutes later walk through immigration just as the baggage arrives. <strong> Neil Taylor</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 11</strong> Buy a lemon when you arrive in a hot countries. Squeeze a slice around the rim of drinks bottles to disinfect, squeeze into a glass of water and drink in order to kill stomach bugs, the citrus acid kills bacteria. Any remaining chunks of lemon rub on your legs and feet as a mosquito repellent - can feel tacky but handy should you run out. A lime works equally well. <br> <strong> Rachel ab-Iorwerth</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 12</strong> Don't forget your pets! Cats and dogs can be happily looked after in their homes if you have a reliable person to call in to feed and exercise them. Cold water fish can be fed by buying a slow-release fish food block to last one or two weeks. <strong> Val Cook</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 13</strong> If you must travel abroad during a Test Match, make sure you don't venture any further than Normandy, that way you'll still be able to pick up Test Match Special on Radio 4 LW. <strong> Richard Cadey</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 14</strong> When packing shirts, dresses, etc, which usually need ironing, lay them out in a dry-cleaning polythene bag, then fold them up. They shouldn't need ironing after that. If there are still a few creases left, hang your shirt/dress in the bathroom while you are having a hot shower. The steam will smooth them out. <strong> Galle Amiot-Cadey</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 15</strong> For travel sickness, take a packet of crystallised ginger. Chew one or two bits about half an hour before your journey, and during any rough passages. Effective and without side effects. <strong> Jean Perraton</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 16</strong> If you have black luggage, put it well away from where you are sleeping - mosquitoes like to hover in dark spaces. Better still: don't take black luggage. <strong> Alex Hill</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 17</strong> Take minimum luggage, but do pack another empty bag within your bag for all the extra stuff you bring home with you. <strong> Nancy Groovy </strong></p> <p><strong> 18</strong> Tie a brightly-coloured ribbon to the handle of your suitcase to make it easier to locate on the conveyor belt among the thousands of other matching luggage. <strong> Hannah Thompson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 19</strong> If you are on medication, ensure you take sufficient supplies with you but also keep a note of the generic name and dosage just in case you run out. <strong> Margaret Wallis</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 20</strong> If you know you want to maximise your sleep time on shortish long-haul flights (such as many US routes), pre-order a halal or vegetarian menu. They are usually served first with the kids' meals so one can be wined and dined and taking a nap while the rest of tourist class is still waiting for the main course. <strong> Kathi Stanzel</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 21</strong> If you suffer from a tummy upset while you are away, drink plenty of Coca-Cola. It really does work wonders to settle your stomach and replenishes your energy, sugar levels and fluids. It is also readily available almost anywhere. <strong> Susanna Walker</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 22</strong> On long-haul flights, always ask for an aisle seat. You won't be able to see anything through the window anyway except on take-off and landing (and then only if it's light), and you'll be able to get up and stretch your legs without climbing over the sleeping bodies of your neighbours. <strong> Helen Altshul</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 23</strong> Good for any travelling but particularly for backpacking, take some zip-lock freezer bags of various sizes with you. They are fantastic for holding documents, protecting cameras from moisture or sand, storing dirty underwear, keeping plastic bottles in case of spillage etc. <strong> Hannah Rayfield</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 24</strong> It was all right to have jet-lag when air travel was exclusive. Now it's as vulgar as a deep tan and is best not talked about. <strong> Liz Gill</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 25</strong> The inner plastic part of those three-litre boxes of wine make excellent travel pillows. Directions: drink wine, remove box, inflate, sleep. (Covering with sarong avoids plastic sticking to face.) <strong> Johnny Johnson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 26</strong> Make a small tin (2 ins by 3 ins) or large matchbox into an emergency kit. Mine contains: small folding scissors, a tiny knife, Sellotape, safety pins, needles and cottons, antiseptic wipe, plasters, sticky labels, pen, pencil, rubber, Blutack, a couple of aspirins, a spare \u00a35, hair grips, matches and emery board, cotton buds, tweezers rubber bands, phone card and spare change. <strong> Charles Ely</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 27</strong> When you need a lavatory in a foreign city and can't find (or can't face) the local ones -- look out for a McDonald's restaurant. Usually clean and with hot water - just hope you are not seen by a friend coming out! <strong> Michael Peet</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 28</strong> Take a head torch. It's very useful as it leaves your hands free whether in power cuts or camping, etc. <strong> James Leonard </strong></p> <p><strong> 29</strong> In China, it's policy to charge tourists twice the price a local would pay for a train ticket as well as making you travel in first class. Getting a local travel agent to buy your ticket (for a small fee) will get you an average-priced ticket in second class, saving you more than 50%. <strong> Sinead McGivern</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 30</strong> When in hot climates, taking up to two litres of water a day can get tedious. So obtain a small, sturdy plastic screw-top bottle and some cordial such as elderflower, ribena etc to give yourself a break. But remember to use safe water. <strong> Christine Shanks</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 31</strong> A cartridge of dental floss tape is a useful item to keep in your luggage. Not only does it get rid of unwanted particles between one's teeth but with its strength, it's useful for running a clothes line or for tying-up luggage that is getting loose or even for stringing parcels of presents which you may want to send home ahead of your return. Compactness and strength are its great qualities. <strong> Robert Witter</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 32</strong> If it's punk rock you're looking for in the city/country of your destination, then find out in advance if there's anything going onby checking out www. worldwidepunk.com/ regional info &amp; local scenes <strong> Pete Craven</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 33</strong> Wear sunglasses when looking at street traders' goods in Asia. You can then look at any items you are interested in without the traders seeing what you are looking at and hassling you to buy it. <strong> Keith Ratcliffe</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 34 </strong> For women travellers: to avoid being hassled by men every few seconds in Istanbul, allow yourself to be \"picked up\" by one. This keeps all the others at bay. There is only the problem of getting rid of just one man. <strong> Anne Carpenter</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 35</strong> If in a place where you do not have a guide book to find the local attractions, scan the postcard stalls. If you see something you like, you can get directions to it by pointing to the postcard. <strong> Oonagh Lahr</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 36</strong> Always travel in a skirt or dress. This makes going to the toilet in primitive or unsavoury places 100 times easier than trousers or even shorts. <strong> C Harding </strong></p> <p><strong> 37</strong> A universal useful piece of travel kit is Dieter Graf Verlag's Point It book. It's pocket-sized and contains 1,200 photographs of food, clothing, activities, body parts, colours, etc. enabling you to communicate wherever you are. <strong> Emma Edwards</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 38</strong> A small pot of vaseline can prove invaluable. It can ease locks and bolts, silence creaky cupboard doors and window catches. It can soothe dry skin, scratches, blisters and chapped lips. I never travel without it. <strong> Pam Gee</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 39</strong> Line the inside of your backpack with chicken wire to protect your things when a thief tries to slash your bag open - especially in and around railway/bus stations in Asia. <strong> Andrew Fitzpatrick</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 40</strong> Major luxury hotels around the world often offer buffet lunches at the weekends. These are usually as-much-as-you-can-eat (and drink) and great value considering the quality and quantity. Put on a shirt, arrive early, leave late and hold a confident pose throughout. <strong> Adrian Brown</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 41</strong> When visiting the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen if they ask you which nationality you are: if you claim you are from some country other than the rest of the tour group, you will find yourself at a table at the end of the tour on your own with no one to share the dozen or so bottles with. <strong> Simon Parsons</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 42</strong> When going on a seabound boat journey, or a ferry crossing on a smallish boat, remember to get a seat on the lowest deck right in the middle of the boat - that way you'll avoid the worst of the sea sickness. <strong> Stephen Isaacs</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 43</strong> Bach Rescue Remedy is really handy for shock, trauma and panic, and is a great remedy for fear of flying. Also the homeopathic remedy Arnica is great for jet lag. <strong> Sandy Marks</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 44</strong> Write your addresses for postcards on to a sheet of sticky labels before you go. <strong> Steve Landin</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 45</strong> SIGG water bottles make brilliant hot water bottles (very useful high up in the altiplano of the Andes where it's bloody cold), because they are metal they can be filled with boiling water and will stay warm for quite a while. Remember to put the water bottle inside a sock before getting into bed though. They also keep water cooler for longer than plastic bottles and don't taint the water with that nasty plastic taste. <strong> Rhiannon Thomas</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 46</strong> Pack your electric toothbrush in hand baggage. If it starts buzzing in your cabin baggage, airline staff could get the wrong idea. <strong> Mark Holmstr\u00f6m</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 47</strong> In the tropics: try resisting the temptation to squash any stray cockroach that happens to wander into your room. The smell will no doubt attract dozens of ants, not to mention a few of the deceased's brethren with vengeance in mind. Instead, if possible, try to usher the beast out. Better still, forget about it completely. <strong> Dean Nicholas</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 48</strong> Packets of balloons are light, take up no space in luggage, and provide impromptu disposable toys for young children when travelling. <strong> Georgina Barnes</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 49</strong> In leech-infested areas, always walk at the front of a group. You'll alert the leeches to the meal behind you but suffer fewer of the perishers yourself. Take salt and a small sprayer. Make up a solution to spray the ones that venture a bit higher than your thighs. In snake-infested areas, always make sure you are not the person in front. <strong> Tim Taylor</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 50</strong> Always carry medicines in two separate places when travelling in case your luggage goes missing. <strong> Richard Tutton and Denise Wright</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 51</strong> For the very best places to shop in the destination where you are flying to, ask the cabin crew. <strong> Philip Ewe</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 52</strong> In Sydney, avoid getting ripped off on a harbour cruise by catching the Manly ferry on a return ticket from Circular Quay. Great harbour views and real people on board, plus the bonus of being able to stroll around Manly when you get to the other side... <strong> Denise Strutt</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 53</strong> If you wear contact lenses, avoid dry eyes from cabin air- conditioning by switching to spectacles before boarding, then switch back on landing. <strong> Julia McKiernan </strong></p> <p><strong> 54</strong> Before your trip, check your bank cards/credit cards for wear &amp; tear. Recently, I was stuck for cash in the U.S due to a dodgy bank card that would not work in cash machines. <strong> Gillynojob </strong></p> <p><strong> 55 </strong> When hiring a car in Australia, watch for high damage excesses that can't be insured against.This is to get you to look after the car and not take it on unmade roads. Five minutes spent with the hirer recording every scratch, bump and windscreen chip on a hire form can save you pounds later. <strong> Robert Brown</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 56</strong> In the Spanish Costas, carry a Spanish newspaper (eg El Pais) under your arm or sticking out of shoulder bag with the title showing. This will guard you against being accosted by time-share touts. But it will not work if your dress shows too obviously that you are British. <strong> PNV Perkins</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 57</strong> Essential item: a frisbee. You can lean on it to write, prepare food on it while on the move and eat off it. You can even play with it and make friends. <strong> Dave Timms and Jessica Hardy</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 58</strong> Don't always go straight through passport control. Greek airports especially are hot and cramped. Go outside and get some last-minute sunshine or a drink at the nearby bars. <strong> Maggie Bevis </strong></p> <p><strong> 59</strong> On arrival at JFK airport in New York, the cheapest way to get to downtown Manhattan is to take the airport shuttle bus (free) to Howard Beach subway station and take the A-train ($1.50). A more expensive but vastly more spectacular way is to take a Carey bus ($15) outside the terminal building all the way to Grand Central. You get a breathtaking view as you approach Manhattan. Save the cheaper journey for the way home. <strong> Trish Dowling</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 60 </strong> If you are a young traveller and are, therefore, short of money, try to find out where the universities are in a city, walk around them, go to the canteen (usually they offer nice, cheap meals and don't usually ask for ID), talk to the students and they will take you out and show you the best bits. <strong> Sara Nunez</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 61</strong> To avoid bulk in your luggage, decant shampoos etc. into smaller bottles so you are carrying only the necessary supplies for your trip. <strong> Nicola Norton </strong></p> <p><strong> 62 </strong> Travelling to a country where the language has a different alphabet? Try to get someone to write down the name and address of your hotel in that language so you can show it to taxi drivers. <strong> Jane C Woolfenden</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 63 </strong> When you make a cocktail with limes, rinse your hands afterwards, otherwise it can burn in the sun and leave scars. <strong> Sally Davies </strong></p> <p><strong> 64 </strong> Always take that extra photo. They don't cost much to process and you may never go there again. <strong> Murray Henman</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 65 </strong> Don't forget to put sun cream on your hair parting. <strong> Cath Webley</strong> </p> <p> <strong> 66 </strong> Wherever you go, take spare socks. They don't take up much space in a bag, and wet, cold or blistering feet can really ruin your day. <strong> Georgina High </strong></p> <p><strong> 67 </strong> Mosquito/sand fly bites: use White Flower Lotion, available from Chinese medicine shops for around \u00a33. You only need a tiny bit and the redness reduces, the swelling goes down and, after a day, the bite is hardly noticeable. <strong> Derek Humphries </strong></p> <p><strong> 68 </strong> Take a nylon hammock. They are highly compactable and an absolute godsend for both the beaches of the Far East and those long, uncomfortable journeys in Africa. <strong> Lee Christie </strong></p> <p><strong> 69 </strong> If you and your partner share a credit card, make sure you open separate accounts before travelling. That way, if one card is lost of stolen and you have to put a stop on it, you can still use the other card. <strong> Chris Worsfold </strong></p> <p><strong> 70 </strong> In eastern Europe, the corridor bulbs are always brighter than the one-candle-power in your room. Swap - who needs bright light in the corridor anyway? <strong> Josephine Millar </strong></p> <p><strong> 71 </strong> Always travel with a small tube of anti-bacterial gel, especially when you have children.

      "bodyText": "1 Even when sunbathing nude, wear at least a watch so you have a white patch to compare the rest of your tan with at the end of the holiday! Rosalind Harvey 2 Soak a cotton neckerchief in cold water and tie it around your neck to keep cool in the heat. Barbara Stewart 3 Rather than photocopying you passport etc, scan all your important documents and then e-mail them to yourself at a hotmail address. You will then be able to be retrieve them any time any where. Neil Gibson 4 While travelling in Asia, always keep a few sheets of tissue in your pocket. If you need it, you need it! Mark Thornton 5 Always take a small pack of handy wipes, particularly when going to a Developing Country. Often, you don't have a chance to find clean water and soap to wash your hands before a meal (and you don't want to waste your precious drinking water). Deborah Doane 6 Never pay full price to get into a theme park. Check out one of the local supermarkets or petrol station chains a few days before you go. Almost all theme parks offer promotions with either that country's or region's biggest brands, which will usually allow you to get two tickets for the price of one (known in the business as BOGOF's). Or simply phone the theme park, and they'll tell you who they're doing discounts with. Matt Ward 7 If you're taking a mosquito net with you, don't forget to include hooks to hang it up. Many hotels don't have them, but they often have wooden beams or ceilings! Diana Warren 8 In a new town or city, always check out the public library. You often get the best information about local events and local history, more interesting postcards to buy, and a comfortable chair to relax in when the pressure of the streets gets too much to take. Ken Worpole 9 A used film canister c an hold enough detergent for your daily hand wash. They are small, air-tight and easy to keep. Li Koon Ong 10 Getting to the visa queue first in the US makes sense, but in Beijing you want to pass through last. Luggage takes a long time to be unloaded and there are no seats, so wait in the transit area, use the toilets (much cleaner there than landside) and then 20 minutes later walk through immigration just as the baggage arrives. Neil Taylor 11 Buy a lemon when you arrive in a hot countries. Squeeze a slice around the rim of drinks bottles to disinfect, squeeze into a glass of water and drink in order to kill stomach bugs, the citrus acid kills bacteria. Any remaining chunks of lemon rub on your legs and feet as a mosquito repellent - can feel tacky but handy should you run out. A lime works equally well. Rachel ab-Iorwerth 12 Don't forget your pets! Cats and dogs can be happily looked after in their homes if you have a reliable person to call in to feed and exercise them. Cold water fish can be fed by buying a slow-release fish food block to last one or two weeks. Val Cook 13 If you must travel abroad during a Test Match, make sure you don't venture any further than Normandy, that way you'll still be able to pick up Test Match Special on Radio 4 LW. Richard Cadey 14 When packing shirts, dresses, etc, which usually need ironing, lay them out in a dry-cleaning polythene bag, then fold them up. They shouldn't need ironing after that. If there are still a few creases left, hang your shirt/dress in the bathroom while you are having a hot shower. The steam will smooth them out. Galle Amiot-Cadey 15 For travel sickness, take a packet of crystallised ginger. Chew one or two bits about half an hour before your journey, and during any rough passages. Effective and without side effects. Jean Perraton 16 If you have black luggage, put it well away from where you are sleeping - mosquitoes like to hover in dark spaces. Better still: don't take black luggage. Alex Hill 17 Take minimum luggage, but do pack another empty bag within your bag for all the extra stuff you bring home with you. Nancy Groovy 18 Tie a brightly-coloured ribbon to the handle of your suitcase to make it easier to locate on the conveyor belt among the thousands of other matching luggage. Hannah Thompson 19 If you are on medication, ensure you take sufficient supplies with you but also keep a note of the generic name and dosage just in case you run out. Margaret Wallis 20 If you know you want to maximise your sleep time on shortish long-haul flights (such as many US routes), pre-order a halal or vegetarian menu. They are usually served first with the kids' meals so one can be wined and dined and taking a nap while the rest of tourist class is still waiting for the main course. Kathi Stanzel 21 If you suffer from a tummy upset while you are away, drink plenty of Coca-Cola. It really does work wonders to settle your stomach and replenishes your energy, sugar levels and fluids. It is also readily available almost anywhere. Susanna Walker 22 On long-haul flights, always ask for an aisle seat. You won't be able to see anything through the window anyway except on take-off and landing (and then only if it's light), and you'll be able to get up and stretch your legs without climbing over the sleeping bodies of your neighbours. Helen Altshul 23 Good for any travelling but particularly for backpacking, take some zip-lock freezer bags of various sizes with you. They are fantastic for holding documents, protecting cameras from moisture or sand, storing dirty underwear, keeping plastic bottles in case of spillage etc. Hannah Rayfield 24 It was all right to have jet-lag when air travel was exclusive. Now it's as vulgar as a deep tan and is best not talked about. Liz Gill 25 The inner plastic part of those three-litre boxes of wine make excellent travel pillows. Directions: drink wine, remove box, inflate, sleep. (Covering with sarong avoids plastic sticking to face.) Johnny Johnson 26 Make a small tin (2 ins by 3 ins) or large matchbox into an emergency kit. Mine contains: small folding scissors, a tiny knife, Sellotape, safety pins, needles and cottons, antiseptic wipe, plasters, sticky labels, pen, pencil, rubber, Blutack, a couple of aspirins, a spare \u00a35, hair grips, matches and emery board, cotton buds, tweezers rubber bands, phone card and spare change. Charles Ely 27 When you need a lavatory in a foreign city and can't find (or can't face) the local ones -- look out for a McDonald's restaurant. Usually clean and with hot water - just hope you are not seen by a friend coming out! Michael Peet 28 Take a head torch. It's very useful as it leaves your hands free whether in power cuts or camping, etc. James Leonard 29 In China, it's policy to charge tourists twice the price a local would pay for a train ticket as well as making you travel in first class. Getting a local travel agent to buy your ticket (for a small fee) will get you an average-priced ticket in second class, saving you more than 50%. Sinead McGivern 30 When in hot climates, taking up to two litres of water a day can get tedious. So obtain a small, sturdy plastic screw-top bottle and some cordial such as elderflower, ribena etc to give yourself a break. But remember to use safe water. Christine Shanks 31 A cartridge of dental floss tape is a useful item to keep in your luggage. Not only does it get rid of unwanted particles between one's teeth but with its strength, it's useful for running a clothes line or for tying-up luggage that is getting loose or even for stringing parcels of presents which you may want to send home ahead of your return. Compactness and strength are its great qualities. Robert Witter 32 If it's punk rock you're looking for in the city/country of your destination, then find out in advance if there's anything going onby checking out www. worldwidepunk.com/ regional info &amp; local scenes Pete Craven 33 Wear sunglasses when looking at street traders' goods in Asia. You can then look at any items you are interested in without the traders seeing what you are looking at and hassling you to buy it. Keith Ratcliffe 34 For women travellers: to avoid being hassled by men every few seconds in Istanbul, allow yourself to be \"picked up\" by one. This keeps all the others at bay. There is only the problem of getting rid of just one man. Anne Carpenter 35 If in a place where you do not have a guide book to find the local attractions, scan the postcard stalls. If you see something you like, you can get directions to it by pointing to the postcard. Oonagh Lahr 36 Always travel in a skirt or dress. This makes going to the toilet in primitive or unsavoury places 100 times easier than trousers or even shorts. C Harding 37 A universal useful piece of travel kit is Dieter Graf Verlag's Point It book. It's pocket-sized and contains 1,200 photographs of food, clothing, activities, body parts, colours, etc. enabling you to communicate wherever you are. Emma Edwards 38 A small pot of vaseline can prove invaluable. It can ease locks and bolts, silence creaky cupboard doors and window catches. It can soothe dry skin, scratches, blisters and chapped lips. I never travel without it. Pam Gee 39 Line the inside of your backpack with chicken wire to protect your things when a thief tries to slash your bag open - especially in and around railway/bus stations in Asia. Andrew Fitzpatrick 40 Major luxury hotels around the world often offer buffet lunches at the weekends. These are usually as-much-as-you-can-eat (and drink) and great value considering the quality and quantity. Put on a shirt, arrive early, leave late and hold a confident pose throughout. Adrian Brown 41 When visiting the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen if they ask you which nationality you are: if you claim you are from some country other than the rest of the tour group, you will find yourself at a table at the end of the tour on your own with no one to share the dozen or so bottles with. Simon Parsons 42 When going on a seabound boat journey, or a ferry crossing on a smallish boat, remember to get a seat on the lowest deck right in the middle of the boat - that way you'll avoid the worst of the sea sickness. Stephen Isaacs 43 Bach Rescue Remedy is really handy for shock, trauma and panic, and is a great remedy for fear of flying. Also the homeopathic remedy Arnica is great for jet lag. Sandy Marks 44 Write your addresses for postcards on to a sheet of sticky labels before you go. Steve Landin 45 SIGG water bottles make brilliant hot water bottles (very useful high up in the altiplano of the Andes where it's bloody cold), because they are metal they can be filled with boiling water and will stay warm for quite a while. Remember to put the water bottle inside a sock before getting into bed though. They also keep water cooler for longer than plastic bottles and don't taint the water with that nasty plastic taste. Rhiannon Thomas 46 Pack your electric toothbrush in hand baggage. If it starts buzzing in your cabin baggage, airline staff could get the wrong idea. Mark Holmstr\u00f6m 47 In the tropics: try resisting the temptation to squash any stray cockroach that happens to wander into your room. The smell will no doubt attract dozens of ants, not to mention a few of the deceased's brethren with vengeance in mind. Instead, if possible, try to usher the beast out. Better still, forget about it completely. Dean Nicholas 48 Packets of balloons are light, take up no space in luggage, and provide impromptu disposable toys for young children when travelling. Georgina Barnes 49 In leech-infested areas, always walk at the front of a group. You'll alert the leeches to the meal behind you but suffer fewer of the perishers yourself. Take salt and a small sprayer. Make up a solution to spray the ones that venture a bit higher than your thighs. In snake-infested areas, always make sure you are not the person in front. Tim Taylor 50 Always carry medicines in two separate places when travelling in case your luggage goes missing. Richard Tutton and Denise Wright 51 For the very best places to shop in the destination where you are flying to, ask the cabin crew. Philip Ewe 52 In Sydney, avoid getting ripped off on a harbour cruise by catching the Manly ferry on a return ticket from Circular Quay. Great harbour views and real people on board, plus the bonus of being able to stroll around Manly when you get to the other side... Denise Strutt 53 If you wear contact lenses, avoid dry eyes from cabin air- conditioning by switching to spectacles before boarding, then switch back on landing. Julia McKiernan 54 Before your trip, check your bank cards/credit cards for wear &amp; tear. Recently, I was stuck for cash in the U.S due to a dodgy bank card that would not work in cash machines. Gillynojob 55 When hiring a car in Australia, watch for high damage excesses that can't be insured against.This is to get you to look after the car and not take it on unmade roads. Five minutes spent with the hirer recording every scratch, bump and windscreen chip on a hire form can save you pounds later. Robert Brown 56 In the Spanish Costas, carry a Spanish newspaper (eg El Pais) under your arm or sticking out of shoulder bag with the title showing. This will guard you against being accosted by time-share touts. But it will not work if your dress shows too obviously that you are British. PNV Perkins 57 Essential item: a frisbee. You can lean on it to write, prepare food on it while on the move and eat off it. You can even play with it and make friends. Dave Timms and Jessica Hardy 58 Don't always go straight through passport control. Greek airports especially are hot and cramped. Go outside and get some last-minute sunshine or a drink at the nearby bars. Maggie Bevis 59 On arrival at JFK airport in New York, the cheapest way to get to downtown Manhattan is to take the airport shuttle bus (free) to Howard Beach subway station and take the A-train ($1.50). A more expensive but vastly more spectacular way is to take a Carey bus ($15) outside the terminal building all the way to Grand Central. You get a breathtaking view as you approach Manhattan. Save the cheaper journey for the way home. Trish Dowling 60 If you are a young traveller and are, therefore, short of money, try to find out where the universities are in a city, walk around them, go to the canteen (usually they offer nice, cheap meals and don't usually ask for ID), talk to the students and they will take you out and show you the best bits. Sara Nunez 61 To avoid bulk in your luggage, decant shampoos etc. into smaller bottles so you are carrying only the necessary supplies for your trip. Nicola Norton 62 Travelling to a country where the language has a different alphabet? Try to get someone to write down the name and address of your hotel in that language so you can show it to taxi drivers. Jane C Woolfenden 63 When you make a cocktail with limes, rinse your hands afterwards, otherwise it can burn in the sun and leave scars. Sally Davies 64 Always take that extra photo. They don't cost much to process and you may never go there again. Murray Henman 65 Don't forget to put sun cream on your hair parting. Cath Webley 66 Wherever you go, take spare socks. They don't take up much space in a bag, and wet, cold or blistering feet can really ruin your day. Georgina High 67 Mosquito/sand fly bites: use White Flower Lotion, available from Chinese medicine shops for around \u00a33. You only need a tiny bit and the redness reduces, the swelling goes down and, after a day, the bite is hardly noticeable. Derek Humphries 68 Take a nylon hammock. They are highly compactable and an absolute godsend for both the beaches of the Far East and those long, uncomfortable journeys in Africa. Lee Christie 69 If you and your partner share a credit card, make sure you open separate accounts before travelling. That way, if one card is lost of stolen and you have to put a stop on it, you can still use the other card. Chris Worsfold 70 In eastern Europe, the corridor bulbs are always brighter than the one-candle-power in your room. Swap - who needs bright light in the corridor anyway? Josephine Millar 71 Always travel with a small tube of anti-bacterial gel, especially when you have children. Excellent when loos are dodgy and running water is not always available. Sowon Park 72 Women taking oral contraceptives should ensure that time changes are taken into account so that the interval between pills remains the same as at home. Remember too that tummy bugs can result in pills going through your system too quickly, so an attack of sickness and diarrhoea could warrant additional methods of contraception for the rest of the cycle. L J Macmillan 73 Instead of relying on hard pillows in hotels, make a square pillow (with feathers) small and thin enough to carry easily but comfortable enough for the plane/hotel. Barbra Carny 74 Always pack a roll of masking tape. Useful for sealing the cap of a leaking sun-tan oil bottle etc. I never travel without it.

I'm more relaxed now so I don't strain my vocal chords. We were shown techniques to help us cope with public speaking. You have to visualise any past experience you've had where you've spoken well, even if you were only chatting to friends. I was surprised how easily it worked. </p> <p>\"It's really helped me deal with clients,\" says Panos. \"They seem to respond better.

I said, 'If you used that voice when you were telling me about Isas, I think I might go for it!'\" Younger employees are often shy about expressing their opinions, says John. \"They worry about upsetting people so they keep quiet. I remind them that the information they have might help the person they're speaking to. What right do they have to keep quiet? It helps them to speak with more confidence.\" Recruits may also be unsure about speaking at meetings. \"Again, try and match the tone or the intensity of the previous speaker,\" John advises. \"It's no good saying, '...er, I'd just like to say ...' if the person before you was speaking very forcefully. And using phrases like, 'following on from what you were saying ...' is helpful. It shows people you were listening.\" Accountant Panos Mavron took one of John's courses to correct years of bad vocal habits. \"People always mentioned that my voice sounded strained,\" he says, \"and it was always knackered at the end of the day. I'm also quite reserved and when I was invited to become president of my local club, I wanted some help with making speeches.\" He found the course useful. \"It improved the quality of my voice. I'm more relaxed now so I don't strain my vocal chords. We were shown techniques to help us cope with public speaking. You have to visualise any past experience you've had where you've spoken well, even if you were only chatting to friends. I was surprised how easily it worked. \"It's really helped me deal with clients,\" says Panos. \"They seem to respond better. My negotiating skills have improved and I find it easier to persuade people to pay me without getting aggressive. It's about winning trust and confidence.\" John Stevens can be contacted at Best Practice Training on bpt@jasgrove.freeserve.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>There was a time when you could view jobs in a career path like a tower block - ideally the bricks should all be the same colour or, at most, different shades of it. You began and finished your career in the same industry, changing jobs only to move up the ladder. Switching sector or profession was rare. </p> <p>Conventional wisdom still says you should consolidate your experience to create a 'credible' CV. While it might be acceptable to change career once, two may be pushing it. When you get to three it may seem to prospective employers that you don't know what you want to do or get bored easily. </p> <p>But does experience in a bunch of disparate industries (on the surface) result in a multi-skilled graduate or a jack-of-all-trades, master of none? </p> <p>According to Imogen Daniels, an adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD), the traditional career-for-life is dying. \"People move about more, careers are less prescriptive and it's more acceptable to move around. Today's graduates have more choices compared to people who graduated 10 years ago in the middle of the recession. And as a result they are less concerned about stability and more about jobs which are stimulating and interest them.\" </p> <p>Sue Guthrie's career path to her current position is a good example. Sue trained as a vet, then lectured in animal health and was a medical writer before becoming an account director at a pharmaceutical PR/medical education company. \"From the age of six I knew that I wanted to be a vet. However, while working as a vet I branched out into research and lectured at an animal college,\" she explains. So how did the writing come about? \"I had always been interested in the arts and languages and while I was working as a vet I did an Open University arts degree. A friend who worked in a medical education agency knew that I was interested in writing and suggested that I send in my CV to the company where she worked. I did and was offered a job.\" </p> <p>The biggest transition for Sue was getting used to working in a commercial environment. \"I was used to working in either a clinic, a lecture theatre or my own office. Suddenly I was desk bound in an open plan office. It took me at least a year to adjust.\" After two and a half years as a medical writer, Sue was offered the option to move into PR. \"I am always ready for a challenge so I decided to give it a go. This has been quite a transition because I found myself involved in activities that I knew nothing about like organising press conferences. </p> <p>\"Because I've done so many different jobs, I've got a broader range of skills and I can cope better with change. However, if anyone had told me 10 years ago that I would one day work in PR, I would never have believed them.\" </p> <p>\"I'm sure when most people see my CV, they must think what on earth is going on,\" says Nina Lee, senior arrivals customer services agent at British Airways. Nina's route to her present role included a masters in clinical laboratory medicine, followed by research, three years working with people with schizophrenia on a care in the community project and a stint in healthcare public relations. All before the age of 27. </p> <p>Like many graduates, unsure of what to do, Nina fell into her first job and the masters by accident. \"During my psychology degree, I did a placement where I carried out research on people with schizophrenia. Based on this I was offered a job and funding to do an masters. Once the project was completed, I was offered project work on a care in the community project.\" </p> <p>The short-term contracts and the lack of any nursing or social work qualifications meant that Nina's career opportunities were limited so she decided to move on. \"I had always been interested in PR and had done some exhibition work while I was carrying out my research project; because I didn't have any experience, I decided to do a PR course,\" she explains. </p> <p>Armed with her PR qualification and a job offer in a PR agency, it seemed that Nina had found her niche. \"I went into PR with an open mind but I realised quite soon that it wasn't for me. I spent the first few months writing press materials, which I hated. And I didn't like being stuck at a desk all day. </p> <p> \"PR has a culture of long hours and I felt that all eyes were on me if I left at 5.30pm. Before I quit PR I went through a lot of turmoil, but I knew that my heart wasn't in it.

      "bodyText": "There was a time when you could view jobs in a career path like a tower block - ideally the bricks should all be the same colour or, at most, different shades of it. You began and finished your career in the same industry, changing jobs only to move up the ladder. Switching sector or profession was rare. Conventional wisdom still says you should consolidate your experience to create a 'credible' CV. While it might be acceptable to change career once, two may be pushing it. When you get to three it may seem to prospective employers that you don't know what you want to do or get bored easily. But does experience in a bunch of disparate industries (on the surface) result in a multi-skilled graduate or a jack-of-all-trades, master of none? According to Imogen Daniels, an adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD), the traditional career-for-life is dying. \"People move about more, careers are less prescriptive and it's more acceptable to move around. Today's graduates have more choices compared to people who graduated 10 years ago in the middle of the recession. And as a result they are less concerned about stability and more about jobs which are stimulating and interest them.\" Sue Guthrie's career path to her current position is a good example. Sue trained as a vet, then lectured in animal health and was a medical writer before becoming an account director at a pharmaceutical PR/medical education company. \"From the age of six I knew that I wanted to be a vet. However, while working as a vet I branched out into research and lectured at an animal college,\" she explains. So how did the writing come about? \"I had always been interested in the arts and languages and while I was working as a vet I did an Open University arts degree. A friend who worked in a medical education agency knew that I was interested in writing and suggested that I send in my CV to the company where she worked. I did and was offered a job.\" The biggest transition for Sue was getting used to working in a commercial environment. \"I was used to working in either a clinic, a lecture theatre or my own office. Suddenly I was desk bound in an open plan office. It took me at least a year to adjust.\" After two and a half years as a medical writer, Sue was offered the option to move into PR. \"I am always ready for a challenge so I decided to give it a go. This has been quite a transition because I found myself involved in activities that I knew nothing about like organising press conferences. \"Because I've done so many different jobs, I've got a broader range of skills and I can cope better with change. However, if anyone had told me 10 years ago that I would one day work in PR, I would never have believed them.\" \"I'm sure when most people see my CV, they must think what on earth is going on,\" says Nina Lee, senior arrivals customer services agent at British Airways. Nina's route to her present role included a masters in clinical laboratory medicine, followed by research, three years working with people with schizophrenia on a care in the community project and a stint in healthcare public relations. All before the age of 27. Like many graduates, unsure of what to do, Nina fell into her first job and the masters by accident. \"During my psychology degree, I did a placement where I carried out research on people with schizophrenia. Based on this I was offered a job and funding to do an masters. Once the project was completed, I was offered project work on a care in the community project.\" The short-term contracts and the lack of any nursing or social work qualifications meant that Nina's career opportunities were limited so she decided to move on. \"I had always been interested in PR and had done some exhibition work while I was carrying out my research project; because I didn't have any experience, I decided to do a PR course,\" she explains. Armed with her PR qualification and a job offer in a PR agency, it seemed that Nina had found her niche. \"I went into PR with an open mind but I realised quite soon that it wasn't for me. I spent the first few months writing press materials, which I hated. And I didn't like being stuck at a desk all day. \"PR has a culture of long hours and I felt that all eyes were on me if I left at 5.30pm. Before I quit PR I went through a lot of turmoil, but I knew that my heart wasn't in it. So when I saw an advert for the job at BA, I applied and got offered the job. \"I now know that I've made the right decision. I work shifts and I like the fact that I'm not fighting crowds to get to work in the morning and facing long queues at the bank at lunchtime. Some people thought I was mad when I told them what I was doing, but I knew it was right for me.\" \"Many people go to university not knowing what they want to do so they study non-vocational subjects,\" says Ben Williams, an Edinburgh-based chartered corporate psychologist. \"They take any job to survive and may move through a succession of jobs until they find the right career for them.\" He describes an itinerant, promiscuous workforce who will change jobs at the flick of a switch.

People aren't loyal to their organisations because of the hire and fire mentality.\" Ben Williams' advice to graduates is to \"find your vocation and a job where you are happy and content and feel that you are making a useful contribution.\" Imogen Daniels' advice to graduates who have moved around a lot is to \"focus more on what you have achieved rather than the time spent at the jobs\". For those who are worried about their 'eclectic CV' Imogen has some words of comfort. \"Staying with one employer for three years with no promotion or achievements may actually be viewed with suspicion by some employers.\"",

The picture editor had drawn it to the attention of the newsdesk well before the earliest edition time.

It was decided that the picture would not be used unless the Africa correspondent came through and then only if his dispatch provided an appropriate context. When he did file his eyewitness account of events in Freetown, he made one point very strongly, that the option of leaving offered to the small number of (mainly white) foreigners by the British military operation was not open to the mass of (black) Sierra Leoneans.

The dead black person was anonymous and exposed to our gaze.

      "body": "<p>Nasser Hussain was not happy. He looked at the umpire who had just given him out leg-before wicket with dismay and paused for a moment, reluctant to leave the crease, before tucking his bat under his arm and stalking off towards the pavilion, his body language speaking eloquently of his disbelief. We were warned not to approach him for half an hour. He was still in a foul temper when we finally made contact and he was initially unwilling to pose for photographs. But he relented and eventually apologised for being \"in a mood\". \"My whole day today has been geared towards getting runs for Essex. You get a bad decision and your day has gone. It pisses you off but you have to get on with it.\" </p> <p>In a way it is a compliment to Hussain, the England cricket captain, that a week before the first Test he is so worked up about getting out in a second division county championship match between Essex and Nottinghamshire in front of a couple of hundred diehards at sleepy Chelmsford. Hussain's urge to score runs and to succeed, the steely competitiveness that characterises his game, is apparent whatever the arena; it is why he was chosen as captain and why cricket followers believe he has what it takes to lift cricket out of the doldrums. </p> <p>The game in England is facing unprecedented challenges. The Test team had a dismal record in the 90s, and Hussain took over last year when Alec Stewart was sacked after England's humiliating exit in the first round of the world cup. The overall quality of the game has also come under attack from critics who say there are too many full-time players performing at a mediocre level that is a world away from the rigours of international cricket. Peaceful days in the sun at Worcester or Guildford, it is argued, have no place in our fiercely competitive global age. </p> <p>English cricketing failure in the 90s, sitting starkly beside the rapid rise of Premiership soccer, left the sport looking feeble: it has struggled for media attention, is having trouble attracting sponsors, and currently lacks players with the punch of Ian Botham or the panache of David Gower. England had limited success for much of the 80s too, and were routinely annihilated by the all-conquering West Indians, but with Botham, Gower, Lamb and Gooch, it was possible to lose with elan, to feel pride in defeat. The 90s were just drab and pitiful. </p> <p>The threat now is that soccer will change its calendar and, in line with a Fifa initiative, be played from February until November. If football changes its season, our traditional summer sport would be in danger of being dismissed. All of which demands that the 32-year-old Hussain, as well as being England's captain and key batsman, should also be the miracle worker who remakes cricket for the modern age. </p> <p>Part of that miracle has to be cultural, and Hussain - who has an Indian father and an English mother and was born in Madras - is uniquely placed to work it. Cricket in England has been emasculated by class and deference; strangled by the old school tie. Captains were supposed to be pukka gents like Peter May or no-nonsense northern types like Raymond Illingworth (Botham and Mike Gatting were earthy - and short-lived - exceptions). The game itself has been locked in some Majorite dream-world of village greens, public schools and hearty parsons: no wonder soccer, adapting its class base and connecting the media and sport, pop and Posh, has been making all the running. </p> <p>When Hussain became England captain last June, his former team-mate at Essex, Derek Pringle, now cricket correspondent of the Independent, wrote of the change - both practical and symbolic - that his appointment would make. \"Hussain is a shrewd, passionate cricketer whose desire to succeed is just what English cricket needs, as it looks to step into the new millennium. Rumours emanating from HQ were that the occasional bout of temper made him something of a liability in the genteel world of Victorian mores by which the game in this country still judges itself. Yet like it or not, he is very much a product of modern Britain, and as such should not be precluded from shaping its future.\" </p> <p>\"He is a good choice as captain and a very important figure,\" says Rob Steen, editor of The New Ball, which showcases new cricket writing. \"He should have been blooded earlier, but the selectors were scared of him. He had said in one interview that we had to get nastier and the establishment hated that. He represents a break with the past, and making him captain was as significant as making Len Hutton the first professional captain in the 50s. He's not from the usual background; he's from a talented Anglo-Indian family who love the game.\" </p> <p>Mihir Bose, author of The Sporting Alien, says Hussain is very different from other Indians and Anglo-Indians who have played in English cricket. \"There is a long tradition of Indians playing in English cricket, but they tended to be from the gentlemanly or princely class and above the battle,\" says Bose. \"In the early part of his career, Nasser made a point of being different - he was bolshie, a streetfighter. He is very much a product of the late 20th century and his captaincy marks a change in cricket. I don't know whether it is conscious or not, but there appears to be a desire to be more populist. He is certainly more populist - like a character from Men Behaving Badly - and aware of modern susceptibilities and of his dual identity.\" </p> <p>Cricket has always been central to Hussain's life. He was born in Madras in 1968 to an Indian father, the cricket-playing Jawad (anglicised to Joe), and an English mother, Shireen. They had met when Joe, who had an electronics business in India, was visiting the UK. His two older brothers, Mel and Abbas, were fine cricketers, and Nasser's early years were spent on the boundary's edge at the Chepauk stadium in Madras watching his father play and having members of visiting Test teams bowl underarm to him. </p> <p>The family moved to Ilford when Nasser was six and all three sons continued to play cricket. Nasser, who was very small as a boy, was an excellent leg-spin bowler, but Mel was reckoned to be the more promising player (\"10 times better than Nasser at the same age,\" according to their father). Ironically, Mel went on to play a few seasons for Hampshire, while Nasser scaled the heights of international cricket. </p> <p>When he was 14, Nasser suddenly grew and, as he got taller, lost the ability to bowl leg- spinners. \"He must have been crying in his bed,\" says his father. \"But he was determined to play professional cricket, was hungry to play for Essex, and turned himself into a batsman. Mel didn't have the patience, but Nasser was determined to succeed. At 17, I knew Nasser would make it to the professional game, but I didn't know he would play Test cricket at 21.\" </p> <p>Living next door to the Hussains in Ilford must have been a noisy experience: one neighbour recalls the endless thump of cricket balls against the wall. Joe Hussain would also take his three boys down to the nets at the Ilford cricket school (which he later bought and now runs), where they would hire a net and practise for hours on end. Ilford is a buoyant catchment area for young cricketers - former Essex and England captain Graham Gooch comes from near here - and an evening at the school demonstrates that there is life in the game yet. </p> <p>Hussain's characteristics - steeliness, directness, testiness, an unwillingness to give a sucker an even break - might be thought of as typical Australian virtues, and they did not endear him to the cricketing establishment in his early days. He was seen as a rebel, accused of aloofness and arrogance, and his career has been punctuated by disciplinary infringements which led to one- or two-match suspensions. </p> <p>His father says the competitiveness is hereditary. \"I play cricket the hard way; I play to win. If I see a boy with the fighting spirit, I don't dampen it, I just have a quiet word. You've got to have it: look at the Aussies, look at the way Steve Waugh [the Australian captain] talks to batsmen at the end of an over. You can't play cricket with one hand tied behind your back. Nasser went over the top once or twice, but nothing much. He always wanted to do well and to win. If those qualities hadn't been there, Nasser wouldn't be what he is today.\" </p> <p>Early in his career at Essex, Hussain was involved in two incidents that dogged him for years afterwards. Once, when he was yorked [bowled by a ball that hits the base of the stumps without bouncing] in a match against Surrey, he went back to the dressing room and rounded on the Essex bowlers for their inability to produce such effective deliveries. Gooch, then Essex captain, did not take kindly to an upstart denting team morale and suspended him for one game. Worse, in another match for Essex, he gave the team's senior bowler, Neil Foster, some unwanted advice and was publicly reprimanded. Back in the dressing room, he kicked over a case containing cricket equipment, which fell on the foot of another Essex bowler, Mark Ilott, injuring his toe. He refused to apologise, and he and Ilott almost came to blows. </p> <p>Hussain was banned for two games after that altercation and was on the way to getting a reputation for truculence that at one stage seemed likely to deny him the England captaincy. He was passed over when Michael Atherton resigned in 1998 (Hussain was vice-captain but Alec Stewart was given the job), and there were dark rumours that Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, was vehemently opposed to Hussain becoming captain. But the d\u00e9bcle of the world cup appears to have convinced the cricketing authorities that England needed some of his bloody-mindedness. </p> <p>When he was made captain, his long-time England team-mate Michael Atherton said that Hussain would have to temper his steeliness. \"It is in the dressing room that he may have to work the hardest,\" said Atherton, who captained England in a record 52 Tests. \"He is regarded by some as self-centred, good for a batsman but not for a captain, and has the endearing ability to rub people up the wrong way with no apparent effort. So much so that last winter two of England's bowlers were heard to mutter that if he ever became captain he would have to find two more bowlers.\" </p> <p>\"I've always had a short fuse,\" Hussain admits. \"That's just the way I am. But the reputation came from one or two things that made the press. I was only left out for one or two games by Essex, and disciplined for a heated argument in the dressing room, but after that you are portrayed as a bad boy. It's very difficult to get away from that, and in your mind you almost start to live up to it. That's why I understand players like that, and like to have them in my side, because you can see them doing what you've done in the past.\" </p> <p>\"What underpins everything is his burning desire to succeed,\" says Gooch, who has known Hussain since he was eight. \"He has a passion that has sometimes led him to boil over. He still has that fire in the belly, but he has learned to control his emotions. He always had his own ideas about how things should be done, and we had our moments when I was captain, but that all helped to make him a more rounded character.\" </p> <p>\"He does explode on occasions,\" says Keith Fletcher, the former England captain and coach, and now eminence grise at Essex. \"But he handled the long tour of South Africa well, and has grown with the responsibility of being England captain. He knows he can't explode now because the press would be down on him. He's not stupid.\" </p> <p>Hussain thinks that, as captain, he can turn his truculent past to his and the team's advantage. \"What I add as captain is that I have been a bit of a rebel in the past, so can identify with others in that situation. The Caddicks and the Tufnells and the Ramprakashes see me as someone they can confide in and play under.\" Each of those players has, at various times, been called difficult or selfish. Indeed, Hussain and Ramprakash were once labelled the \"tantrum twins\". But Hussain admires players who are unwilling to conform and believes that he can exploit their sometimes wayward talents. </p> <p>\"In terms of captaincy, I am of the school of getting people together to get the best out of them,\" he says. \"They can be any colour, any character, do what they want after hours, but from 11 till 6 in a Test match they have to perform. It adds to the side to have different characters. You have to have a full collection of people. There are many different routes to being a top player. I've played with Graham Gooch, who was a workaholic and a fitness fanatic, and he was a world-class player. And I've also played with David Gower, who didn't like to net and didn't like to go for a run, and he was also a great player. I'd love to have them both in the side because there are people in the team who will always go one way or the other, and if you are constantly trying to gear your team towards one of them the other group will say 'sod this for a lark.'\" </p> <p>Hussain is diplomatic - an important skill for the England captain to learn - about the establishment's suspicion of him, but he makes it clear that he has no time for the old idea of picking good team players. \"We go a bit too much on character in England. The bottom line is whether it's the right person for the job, and that applies at every level - captains and coaches. We mustn't just pick people because they're good blokes who say and do the right things.\" Very democratic; very Australian. </p> <p>Pringle has suggested that Hussain's Anglo-Indian background accounted for some of his early rebelliousness. \"Like Mark Ramprakash, he is the product of a mixed-race marriage,\" said Pringle. \"As a consequence, growing pains have probably been more acute, with loyalties and identities tried for size, before being discarded.\" </p> <p>\"Pring loves a theory,\" says Hussain with a laugh. \"I consider myself English and I remember how disappointed I was when I was selected for my first game at the Oval but didn't play. David Gower gave me the bag of goodies but took out the England cap and jumper. I wanted that pullover with the three lions. But I'm still very proud of the Indian side of me. There is a lot of interest from the Asian community in England, and family and friends in India are always ringing my dad to talk about how I'm doing.\" \"Relatives in India follow his progress so closely on the internet that they know more about him than I do,\" says Joe Hussain. </p> <p>When Norman Tebbit declared his \"cricket test\" in 1990, asking Britons of Asian extraction which team they would support - England, or teams from the subcontinent - Hussain attacked the former Conservative chairman for his insensitivity and compared him with Enoch Powell. \"I admit to getting withdrawal symptoms if I go too long without a curry,\" said Hussain. \"Yet, on returning from the West Indies [where he had been touring with England] I was looking forward just as much to having roast chicken and all the trimmings. I do know of Asian families who have not integrated into the English way of life. But I know plenty that have. During my childhood it never entered my head to think whether we were Indian or English.\" </p> <p>The source of Hussain's spirit and singlemindedness lies back in Ilford. Joe Hussain, a fit sixtysomething who still turns out at weekends for Ilford cricket club, instilled in his children a confidence and desire to succeed that has seen them all excel. Mel now works in the City (\"he earns twice as much as me, has more days off and doesn't get slagged off in the press,\" says Nasser); Abbas did a pharmaceutical degree at Loughborough and now sells drugs (\"legal drugs\", Nasser emphasises) around the world; and younger sister Benazir is a ballet dancer, formerly with the Royal Ballet and currently with the Perth Ballet in Australia. </p> <p>It is a formidably close-knit, high-achieving family in which sport and education each had their place. Hussain could have gone straight on to the staff at Essex, but his father insisted that he go to university and play for the county only in the vacation. He had attended the very sporty Forest School in Snaresbrook, accumulating 10 O levels and three A levels (ropey grades, he says modestly), as well as a mountain of runs. He was good at maths and went to Durham University, which had a cricket team stronger than those at Oxford or Cambridge, to study geo-chemistry (\"maths wouldn't have left enough time for cricket and socialising\"). </p> <p>\"I had three really good years there,\" he says. \"I played cricket, golf and football, and enjoyed a great social life. It gave me a good, balanced outlook.\" He also met his wife, Karen, at Durham; they married in 1993. Karen became a teacher but gave up last year to be able to spend more time on tour with him. Nasser remains close to his family, and father Joe says the truculent public image is far removed from the private man. \"On the field, he is aggressive. But if you meet him privately or for a drink, you will find a different Nasser. He's not what people assume - arrogant and temperamental. \" </p> <p>\"He has a good sense of humour and can laugh at himself,\" says Gooch. \"He mixes well with the players, likes to have a bit of fun, and has learned to relax. At first he didn't know how to switch off. He was trying to break into the Essex team and then the Test side. He had an early taste of international cricket but then dropped out. When you're not in the side, the pressure builds.\" </p> <p>Hussain talks like he bats - very directly, no words wasted - and uses the terms \"arty-farty\" and \"airy-fairy\" pejoratively. Asked if he now \"channels his aggression\" more productively, he dismisses the phrase as flowery and meaningless. He has, you feel, stripped batting - and the sportsman's life - down to essentials. </p> <p>He is bright and self-assured. \"Nass has a good brain,\" says Fletcher, \"and if you argue with him you have to be sure of your facts or he'll pull you to pieces.\" He is very good in press conferences and never switches to autopilot. When he uses a clich\u00e9, he has the intelligence and good grace to apologise for it. \"I've realised it's part of the job,\" he says. \"The best way to do it is to try to explain to the press exactly what you are going through, why you did certain things and why you are picking certain people, rather than give them half-truths and always worry about saying the wrong thing.\" </p> <p>The England captaincy has been described as the most demanding playing role in British sport (second only to the England football managership in the amount of flak the incumbent is likely to receive). Hussain says that since he became captain last June, his life has been turned upside down. \"You become the focal point of English cricket. Virtually everything concerning the game ends up at your doorstep.\" </p> <p>In the past month, that public pressure has been intensified by the allegations of match fixing levelled against South African captain Hansie Cronje and others. \"I have no problem with the press frenzy over match fixing,\" says Hussain. \"I just wish that the whole truth would come out. My initial reaction was complete disbelief. We had heard nothing in South Africa. There were rumblings when we began pre-season training here that the Indian police had got something, but I thought it was a complete red herring. Then someone rang to tell me Cronje had been sacked. I knew the moment he said he had been approached during the triangular tournament involving England that we were going to be involved and that the Centurion Test [which England won after an unprecedented move by Cronje to get a result from a rain-ruined game] would be questioned. I have no problem with that: from now on, everything and everyone has to be looked at. </p> <p>\"The police here have been examining allegations for months. I was driving through Chelmsford in August last year and had a phone call from the CID. I thought it was a wind-up. They wanted to interview me on match fixing and I came in to talk to them. But I knew absolutely nothing. David Graveney [the chairman of selectors] had made it clear that if anyone was approached they were to report it. </p> <p>\"You have to be careful. After the Cronje thing blew up, my brother phoned, put his Indian voice on, and left a message saying this was my Indian bookmaker friend and asking why I hadn't rung him for a while. You have to have a laugh, but this is not the time or the place because it poses a serious threat to the game.\" </p> <p>During the winter, before the Cronje storm, Hussain had taken an inexperienced England side on a four-month tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe. He won generous plaudits for his batting (he topped the England Test averages), his captaincy (England lost the Test series against South Africa 2-1 but had been expected to do much worse), and the way he kept the touring party motivated. Some of his drive and passion appeared to have rubbed off on his team. \"I get a lot of letters saying we don't mind winning or losing, but make sure the players show that they care,\" he says. \"We did that this winter.\" </p> <p>Part of his sorrow over the Cronje affair is that his side's efforts, especially in winning that final Test, are now tarnished by association. \"As a fellow player, I feel for Cronje and his fall from grace,\" he says, \"but the disappointing thing is that the winning or losing of games is now being questioned.\" That, Hussain implies, can kill a sport. \"I used to be a fan of athletics and liked the 100 metres, but after the Ben Johnson thing I never watched it because I used to think that whoever wins now has just taken the better drugs. I want to make sure that cricket doesn't go the same way.\" </p> <p>He recognises that the pressure this summer will be different from that in South Africa - not to perform heroically against superior opposition but to win well against Zimbabwe, the weakest Test- playing country, and the West Indies, a once great side which has fallen on hard times. If things go badly from next Thursday, when England face Zimbabwe at Lord's (the Zimbabweans' first Test match in this country), he may discover just how tough the captaincy - and how capricious the media - can be. </p> <p>\"I've been fortunate because I came in at rock bottom,\" he says. \"We were out of the world cup, our Test results hadn't been great, and everyone was thinking that anything from here was a bonus. Everyone was expecting us to lose four- or five-nil in South Africa, and we didn't so people view it as a success, but I personally don't because we lost the Test series. There's been a lot of praise heaped on me, but the two series I've been in charge we've lost. </p> <p>\"The only thing that will lift English cricket is winning, and people seeing us doing well and enjoying it. We should beat Zimbabwe and, if we play like we can, we should beat West Indies. But Zimbabwe like to prove a point and West Indies are still dangerous .\" </p> <p>The real test, though, comes next summer when England play Australia for the Ashes, the series which will define the success or failure of Hussain's tenure as captain. \"He likes the way the Australians play cricket but he believes we have the talent to take them on,\" says Joe Hussain. \"His biggest ambition in life is to beat them.\" If he succeeds, Hussain will have given English cricket its biggest boost since Ian Botham's heroics at Headingley in 1981, the future will look incomparably brighter, and the sport's rebellious son will have become its saviour.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nasser Hussain was not happy. He looked at the umpire who had just given him out leg-before wicket with dismay and paused for a moment, reluctant to leave the crease, before tucking his bat under his arm and stalking off towards the pavilion, his body language speaking eloquently of his disbelief. We were warned not to approach him for half an hour. He was still in a foul temper when we finally made contact and he was initially unwilling to pose for photographs. But he relented and eventually apologised for being \"in a mood\". \"My whole day today has been geared towards getting runs for Essex. You get a bad decision and your day has gone. It pisses you off but you have to get on with it.\" In a way it is a compliment to Hussain, the England cricket captain, that a week before the first Test he is so worked up about getting out in a second division county championship match between Essex and Nottinghamshire in front of a couple of hundred diehards at sleepy Chelmsford. Hussain's urge to score runs and to succeed, the steely competitiveness that characterises his game, is apparent whatever the arena; it is why he was chosen as captain and why cricket followers believe he has what it takes to lift cricket out of the doldrums. The game in England is facing unprecedented challenges. The Test team had a dismal record in the 90s, and Hussain took over last year when Alec Stewart was sacked after England's humiliating exit in the first round of the world cup. The overall quality of the game has also come under attack from critics who say there are too many full-time players performing at a mediocre level that is a world away from the rigours of international cricket. Peaceful days in the sun at Worcester or Guildford, it is argued, have no place in our fiercely competitive global age. English cricketing failure in the 90s, sitting starkly beside the rapid rise of Premiership soccer, left the sport looking feeble: it has struggled for media attention, is having trouble attracting sponsors, and currently lacks players with the punch of Ian Botham or the panache of David Gower. England had limited success for much of the 80s too, and were routinely annihilated by the all-conquering West Indians, but with Botham, Gower, Lamb and Gooch, it was possible to lose with elan, to feel pride in defeat. The 90s were just drab and pitiful. The threat now is that soccer will change its calendar and, in line with a Fifa initiative, be played from February until November. If football changes its season, our traditional summer sport would be in danger of being dismissed. All of which demands that the 32-year-old Hussain, as well as being England's captain and key batsman, should also be the miracle worker who remakes cricket for the modern age. Part of that miracle has to be cultural, and Hussain - who has an Indian father and an English mother and was born in Madras - is uniquely placed to work it. Cricket in England has been emasculated by class and deference; strangled by the old school tie. Captains were supposed to be pukka gents like Peter May or no-nonsense northern types like Raymond Illingworth (Botham and Mike Gatting were earthy - and short-lived - exceptions). The game itself has been locked in some Majorite dream-world of village greens, public schools and hearty parsons: no wonder soccer, adapting its class base and connecting the media and sport, pop and Posh, has been making all the running. When Hussain became England captain last June, his former team-mate at Essex, Derek Pringle, now cricket correspondent of the Independent, wrote of the change - both practical and symbolic - that his appointment would make. \"Hussain is a shrewd, passionate cricketer whose desire to succeed is just what English cricket needs, as it looks to step into the new millennium. Rumours emanating from HQ were that the occasional bout of temper made him something of a liability in the genteel world of Victorian mores by which the game in this country still judges itself. Yet like it or not, he is very much a product of modern Britain, and as such should not be precluded from shaping its future.\" \"He is a good choice as captain and a very important figure,\" says Rob Steen, editor of The New Ball, which showcases new cricket writing. \"He should have been blooded earlier, but the selectors were scared of him. He had said in one interview that we had to get nastier and the establishment hated that. He represents a break with the past, and making him captain was as significant as making Len Hutton the first professional captain in the 50s. He's not from the usual background; he's from a talented Anglo-Indian family who love the game.\" Mihir Bose, author of The Sporting Alien, says Hussain is very different from other Indians and Anglo-Indians who have played in English cricket. \"There is a long tradition of Indians playing in English cricket, but they tended to be from the gentlemanly or princely class and above the battle,\" says Bose. \"In the early part of his career, Nasser made a point of being different - he was bolshie, a streetfighter. He is very much a product of the late 20th century and his captaincy marks a change in cricket. I don't know whether it is conscious or not, but there appears to be a desire to be more populist. He is certainly more populist - like a character from Men Behaving Badly - and aware of modern susceptibilities and of his dual identity.\" Cricket has always been central to Hussain's life. He was born in Madras in 1968 to an Indian father, the cricket-playing Jawad (anglicised to Joe), and an English mother, Shireen. They had met when Joe, who had an electronics business in India, was visiting the UK. His two older brothers, Mel and Abbas, were fine cricketers, and Nasser's early years were spent on the boundary's edge at the Chepauk stadium in Madras watching his father play and having members of visiting Test teams bowl underarm to him. The family moved to Ilford when Nasser was six and all three sons continued to play cricket. Nasser, who was very small as a boy, was an excellent leg-spin bowler, but Mel was reckoned to be the more promising player (\"10 times better than Nasser at the same age,\" according to their father). Ironically, Mel went on to play a few seasons for Hampshire, while Nasser scaled the heights of international cricket. When he was 14, Nasser suddenly grew and, as he got taller, lost the ability to bowl leg- spinners. \"He must have been crying in his bed,\" says his father. \"But he was determined to play professional cricket, was hungry to play for Essex, and turned himself into a batsman. Mel didn't have the patience, but Nasser was determined to succeed. At 17, I knew Nasser would make it to the professional game, but I didn't know he would play Test cricket at 21.\" Living next door to the Hussains in Ilford must have been a noisy experience: one neighbour recalls the endless thump of cricket balls against the wall. Joe Hussain would also take his three boys down to the nets at the Ilford cricket school (which he later bought and now runs), where they would hire a net and practise for hours on end. Ilford is a buoyant catchment area for young cricketers - former Essex and England captain Graham Gooch comes from near here - and an evening at the school demonstrates that there is life in the game yet. Hussain's characteristics - steeliness, directness, testiness, an unwillingness to give a sucker an even break - might be thought of as typical Australian virtues, and they did not endear him to the cricketing establishment in his early days. He was seen as a rebel, accused of aloofness and arrogance, and his career has been punctuated by disciplinary infringements which led to one- or two-match suspensions. His father says the competitiveness is hereditary. \"I play cricket the hard way; I play to win. If I see a boy with the fighting spirit, I don't dampen it, I just have a quiet word. You've got to have it: look at the Aussies, look at the way Steve Waugh [the Australian captain] talks to batsmen at the end of an over. You can't play cricket with one hand tied behind your back. Nasser went over the top once or twice, but nothing much. He always wanted to do well and to win. If those qualities hadn't been there, Nasser wouldn't be what he is today.\" Early in his career at Essex, Hussain was involved in two incidents that dogged him for years afterwards. Once, when he was yorked [bowled by a ball that hits the base of the stumps without bouncing] in a match against Surrey, he went back to the dressing room and rounded on the Essex bowlers for their inability to produce such effective deliveries. Gooch, then Essex captain, did not take kindly to an upstart denting team morale and suspended him for one game. Worse, in another match for Essex, he gave the team's senior bowler, Neil Foster, some unwanted advice and was publicly reprimanded. Back in the dressing room, he kicked over a case containing cricket equipment, which fell on the foot of another Essex bowler, Mark Ilott, injuring his toe. He refused to apologise, and he and Ilott almost came to blows. Hussain was banned for two games after that altercation and was on the way to getting a reputation for truculence that at one stage seemed likely to deny him the England captaincy. He was passed over when Michael Atherton resigned in 1998 (Hussain was vice-captain but Alec Stewart was given the job), and there were dark rumours that Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, was vehemently opposed to Hussain becoming captain. But the d\u00e9bcle of the world cup appears to have convinced the cricketing authorities that England needed some of his bloody-mindedness. When he was made captain, his long-time England team-mate Michael Atherton said that Hussain would have to temper his steeliness. \"It is in the dressing room that he may have to work the hardest,\" said Atherton, who captained England in a record 52 Tests. \"He is regarded by some as self-centred, good for a batsman but not for a captain, and has the endearing ability to rub people up the wrong way with no apparent effort. So much so that last winter two of England's bowlers were heard to mutter that if he ever became captain he would have to find two more bowlers.\" \"I've always had a short fuse,\" Hussain admits. \"That's just the way I am. But the reputation came from one or two things that made the press. I was only left out for one or two games by Essex, and disciplined for a heated argument in the dressing room, but after that you are portrayed as a bad boy. It's very difficult to get away from that, and in your mind you almost start to live up to it. That's why I understand players like that, and like to have them in my side, because you can see them doing what you've done in the past.\" \"What underpins everything is his burning desire to succeed,\" says Gooch, who has known Hussain since he was eight. \"He has a passion that has sometimes led him to boil over. He still has that fire in the belly, but he has learned to control his emotions. He always had his own ideas about how things should be done, and we had our moments when I was captain, but that all helped to make him a more rounded character.\" \"He does explode on occasions,\" says Keith Fletcher, the former England captain and coach, and now eminence grise at Essex. \"But he handled the long tour of South Africa well, and has grown with the responsibility of being England captain. He knows he can't explode now because the press would be down on him. He's not stupid.\" Hussain thinks that, as captain, he can turn his truculent past to his and the team's advantage. \"What I add as captain is that I have been a bit of a rebel in the past, so can identify with others in that situation. The Caddicks and the Tufnells and the Ramprakashes see me as someone they can confide in and play under.\" Each of those players has, at various times, been called difficult or selfish. Indeed, Hussain and Ramprakash were once labelled the \"tantrum twins\". But Hussain admires players who are unwilling to conform and believes that he can exploit their sometimes wayward talents. \"In terms of captaincy, I am of the school of getting people together to get the best out of them,\" he says. \"They can be any colour, any character, do what they want after hours, but from 11 till 6 in a Test match they have to perform. It adds to the side to have different characters. You have to have a full collection of people. There are many different routes to being a top player. I've played with Graham Gooch, who was a workaholic and a fitness fanatic, and he was a world-class player. And I've also played with David Gower, who didn't like to net and didn't like to go for a run, and he was also a great player. I'd love to have them both in the side because there are people in the team who will always go one way or the other, and if you are constantly trying to gear your team towards one of them the other group will say 'sod this for a lark.'\" Hussain is diplomatic - an important skill for the England captain to learn - about the establishment's suspicion of him, but he makes it clear that he has no time for the old idea of picking good team players. \"We go a bit too much on character in England. The bottom line is whether it's the right person for the job, and that applies at every level - captains and coaches. We mustn't just pick people because they're good blokes who say and do the right things.\" Very democratic; very Australian. Pringle has suggested that Hussain's Anglo-Indian background accounted for some of his early rebelliousness. \"Like Mark Ramprakash, he is the product of a mixed-race marriage,\" said Pringle. \"As a consequence, growing pains have probably been more acute, with loyalties and identities tried for size, before being discarded.\" \"Pring loves a theory,\" says Hussain with a laugh. \"I consider myself English and I remember how disappointed I was when I was selected for my first game at the Oval but didn't play. David Gower gave me the bag of goodies but took out the England cap and jumper. I wanted that pullover with the three lions. But I'm still very proud of the Indian side of me. There is a lot of interest from the Asian community in England, and family and friends in India are always ringing my dad to talk about how I'm doing.\" \"Relatives in India follow his progress so closely on the internet that they know more about him than I do,\" says Joe Hussain. When Norman Tebbit declared his \"cricket test\" in 1990, asking Britons of Asian extraction which team they would support - England, or teams from the subcontinent - Hussain attacked the former Conservative chairman for his insensitivity and compared him with Enoch Powell. \"I admit to getting withdrawal symptoms if I go too long without a curry,\" said Hussain. \"Yet, on returning from the West Indies [where he had been touring with England] I was looking forward just as much to having roast chicken and all the trimmings.

Mel now works in the City (\"he earns twice as much as me, has more days off and doesn't get slagged off in the press,\" says Nasser); Abbas did a pharmaceutical degree at Loughborough and now sells drugs (\"legal drugs\", Nasser emphasises) around the world; and younger sister Benazir is a ballet dancer, formerly with the Royal Ballet and currently with the Perth Ballet in Australia. It is a formidably close-knit, high-achieving family in which sport and education each had their place. Hussain could have gone straight on to the staff at Essex, but his father insisted that he go to university and play for the county only in the vacation.

Some of his drive and passion appeared to have rubbed off on his team. \"I get a lot of letters saying we don't mind winning or losing, but make sure the players show that they care,\" he says. \"We did that this winter.\" Part of his sorrow over the Cronje affair is that his side's efforts, especially in winning that final Test, are now tarnished by association. \"As a fellow player, I feel for Cronje and his fall from grace,\" he says, \"but the disappointing thing is that the winning or losing of games is now being questioned.\" That, Hussain implies, can kill a sport. \"I used to be a fan of athletics and liked the 100 metres, but after the Ben Johnson thing I never watched it because I used to think that whoever wins now has just taken the better drugs. I want to make sure that cricket doesn't go the same way.\" He recognises that the pressure this summer will be different from that in South Africa - not to perform heroically against superior opposition but to win well against Zimbabwe, the weakest Test- playing country, and the West Indies, a once great side which has fallen on hard times. If things go badly from next Thursday, when England face Zimbabwe at Lord's (the Zimbabweans' first Test match in this country), he may discover just how tough the captaincy - and how capricious the media - can be. \"I've been fortunate because I came in at rock bottom,\" he says. \"We were out of the world cup, our Test results hadn't been great, and everyone was thinking that anything from here was a bonus. Everyone was expecting us to lose four- or five-nil in South Africa, and we didn't so people view it as a success, but I personally don't because we lost the Test series. There's been a lot of praise heaped on me, but the two series I've been in charge we've lost. \"The only thing that will lift English cricket is winning, and people seeing us doing well and enjoying it. We should beat Zimbabwe and, if we play like we can, we should beat West Indies. But Zimbabwe like to prove a point and West Indies are still dangerous .\" The real test, though, comes next summer when England play Australia for the Ashes, the series which will define the success or failure of Hussain's tenure as captain. \"He likes the way the Australians play cricket but he believes we have the talent to take them on,\" says Joe Hussain. \"His biggest ambition in life is to beat them.\" If he succeeds, Hussain will have given English cricket its biggest boost since Ian Botham's heroics at Headingley in 1981, the future will look incomparably brighter, and the sport's rebellious son will have become its saviour.",

      "bodyText": "For all its efforts to reinvent itself as a modern, non-sexist, event, Miss Universe has run into trouble again: this time in the form of Orthodox priests protesting against the \"pernicious\" pageant being held in Cyprus - the island that has long prided itself as the birthplace of Aphrodite, the world's first beauty queen. Last night, as 79 delegates competed for the new millennium's first Miss Universe crown, strutting before judges in bikinis and ballgowns, the church was doing what it does best - leading its flock in prayer. At an all-night vigil timed to coincide with the contest's 4am finale (for the benefit of viewers across the Atlantic), the church admonished the contest for its \"evil, soul-destroying ways\". Miss Universe, the conservative Greek Orthodox church says, is the sort of thing that demeans women, destroys marriages and, in seeking \"to satisfy the pleasure of the senses\", encourages drug-taking, Aids and sexual crime. Even worse, protesters argue, the event is being held in Nicosia's main sports stadium, within walking distance of an ancient orthodox monastery dedicated to the Holy Virgin and All-Innocent Mother of Our Saviour. \"When we believe something is very wrong we react with a vigil and prayer,\" said Father Marios of the synod, the church's governing board. What, he asked, are innocent villagers meant to think when they see girls with legs up to their armpits parading in a state of semi-dress? \"How can an island that has been partitioned by war, that has missing people and mothers who cry themselves to sleep, so happily promote half-naked women? \"It is a schizophrenic state of affairs and an affront to Christianity.\" Affront or not, the Greek Cypriot government has poured nearly \u00a35m of taxpayers' money into the pageant. For the past three weeks the delegates have been wined and dined across the former British colony. Miss Universe 2000 is the 49th beauty contest to be held since it was first held a year after the British invented the Miss World title in 1951. Three thousand years after Aphrodite, the goddess of love, rose \"out of the soft, sea foam\", according to Homer, officials had hoped the \"event of the new millennium\" would lure visitors to the tourist-dependent island. \"This is something we have been striving to do for years,\" said the island's commerce and tourism minister, Nicos Rolandis, who married a former Cypriot beauty queen. \"Who said anything about culture? This is not culture. This is entertainment, pure and simple.\" Not everyone on Cyprus would agree. For all of its \"gawp value\", the visual feast has left most Cypriots cold. Last week's preliminary pageant was held in a half-empty stadium. For the finale - beamed via the US to more than 120 countries - the organisers have been forced to slash ticket prices by more than 60%. \"It's been a case of overkill,\" said one Cypriot male. \"You turn on the television and these girls just seem to be everywhere.\" In the five years since the US tycoon Donald Trump bought the company, Miss Universe has, like other pageants, been increasingly derided, even by the delegates. Even by the controversial standards of Miss Universe, this year's event has been problematic. The Cyprus government caused consternation in Paris by demanding that the Louvre lend the island the Venus de Milo statue, the quintessential Aphrodite, for the duration of the show. Once the contestants arrived nerves were frayed further when Turkey announced that it would not be sending a delegate to the island it invaded in 1974, and China fumed over a competitor who presented herself as \"Miss Taiwan\". For the Orthodox church the fall-out is proof that the government is already paying for its sins.",

Northamptonshire council still insists all this is normal but we are not listening. Belt up, as Sir Jimmy Savile used to say in those advertisements. Belt up. comment@theguardian.com",

James Parry, 13, claims he was slapped across the face because he pronounced a sentence wrongly at Syr Thomas Jones comprehensive school at Amlwch, Anglesey, in January. The teacher is also said to have poked him on the chest while making him say the sentence correctly five times. Anglesey education authority confirmed yesterday that details of the alleged incident and the caution had been forwarded to officials at the Department for Education. The teacher is understood to have been cautioned by police last month following a complaint by the boy's family. James's mother, Samantha Parry, who works as a lunchtime supervisor at the school has met the teacher, Linda Jones, and the school's headteacher but is refusing to accept a personal apology. \"The teacher should be sacked,\" Mrs Parry said last night. Anglesey education authority said that it was waiting to hear from the DfEE before deciding on any disciplinary measures.",

      "bodyText": "Two brothers from Northern Ireland have won more than \u00a3600,000 damages after a book published in the US claimed they were part of a committee which ordered political assassinations in the province. David and Albert Prentice won the settlement following a lawsuit taken out in Washington. Damages are thought to be around $1m (\u00a3630,000). They brought the case against journalist Sean McPhileny and Roberts Rhinhart, publishers of the book The committee: political assassinations in Northern Ireland. Mr McPhileny and Roberts Rhinehart said in a statement they accepted that the Prentice brothers had not been involved in the activities described in the book. \"Sean McPhileny and Roberts Rhinehart sincerely regret the embarrassment and offence caused to Albert and David Prentice by the books.\" A spokesman for the brothers said they were delighted at the settlement and that their name had been cleared from the \"ludicrous allegations in the book\". Their US lawyer, Bill Taylor, also welcomed the settlement. \"We are very happy with the amount of damages.\" The book was on sale in the US, but not in Britain.",

The plan is to use Sierra Leonean forces to go on the attack while UN troops secure strategic points and captured territory.</p> <p>British forces will provide crucial support with strategy and logistics although they will, officially at least, steer clear of direct combat. A committee has been formed to bring the various military elements together. It is chaired by the British.</p> <p>The initial targets for the offensive are the city of Makeni, which is the RUF headquarters, and the diamond-rich regions of Kono and Koidu which generate tens of millions of dollars for the rebels.</p> <p>As part of the attempt to break RUF morale, a public relations campaign is being launched in the local media today to portray a unified, powerful front of Sierra Leonean, UN and UK forces that the rebels cannot hope to resist.</p> <p>The sources say the strategy is to exploit divisions within the RUF between Mr Sankoh and some of his commanders who the British believe are reluctant to continue the war. It is being made clear to rebel leaders that if they continue the fight their army will be pursued, but that the intent is not the total destruction of the RUF, which is also technically a political party.</p> <p>However, rebel commanders are also being told that the pro-government forces are no longer prepared to deal with Mr Sankoh because of his repeated breach of agreements. RUF commanders are being told to demonstrate their opposition to the war by handing him over for trial.</p> <p>\"Foday Sankoh has no support at all in the RUF any more. We believe there are other leaders who are prepared to get rid of him because they are not interested in war,\" said the source.</p> <p>However, British and UN officials concede that they do not know where the rebel leader is or whether his commanders are in a position to detain him.</p> <p>Although an offensive would potentially endanger the lives of nearly 500 UN peacekeepers being held hostage by the rebels, officials say RUF commanders have been told that they will be held responsible for any harm that befalls them.</p> <p>In a sign of growing British involvement, General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff, is flying to Sierra Leone this weekend accompanied by a senior Foreign Office official.</p> <p>Six hundred royal marines are due to arrive off the Sierra Leone coast over the weekend, reinforcing the battalion of paratroopers in Freetown.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence yesterday disclosed that control of British troops and aircraft - including Sea Harriers on board the carrier HMS Illustrious, heading towards the west African coast - was up to Brig Richards.</p> <p>The brigadier, originally in charge of just 15 British \"technical advisers\", is now commander of more than 1,300 British troops as well as an amphibious force including the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, equipped with an artillery battery and six landing craft due to arrive off Sierra Leone this weekend.</p> <p>Defence sources said the British taskforce would take orders from Brig Richards. \"He can employ the assets.

      "bodyText": "British forces in Sierra Leone have taken control of the United Nations military operation and pro-government forces in preparation for an assault on the Revolutionary United Front's heartland, according to informed sources in Freetown. The dramatic change in strategy to take the war to the rebels in an attempt to break them militarily contrasts with the line in London, where ministers and officials were nervously denying that there had been any \"mission creep\". In less than a week, the British position has shifted dramatically from going in only for 10 days to facilitate the evacuation of UK citizens to taking a key role in securing peace. With the capital now deemed relatively secure against RUF attack after several days of rapid fortification by British and UN forces, preparations are being made to go on the offensive against the rebels. The British have also in effect declared the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, a wanted man who will face trial for crimes against humanity if he is captured. The commander of the growing British military force, Brigadier David Richards, is quietly overseeing command of the UN military in Sierra Leone and various pro-government forces, including the national army and Kamajor militia, which are being blended into a single force. The plan is to use Sierra Leonean forces to go on the attack while UN troops secure strategic points and captured territory. British forces will provide crucial support with strategy and logistics although they will, officially at least, steer clear of direct combat. A committee has been formed to bring the various military elements together. It is chaired by the British. The initial targets for the offensive are the city of Makeni, which is the RUF headquarters, and the diamond-rich regions of Kono and Koidu which generate tens of millions of dollars for the rebels. As part of the attempt to break RUF morale, a public relations campaign is being launched in the local media today to portray a unified, powerful front of Sierra Leonean, UN and UK forces that the rebels cannot hope to resist. The sources say the strategy is to exploit divisions within the RUF between Mr Sankoh and some of his commanders who the British believe are reluctant to continue the war. It is being made clear to rebel leaders that if they continue the fight their army will be pursued, but that the intent is not the total destruction of the RUF, which is also technically a political party. However, rebel commanders are also being told that the pro-government forces are no longer prepared to deal with Mr Sankoh because of his repeated breach of agreements. RUF commanders are being told to demonstrate their opposition to the war by handing him over for trial. \"Foday Sankoh has no support at all in the RUF any more. We believe there are other leaders who are prepared to get rid of him because they are not interested in war,\" said the source. However, British and UN officials concede that they do not know where the rebel leader is or whether his commanders are in a position to detain him. Although an offensive would potentially endanger the lives of nearly 500 UN peacekeepers being held hostage by the rebels, officials say RUF commanders have been told that they will be held responsible for any harm that befalls them. In a sign of growing British involvement, General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff, is flying to Sierra Leone this weekend accompanied by a senior Foreign Office official. Six hundred royal marines are due to arrive off the Sierra Leone coast over the weekend, reinforcing the battalion of paratroopers in Freetown. The Ministry of Defence yesterday disclosed that control of British troops and aircraft - including Sea Harriers on board the carrier HMS Illustrious, heading towards the west African coast - was up to Brig Richards. The brigadier, originally in charge of just 15 British \"technical advisers\", is now commander of more than 1,300 British troops as well as an amphibious force including the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, equipped with an artillery battery and six landing craft due to arrive off Sierra Leone this weekend. Defence sources said the British taskforce would take orders from Brig Richards. \"He can employ the assets. We don't need to as he decides. It is not something for London.\" The British defence sources said yesterday the marines were there \"should they be required. We do not know what is going to happen next.\" Asked to rule out paratroops defending anything other than their present commitments - to safeguard positions around Lungi airport and help ferry UN troops in the area - and state that they would be home within weeks, Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said: \"That is certainly the intention.\" But when pressed, he added: \"This is a fast-moving situation on the ground.\" A Foreign Office official said there were signs of greater stability in the country, though it remained volatile. The RUF had not made any significant advances in the past 48 to 72 hours and the various militia forces in Sierra Leone had rallied to support the president. Whitehall is clinging to the hope that there will be sufficient UN troops in place and a marked improvement in the security situation within a month to allow British forces to make an honourable exit. The UN force increased to about 9,000 yesterday with the arrival of Jordanian reinforcements. Indian and Bangladeshi battalations are scheduled to arrive at the weekend. According to the Foreign Office, Nigeria has also agreed that its formidable troops should join them. Nigeria, which partly precipitated the crisis when its experienced troops left the country a week ago, was adamant that it would not return unless it was funded by the UN. The UN is planning to increase the force from the 11,000 originally planned to around 14,000 to 15,000. But even the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, in a surprise admission, said the quality of many of the troops at his disposal was poor. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"We are going to evaluate the presence of the British troops on a day-to-day basis and we will weigh the value of their presence against the safety and security of our troops and keep it under constant review.\" In another comment that allowed for flexibility, Lady Symons, the defence minister, said: \"We are not dealing in the realms of a preordained script.\"",

The masters of \"tough discipline\" for the world's poorest countries are very much in the cry-baby class when anyone hits back, as was seen at the Bank of England last week. The story so far; Joe Stiglitz, then chief economist at the World Bank, tore into the fund's \"stabilisation\" policies in an article in New Republic earlier this year. </p> <p>Among his many dicta was the claim that the IMF is largely staffed by \"third-rank students from first-rate universities.\" Fellow economist, Rudi Dornbusch, defended the IMF with a follow-up letter, claiming that: \"Today no finance minister will opt for the Stiglitz Clinic of Alternative Medicine. They have the ambulance rush them to the IMF.\" Professor Stiglitz was promptly hoofed out of the totally independent World Bank on the orders of Larry Summers, the svelte US treasury secretary. Come May 5, he was speaking at a Bank seminar on the future of the IMF and World Bank, repeating his criticisms of the IMF. During the Q&amp;A, IMF deputy research chief Flemming Larsen rose to his feet, read out the Dornbusch letter in full and stalked from the room in high dudgeon, a \"great moment\", says our spy. Touchy touchy! </p> <p>\u0095 Almost as sensitive, in fact, as the City lawyers who these days pour over flotation documents, terrified of breaking one or other rule or regulation. A forest of \"warnings to investors\" accompanies any share offer nowadays, but the most unusual of the year to date must be the alert in the prospectus for XTL, an Israeli biotech company floating in London. Many of the senior executives are obliged to perform annual military reserve duty, it discloses, and were another Middle East war to erupt, they could be required to serve for \"extended periods of time\", which could severely disrupt the operation of the business. \"The future of peace efforts in the region remains uncertain,\" it adds. \"A state of hostility ... has led to security and economic problems for Israel.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Not only the lawyers are cautious these days. City analysts have long been famed for their reticence to come up with profit forecasts beyond a year or two, even for a rock-steady business such as a brewery or brickworks.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 They can dish it out at the International Monetary Fund, it seems, but taking it is another matter. The masters of \"tough discipline\" for the world's poorest countries are very much in the cry-baby class when anyone hits back, as was seen at the Bank of England last week. The story so far; Joe Stiglitz, then chief economist at the World Bank, tore into the fund's \"stabilisation\" policies in an article in New Republic earlier this year. Among his many dicta was the claim that the IMF is largely staffed by \"third-rank students from first-rate universities.\" Fellow economist, Rudi Dornbusch, defended the IMF with a follow-up letter, claiming that: \"Today no finance minister will opt for the Stiglitz Clinic of Alternative Medicine. They have the ambulance rush them to the IMF.\" Professor Stiglitz was promptly hoofed out of the totally independent World Bank on the orders of Larry Summers, the svelte US treasury secretary. Come May 5, he was speaking at a Bank seminar on the future of the IMF and World Bank, repeating his criticisms of the IMF. During the Q&amp;A, IMF deputy research chief Flemming Larsen rose to his feet, read out the Dornbusch letter in full and stalked from the room in high dudgeon, a \"great moment\", says our spy. Touchy touchy! \u0095 Almost as sensitive, in fact, as the City lawyers who these days pour over flotation documents, terrified of breaking one or other rule or regulation. A forest of \"warnings to investors\" accompanies any share offer nowadays, but the most unusual of the year to date must be the alert in the prospectus for XTL, an Israeli biotech company floating in London. Many of the senior executives are obliged to perform annual military reserve duty, it discloses, and were another Middle East war to erupt, they could be required to serve for \"extended periods of time\", which could severely disrupt the operation of the business. \"The future of peace efforts in the region remains uncertain,\" it adds. \"A state of hostility ... has led to security and economic problems for Israel.\" \u0095 Not only the lawyers are cautious these days. City analysts have long been famed for their reticence to come up with profit forecasts beyond a year or two, even for a rock-steady business such as a brewery or brickworks. Happily, there are one or two super-steady firms where earnings can be forecast as far out as 2010, one such being the extraordinarily sedate and well-established Lastminute.com, where Goldman Sachs, without any apparent irony, is forecasting profits into the blue yonder.

      "bodyText": "Police investigating the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh, the estate agent abducted and assumed murdered 14 years ago, yesterday reopened the case. A key witness has come forward with new evidence leading officers from Scotland Yard's serious crime group to consider for the first time that Ms Lamplugh's disappearance in 1986 may have involved more than one man. They will now focus on a \"core group\" of suspects. The witness, who came forward with a \"nagging doubt\" during a routine \"cold-case\" review launched last December, is believed to have told police they saw Ms Lamplugh in her car with one or more people up to 80 minutes after the last known sighting. As part of the review, samples taken from the dead woman's car, fibres, hair and human tissue will be subjected to DNA testing not available at the time of the initial investigation. Lamplugh, 25, disappeared on July 28 1986 after leaving her office in Stevenage Road, Fulham to show a client known as Mr Kipper a house in Shorrolds Road, around a mile away. The original investigation into her disappearance was closed in 1987, and she was officially declared dead in 1994. Her body has never been found. \"[The] information came to light during a review of the case and is most exciting and includes a new witness. We're extremely hopeful, extremely confident,\" said Det Supt Shaun Sawyer, who is leading the case. \"There are some existing suspects we will reinterview and there are some new suspects. We have to consider that more than one person may have been involved.\" Mr Sawyer added that police would be looking to establish links between the suspects. Before the new witness's evidence it was thought that the last positive sighting of Lamplugh came when she left the office at 12.40pm, and that she drove directly to Shorrolds Road to meet her abductor. That time frame has now been widened, and police yesterday appealed for witnesses who may have seen Lamplugh's white Ford Fiesta in the area around Fulham between 12.40 and 2pm. It was initially thought that the estate agent had got into a black BMW driven by \"Mr Kipper\" at around 1pm, but the new information contradicts this theory. The police acknowledged that some of their suspects were serving prison sentences for violent crime. They denied that they were preparing to dig for Lamplugh's body at Norton army barracks in Worcestershire. Gilly Paige, a former girlfriend of the convicted murderer John Cannan, told police that he confessed to raping and killing Lamplugh at the disused barracks. Cannan, who was jailed for life in 1989 for the murder of sales manager Shirley Banks, was interviewed three times by officers investigating the Lamplugh case and denies killing her. In December Diana Lamplugh, Suzy's mother, said she had received new information that corroborated Ms Paige's story. In 1994 Michael Sams, also serving a life sentence for murder, said he killed Lamplugh but the claim was dismissed as a hoax. Yesterday Mrs Lamplugh indicated that as long as the police were certain of the killer's identity, and that he could not strike again, she would be content for the investigation to be closed. \"The main thing is that it doesn't happen again. If the person was in prison and not coming out it's not the same as someone waiting round the corner to kill again,\" she said. Mr Sawyer said the new witness came forward after reconsidering the route the estate agent may have taken from her office: \"[They] spent a long time worrying about something that they never thought could possibly have been relevant.\" He also appealed to the killer to come forward. \"I say to you, you have lived with this anxiety for some time. You have lived with the fear of being discovered for the last 14 years. There remains an opportunity for you to identify yourself.\" Suzy Lamplugh's parents echoed Mr Sawyer's appeal for help and spoke of their enduring sense of loss. \"I'm a mother, part of my body has been murdered and that of course makes me angry as well as making me deeply sad,\" said Mrs Lamplugh, 63, who founded a charitable trust in her daughter's name to advise young women on personal safety within months of Suzy's disappearance. Family despair, police frustration Yesterday's announcement that the police had found a new witness in the Lamplugh case is the latest twist in a 14-year case that has caused despair to her family and frustration to the police. July 28 1986 Suzy Lamplugh goes missing after leaving the estate agent where she works to meet a Mr Kipper at a house in Fulham. Her body is never found October 1987 After investigations on two continents but no breakthroughs, the police inquiry is closed. The file remains open April 1989 Police conduct the first of three interviews with John Cannan, a convicted killer, whose prison nickname was Kipper. His former girlfriend said she suspected him of involvement in the case but the police are unable to find any evidence to link him August 1992 Police say a young woman's body found in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, is not Lamplugh's February 1994 Lamplugh is officially declared dead December 1994 Claims by Michael Sams, serving life for murder and kidnap, that he killed Lamplugh are dismissed by the family as a \"sick hoax\" December 1999 Diana Lamplugh is told that her daughter's body could be at an abandoned army barracks at Norton, Worcestershire May 2000 After investigations police announce that they are to reopen the case Martin Deacon",

      "bodyText": "It's Friday so it must be Ford. Another day, another crisis for Stephen Byers. No sooner had the trade and industry secretary reversed out of Rover than along comes another car company problem. The past two months proved a testing time for a Blairite minister, already burdened with tags such as \"rising star\" and \"possible future prime minister\", as BMW threatened to shut Longbridge and dump 24,000 West Midlanders on the dole. Twice Mr Byers had to cancel holidays, on one occasion turning up at the Gatwick check-in desk to tell his partner Jan, who had just flown down from Newcastle, that their trip to Paris was off. And the BMW fiasco brought to a head complaints that the Department of Trade and Industry is failing to champion Britain's trade and industry. The DTI has even been dubbed the Department of Timidity and Inaction by John Edmonds, head of the GMB general union. \"Don't worry about Steve Byers,\" remarked a battle-hardened Labour official. \"It is just his turn. Every week one minister or another is in the firing line. Last time it was John Prescott, now it is Steve.\" Mr Byers, who yesterday spoke to the Marconi boss, Lord Simpson, about state aid to secure a huge job-creating investment for the West Midlands, maintains he is no bystander. He raised the prospect of a rescue bid for Longbridge with John Towers in the back of a government Rover 75 within 48 hours of BMW's announcement. Yet it is not as simple as the Labour official suggested. Manufacturing has lost 206,000 jobs since the election and the high pound is crucifying exporters while Mr Byers, a strong supporter of the euro, looks on helplessly. The DTI is in some ways the department for the Labour heartlands, its presence most needed in the industrial north and West Midlands. Shortly after he was appointed at Christmas 1998, Mr Byers made a speech declaring that wealth creation was more important than wealth redistribution. During the week-long debate that ensued he was painted by leftwingers as an ultra-Blairite free marketeer happy to let firms go to the wall. \"I wish I could teach him about politics,\" sighed a sympathetic backbencher. Mr Byers is unapologetic about his statement, and, while opposing traditional intervention, yesterday said he believed the government did have a role in guiding industry. \"We have to ensure that the market is our servant and not our master,\" he said. \"One of the roles of the government is to help people through a process of change and it is about being on their side. We are going to be there for the hard times and not only the easy ones.\" To bolster their man his supporters cite everything from banging on BMW's door to open the way for the Towers team to a \u00a3530m loan for British Aerospace to design a superjumbo and spending \u00a3100m to keep pits open. Detractors say he failed to move when Marks &amp; Spencer scrapped UK contracts, putting thousands in the textile industry out of work. Mr Edmonds said: \"I think he has been very badly let down by his department. At times the DTI is a joke. Ask any businessman who deals with it and they will tell you the first thing they are told is what it cannot do. Stephen Byers has to shake it up or he risks going down with the department.\" Britain's main business papers, the Economist and the Financial Times, constantly snipe at the minister, while the Sun once asked: \"What is the point of Stephen Byers?\" The attack was possibly in revenge for his decision to block Sky TV's takeover of Manchester United. Big business is less hostile, and Digby Jones, director general of the CBI, was recently dropped from a TV programme after being deemed insufficiently critical by the producers. Parliamentary colleagues also like Mr Byers, who is attentive to constituency issues. The DTI has always been a bed of nails and Margaret Thatcher and John Major went through about a dozen secretaries of state during the Tory era. The big test Tony Blair is already on his third in three years. The first, Margaret Beckett, introduced the minimum wage and laid the foundation for new employment rights, but lost out to Gordon Brown in spending battles and was the victim of a Downing Street \"whispering\" campaign. The second, Peter Mandelson, was well respected by his officials and impressed businessmen, but was distrusted by union leaders. The DTI is Mr Byers's first big test as a minister. When he was at education as schools minister, David Blunkett took the flak. When he was chief secretary at the Treasury, Gordon Brown took the hits. Now he is on his own. Mr Byers, a former Newcastle law lecturer, graduated from the hard left on north Tyneside during the 1980s to the New Labour respectability of the late 1990s.

Mr Byers intends to concentrate on the regions, particularly the north and West Midlands, which would go down well with Labour's core voters. After Phoenix pulled off its Rover coup last Tuesday, Mr Byers received bouquets rather than brickbats from Labour backbenchers as he enjoyed a pint on the Commons terrace. \"Steve's had the guts to do the right thing and the outcome is a good one.

      "body": "<p>To the knockers in the City, he's a sentimental mug. BMW, one of the world's top car producers, couldn't make a go of Rover. What makes John Towers, head of the Phoenix consortium of local businessmen which this week bought the loss-making company for a nominal \u00a310, think he can do any better? With close ties to the West Midlands, he's let his heart rule his head. Emotions have got the better of economics. He will soon have to face up to the inevitable and close Longbridge, with all the painful social consequences that will entail. </p> <p>The critics bark on and on. In a week which has also seen saw Ford announce 1,900 redundancies at Dagenham, once again blaming overcapacity in the European car market, the risks do appear to be very real. But if Towers shares some of these worries, he's keeping them well buried. After six weeks of determined silence, and now paraded as the saviour of Longbridge, he insists he would never have got involved in the deal if didn't believe Rover was a viable business proposition. </p> <p>\"I would never have entered into this had there not been a clear possibility of a better business process than that which had existed under the other proposal. If that was not possible, there was no point,\" he says, carefully. \"The only obstacle in my way was my own feeling, having experienced a number of business sales and acquisitions, that we were too late.\" </p> <p><strong> Hard-nosed alternative</strong><br> </p> <p> The \"other proposal\" involved the disposal of Rover to Alchemy, the hard-nosed venture capital group, which had begun talks with BMW in November, giving it a five-months start over Phoenix, which did not come to the fore until early April. </p> <p>Doubtful of Rover's future as a mass market producer, Alchemy wanted to downsize the operation at Longbridge, making redundant up to 5,000 workers and selling many of the business' assets. Instead of a full range of models, Longbridge would in future produce low volume sports cars. Rumour suggests Alchemy was receiving the secret backing of some senior ministers and their advisers, who were sceptical of Rover's long-term future and wanted the bad news out of the way before the next election. </p> <p>To the cynics, the Phoenix consortium's vision for Rover was almost romantic by comparison, seeking to preserve the company as a volume producer and the jobs that went with it. Under the Phoenix proposal all stakeholders in the business - workers, managers and dealers - would own part of the company. Alchemy was in the lead right up to the finishing line - when it withdrew after failing to get sufficient money from BMW to fund the redundancies.

      "bodyText": "To the knockers in the City, he's a sentimental mug. BMW, one of the world's top car producers, couldn't make a go of Rover. What makes John Towers, head of the Phoenix consortium of local businessmen which this week bought the loss-making company for a nominal \u00a310, think he can do any better? With close ties to the West Midlands, he's let his heart rule his head. Emotions have got the better of economics. He will soon have to face up to the inevitable and close Longbridge, with all the painful social consequences that will entail. The critics bark on and on. In a week which has also seen saw Ford announce 1,900 redundancies at Dagenham, once again blaming overcapacity in the European car market, the risks do appear to be very real. But if Towers shares some of these worries, he's keeping them well buried. After six weeks of determined silence, and now paraded as the saviour of Longbridge, he insists he would never have got involved in the deal if didn't believe Rover was a viable business proposition. \"I would never have entered into this had there not been a clear possibility of a better business process than that which had existed under the other proposal. If that was not possible, there was no point,\" he says, carefully. \"The only obstacle in my way was my own feeling, having experienced a number of business sales and acquisitions, that we were too late.\" Hard-nosed alternative The \"other proposal\" involved the disposal of Rover to Alchemy, the hard-nosed venture capital group, which had begun talks with BMW in November, giving it a five-months start over Phoenix, which did not come to the fore until early April. Doubtful of Rover's future as a mass market producer, Alchemy wanted to downsize the operation at Longbridge, making redundant up to 5,000 workers and selling many of the business' assets. Instead of a full range of models, Longbridge would in future produce low volume sports cars. Rumour suggests Alchemy was receiving the secret backing of some senior ministers and their advisers, who were sceptical of Rover's long-term future and wanted the bad news out of the way before the next election. To the cynics, the Phoenix consortium's vision for Rover was almost romantic by comparison, seeking to preserve the company as a volume producer and the jobs that went with it. Under the Phoenix proposal all stakeholders in the business - workers, managers and dealers - would own part of the company. Alchemy was in the lead right up to the finishing line - when it withdrew after failing to get sufficient money from BMW to fund the redundancies. Sources in the West Midlands say Alchemy may also have been cheesed off by indications from the local council that it would not grant planning permission for a change of use of parts of the 400-acre Longbridge site. With Alchemy out of the running, BMW was faced with two choices - either put Rover into receivership or do a deal with Phoenix. After initially appearing unenthusiastic, BMW appears to have decided that selling the assets to Phoenix for a nominal amount and \"lending\" it \u00a3575m for the acquisition was preferable to the uncertain costs and bad publicity associated with closure of a business in its biggest European market.

BMW in pocket As it is, BMW is reckoned to be coming out of the overall transaction in pocket because the sum total of Rover's net assets and the financial package that it has put together for Phoenix is around \u00a31.2bn in value, less than it stands to get for Land Rover. The net cash will not, however, compensate for the billion pounds worth of investment that BMW has poured into the company's engineering since acquiring it six years ago. The benefit of that will go to Towers and his partners. Towers, chief executive of Rover before the BMW takeover, insists that despite all the bad publicity of the past few years it is making some very good cars. \"It was not until the proposed deal between Alchemy and BMW was announced that people be gan to hear that the Rover 75 had been car of the year,\" he says.

No top-down approach It's thought that the new sales and marketing strategy will involve devolving much more responsibility for pricing and advertising to the dealership network rather than a top-down approach. Once overheads are under control, Towers plans to do \"imaginative things\" with existing platforms to develop new sports cars and sports saloons, aided by Nick Stephenson, special projects manager at Lola racing cars and a key member of the consortium.

It fulfils Britain's responsibility as the former colonial power, largest aid donor, and joint mediator of last year's Sierra Leone peace accord. Most of all, the intervention is the duty owed by a wealthy and powerful nation to, in this case, one of the world's poorest countries. The hazardous nature of this undertaking is not in dispute. Nor is it, or can it, be clear how long and how deep Britain's involvement in such a chaotic situation will go: those demanding timetables and watertight guarantees understand neither war nor politics. It may ultimately cost blood as well as money. It may hurt. But it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>Britain's action once again begs a much broader question - about the principle of intervention in the affairs of another state and \"global governance\" through the agency of the UN. These issues pose a problem for the political left with its visceral dislike of big, rich countries apparently telling smaller, weaker ones what to do. In Africa, this dilemma is exacerbated by the legacy of European colonisation and misrule. On the political right, UN intervention is opposed for ideological reasons. This tendency has gained fullest expression most recently in the US, where a conservative congress and a president who lacks strong convictions have often combined, as now, to give a distinctly disengaged flavour to American foreign policy.</p> <p>Interventions like that in West Africa also raise issues of consistency which trouble people right across the political spectrum. If in Sierra Leone, then why not in Sri Lanka, another former British colony where an appalling civil war rages unchecked? Or Chechnya or Tibet? In the case of Sri Lanka, there is no obvious or satisfactory answer. When it comes to territory controlled by nuclear-armed states which also have UN security council vetoes, like Russia and China, brute political and military reality trumps any amount of humanitarian concern.</p> <p>Intervention, both in theory and practice, is plainly an imperfect science. But progress is discernible. The self-serving opposition of Moscow and Beijing to any infringement of sovereign borders gives solace to a few undemocratic, renegade regimes, such as Serbia and Iraq. Increasingly, however, the principle of UN-approved intervention is accepted, as shown by the speech of Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, to the UN general assembly last autumn and, for example, positions taken by the last Organisation of African Unity summit. But if the end is largely agreed, the means remain controversial and fiendishly difficult.</p> <p>The UN-sanctioned intervention in East Timor last year worked because one regional power, Australia, was prepared to show a lead and commit ground troops. Kosovo remains much more problematical because it lacked the UN's prior blessing. The US-led air war did not by itself bring the Serbs to heel and Kosovo, too, ultimately required a (British-led) ground occupation and UN follow-up to secure its objectives. Likewise, the Bosnian war ended only after an Anglo-French rapid reaction force came to the aid of the UN and forced the Bosnian Serbs to come to terms. In contrast, other UN interventions, in Angola and Rwanda to name but two, failed miserably for lack of international support and, crucially, because no regional or western power was able or prepared to get involved physically as the designated international military trouble-shooter.</p> <p>There is a pattern here which looks like being repeated in Sierra Leone. Britain, like it or not, is already spearheading the military effort and the British commander is expected in effect to assume overall direction of Nigerian and other troops officially under UN command. As this stabilising force extends its influence, the aim will be to persuade the RUF rebels, the Sierra Leone army, and the militias that a return to the Togo peace process is their best bet. The UN mission should then be able to revert to the business of peacekeeping.</p> <p>In an ideal world, Sierra Leone would have been able to sort out its problems by itself. But in nine years of war, it has become the archetypal \"failed state\". Ideally, the Nigerian-led, West African force which preceded the UN would have been better supported and funded by the west; and UN peacekeeping missions would generally be better trained and financed. In an ideal world, as Mr Cook said this week, the underlying causes of such conflicts - poverty, debt, ignorance - would be more energetically and selflessly addressed; the rackets which rob Africa of its precious natural resources, like the trade in uncut diamonds which funds the RUF, would be halted; and political mavericks like the rulers of Libya and Liberia would stop using conflicts like Sierra Leone to further their pseudo-ideological and material interests. Ideally, the international criminal court would be ready to prosecute those responsible for Sierra Leone's agony. It is not.</p> <p>There can be no general rule of intervention; each case is different. But the fact that there have been so many failures in the past does not negate attempts to do better now and in the future. That is what progress is all about. In Sierra Leone, as elsewhere, Britain is right simply to try to do what it can, where it can, when it can, within the limits of its power and self-responsibility.</p>",

The UN-sanctioned intervention in East Timor last year worked because one regional power, Australia, was prepared to show a lead and commit ground troops. Kosovo remains much more problematical because it lacked the UN's prior blessing. The US-led air war did not by itself bring the Serbs to heel and Kosovo, too, ultimately required a (British-led) ground occupation and UN follow-up to secure its objectives. Likewise, the Bosnian war ended only after an Anglo-French rapid reaction force came to the aid of the UN and forced the Bosnian Serbs to come to terms. In contrast, other UN interventions, in Angola and Rwanda to name but two, failed miserably for lack of international support and, crucially, because no regional or western power was able or prepared to get involved physically as the designated international military trouble-shooter. There is a pattern here which looks like being repeated in Sierra Leone. Britain, like it or not, is already spearheading the military effort and the British commander is expected in effect to assume overall direction of Nigerian and other troops officially under UN command. As this stabilising force extends its influence, the aim will be to persuade the RUF rebels, the Sierra Leone army, and the militias that a return to the Togo peace process is their best bet. The UN mission should then be able to revert to the business of peacekeeping. In an ideal world, Sierra Leone would have been able to sort out its problems by itself. But in nine years of war, it has become the archetypal \"failed state\". Ideally, the Nigerian-led, West African force which preceded the UN would have been better supported and funded by the west; and UN peacekeeping missions would generally be better trained and financed. In an ideal world, as Mr Cook said this week, the underlying causes of such conflicts - poverty, debt, ignorance - would be more energetically and selflessly addressed; the rackets which rob Africa of its precious natural resources, like the trade in uncut diamonds which funds the RUF, would be halted; and political mavericks like the rulers of Libya and Liberia would stop using conflicts like Sierra Leone to further their pseudo-ideological and material interests. Ideally, the international criminal court would be ready to prosecute those responsible for Sierra Leone's agony. It is not. There can be no general rule of intervention; each case is different. But the fact that there have been so many failures in the past does not negate attempts to do better now and in the future. That is what progress is all about. In Sierra Leone, as elsewhere, Britain is right simply to try to do what it can, where it can, when it can, within the limits of its power and self-responsibility.",

BT says this concession is worth \u00a32m a day in interest payments, or \u00a3360m all told. Vodafone bid about \u00a36bn in its own right for a third-generation licence and Orange bid \u00a34bn. The government has deferred payment by the two companies to give Vodafone time to sell Orange, which it acquired when it bought the German telecoms group, Mannesmann. The sale of Orange was a condition set by regulators for approval of the monster bid, and the government accepts it is fair to allow Vodafone and Orange to untangle themselves before having to pay. BT and One2One have claimed the interest gain for both companies is unfair and that BT and One2One ought to be compensated by the government for the interest they themselves will have foregone by paying on the nail. In the high court yesterday , Mr Justice Morrison expressed scepticism about the BT and One2One challenge, saying that it \"lacked merit\", but granted leave to seek judicial review because the Department of Trade and Industry was actively supporting the move in order to obtain a firm ruling. He was not, however, prepared to grant an injunction invalidating the auction. Both sides will now present arguments in October. The auction last month of third-generation franchises has brought \u00a322.5bn into the public coffers, with five winners: BT, One2One, Vodafone, Orange and Tiw-Umts, a joint venture between Canada's Telesystem International Wireless and Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa. Judge Morrison said that, at first glance, he believed the challenge was unlikely to succeed. \"I find myself in this difficulty, that having prepared this case with care, my preliminary view was that this was not a case where leave or permission should be granted,\" he said.

Rejecting allegations that it was snubbing the royal family, the corporation said it had committed \u00a31m to the coverage of the Queen Mother's centenary on BBC1 alone. The BBC had been in discussions to show the event, two weeks before her birthday on August 4, but \"on balance\" decided not to go ahead. It said a suggestion that it refused to cover it live because it clashed with the early evening soap, Neighbours, was nonsense. In fact the event was originally to start at 6pm, not 5pm. The Daily Mail highlighted the BBC's decision in a front page story yesterday headlined: \"How dare the BBC snub the Queen Mother\". Inside, the paper accused the corporation of nurturing republican elements, and said of the decision: \"It not only affronts the millions of viewers who would have enjoyed the hour-long spectacular, but reveals a depth of journalistic incompetence unforgivable in a publicly funded organisation.\" BBC executives were furious at the allegation. One source said: \"If we constructed our schedules with one eye on what the Daily Mail says, nobody would watch our programmes.\" A spokesman said: \"Under no circumstances or by any stretch of the imagination can we be accused of snubbing Her Majesty. We are spending \u00a31m on commemorating a great occasion.\" The BBC is to screen live a service of thanksgiving for the Queen Mother in St Paul's cathedral, which will be attended by the Queen, Tony Blair and politicians and royalty from around the world. On August 4 it will mount a two-hour outside broadcast, taking in events from all around Britain, presented by David Dimbleby. In the run-up, there will be documentaries, celebrations, music programmes on Radios 2 and 3 and broadcasts on Radio 4. On the Sunday before the birthday, Sally Magnusson will present a special edition of BBC1's Songs of Praise from the Queen Mother's birthplace, Glamis Castle. \"This will be the people's tribute,\" the spokesman said. BBC cameras will be at the parade in question, which will feature a pageant of 5,000 people from the charities of which the Queen Mother is patron and a military parade of 1,000 members from all her regiments in Britain and the Commonwealth. Dame Vera Lynn will lead 700 children in the parade, and there will be a flypast by second world war aircraft. The event, headed by Major General Evelyn Webb-Carter, general officer commanding, of the army's London district, will be covered in the BBC's main evening news bulletins.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Maxwell's troubled Telemonde communications company has swung round into profit in the three months to the end of March, despite problems with US regulators and protracted negotiations over \u00a376m of supply credit. The US company turned a loss of $600,000 in the first quarter of 1999 into an operating profit of $1.2m. Mr Maxwell, co-founder of Telemonde and son of the late publisher Robert Maxwell, said the turn-around was \"very significant\", given Telemonde was now hitting \"vital\" sales and profit targets. The company remains de-listed in the US because of outstanding questions raised by the financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, concerning accounting policies. It is thought Telemonde believes these queries, which were raised last November, will be sorted out in the near future, allowing the company to return to the Nasdaq stock exchange. Telemonde's recent difficulties have arisen from supply contracts with suppliers under which the company is required to buy specific quantities of supplies over set periods. In November, Mr Maxwell notified the SEC that the company had not been able to generate sufficient cash to meet these requirements, so was in danger of default. One contract has been renegotiated, and two are still subject to discussions. The company aims to cable up the developing world, bringing poorer countries the benefits of high-quality, low-cost telecoms links. Although co-founder Adam Bishop said much of first-quarter revenue had come from transatlantic traffic, Mr Maxwell said that for the first time a significant contribution was coming from the Middle East. Financial chief Paul Donofrio said there was \"still much work to be done,\" in particular to secure adequate working capital to fuel Telemonde's continued strong growth.",

Labour will find it harder to blame defeat on traditional supporters refusing to vote, because the 35% turnout was relatively high by local election standards.

      "bodyText": "Friday lunchtime in a packed gastro-pub in Soho, central London, and a gaggle of women are shouting to make themselves heard. Fuelled by Chardonnay, their voices become more raucous as they compete with the thocks of table football, the clatter of kitten heels on the wooden floor, and Gabrielle blaring over the sound system. \"Sometimes we decide not to come here after work because we can't handle the noise,\" admits Fiona Fovargue, a 30-year-old advertising account manager, as she strains to be heard over a screech of laughter. It is a scenario with which many diners are becoming increasingly familiar. But a survey published by New Scientist magazine this week suggests that noise levels in such establishments regularly exceed industrial safety regulations. Indeed, in almost half the venues, the average noise level was 88 decibels - higher than the 85 at which there is a risk of hearing damage. The survey also discovered that bars and restaurants that follow the vogue of bare floors, walls and pillars were the noisiest, since sound is reflected back and not absorbed. In one unnamed West End restaurant, a peak level of 97 was measured. Prolonged conversation at such a pitch can lead to laryngitis, and the magazine warned that staff subjected to such conditions \"ought to consider donning industrial ear muffs to protect them from possible hearing loss\". Armed with a decibel meter and an environmental health officer, the Guardian conducted its own straw poll in London and Manchester. In six of the 10 restaurants and bars peak levels over 85 decibels were recorded - a level above that at which employers are legally required to take action if workers are exposed to it for eight hours a day. At the Slug and Lettuce in Soho, where Ms Fovargue and her five colleagues were struggling to be heard, the highest level was 94; at a Pizza Express in Manchester, the highest level was 90. Customers tended to admit they wished sound levels were lower, and often criticised the music - largely credited with driving up noise levels, according to Dani Fiumicelli, the acoustician taking the readings. \"The noise of people talking means it is hard enough to make oneself heard without this drivel,\" complained Caroline Thornton, a 24-year-old administrator, as Frank Sinatra pushed levels in Leicester Square's All Bar One to 89 decibels. But venues without music could also be deafening. At the Eagle, a gastro-pub in Farringdon Road, London, with bare boards and a kitchen open along the length of the bar, the decibels soared to 89.7 - just short of a thundering heavy goods lorry. Mr Fiumicelli, an acoustician with a London borough council, insisted that customers were unlikely to be damaged by the levels, since they were unlikely to be subjected to such levels for eight hours daily. But he stressed that more traditional venues with carpets, bolstered furnishings and plants, were gentler to ears. The New Scientist had also surveyed such establishments and found none exceeded the 75 decibel level. But did this mean having to revert to flock wallpapered establishments, anathema to hip urban living? Not necessarily. Cafe Med, a terracotta-decorated Soho brasserie with dark wood floors and deep leather armchairs, noise levels averaged 75 decibels. Andrew Tyldesley, a property developer, explained why he had booked the restaurant. \"I knew we had to talk, and it is nice to be able to hear yourself doing so.\" Decibel count Where shouting drowns out music \u0095 Pizza Express South King Street, Manchester Three-floor branch of high-street chain with steel and glass interior Maximum decibels 90.1 Noise Waitress can't hear orders, babies' screams and jazz music drowned out by shouting and clatter of plates \u0095 Mash and Air Chorlton Street, Manchester Conran-style minimalist restaurant and bar Maximum decibels 80.5 Noise Pans crashing in the open-plan kitchen, loud acid house music \u0095 The Living Room Deansgate, Manchester Art house lounge brasserie \"designed to feel like home\" Maximum decibels 87.6 Noise Grace Jones and shouting \u0095 Cafe Med Dean Street, London Mediterranean Bar grill, wooden floors, open kitchen Maximum decibels 83 Noise Unobtrusive jazz broadcast, hum of conversation \u0095 The Eagle Farringdon Road, London Gastro pub with open kitchen, bare floors and walls Maximum decibels 89.7 Noise Food frying, clatter of utensils, drone of traffic from adjoining busy road \u0095 Slug and Lettuce Wardour Street, London Chain bar with bare floors and walls Maximum decibels 94 Noise Table football, pop music, lots of laughter \u0095 McDonald's Leicester Square, London Fast-food outlet packed with mothers with young children, foreign tourists, and teenagers Maximum decibels 80 Noise Quiet pop music, the ring of cash machines and cry of children",

The auction houses have dedicated sales of her works, always well attended. Yet in the 60s she was very much out of fashion and you could pick up her pieces for a few pounds. Her reputation began to revive following a major retrospective exhibition of her work in Brighton in 1972. She was, moreover, an industrial potter; her work was mass-produced.</p> <p>If Clarice Cliff has now become too expensive for you, are there other quite well-known potters that have been overlooked and may be due for a revival? One such group could be the pieces of the Poole Potters. Poole Pottery is a cross between studio pottery and industrial ceramics, as the pottery in Dorset attracted various artists whose designs were produced in limited and unlimited editions.</p> <p>The pottery is still going. In 1992 a venture capital-backed management buyout from parent Thomas Tilling brought in fresh capital. Last August Poole experienced a 99% eclipse of the sun. To mark the occasion a plate and charger, a large decorative wall plate, were produced in a limited edition of 2,000.</p> <p>The Poole Pottery was set up in the 1850s and became firmly established in 1873 when it was taken over by Jesse Carter and his sons Charles and Owen, and became host to artists with emerging and changing styles.</p> <p>William de Morgan, who became well known had been buying blanks from the Carters from the 1870s. In 1900 he began buying bowls. John Radley Young introduced new lines during the first world war and Roger Fry, the Bloomsbury designer, visited Poole between 1914 and 1917 to produce wares for his Omega workshops.</p> <p>Resident designers in the last century included Truda Carter, John Adams, Harold and Phoebe Stabler and visiting artists such as Edward Barra and Dora Batty. Later designers were Ruth Paveley in the 20s.</p> <p>The range extends from early plain and encaustic tiles through various experiments to the decorative domestic wares up until the 50s.</p> <p>The wares produced throughout the 20th century reflected the changing tastes of various decades. There were bright Art Deco items during the 20s and 30s and more restrained items in the 40s. In the 50s there were the free-form styles often made for Liberty. They were called Freeform because they were hand-thrown using traditional hand potting techniques, making each one slightly different. By the 60s came the Delphis range, with bright psychedelic colours and abstract designs.</p> <p>The Delphis wares were launched in 1963 at Heal's, the designer store. The same year Tony Morris, a former student at Newport School of Art, joined Poole and over the next two years he and Robert Jefferson developed the range. The lines were continued until 1980.</p> <p>Today, after a period in the doldrums, Poole pottery is beginning to perform well at auctions. Christie's South Kensington has two auctions a year where it sells Poole Pottery along with Chintz and Carlton Ware.</p> <p>The most sought-after items are the traditional ware, the pieces made early in the century by the Carter-Adams-Stabler team, and the Delphis range. The traditional items are usually earthenware pieces with an off-white glaze and either geometric or spare floral or bird designs.</p> <p>Poole Pottery is still very cheap. In flea markets in Brighton and Lewes in Sussex recently I saw several pieces, mostly plates or chargers, going for \u00a315 to \u00a320 and a large jug and bowl for \u00a368. At the next Christie's auction on August 25 there are two chargers from the Delphis range, and associated with Tony Morris estimated at between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500. Occasionally a piece reaches a four-figure sum.</p> <p>If Clarice Cliff can take off, why not the Poole Potters, particularly the Delphis wares?</p> <p>Joy McCall at Bonham's says: \"I suppose you would have to say that Clarice Cliff is probably more distinctive in shape and design. The countryside and floral patterns are very intricate, the Delphis pieces have abstract designs. But they are not inferior as products.\"</p> <p>For further information telephone Christie's, South Kensington, 020-7581-7611, <a href=\"http://www.christies.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.christies.com</a> or Bonham's 020-7393-3900 <a href=\"http://www.bonhams.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.bonhams.com</a>.</p>",

The Poole Pottery was set up in the 1850s and became firmly established in 1873 when it was taken over by Jesse Carter and his sons Charles and Owen, and became host to artists with emerging and changing styles. William de Morgan, who became well known had been buying blanks from the Carters from the 1870s. In 1900 he began buying bowls. John Radley Young introduced new lines during the first world war and Roger Fry, the Bloomsbury designer, visited Poole between 1914 and 1917 to produce wares for his Omega workshops. Resident designers in the last century included Truda Carter, John Adams, Harold and Phoebe Stabler and visiting artists such as Edward Barra and Dora Batty. Later designers were Ruth Paveley in the 20s. The range extends from early plain and encaustic tiles through various experiments to the decorative domestic wares up until the 50s. The wares produced throughout the 20th century reflected the changing tastes of various decades. There were bright Art Deco items during the 20s and 30s and more restrained items in the 40s. In the 50s there were the free-form styles often made for Liberty. They were called Freeform because they were hand-thrown using traditional hand potting techniques, making each one slightly different. By the 60s came the Delphis range, with bright psychedelic colours and abstract designs. The Delphis wares were launched in 1963 at Heal's, the designer store. The same year Tony Morris, a former student at Newport School of Art, joined Poole and over the next two years he and Robert Jefferson developed the range. The lines were continued until 1980. Today, after a period in the doldrums, Poole pottery is beginning to perform well at auctions. Christie's South Kensington has two auctions a year where it sells Poole Pottery along with Chintz and Carlton Ware. The most sought-after items are the traditional ware, the pieces made early in the century by the Carter-Adams-Stabler team, and the Delphis range. The traditional items are usually earthenware pieces with an off-white glaze and either geometric or spare floral or bird designs. Poole Pottery is still very cheap. In flea markets in Brighton and Lewes in Sussex recently I saw several pieces, mostly plates or chargers, going for \u00a315 to \u00a320 and a large jug and bowl for \u00a368. At the next Christie's auction on August 25 there are two chargers from the Delphis range, and associated with Tony Morris estimated at between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500. Occasionally a piece reaches a four-figure sum. If Clarice Cliff can take off, why not the Poole Potters, particularly the Delphis wares? Joy McCall at Bonham's says: \"I suppose you would have to say that Clarice Cliff is probably more distinctive in shape and design. The countryside and floral patterns are very intricate, the Delphis pieces have abstract designs. But they are not inferior as products.\" For further information telephone Christie's, South Kensington, 020-7581-7611, www.christies.com or Bonham's 020-7393-3900 www.bonhams.com.",

There was no shortage of sympathetic relatives but, as she points out: \"They're not helpful at 3 o'clock in the morning when you can't sleep and all you want is to hear his voice.\" She became a foot-soldier in America's silent civil war over guns, which will break into open battle this weekend with the Million Mom March, a mass protest in support of gun control to be staged tomorrow, Mother's Day, in Washington and cities across the country. The aim is to put the issue where it has never been before, at the centre of the political agenda as the 2000 election campaign enters its final months. In a country where handguns are subject to fewer federal regulations than electric toasters or teddy bears, the marchers will demand built-in safety locks, \"cooling off\" periods between ordering a gun and receiving it, and purchase limits of one gun per person per month. To European eyes, it is hardly a radical programme. But similar measures have been stuck in Congress for the past year, blocked by well-funded and well-organised opposition from the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA), which is ploughing millions of dollars into a campaign to stifle the momentum of the Million Mom March. Advertisements are being broadcast around the country, in which the NRA's figurehead, the aging film legend Charlton Heston, offers to spend $1m on a programme to teach children to handle guns safely. The NRA has also launched a spoiler to the Million Mom March called the Armed Informed Mothers' March. It will be fronted by an NRA women's subsidiary calling itself the Second Amendment Sisters, in reference to the constitutional clause guaranteeing Americans the right to bear arms. The winners and losers in tomorrow's battle will be determined by turnout. Gun-control campaigners are optimistic they can bring up to 300,000 marchers together in Washington, and make up the rest of the million in other cities. If they succeed, it will be the biggest anti-gun demonstration in US history. The movement has been fuelled by a string of highly publicised school shootings - such as the 1999 massacre at Columbine high school in Colorado - which have spread anxiety about guns to white middle-class suburbs, particularly to suburban mothers. A Gallup poll yesterday found that 58% of US women were in favour of new gun laws, compared to 30% of men. \"In most of the southern cities, it cuts across race lines, and it goes across class lines,\" said Ben Bycel, an anti-gun activist who is helping to coordinate the march in the south. \"I haven't seen anything like this since the 1960s. There is a groundswell here.\" Ms Algee now lives in Atlanta. There, she says, outrage at guns is no longer just a black issue. Several of her fellow organisers are relatively affluent whites. \"If it doesn't affect you directly, you feel sad about it, but you don't do anything about it,\" she said. \"But with guns, there are no guarantees. It's no respecter of persons or backgrounds.\" Two years ago, the Jaskolkas, a conservative, gun-owning family from Delaware, discovered just how random gun violence can be. Gregory, Brenda and their 11-year-old son Joseph were at a New Year's Eve street party when a bullet fell from the sky and struck Joseph in the head. Somebody had decided to mark the occasion by letting off a few rounds, a relatively common form of celebration in a country where many still see themselves as roughneck pioneers. Incredibly, Joseph survived with a bullet lodged in his brain. But the Jaskolkas' lives were changed forever. Their son, now 13, can walk only with extreme difficulty and spends most of his time confined to their home.

      "body": "<p>Soaring property prices have put owning a home in London out of the reach of thousands of workers. But does it save you money to buy a cheaper house in commuterland and pay train fares - which can add up to as much as \u00a35,000-\u00a36,000 a year - to work in the capital?</p> <p>The number of passengers using the train to commute into London is up for the third consecutive year, according to official figures. Last year an extra 12,919 passengers chose to take the train to work, bringing the total number of peak-hour travellers to 455,290.</p> <p>But does it pay to travel so far to work? It's certainly far cheaper to buy property outside London. The average cost of a semi-detached family home in Norwich, East Anglia is \u00a364,225. The cost of a semi in the London borough of Croydon is an average of \u00a3141,644, while in trendy Islington the same semi would cost a whacking \u00a3339,240.</p> <p>A mortgage for 90% of the value of the Norwich home at a standard variable rate of 7.75% will cost buyers \u00a35,299 a year. Add to that the cost of a season ticket, \u00a34,400 for the 1 hour 40 minute journey and the annual cost of living in Norwich, and travelling to London comes to the grand total of \u00a39,699.</p> <p>That \u00a39,699 would, according to Halifax, pay for a mortgage of nearly \u00a3106,000 (equal to a house purchase of \u00a3117,600 assuming a 10% deposit) which would still not be enough to buy the average semi in London, so the Norwich commuter is quids in.</p> <p>Russell Taylor is one of a growing band of commuters who want to have their cake and eat it. After 15 years in London, Mr Taylor, who runs FPD Savills' Docklands estate agency office, went in search of a better quality of life. Last October he and his family took the plunge and moved to the pretty Hampshire city of Winchester. They are currently renting while looking for somewhere to buy.</p> <p>A cathedral, good state and private schools, the countryside and the Solent entice many Londoners to wave farewell to the smoke and move to Winchester, says Stephen Cross of FPD Savills' Winchester Office. Mr Cross has noticed a marked increase in the number of people looking to live in the area but work in London.</p> <p>\"Easily 50% of the people we sell to are commuting to London. They either live here already and commute or are moving out of London,\" says Mr Cross. \"It's a fast train to London. The road links are very good too. The M3 connects to the M27, the A34 to the M4 and the A303 to Exeter. The ferry ports are also in easy reach,\" he explains.</p> <p>Mr Taylor says his journey is far from arduous and has rekindled an interest in reading during the 55 minute trip: \"I step on the Winchester to Waterloo, get engrossed in a book and I'm there before I know it. I keep a scooter at Waterloo and can be in the office in 10 minutes.</p> <p>\"Door-to-door it takes an hour and 20 minutes. And 55 minutes of that is sitting down reading,\" he adds. The average price of a semi in Winchester is \u00a3130,386 and the cost of an annual season ticket for the 55-minute journey to Waterloo is \u00a32,936. A four-bedroom family home can cost between \u00a3375,000 - \u00a3450,000. It's easy to understand why people move out, says Mr Cross. \"If you can swap your \u00a3400,000 terraced house in London for a detached or semi-detached home in Winchester, you're going to do it, aren't you?\"</p> <p>Elaine Stratford, sales director of Banner Homes, certainly believes you will. She says: \"There is no doubt that the area from which people are prepared to commute has greatly expanded.\" There are plenty of commuters applying to buy Banner's properties in Winchester and Cambridge. The remaining two duplexes overlooking a courtyard in the company's Winchester development are selling from \u00a3264,950. Another development is planned soon.</p> <p>Demand is high, says Ms Stratford. \"The hunt for good schools is one factor that drives people to search for new areas to commute from,\" she says. \"House-hunters in Winchester can buy into the rural element and send their children to a nice village primary school but still be in Waterloo in under an hour.\"</p> <p>As well as having a thriving business community, East Anglia and Cambridge are attracting increasing numbers of London commuters in search of value for money. Stuart Chipchase of FPD Savills' Cambridge office says houses in the area are two-thirds of the price of the equivalent London home. \"Buyers can get an old farmhouse with half to a couple of acres - not too big to mow - for the same price as some London terraces,\" says Mr Chipchase. The company is currently marketing a house on a hill, standing in 10 acres, for \u00a3950,000.</p> <p>Residents of the villages around nearby Huntingdon can cycle leisurely to the station, jump on a train and be in King's Cross within an hour, he says.</p> <p>But as any seasoned commuter hanging on until their arms are numb will testify, travelling long distances by train has its downside. Last year's figures show passengers experienced severe overcrowding on trains on routes run by four of the 10 train companies that serve the capital. Thameslink, Connex South Central, South West Trains and Chiltern all exceeded the guidelines for maximum numbers of passengers standing.</p> <p>In some cases the problems were caused by the increase in the number of passengers following improvements to the services.</p> <p>The train companies promise to keep pace with the increasing demand. As part of the upgrade of the west coast main line Virgin trains is cutting journey times on intercity services. Birmingham to London (currently 1 hour 30 minutes) will take only 1 hour and 10 minutes by 2005. Likewise Manchester to London (now 2 hours 30 minutes) will take only 1 hour and 50 minutes in five years' time.</p> <p>Of course, making the decision to move out but continue working in London can be risky unless you have friends and family in the area. Some property websites can help with pre-move research. <a href=\"http://www.upmystreet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.upmystreet.com</a> provides local information including the cost of council tax, details of local schools and their league table results.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Soaring property prices have put owning a home in London out of the reach of thousands of workers. But does it save you money to buy a cheaper house in commuterland and pay train fares - which can add up to as much as \u00a35,000-\u00a36,000 a year - to work in the capital? The number of passengers using the train to commute into London is up for the third consecutive year, according to official figures. Last year an extra 12,919 passengers chose to take the train to work, bringing the total number of peak-hour travellers to 455,290. But does it pay to travel so far to work? It's certainly far cheaper to buy property outside London. The average cost of a semi-detached family home in Norwich, East Anglia is \u00a364,225. The cost of a semi in the London borough of Croydon is an average of \u00a3141,644, while in trendy Islington the same semi would cost a whacking \u00a3339,240. A mortgage for 90% of the value of the Norwich home at a standard variable rate of 7.75% will cost buyers \u00a35,299 a year. Add to that the cost of a season ticket, \u00a34,400 for the 1 hour 40 minute journey and the annual cost of living in Norwich, and travelling to London comes to the grand total of \u00a39,699. That \u00a39,699 would, according to Halifax, pay for a mortgage of nearly \u00a3106,000 (equal to a house purchase of \u00a3117,600 assuming a 10% deposit) which would still not be enough to buy the average semi in London, so the Norwich commuter is quids in. Russell Taylor is one of a growing band of commuters who want to have their cake and eat it. After 15 years in London, Mr Taylor, who runs FPD Savills' Docklands estate agency office, went in search of a better quality of life. Last October he and his family took the plunge and moved to the pretty Hampshire city of Winchester. They are currently renting while looking for somewhere to buy. A cathedral, good state and private schools, the countryside and the Solent entice many Londoners to wave farewell to the smoke and move to Winchester, says Stephen Cross of FPD Savills' Winchester Office. Mr Cross has noticed a marked increase in the number of people looking to live in the area but work in London. \"Easily 50% of the people we sell to are commuting to London. They either live here already and commute or are moving out of London,\" says Mr Cross. \"It's a fast train to London. The road links are very good too. The M3 connects to the M27, the A34 to the M4 and the A303 to Exeter. The ferry ports are also in easy reach,\" he explains. Mr Taylor says his journey is far from arduous and has rekindled an interest in reading during the 55 minute trip: \"I step on the Winchester to Waterloo, get engrossed in a book and I'm there before I know it. I keep a scooter at Waterloo and can be in the office in 10 minutes. \"Door-to-door it takes an hour and 20 minutes. And 55 minutes of that is sitting down reading,\" he adds. The average price of a semi in Winchester is \u00a3130,386 and the cost of an annual season ticket for the 55-minute journey to Waterloo is \u00a32,936. A four-bedroom family home can cost between \u00a3375,000 - \u00a3450,000. It's easy to understand why people move out, says Mr Cross. \"If you can swap your \u00a3400,000 terraced house in London for a detached or semi-detached home in Winchester, you're going to do it, aren't you?\" Elaine Stratford, sales director of Banner Homes, certainly believes you will. She says: \"There is no doubt that the area from which people are prepared to commute has greatly expanded.\" There are plenty of commuters applying to buy Banner's properties in Winchester and Cambridge. The remaining two duplexes overlooking a courtyard in the company's Winchester development are selling from \u00a3264,950. Another development is planned soon. Demand is high, says Ms Stratford. \"The hunt for good schools is one factor that drives people to search for new areas to commute from,\" she says. \"House-hunters in Winchester can buy into the rural element and send their children to a nice village primary school but still be in Waterloo in under an hour.\" As well as having a thriving business community, East Anglia and Cambridge are attracting increasing numbers of London commuters in search of value for money. Stuart Chipchase of FPD Savills' Cambridge office says houses in the area are two-thirds of the price of the equivalent London home. \"Buyers can get an old farmhouse with half to a couple of acres - not too big to mow - for the same price as some London terraces,\" says Mr Chipchase. The company is currently marketing a house on a hill, standing in 10 acres, for \u00a3950,000. Residents of the villages around nearby Huntingdon can cycle leisurely to the station, jump on a train and be in King's Cross within an hour, he says. But as any seasoned commuter hanging on until their arms are numb will testify, travelling long distances by train has its downside. Last year's figures show passengers experienced severe overcrowding on trains on routes run by four of the 10 train companies that serve the capital. Thameslink, Connex South Central, South West Trains and Chiltern all exceeded the guidelines for maximum numbers of passengers standing. In some cases the problems were caused by the increase in the number of passengers following improvements to the services. The train companies promise to keep pace with the increasing demand. As part of the upgrade of the west coast main line Virgin trains is cutting journey times on intercity services. Birmingham to London (currently 1 hour 30 minutes) will take only 1 hour and 10 minutes by 2005. Likewise Manchester to London (now 2 hours 30 minutes) will take only 1 hour and 50 minutes in five years' time. Of course, making the decision to move out but continue working in London can be risky unless you have friends and family in the area. Some property websites can help with pre-move research. www.upmystreet.com provides local information including the cost of council tax, details of local schools and their league table results.",

But that is not how things look from Wuppertal, where he has raised an issue of concern.</p> <p>\"Here, the change from an industrial to a post-industrial economy has yet to be fully accomplished,\" said Michael-Georg von Wenczowsky, the Christian Democrat candidate for one of the city's three seats in the regional assembly.</p> <p>Around 35% of Wuppertal's workers are still employed in traditional sectors such as textiles, chemicals, toolmaking and the manufacture of motor spares. \"The textile industry is in rapid decline and the jobs that are being lost are going to have to be replaced,\" he said.</p> <p>Wuppertal is a quirky place, whose inhabitants pride themselves on their sophisticated humour. The city claims the world's largest flea market, and boasts a suspended railway - the Schwebebahn - which still looks futuristic 100 years after its inauguration.</p> <p>Christian Boros, who runs a local advertising firm, has a theory that the city is \"so ugly that it encourages creativity\". Whatever the reason, several hundred small new media enterprises have sprung up in Wuppertal - one of the reasons why, despite its problems, the local unemployment rate, at 11.1%, is only fractionally higher than the regional average.</p> <p>But creating jobs is only half the battle - the people of Wuppertal and Germany's other rustbelt cities need to be qualified to fill them. Even the Social Democrat mayor of Wuppertal, Hans Kremendahl, agrees that there is a problem.</p> <p>\"It is twofold,\" he said. \"The equipment of schools has got to be improved, though Wuppertal is in the lead within North Rhine-Westphalia because we have our own supplementary city programme. In addition though, a gap has got to be closed between the needs of industry and the quantity and quality of information technologists being produced.\"</p> <p>For Esther K\u00f6niges, who is setting up a subsidiary of Mr Boros's advertising company to create websites for firms, that gap is a daily preoccupation.</p> <p>\"We are starting to look for people, but we are finding it difficult,\" she said.</p> <p>Though Wuppertal has an excellent university, with departments specialising in graphic design and computer science, in the increasingly crucial area of website creation, it has turned out graduates who are too specialised.</p> <p>\"It is very difficult to find generalists. You can find designers and programmers, but not people who can put it all together,\" said Ms K\u00f6niges. \"I am sure that these people can do a good job for, say, Siemens. But what Germany needs is new ideas to develop new business.\"</p> <p>When the government first announced its initiative to bring in IT specialists, a magazine asked on its cover: \"Are Germans too stupid for computers?\" The question is, of course, absurd: in the south of the country, particularly, Germans have been running a successful, computer-based economy since the 1980s.</p> <p>But the struggle for power in what was once Germany's industrial heartland has highlighted the issue of whether the country's highly structured, rigorously planned but often inflexible way of doing things might not be inimical to the latest technologies.</p>",

J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers, the Christian Democrat candidate to lead the administration in North Rhine-Westphalia, attacked the plans, reportedly saying that priority should be given to Kinder statt Inder -children instead of Indians. His approach - he denied using the exact words - was denounced as racist by opponents, amid Europe-wide concern about the rise of Austria's extreme rightwing Freedom party under its former leader, J\u00f6rg Haider. Mr R\u00fcttgers, whose stance is unlikely to bring him victory in tomorrow's poll in a region which has been run by the Social Democrats for more than 30 years, has been branded a \"Haider on the Rhine\". But that is not how things look from Wuppertal, where he has raised an issue of concern. \"Here, the change from an industrial to a post-industrial economy has yet to be fully accomplished,\" said Michael-Georg von Wenczowsky, the Christian Democrat candidate for one of the city's three seats in the regional assembly. Around 35% of Wuppertal's workers are still employed in traditional sectors such as textiles, chemicals, toolmaking and the manufacture of motor spares. \"The textile industry is in rapid decline and the jobs that are being lost are going to have to be replaced,\" he said. Wuppertal is a quirky place, whose inhabitants pride themselves on their sophisticated humour. The city claims the world's largest flea market, and boasts a suspended railway - the Schwebebahn - which still looks futuristic 100 years after its inauguration. Christian Boros, who runs a local advertising firm, has a theory that the city is \"so ugly that it encourages creativity\". Whatever the reason, several hundred small new media enterprises have sprung up in Wuppertal - one of the reasons why, despite its problems, the local unemployment rate, at 11.1%, is only fractionally higher than the regional average. But creating jobs is only half the battle - the people of Wuppertal and Germany's other rustbelt cities need to be qualified to fill them. Even the Social Democrat mayor of Wuppertal, Hans Kremendahl, agrees that there is a problem. \"It is twofold,\" he said. \"The equipment of schools has got to be improved, though Wuppertal is in the lead within North Rhine-Westphalia because we have our own supplementary city programme. In addition though, a gap has got to be closed between the needs of industry and the quantity and quality of information technologists being produced.\" For Esther K\u00f6niges, who is setting up a subsidiary of Mr Boros's advertising company to create websites for firms, that gap is a daily preoccupation. \"We are starting to look for people, but we are finding it difficult,\" she said. Though Wuppertal has an excellent university, with departments specialising in graphic design and computer science, in the increasingly crucial area of website creation, it has turned out graduates who are too specialised. \"It is very difficult to find generalists. You can find designers and programmers, but not people who can put it all together,\" said Ms K\u00f6niges. \"I am sure that these people can do a good job for, say, Siemens. But what Germany needs is new ideas to develop new business.\" When the government first announced its initiative to bring in IT specialists, a magazine asked on its cover: \"Are Germans too stupid for computers?\" The question is, of course, absurd: in the south of the country, particularly, Germans have been running a successful, computer-based economy since the 1980s. But the struggle for power in what was once Germany's industrial heartland has highlighted the issue of whether the country's highly structured, rigorously planned but often inflexible way of doing things might not be inimical to the latest technologies.",

He was to be sent back to Germany on Monday, despite a protest by a charity supporting victims of torture that has called for his release. A court application for the man, who has not been named, to be released on bail was rejected yesterday after he was certified by hospital doctors as fit to travel. But the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture said the man was showing signs of shellshock and severe depression, and that ministers should reconsider his case. The charity's director, Helen Bamber, said it would be inhumane for him to remain in detention or be deported. The man's lawyer, Kash Beh bahani, said yesterday that his client had told him he would rather die than be sent back to Germany, where he believed he would be deported to Iran. The man has been on hunger strike for more than 39 days, and was transferred for a second time to Medway Maritime hospital. The immigration authorities said he should be sent back to Germany on \"safe third country\" grounds. He had fled from Iran via Germany, and that was where his asylum application should be decided. His removal is believed to have been postponed after the German authorities requested more information about his medical condition. Doctors acting for the medical foundation believe he is in a highly disturbed state and unfit to travel. A second Iranian is also in hospital after going on hunger strike more than 30 days ago at Rochester prison.",

It is estimated to fetch \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3300,000 for Bloom's heirs in a sale of part of the world's largest Lowry collection, which Bloom amassed through his bond with the solitary artist. Bloom once bought six \"sordid\" Lowrys for \u00a390. In his account of the journey to London, Lowry, who was 70 at the time, told him: \"She had a very nice face and quite a long beard. \"Well sir, I just couldn't let such an opportunity pass, so I began almost at once to make a little drawing of her on a piece of paper. \"She was sitting right opposite me.

Their train trip was in 1957, when little treatment existed for unsightly hair growths, decades before their removal became a multi-billion pound drug and cosmetic industry. The condition is often caused by excess male hormones in the body or through taking steroids and sometimes by polycystic ovaries, birth control pills or a disorder of the adrenal gland. The painting is one of 20 Lowrys from Bloom's collection expected to fetch a total of up to \u00a31.3m on June 9.",

      "bodyText": "The family of a plastic surgeon who died of an asbestos-linked lung disease more than 20 years after he unwittingly inhaled blue asbestos dust in hospital corridors had a \u00a31.15m settlement approved at the high court yesterday. James Emerson, a consultant at the Northern general hospital in Sheffield, was 47 when he died of mesothelioma in August 1995. He had contracted the disease from exposure to asbestos when he was a medical student at the Middlesex hospital in London between 1966 and 1970, and a junior doctor there in 1972-73. When Mr Emerson - who left a widow, Vanessa, and three daughters, Isabel, Lydia and Jessica, now 17, 15 and 10 - became ill he was at a loss to know where he had been exposed to the killer dust. Investigations brought to light a Guardian article written in 1977 which stated that \"parts of the underground area of one of London's major teaching hospitals, the Middlesex, have been closed down, and the stores kept there removed and decontaminated, because of the presence of blue asbestos in pipe lagging\". Under the hospital were underground passages carrying a network of cables and pipes covered with asbestos lagging. The passages were used by staff and students to travel between buildings, especially the main hospital and the medical school. Evidence from witnesses collected by the family's lawyers, Irwin Mitchell, confirmed that at the time some of the pipes had been lagged with asbestos insulation material and that the lagging was in poor repair and had been damaged in parts by passing trolleys. Mr Emerson remembered that he had walked through the passages several times a day. His lawyers argued that the predecessor of Camden and Islington health authority, which employed Mr Emerson, should have known by 1966 that even low levels of exposure to asbestos could cause mesothelioma. But the health authority only started to consider the safety implications around 1977. Shortly before the case was due to go to trial in November 1998, Camden and Islington admitted liability. Mrs Emerson, a 49-year-old GP who lives in Sheffield with her daughters, was at the high court in London yesterday to hear her counsel, Andrew Spink, tell Mr Justice Eady that her husband had been a notable and very successful surgeon. Approving the settlement, the judge said it was a tragic case and Mr Emerson had died at the height of his career. He noted that Mr Emerson's three daughters were thriving and doing well at school, due to the devoted care of their mother.",

      "bodyText": "Relatives of six people killed by a defective lorry yesterday expressed horror that the haulage company's owner has applied for a licence to run heavy goods vehicles. Tony Eyers was banned from running a business for five years by the traffic commissioner because of his firm's cavalier disregard for road safety. In September 1993 one of his defective lorries ploughed into a van, passersby and a terrace of shops on a steep hill in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, killing three women, two men, and a two-year-old girl. The 30-tonne lorry had defective brakes on all eight of its wheels. It later emerged that Mr Eyers, who was managing director of Skipton-based Fewston Transport, had burned company records after the crash. An inquest ruled that the six people had been unlawfully killed. After a three-year campaign by the victims' relatives, the company's former transport manager was charged with manslaughter, but the charges were dropped when a judge ruled that he would be unable to get a fair trial. Mr Eyers has now applied for a licence to operate six vehicles for North Riding Waste at Tockwith, near York. But the relatives of some of the victims who died in the accident expressed concern about his application. Glenn Rooke, whose wife Angela was killed by the lorry, said he hoped that the public inquiry would look at Mr Eyers's previous safety record. \"I don't have a lot of confidence in the system these days,\" he said. \"If it was up to me, there is no way he would get a licence. But unfortunately it's not. Mr Eyers has never shown any sign of remorse or regret to us about the accident.

I am not confusing reality with fiction, but just pointing out that such lacunae in realistic depictions of everyday scenes on television militate against viewers taking them as they are intended and, in a particularly poignant twist, make us aspire to do better things with our pub furniture arrangements, and perhaps even with our disappointing selves. It would be nice to be beautiful, wouldn't it, to waft across the floor of a voguish basement bar with attractive friends and stylish drinks, and to sit on something decorous. </p> <p>In Coupling (BBC2), the cunning and well-scripted new sitcom by Steve Moffatt, two women came from a crowded bar in the background to the red sofa near the camera. This sequence, and not just for the reasons rehearsed in the last paragraph, was ripe with suggestion. Time was when a sofa in a British pub, especially a well-designed one swathed in virginal velour, was an aberration. Time was when, if the pub flooring was not a heavily stained and smelly carpet, it could not be pub flooring. </p> <p>Then the fantasy land of television interposed itself between ourselves and that unpleasant reality. In Friends, there was a sofa forever vacant when Joey, Chandler, Ross, Monica, Rachel and Phoebe arrived at Central Perk. The floor was sanded and thus, for those of us who have smellyvision (a tiny elite to which the likes of you will never belong), did not reek repulsively as floors did in pub scenes of British television past (Coronation Street, Minder, Only Fools and Horses, EastEnders etc). Pub and cafe designers of cool Britannia looked at the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of Friends and realised this could be imported wholesale to the delight of TV viewers who saw their fantasies brought from televisual New York to real Britain. </p> <p>And so it was. Except that these hang-outs are in reality so crammed that anyone fortunate enough to get a seat on their sofas will occupy them all day and all night, in the manner of street car parking in central London: once you get a spot there is nothing to do but occupy it, perhaps forever. </p> <p>Coupling is doubly derivative of Friends. The pilot episode was chiefly set in a buffed, sanded and newly upholstered basement bar in Clerkenwell (that apparently fashionable district of London where the Guardian, incongruously, is produced). The setting was thus a televisual simulation of a real type of new central London bar that is derivative of Friends' Central Perk (which may itself be a televisual simulation of the real central New York bar, though perhaps not). </p> <p>Coupling was further derivative because its comedy involved six sexually cross-fertilising young men and women, all implausibly good looking, all stupendously banal, just like Friends. At one point the character played by Jack Davenport said \"Oh. My. God,\" as though he was David Schwimmer - which in a sense, he was. There was even a running gag about men being turned on by lesbian sex fantasies, just as there is in Friends. As the series goes on, no doubt, Coupling will embrace Friends' incestuous sexual politics. Steve will have sex with Jane who will have sex with Patrick who will have sex with Susan who will have sex with Jeff who will be unexpectedly rejected by Sally. And any one of the sextet who has sex with anyone outside this ronde will be deserving of contempt and their extra- curricular partner will be written out with extreme prejudice, so that the six can get on with the real business of their lives, seducing and dumping each other. </p> <p>Admittedly, Coupling was not wholly derivative. In Friends, Ross and Rachel never had sex in a stall of the ladies loo, as Steve and Jane did (the hotsy-totsy simulation of Schwimmer and Aniston performed here by Davenport and Gina Bellman, whose strip in the cubicle unwontedly recalled her performance in Dennis Potter's Blackeyes). And Coupling was much ruder in its put downs: \"Mary Kelly thinks you're an idiot.\" \"Then why does she keep looking at my arse?\" \"She's lip reading.\" </p> <p>The comedy was much more to British tastes, in that it was fraught with anxiety. One woman who had just turned 30 realised this imposed a set of personal responsibilities: \"I have had to put a daily limit on facial expression. Nowadays, I only smile at single men. I can justify the use of elasticity.\" Shame she had to smile so much to her girlfriend when she said this, since it totally undermined the joke. </p> <p>Ageing, though, that twentysomething terror, was well deployed by Moffatt: \"Has it never occurred to you that age brings wisdom and greater confidence?\" said naive twentysomething. \"All age brings is more to shave,\" retorted sardonic thirtysomething. </p> <p>Better, Davenport and Bellman played out a droll comedy of rejection. He wanted to dump her, but she was having none of it. \"I don't accept that,\" she told him. \"Don't I get a say in it?\" he asked. \"Of course you don't.\" No wonder Susan Faludi wrote a book about the crisis for men called Stiffed if this sort of dialogue realistically depicts the new power relationship between men and women. </p> <p>Will this series take like a chain of buffed West End boozers? The answer was in the lyrics of the ill-advisedly retro Doris Day theme tune. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.</p>",

It would be nice to be beautiful, wouldn't it, to waft across the floor of a voguish basement bar with attractive friends and stylish drinks, and to sit on something decorous. In Coupling (BBC2), the cunning and well-scripted new sitcom by Steve Moffatt, two women came from a crowded bar in the background to the red sofa near the camera. This sequence, and not just for the reasons rehearsed in the last paragraph, was ripe with suggestion. Time was when a sofa in a British pub, especially a well-designed one swathed in virginal velour, was an aberration. Time was when, if the pub flooring was not a heavily stained and smelly carpet, it could not be pub flooring. Then the fantasy land of television interposed itself between ourselves and that unpleasant reality. In Friends, there was a sofa forever vacant when Joey, Chandler, Ross, Monica, Rachel and Phoebe arrived at Central Perk. The floor was sanded and thus, for those of us who have smellyvision (a tiny elite to which the likes of you will never belong), did not reek repulsively as floors did in pub scenes of British television past (Coronation Street, Minder, Only Fools and Horses, EastEnders etc). Pub and cafe designers of cool Britannia looked at the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of Friends and realised this could be imported wholesale to the delight of TV viewers who saw their fantasies brought from televisual New York to real Britain. And so it was. Except that these hang-outs are in reality so crammed that anyone fortunate enough to get a seat on their sofas will occupy them all day and all night, in the manner of street car parking in central London: once you get a spot there is nothing to do but occupy it, perhaps forever. Coupling is doubly derivative of Friends. The pilot episode was chiefly set in a buffed, sanded and newly upholstered basement bar in Clerkenwell (that apparently fashionable district of London where the Guardian, incongruously, is produced). The setting was thus a televisual simulation of a real type of new central London bar that is derivative of Friends' Central Perk (which may itself be a televisual simulation of the real central New York bar, though perhaps not). Coupling was further derivative because its comedy involved six sexually cross-fertilising young men and women, all implausibly good looking, all stupendously banal, just like Friends. At one point the character played by Jack Davenport said \"Oh. My. God,\" as though he was David Schwimmer - which in a sense, he was. There was even a running gag about men being turned on by lesbian sex fantasies, just as there is in Friends. As the series goes on, no doubt, Coupling will embrace Friends' incestuous sexual politics. Steve will have sex with Jane who will have sex with Patrick who will have sex with Susan who will have sex with Jeff who will be unexpectedly rejected by Sally. And any one of the sextet who has sex with anyone outside this ronde will be deserving of contempt and their extra- curricular partner will be written out with extreme prejudice, so that the six can get on with the real business of their lives, seducing and dumping each other. Admittedly, Coupling was not wholly derivative. In Friends, Ross and Rachel never had sex in a stall of the ladies loo, as Steve and Jane did (the hotsy-totsy simulation of Schwimmer and Aniston performed here by Davenport and Gina Bellman, whose strip in the cubicle unwontedly recalled her performance in Dennis Potter's Blackeyes). And Coupling was much ruder in its put downs: \"Mary Kelly thinks you're an idiot.\" \"Then why does she keep looking at my arse?\" \"She's lip reading.\" The comedy was much more to British tastes, in that it was fraught with anxiety. One woman who had just turned 30 realised this imposed a set of personal responsibilities: \"I have had to put a daily limit on facial expression. Nowadays, I only smile at single men. I can justify the use of elasticity.\" Shame she had to smile so much to her girlfriend when she said this, since it totally undermined the joke. Ageing, though, that twentysomething terror, was well deployed by Moffatt: \"Has it never occurred to you that age brings wisdom and greater confidence?\" said naive twentysomething. \"All age brings is more to shave,\" retorted sardonic thirtysomething. Better, Davenport and Bellman played out a droll comedy of rejection. He wanted to dump her, but she was having none of it. \"I don't accept that,\" she told him. \"Don't I get a say in it?\" he asked. \"Of course you don't.\" No wonder Susan Faludi wrote a book about the crisis for men called Stiffed if this sort of dialogue realistically depicts the new power relationship between men and women. Will this series take like a chain of buffed West End boozers? The answer was in the lyrics of the ill-advisedly retro Doris Day theme tune. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.",

      "bodyText": "France's most troublesome priest, Jacques Gaillot, has been forgiven by the French Catholic church, five years after his appointment as Bishop of Evreux was revoked because the Vatican disapproved of his media-driven campaigns in favour of the poor, illegal immigrants and the jobless. The Vatican was so angry at his social crusades, including support for homosexuals, that he was given the contemptuous title of Bishop of Partenia, a non-existent diocese in north Africa. But his expulsion from Evreux was marked by the presence of thousands of Catholics at his last mass in the cathedral. Monsignor Gaillot, who caused public rows with his calls to overturn the Vatican's ban on contraceptives, to stop the spread of Aids, and his support for the ordination of married priests, was already the country's best known cleric. Easily recognisable with his striking blue eyes and small stature, he has marched in dozens of demonstrations in defence of illegal immigrants, or better housing for the poor. Although there is no indication whether Pope John Paul has forgiven Mgr Gaillot for condemning some of the Vatican's teachings on contemporary social questions, the head of the French hierarchy, Louis-Marie Bill\u00e9, Archbishop of Lyon, has publicly invited him to return to the fold as a \"brother\". To mark the reconciliation, he has been invited to an ecumenical gathering tomorrow where he will sit with all the senior members of the French church Archbishop Bill\u00e9 said that the decision to make peace with Mgr Gaillot was made by all the French hierarchy. \"It is important that Catholics, and public opinion in general, are aware that the communion that links us as brothers is real, even when it is lived out in a special fashion,\" Archbishop Bill\u00e9 said. \"What happened five years ago remains a wound even for those who don't necessarily share Mgr Gaillot's opinions.\" In a letter to Mgr Gaillot, Archbishop Bill\u00e9 said all members of the Catholic church were committed to serving the poor, and accepted that he had the right to carry out his mission \"in a way different from the rest of us\". Friends of Mgr Gaillot said he was told that his work for the poor and minorities was to be publicly recognised by French bishops. \"The Vatican had no part in this initiative even though it was decided in the context of Jubilee 2000,\" a friend said. \"There will be no pressure to reinstate Mgr Gaillot as Bishop of Evreux, nor to seek another episcopal function. The essential point is that his mission among the socially excluded has been officially recognised.\"",

But religion implies blasphemy, and the underside of aesthetics rears its grossly distorted head in Carnivalesque, an exhibition sprawling like a fat drunk across several venues in Brighton. It demonstrates that for every noble aspiration we have to contemplate the finer things, we have an equal and opposite urge to gorge, puke, screw and fart our way to the bottom of the barrel. </p> <p>Today we talk about our divided nature in the language of the unconscious, but in the middle ages it was imagined in extravagant mythological terms as the War of Carnival and Lent. This was a Lenten world ruled by Christianity and poverty, but once a year each town would stage its carnival and the world would explode in a shower of sausages, long noses, big bottoms and immense turds. </p> <p>Carnivalesque traces the way carnival has manifested itself in art from the middle ages to today. Here, Paul McCarthy's Spaghetti Man (1993) - a lifesize plastic man wearing an animal head, with his penis transformed into several metres of flaccid, flesh-coloured rubber hose - is set in the same art historical space as a Flemish diptych from circa 1520. This opens up to reveal not - as a pious person of the time would have expected - a religious image, but a painting of a huge hairy spotty arse pricked by a bunch of thistles. You only have yourself to blame. On the outside of the diptych is painted a warning not to open it; inside, opposite the raddled arse, it says in so many words \"told you so\". Its parody of Christian art seems very subversive, but Philip II of Spain, a Lenten monarch if ever there was one, loved to look at a similar object as a relief from persecuting heretics. </p> <p>In the 1930s the Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin, the inspiration for this show as well as dozens of academic theories about the \"carnivalesque\", argued that \"carnival laughter\" is \"the laughter of all the people\" and an assault on all hierarchical order. Bakhtin was living in internal exile in Kazakhstan when he wrote this and was obviously thinking of Stalin when he claimed in his classic study Rabelais and His World (not published until 1965) that \"no dogma, no authoritarianism, no narrow-minded seriousness\" can co-exist with carnival. </p> <p>But the imagination is a frightening place and the carnival world this exhibition explores is anything but a jolly libertarian paradise. It is a scary place where people you know suddenly put on huge hairy wooden masks and turn themselves into monsters. Some of the most unsettling pictures here are James Ensor's masked nocturnal invaders in early 20th century Belgium. Even nastier are Philip Guston's Ku Klux Klansmen, reduced to pairs of beady black eyes and pointed masks. You see the Klan through Guston as a version of European carnival; the infamous white garb is a vicious form of the masquerade outfits in Tiepolo's paintings and drawings of 18th-century Pulcinellas at the Verona carnival. </p> <p>Carnival can be cruel. This exhibition demonstrates that its structure persists across centuries: the same masks, the same bottom jokes, a shared stock of images. What you have to conclude is that our personal desires or terrors are not private but shared. Carnival is an aesthetic phenomenon manifesting our need to look at the ugly as well as the beautiful. It is the inversion of the classical idea of perfection. If we will always take pleasure in straight lines we will also always laugh at someone showing their arse. </p> <p>What is so clever about this exhibition is that it resists the temptation to stick in any old bum or sausage. It keeps its fools and masked pranksters firmly under control and because of this precision it is able to tell an alternative history of art. Carnival has seeped up into high art from Goya to Louise Bourgeois, whose stumpy voodoo doll made of pink quilting is repellent yet mesmerising. Just when you think those pancake-eating Bruegel peasants are a bit quaint you recognise this world of upside-down folly, boozing, gorging and beating each other with sticks, as our own.

      "body": "<p>The Diaghilev Series, Valery Gergiev's week-long tour through the scores associated with the Ballets Russes, began with two concerts from his own Kirov Orchestra and ended with a pair from the Philharmonia. The Kirov's programmes had been devoted exclusively to Russian music, but at London's Royal Festival Hall the Philharmonia's ranged more widely: Stravinsky appeared in both of them, as well as works by Debussy, Ravel, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov, masterpieces every one of them. </p> <p>In his youth Diaghilev had ambitions to be a composer himself; his musical instincts rarely failed him later. Some of the pieces, of course, were just appropriated for dance rather than commissioned. The Polovtsian Dances from Borodin's opera Prince Igor were featured in his company's debut Paris season in 1909, which brought Nijinsky, Pavlova and Karsavina to the West for the first time. Rimsky's Sheherazade entered their repertory the following year. Much to the impresario's satisfaction, the explicit sexuality of Nijinsky's choreography of Debussy's Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune scandalised all of Paris (including the composer himself) when it was unveiled in 1912, 18 years after the piece itself was premiered in the same city. </p> <p>Stravinsky's The Firebird (Gergiev conducted the 1911 suite) and Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, however, owed their existence to Diaghilev's sponsorship, while the former's Apollo was first staged in Europe under the Ballets Russes's auspices. Each work was a milestone in its composer's development. In the history of musical modernism Diaghilev was one of the most significant catalysts of all; his carefully superintended commissions almost always encouraged composers to extend their creative horizons. </p> <p>On the threshold of his international career with The Firebird, Stravinsky needed no encouragement to kick over the traces, but when he came to write Apollo two decades later he used the opportunity to push his neoclassical style in a new direction. Meanwhile in Daphnis, the reticent Ravel was pushed into displaying his orchestral mastery with greater virtuosity than ever before. </p> <p>That kind of white-hot inspiration usually brings the best out of Gergiev; in the right works his conducting has a visceral quality that is unique among conductors today. But in his pair of Philharmonia concerts he seemed more concerned with other things, with instrumental detail and beauty of tone, with dynamic contrasts (some of the orchestra's quietest playing was breathtaking) and long-limbed phrasing, as if intent on pointing up the difference between this British orchestra and his Russian one. Though he has made enormous strides at the Kirov in ridding the orchestra of its less desirable characteristics - the days of vibrato-laden brass and soupy woodwind are long gone - it is still a band that is at its best when being assertive, while the Philharmonia prides itself on its finesse. </p> <p>There was still the never-fail adrenalin-rush that Gergiev brings to big moments: the final Bacchanale of Daphnis was stupendous, while the climax of the last section of Sheherazade seemed to pull together all the threads of the preceding movements in an absolutely conclusive way, but these were the predictable high points. Much more of a surprise was his neutral approach to both Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e9s-midi, which relied entirely on the beauty of the Philharmonia's woodwind to make its points in sweeping curves, and to the way in which he presented the strings-only Apollo. He played down the energy of the athletic numbers in favour of the grandeur of those intended to be danced by Apollo himself, and made the pas de deux between Apollo and Terpsichore the emotional heart of the work. Sheherazade began in that way too: broadly paced, moulded rather than driven, and only really dramatic in the last movement. </p> <p>There were passages in which the conducting seemed to be relying on auto-pilot, as if Gergiev was not engaged with what he was doing, or had not established a personal slant on the music - hardly surprising, perhaps, considering these were his third and fourth orchestral programmes within seven days and he was working with an orchestra that he conducts relatively rarely. Of course he pushes himself too hard: that is part and parcel of his character as a musician, and the Kirov would not have survived as magnificently as it has down without his selfless energy. But sometimes it shows, and these two concerts, for all their splendour, did not quite live up to expectations.</p>",

And in David Gieselmann's Mr Kolpert at the Royal Court an affluent young couple \"entertain\" their guests with the idea that there is a corpse in the living-room trunk. Both plays are European; both use the thriller format; both feature bourgeois protagonists. But what is fascinating is that Gieselmann's sardonic comedy seems much more lethally political than Sartre's heavyweight melodrama. </p> <p>I am wary of calling Sartre's play dated, simply because it was written in 1948. As John Lahr once wrote, \"all drama is dated, the product of a particular moment\". And nothing is dafter than to attack plays simply because they don't conform to our own values and circumstances. We don't believe in divine monarchy, but Richard II is still a potent analysis of the fallibility of power. Venereal disease may now be curable, but it doesn't stop Ibsen's Ghosts being a powerful attack on inherited guilt. All good plays exist in a dual time-frame: they embody their own period while expressing eternal truths. </p> <p>Eyre's tactical error in The Novice is to abstract Sartre's play from its times. He gives us bags of 40s film noirish atmosphere. But, in a play that is all about a bourgeois rebel assigned to kill a compromising communist, he deletes all reference to the Soviet Union. This strikes me as bizarre, since the whole play is about the tentacles of Moscow's power. </p> <p>In Eyre's version the hero, having committed the murder, is baldly told by his minder, \"we've changed our policy\". In Sartre's original it is spelt out clearly: contact with the USSR was interrupted by war and the local party chose to pursue its own line, whereas in the postwar world it has to kow-tow to Moscow orthodoxy. Eyre excises the specifics, leaving Sartre's play floating in political limbo. </p> <p>But Sartre's form also looks suspect. There was a time when I found his mix of melodrama and politics exciting. What strikes me now is that he tries to spice up his ideas with desultory sex. Sartre gives his hero a glam wife who oscillates between coy flirt, frigid ice-maiden and romantic victim: she is simply used as top-dressing - or sometimes undressing - for the political debates. My hunch is that, if you are going to revive the play today, you have two choices: either acknowledge its strengths and weaknesses and do it as all-out dialectical debate, or, as Frank Castorf does in his jazzy version at the Berlin Volksbuhne, treat it as rampant expressionism. What you can't do is strip it of all context. </p> <p>Ironically, Gieselmann's Mr Kolpert, although seemingly apolitical, has much more social content. Like Sartre's play it is about the morality of murder. The well-heeled Ralf and Sarah entertain married guests and tease them with the idea that there may be a dead body in the trunk. But the key moment comes when Sarah explains, in David Tushingham's translation, the affluent vacancy of their lives: \"Ralf and I kept seeing people our age dancing, trying hard to pretend they'd just left school a few weeks ago and that emotions and all that stuff are just a bit of a laugh. But beneath all that they were really human beings. Then we realised we weren't aware of emotions any more either. All we wanted to do was feel something again.\" </p> <p>If that strikes a chord it is with the world of Sarah Kane and with Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking and Some Explicit Polaroids. What all these German and British writers seem to have spotted is that the real danger in modern society is of a sawn-off sensibility and a detachment from feeling. A shrewd academic pointed out to me this week that there is nothing new in this: Wordsworth was making the same complaint in his Preface to the Lyrical Ballads. But what modern dramatists have detected is that we now seek dangerous substitutes - chemical substances or, in extreme cases, killing - to compensate for our emotional void. </p> <p>That is why I would call Mr Kolpert a deeply political play. It suggests valueless affluence leads to desperation. In Sartre's world people kill for a cause; in Gieselmann's they murder, or toy with it, out of ennui. Sartre warns us against the dangers of excess idealism: Gieselmann against a total lack of it. Fifty years separate the two plays which together paint a graphic picture of modern Europe. If I find Gieselmann's infinitely more terrifying it is because it suggests we now live in a world where violence is the product less of political passion than of bourgeois boredom. How on earth do we counter that? </p> <p>\u0095 The Novice is at the Almeida Theatre, London N1 (020 7359 4404) till June 17; Mr Kolpert is at the Royal Court, London SW6 (020 7565 5000) till May 20.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Princess Diana glides closer to her faithful retainer James Hewitt and begs him to give her the affection that her playboy husband Charles cannot. Hewitt, resplendent in naval uniform, is moved. Heavy black liner accentuates the torment in his eyes and his breast quivers. \"No Diana!\" he protests. Violins in the orchestra pit strike up. Under a shaky chandelier, the loyal lover embraces his beloved. The couple clinch. The audience goes wild. </p> <p>This is not a made-for-TV dramatisation of the life of a late member of the British royal family. It is a theatrical event that has enraptured villagers in one of India's remotest regions. The Diana myth has, in just a few months, transformed the seemingly doomed fortunes of a five-century old travelling theatre tradition in Assam. Many in the audience have never heard of Diana, but the theatre group claims her story has an important message about marital fidelity for the humblest villager. </p> <p>\"Princess Diana's story is a morality play,\" says Mukib Ahmed, who plays Prince Charles. \"Even in Assam we have cases of husbands who are unfaithful to their wives. In Diana's case, it ended in tragedy. We can learn from her life.\" </p> <p>The travelling theatre began with the efforts of a 15th century moralist and religious reformer, Shankar Deb, to educate the Assamese away from the brutal practices of Tantric Hinduism. In a new book, To the Elephant's Graveyard, Tarquin Hall describes a popular method of divination: examining a nine-month foetus cut from the body of its mother. Appalled, Shankar Deb founded Vashnavite Hinduism, prevalent in Assam to this day. </p> <p>To spread his new values of decency and uprightness, his followers travelled from village to village performing yatra, morality plays. In an area starved for entertainment, these soon became immensely popular. Today, the painted lorries heralding the troupe's arrival are greeted rapturously by villagers. Daily chores cease, and an impromptu four-day carnival begins. Stalls selling sweetmeats and snacks spring up. Village youths lounge outside the tent on their motorcycles, hoping some of the glamour of theatre will be sprinkled on them. As dusk falls, the entire community converges upon the theatre. Many have walked for miles. The bamboo stage is enormous and the tent seats 2,000. There is a portable generator so plays may be performed in villages with no electricity. </p> <p>It is an expensive business. There are about 100 people in the troupe, including cast, costume and make-up personnel, a full orchestra, engineers and cooks. Travelling theatre has survived because Assam's remoteness meant little competition. The region has largely resisted the lure of Bollywood films in Hindi. But the recent growth of cinema in Assamese is a greater threat. So large is the appetite for these films, with their lurid plots featuring sex and violence, that fights for tickets have exploded outside the mobile cinemas that tour the villages. </p> <p>The Abahan Theatrical group decided to fight back by staging blockbusters with an added moral dimension. Its first experiment last year was a production of Titanic, based on the plot of James Cameron's film. It was a success, and this year the group launched into its most ambitious project, a locally-scripted version of the life and death of Diana.

      "bodyText": "Princess Diana glides closer to her faithful retainer James Hewitt and begs him to give her the affection that her playboy husband Charles cannot. Hewitt, resplendent in naval uniform, is moved. Heavy black liner accentuates the torment in his eyes and his breast quivers. \"No Diana!\" he protests. Violins in the orchestra pit strike up. Under a shaky chandelier, the loyal lover embraces his beloved. The couple clinch. The audience goes wild. This is not a made-for-TV dramatisation of the life of a late member of the British royal family. It is a theatrical event that has enraptured villagers in one of India's remotest regions. The Diana myth has, in just a few months, transformed the seemingly doomed fortunes of a five-century old travelling theatre tradition in Assam. Many in the audience have never heard of Diana, but the theatre group claims her story has an important message about marital fidelity for the humblest villager. \"Princess Diana's story is a morality play,\" says Mukib Ahmed, who plays Prince Charles. \"Even in Assam we have cases of husbands who are unfaithful to their wives. In Diana's case, it ended in tragedy. We can learn from her life.\" The travelling theatre began with the efforts of a 15th century moralist and religious reformer, Shankar Deb, to educate the Assamese away from the brutal practices of Tantric Hinduism. In a new book, To the Elephant's Graveyard, Tarquin Hall describes a popular method of divination: examining a nine-month foetus cut from the body of its mother. Appalled, Shankar Deb founded Vashnavite Hinduism, prevalent in Assam to this day. To spread his new values of decency and uprightness, his followers travelled from village to village performing yatra, morality plays. In an area starved for entertainment, these soon became immensely popular. Today, the painted lorries heralding the troupe's arrival are greeted rapturously by villagers. Daily chores cease, and an impromptu four-day carnival begins. Stalls selling sweetmeats and snacks spring up. Village youths lounge outside the tent on their motorcycles, hoping some of the glamour of theatre will be sprinkled on them. As dusk falls, the entire community converges upon the theatre. Many have walked for miles. The bamboo stage is enormous and the tent seats 2,000. There is a portable generator so plays may be performed in villages with no electricity. It is an expensive business. There are about 100 people in the troupe, including cast, costume and make-up personnel, a full orchestra, engineers and cooks. Travelling theatre has survived because Assam's remoteness meant little competition. The region has largely resisted the lure of Bollywood films in Hindi. But the recent growth of cinema in Assamese is a greater threat. So large is the appetite for these films, with their lurid plots featuring sex and violence, that fights for tickets have exploded outside the mobile cinemas that tour the villages. The Abahan Theatrical group decided to fight back by staging blockbusters with an added moral dimension. Its first experiment last year was a production of Titanic, based on the plot of James Cameron's film. It was a success, and this year the group launched into its most ambitious project, a locally-scripted version of the life and death of Diana. The play is an unlikely triumph, with distance lending an intriguing cultural twist. A team of researchers sifted through contemporary writing about the late princess, including biographies and back copies of Hello! magazine. The challenges are amazing. \"I have seen still pictures of Camilla,\" says Likuma Sharma, who plays the woman referred to in the play as Camilla Parker-Bowels, \"but I have never had a chance to see film or video of her.

Lives also depend on the words used to describe the province's police force. It cannot continue to be called the Royal Ulster Constabulary, because the Republicans won't accept that, but is there some way of defining it under its new name, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, with words that the Unionists can accept? Everyone is frantically looking for one. </p> <p>I have just read an article about gay marriage in the Washington weekly magazine, the New Republic. Its author, Andrew Sullivan, will accept nothing less than \"marriage\" as the word to describe a permanent partnership between a gay or a lesbian couple. The state of Vermont has just decided to create a new institution for gay couples called \"civil union\". This will accord them all of the rights and responsibilities of a civil marriage between a man and a woman. It is a great victory for gay rights in the United States. </p> <p>But Sullivan finds it totally unacceptable. \"Civil union essentially creates a two-tiered system, with one marriage model clearly superior to the other,\" he writes. \"There are no arguments for civil union that do not apply equally to marriage. To endorse one, but not the other, to concede the substance of the matter while withholding the name and form of the relationship, is to engage in an act of pure stigmatisation.\" For Mr Sullivan, there can be no complete equality of rights between homosexuals and heterosexuals unless the same time-honoured word, \"marriage\", is applied to all legally-recognised partnerships. In a similar way, members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary feel stigmatised by their insipid new title. </p> <p>It is extraordinary how important words remain, especially as they are used so sloppily nowadays. But sloppiness also has its uses when the purpose, as it often is, is to obfuscate. Elisabeth Murdoch, in an interview with the Guardian this week, was at pains not to reveal too much about her reasons for resigning from BskyB - her father Rupert's TV network - to start up her own company. Why did she decide to do it? \"I think it was a catalyst for me to be like, 'Okay, I am someone who can do this. And I also thought that it was a good time from the perspective of where Sky is at the moment,\" she said. You couldn't put it unclearer than that - unless, of course, you are Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York. </p> <p>Interviewed in the current issue of the Tatler magazine, the prince was asked whether he would consider re-marrying his former wife. \"I don't rule re-marriage out, and I certainly don't rule it in,\" he said. \"If ever the opportunity arose, I don't know what I'd do, as it isn't in the plan.\" Replying to the same question, Fergie said, \"I simply say that if it should happen, great. It is not in, nor is it ruled out.\" Almost impenetrable as these answers are, they are intriguing all the same. </p> <p>Although Andrew and Fergie have clearly agreed on the same \"neither-in-nor-out\" formula in discussing the possibility of re-marriage, it would appear that she is rather keener on the idea than he is. Unlike him, she says it would be \"great\" if it happened, and she reverses the sequence of the formula to make it sound more important that it is not ruled out than that it is not ruled in. The prince, by contrast, says that while he doesn't rule it out, he \"certainly\" doesn't rule it in, which tips the balance the other way. </p> <p> According to him, there are also a couple of prerequisites for them getting married for a second time, both of which are puzzling. One is that the \"opportunity\" must first arise, and the other is that there will first have to be a change in \"the plan\". What \"opportunity\"? What \"plan\"? They are both living in the same house and could decide to re-marry at any time, unless they are being denied the opportunity by someone else - the Queen, perhaps. As for the \"plan\", whatever it may be, it doesn't presently include the possibility of re-marriage, but could apparently be amended to do so. </p> <p>Obfuscation is irritating, but at least it represents a desire not to lie. Ken Livingstone was commendably clear in his repeated declarations that he would not, under any circumstances, stand as an independent for mayor of London, but then it turned out he didn't mean any of it.

      "body": "<p>When I was a chicklet, I liked nothing more of a shimmering 70s Saturday morning than to settle down with a copy of Judy or Bunty, and read comic strips about young gels of humble origin, who, due to their incredible resemblance to the deposed Princess of Tsaratanla, were plucked from the schoolroom and dressed in the finest silks and drippingest diamonds in order to thwart the dastardly efforts of a band of brigands who planned to snatch the princess and hold her for some huge ransom. That the subtext of these stories was quite filthy - the life of royalty obviously mattering much more than the life of a dirty commoner - never bothered me. I thought they were fab and, as a freckled, skinny, blonde child (I know - stop sniggering at the back), wondered whether I could one day be of similar use to my heroine, Hayley Mills. </p> <p>So, when I saw the photographs of the smiling blonde with the soft bob, long fringe and pouty, baby-pink, lip-glossed lips in the latest issue of OK!, I was relieved that my favourite Spice, Baby, had had the foresight to arrange such a doppelg\u00e4nger for herself. But, on closer inspection, what were those big biceps doing there? And those dirty great tattoos ? Realisation dawned: it wasn't a stand-in for my beloved Baby, but Sporty! Bitch, stealing Baby's look! Serve her right if she was found throttled with Baby's favourite pink scrunchy. But, according to OK!, the transformation arose from necessity rather than spite. Poor Sporty had been forced to \"cast off her tomboy image of kung-fu kicks to an ultra-feminine new one\" after becoming \"the target of a lot of criticism after less-than-flattering pictures were published of her on holiday with her friend and personal assistant, Chai Ying Yau\". This is the same Ying Yau, trivia-hounds might recall, who recently shared a bed in Barbados with Sporty for a whole week, and who was widely mooted by the tabloids as the real Spice love interest. Denials came thick and fast from the Sporty camp, none of which was helped by the fact that a) with her money, such a move on grounds of economy cuts little ice; and b) Ying Yau's very name sounds like the sort of noise a girl might make after a lengthy bout of good cunnilingus. </p> <p>Personally, I've never thought that Sporty was gay. In my experience, only straight girls dare to look that butch. Your actual 21st-century lesbian tends to stagger about in strappy platform sandals, blind with mascara and dumb with lippy. People with an extreme interest in football often misread cultural signifiers, and a tracksuit and trainers no more make Sporty a dyke than a sarong and scanties make Becks a bender. </p> <p>What is fascinating isn't whether Sporty does or doesn't, but why she felt she had to go to the lengths of changing her image in order to shake off the rumours. The outing of Stephen Gately makes the Sporty make-over even stranger, for Boyzone are full-on heartthrobs, marketed to appeal to an almost exclusively female audience. It's a long time since the Spice Girls were marketed as pin-up girls for adolescent boys. Indeed, their appeal has always been primarily to very young girls. And George Michael and Elton John: coming out really ruined their careers, didn't it? </p> <p>But this new tolerance does not seem to extend to lesbians. The career of Ellen DeGeneres - and that of her girlfriend, actress Anne Heche, whom many studios now regard as a non-starter for romantic leads due to public knowledge of her lack of interest in men - remains a warning to all. In the UK, poor old Hufty from The Word was obviously a royal pain, but was she more so than Terry Christian, who is still hanging on in there? And, while Mandelson and Chris Smith strut about in robes of office, Angela Eagle MP is something less than a household name. This would be annoying and illogical under any circumstances, but in tandem with the current vogue for Thespian Lesbianism - lad-mag babes stripping off and cuddling up to each other for the delectation of the nation's onanists - it is downright nasty. Lesbianism, it seems, has become a party to which the world, especially the male half, must be invited if it is to be acceptable. When it is done for the satisfaction of the participants rather than for the viewers, it reverts to its former status of neighbourhood threat and moral evil. Oh, you and your girlfriend want to make love behind closed doors, do you? Bloody spoilsports! And, by the way, you're fired. There is no such Peeping Tom pressure on gay men - imagine how odd we would find it if magazines for young women routinely featured photographs of pretty boys in their underwear snogging. It's no accident that DeGeneres is only now making a comeback by stripping off for a TV sex scene with Sharon Stone. That's more like it: give the boys a thrill! </p> <p> Perhaps this is just a variation on my old riff of the modern habit of rewarding people who pretend to do a thing with far more approval and money than the people who actually do it (compare the money paid to doctors and nurses with the money paid to actors pretending to be doctors and nurses). But it is far more likely that, while it has always been socially acceptable for a man to make himself unavailable to women (which gay men do in extremis, and which straight men do in various ways all the time), it is still not acceptable for a woman to make herself unavailable to men, which is what lesbians, by their nature, do. One of the creepiest expressions of this double standard is the current vogue for films in which a sad straight woman clings to her gay male best friend. Imagine a rash of films in which a sad straight man pined after his lesbian best friend - it just wouldn't work, because, post-Bridget Jones, we are so used to the lie that women are inherently masochistic in emotional matters, and rejection by men their natural lot, that being with a man who doesn't want you is pretty much par for the course. The straight man/lesbian friend scenario would only ever be acceptable if, in the end, she renounced her sexuality and fell into his arms. </p> <p>In the very same copy of OK!, by the way, Julian Clary could be seen as the guest of honour at the Wills Bowls Club, Swindon, of which his parents are club captains this year. In a dark suit and discreet make-up, this campest of comics bathed in the smiles and approval of the club's elderly and, one might venture, conservative-with-a-small-c members. At a time when female members of golf clubs, most of them married, routinely receive sexually-oriented hate-mail accusing them of being \"dykes\" if they request the same access to their own club's greens as male golfers, this seemed a poignant reminder of how, even within the realms of \"deviancy\", men have the upper hand. Who can blame poor Sporty for dragging up?</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I was a chicklet, I liked nothing more of a shimmering 70s Saturday morning than to settle down with a copy of Judy or Bunty, and read comic strips about young gels of humble origin, who, due to their incredible resemblance to the deposed Princess of Tsaratanla, were plucked from the schoolroom and dressed in the finest silks and drippingest diamonds in order to thwart the dastardly efforts of a band of brigands who planned to snatch the princess and hold her for some huge ransom. That the subtext of these stories was quite filthy - the life of royalty obviously mattering much more than the life of a dirty commoner - never bothered me. I thought they were fab and, as a freckled, skinny, blonde child (I know - stop sniggering at the back), wondered whether I could one day be of similar use to my heroine, Hayley Mills. So, when I saw the photographs of the smiling blonde with the soft bob, long fringe and pouty, baby-pink, lip-glossed lips in the latest issue of OK!, I was relieved that my favourite Spice, Baby, had had the foresight to arrange such a doppelg\u00e4nger for herself. But, on closer inspection, what were those big biceps doing there? And those dirty great tattoos ? Realisation dawned: it wasn't a stand-in for my beloved Baby, but Sporty! Bitch, stealing Baby's look! Serve her right if she was found throttled with Baby's favourite pink scrunchy. But, according to OK!, the transformation arose from necessity rather than spite. Poor Sporty had been forced to \"cast off her tomboy image of kung-fu kicks to an ultra-feminine new one\" after becoming \"the target of a lot of criticism after less-than-flattering pictures were published of her on holiday with her friend and personal assistant, Chai Ying Yau\". This is the same Ying Yau, trivia-hounds might recall, who recently shared a bed in Barbados with Sporty for a whole week, and who was widely mooted by the tabloids as the real Spice love interest. Denials came thick and fast from the Sporty camp, none of which was helped by the fact that a) with her money, such a move on grounds of economy cuts little ice; and b) Ying Yau's very name sounds like the sort of noise a girl might make after a lengthy bout of good cunnilingus. Personally, I've never thought that Sporty was gay. In my experience, only straight girls dare to look that butch. Your actual 21st-century lesbian tends to stagger about in strappy platform sandals, blind with mascara and dumb with lippy. People with an extreme interest in football often misread cultural signifiers, and a tracksuit and trainers no more make Sporty a dyke than a sarong and scanties make Becks a bender. What is fascinating isn't whether Sporty does or doesn't, but why she felt she had to go to the lengths of changing her image in order to shake off the rumours. The outing of Stephen Gately makes the Sporty make-over even stranger, for Boyzone are full-on heartthrobs, marketed to appeal to an almost exclusively female audience. It's a long time since the Spice Girls were marketed as pin-up girls for adolescent boys. Indeed, their appeal has always been primarily to very young girls. And George Michael and Elton John: coming out really ruined their careers, didn't it? But this new tolerance does not seem to extend to lesbians. The career of Ellen DeGeneres - and that of her girlfriend, actress Anne Heche, whom many studios now regard as a non-starter for romantic leads due to public knowledge of her lack of interest in men - remains a warning to all. In the UK, poor old Hufty from The Word was obviously a royal pain, but was she more so than Terry Christian, who is still hanging on in there? And, while Mandelson and Chris Smith strut about in robes of office, Angela Eagle MP is something less than a household name. This would be annoying and illogical under any circumstances, but in tandem with the current vogue for Thespian Lesbianism - lad-mag babes stripping off and cuddling up to each other for the delectation of the nation's onanists - it is downright nasty. Lesbianism, it seems, has become a party to which the world, especially the male half, must be invited if it is to be acceptable. When it is done for the satisfaction of the participants rather than for the viewers, it reverts to its former status of neighbourhood threat and moral evil. Oh, you and your girlfriend want to make love behind closed doors, do you? Bloody spoilsports! And, by the way, you're fired. There is no such Peeping Tom pressure on gay men - imagine how odd we would find it if magazines for young women routinely featured photographs of pretty boys in their underwear snogging. It's no accident that DeGeneres is only now making a comeback by stripping off for a TV sex scene with Sharon Stone. That's more like it: give the boys a thrill! Perhaps this is just a variation on my old riff of the modern habit of rewarding people who pretend to do a thing with far more approval and money than the people who actually do it (compare the money paid to doctors and nurses with the money paid to actors pretending to be doctors and nurses). But it is far more likely that, while it has always been socially acceptable for a man to make himself unavailable to women (which gay men do in extremis, and which straight men do in various ways all the time), it is still not acceptable for a woman to make herself unavailable to men, which is what lesbians, by their nature, do. One of the creepiest expressions of this double standard is the current vogue for films in which a sad straight woman clings to her gay male best friend. Imagine a rash of films in which a sad straight man pined after his lesbian best friend - it just wouldn't work, because, post-Bridget Jones, we are so used to the lie that women are inherently masochistic in emotional matters, and rejection by men their natural lot, that being with a man who doesn't want you is pretty much par for the course. The straight man/lesbian friend scenario would only ever be acceptable if, in the end, she renounced her sexuality and fell into his arms. In the very same copy of OK!, by the way, Julian Clary could be seen as the guest of honour at the Wills Bowls Club, Swindon, of which his parents are club captains this year. In a dark suit and discreet make-up, this campest of comics bathed in the smiles and approval of the club's elderly and, one might venture, conservative-with-a-small-c members. At a time when female members of golf clubs, most of them married, routinely receive sexually-oriented hate-mail accusing them of being \"dykes\" if they request the same access to their own club's greens as male golfers, this seemed a poignant reminder of how, even within the realms of \"deviancy\", men have the upper hand. Who can blame poor Sporty for dragging up?",

      "trailText": "In the run up to summer, don't forget the spring, says Christopher Lloyd. Plan for May borders - and enjoy",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When I am in the middle of spring, I find the idea of a spring border very appealing. There are so many good ingredients that it would be good to get together. I do not think that spring flowerers should be allowed to dilute the impact of a garden's or border's principal season later on. By the same token, a border of spring flowers would inevitably contribute little in summer or autumn, and this too should be accepted.</p> <p>I would have it include some low shrubs, and a couple that are currently inspiring immediately come to mind. Coronilla valentina (0.3m) makes a low hummock (I like to plant two or three together, integrating an undulation of hummocks) and is so smothered with little clusters of bright yellow, sweetly scented pea flowers that scarcely any foliage is visible.</p> <p>Behind this, and in contrast, I would like a favourite rosemary, the fine-leaved one called 'Benenden Blue' (0.7m). It has a fairly spiky habit, making a series of spires, and is smothered for many weeks with rich blue flowers - the best in this respect of any rosemary. Like all of its kind, it tends to splay apart with age, but this can be regulated a little by tipping some of the longer shoots back after flowering.</p> <p>You might include a clump of a dozen or so white tulips around here - the lily-flowered 'White Triumphator' is elegant. Many spurges are spring-flowering. If I had to select just one for this border it would be the clump-forming Euphorbia polychroma 'Major' (0.3m), which flowers much more persistently than E. polychroma straight and makes a bold dome of yellow-green, flowering heads.</p> <p>This colour goes particularly well with scarlet and orange - Anemone fulgens (0.2m), say, or the scarlet lily-flowered tulip, 'Dyanito'. Another cooling-off flower is biennial white honesty (1m), Lunaria annua var. albiflora , which has quite a statuesque, broadly spire-like habit. It self-sows, which will keep you guessing where to expect it next year. So does Smyrnium perfoliatum (1m), which never fails to attract attention and, with its bright lime-greeny-yellow colouring is an ideal companion for the honesty. It takes time to establish a self-sowing colony of this, but once you have passed that stage it will be a question of rationing its spread.</p> <p>In my garden, the spring self-sower to beat all others is forget-me-not, myosotis.

      "bodyText": "When I am in the middle of spring, I find the idea of a spring border very appealing. There are so many good ingredients that it would be good to get together. I do not think that spring flowerers should be allowed to dilute the impact of a garden's or border's principal season later on. By the same token, a border of spring flowers would inevitably contribute little in summer or autumn, and this too should be accepted. I would have it include some low shrubs, and a couple that are currently inspiring immediately come to mind. Coronilla valentina (0.3m) makes a low hummock (I like to plant two or three together, integrating an undulation of hummocks) and is so smothered with little clusters of bright yellow, sweetly scented pea flowers that scarcely any foliage is visible. Behind this, and in contrast, I would like a favourite rosemary, the fine-leaved one called 'Benenden Blue' (0.7m). It has a fairly spiky habit, making a series of spires, and is smothered for many weeks with rich blue flowers - the best in this respect of any rosemary. Like all of its kind, it tends to splay apart with age, but this can be regulated a little by tipping some of the longer shoots back after flowering. You might include a clump of a dozen or so white tulips around here - the lily-flowered 'White Triumphator' is elegant. Many spurges are spring-flowering. If I had to select just one for this border it would be the clump-forming Euphorbia polychroma 'Major' (0.3m), which flowers much more persistently than E. polychroma straight and makes a bold dome of yellow-green, flowering heads. This colour goes particularly well with scarlet and orange - Anemone fulgens (0.2m), say, or the scarlet lily-flowered tulip, 'Dyanito'. Another cooling-off flower is biennial white honesty (1m), Lunaria annua var. albiflora , which has quite a statuesque, broadly spire-like habit. It self-sows, which will keep you guessing where to expect it next year. So does Smyrnium perfoliatum (1m), which never fails to attract attention and, with its bright lime-greeny-yellow colouring is an ideal companion for the honesty. It takes time to establish a self-sowing colony of this, but once you have passed that stage it will be a question of rationing its spread. In my garden, the spring self-sower to beat all others is forget-me-not, myosotis. We never allow these to become overcrowded or starved looking (Fergus is hot on the yearly application of surface mulches of either mushroom compost or, where its alkalinity would be unsuitable for lime-haters, finely ground and well-rotted bark, which is considerably more expensive). Where you have a lot of self-sowers in a border, there is a temptation to leave things alone, but that results not only in overcrowding but also in neglect of the soil's condition, which needs constant enrichment with organic matter.

A clump-former that you can divide after flowering (enriching the soil at the same time!), it has a long flowering season. It likes moisture and, given that, will take a lot of shade. One might grow with it one of the less gaudy polyanthus primroses. The laced kinds (which can be raised from seed) have great charm.

      "body": "<p>Think of a summer house, and what comes to mind? A cabin with verandah, say, popular among bourgeois families before the war? The pineapple building at Dunmore Park, one of hundreds of follies on Britain's grand country estates? A place to keep muddy boots and plant pots, where the children love to play? Or design by some of the nation's brightest and best?</p> <p>Which would you choose? English Heritage has gone for the latter, and for the next five months is hosting an exhibition of summer houses - or sitooteries, as they are being called - at Belsay Hall, Northumberland. The results, dotted around the grade 1-listed gardens and inside the main house, are impressive - as is the list of architects involved.</p> <p>Twelve designers - among them Julian Opie, Inflate, FAT [Fashion Architecture Taste] and Claudio Silvestrin - have each been given \u00a310,000 to build somewhere suggesting \"a place for quiet contemplation\". There is a municipal-style bus shelter (or is it a Greek temple or petrol station?) that glows in the gloom of its wooded location. On Belsay's lawns, there is a \"hairy house\" of 5,600 timber staves protruding from a wooden cube, like a massive hunk of cheese bristling with giant cocktail sticks. In the Quarry Garden, see the Rocky Love Seat and the Enclosed Plane, a sleek, stainless-steel structure that folds outs to reveal a canopy and deckchair. All the sitooteries are set in a space no bigger than 12 sq ft.</p> <p>Sitooteries, a Scottish term, distances the exhibition from preconceived ideas about summer houses - or pavilions, belvederes, gazebos . . . the list goes on. \"A colleague suggested the name, and I thought he was having me on,\" says Judith King, who curated the show with Mark Daniels. \"Sitooteries are a place to sit out in a dance, but also an alcove, a place of retreat.\"</p> <p>What might seem more of a joke is the location. Why stage such an event in a place with truly dodgy weather? During the week the structures were being put up, it poured non-stop. Surely the West Country would have been a better bet; or the South Downs, which somehow epitomise the British summer. If the climate is not all it could be, says King, the location cannot be faulted, however. The house, built in Greek revival style in 1837, has \"very severe architecture, so is perfect for showing contemporary works\".</p> <p>The gardens, designed in the craggy \"picturesque\" style, offer many backdrops for the sitooteries. FAT's romanesque church, with its shimmering metal discs and a Magritte-like cloud pattern, is fantastically incongruous in its woodland setting. A kitsch, artificial structure for an artificial landscape.</p> <p>Inflate's Bandstand is a 21st- century inflatable canopy attached to a concrete base with fibreglass hinges. Look up from inside, and a transparent lens in the orange plastic lets you view the sky.</p> <p>From this eccentric, other-worldly quality, it is an easy leap to the follies of the 18th and 19th centuries. Many seemed outrageously whimsical, but often found sensible use as ice houses, game larders, bridges even. Some had a serious point, deliberately bucking the particular fashion of the time or acting as a testing ground for new architectural ideas: the Gothic revival, say, came about through garden buildings. Similarly, Inflate's purpose was to experiment with new materials that, if successful, will feed into future work.</p> <p>Still, we should not be too hasty in making the link. On some estates in the 18th century, a visitor might stumble on a real-life hermit: a peasant paid to live rough and, presumably, give authenticity to the parkland's grottoes. A generous view is that such an encounter provoked thoughts about reclusiveness and contemplation. Less so, that it was a decadent forerunner to the modern-day garden gnome.</p> <p>There is another key difference. The dilettante attitudes that seem to prompt the aristocratic follies is absent from the sitooteries. Instead, they have arrived at a time when there are generally higher expectations of our domestic surroundings. There is talk of eventually selling the sitooteries, and whoever buys them will surely count leisure among their priorities. In our workaholic times, the fact that they have been given house (or, in this case, garden) room at all sounds a positive note. Now all any wannabe owner of a place for quiet contemplation need do is pray for some sunshine</p> <p>\u0095 The Sitooteries is at Belsay Hall, Northumberland until September 30.

The results, dotted around the grade 1-listed gardens and inside the main house, are impressive - as is the list of architects involved. Twelve designers - among them Julian Opie, Inflate, FAT [Fashion Architecture Taste] and Claudio Silvestrin - have each been given \u00a310,000 to build somewhere suggesting \"a place for quiet contemplation\". There is a municipal-style bus shelter (or is it a Greek temple or petrol station?) that glows in the gloom of its wooded location. On Belsay's lawns, there is a \"hairy house\" of 5,600 timber staves protruding from a wooden cube, like a massive hunk of cheese bristling with giant cocktail sticks. In the Quarry Garden, see the Rocky Love Seat and the Enclosed Plane, a sleek, stainless-steel structure that folds outs to reveal a canopy and deckchair. All the sitooteries are set in a space no bigger than 12 sq ft. Sitooteries, a Scottish term, distances the exhibition from preconceived ideas about summer houses - or pavilions, belvederes, gazebos . . . the list goes on. \"A colleague suggested the name, and I thought he was having me on,\" says Judith King, who curated the show with Mark Daniels. \"Sitooteries are a place to sit out in a dance, but also an alcove, a place of retreat.\" What might seem more of a joke is the location. Why stage such an event in a place with truly dodgy weather? During the week the structures were being put up, it poured non-stop. Surely the West Country would have been a better bet; or the South Downs, which somehow epitomise the British summer. If the climate is not all it could be, says King, the location cannot be faulted, however. The house, built in Greek revival style in 1837, has \"very severe architecture, so is perfect for showing contemporary works\". The gardens, designed in the craggy \"picturesque\" style, offer many backdrops for the sitooteries. FAT's romanesque church, with its shimmering metal discs and a Magritte-like cloud pattern, is fantastically incongruous in its woodland setting. A kitsch, artificial structure for an artificial landscape. Inflate's Bandstand is a 21st- century inflatable canopy attached to a concrete base with fibreglass hinges. Look up from inside, and a transparent lens in the orange plastic lets you view the sky. From this eccentric, other-worldly quality, it is an easy leap to the follies of the 18th and 19th centuries. Many seemed outrageously whimsical, but often found sensible use as ice houses, game larders, bridges even. Some had a serious point, deliberately bucking the particular fashion of the time or acting as a testing ground for new architectural ideas: the Gothic revival, say, came about through garden buildings. Similarly, Inflate's purpose was to experiment with new materials that, if successful, will feed into future work. Still, we should not be too hasty in making the link. On some estates in the 18th century, a visitor might stumble on a real-life hermit: a peasant paid to live rough and, presumably, give authenticity to the parkland's grottoes. A generous view is that such an encounter provoked thoughts about reclusiveness and contemplation. Less so, that it was a decadent forerunner to the modern-day garden gnome. There is another key difference. The dilettante attitudes that seem to prompt the aristocratic follies is absent from the sitooteries. Instead, they have arrived at a time when there are generally higher expectations of our domestic surroundings. There is talk of eventually selling the sitooteries, and whoever buys them will surely count leisure among their priorities. In our workaholic times, the fact that they have been given house (or, in this case, garden) room at all sounds a positive note. Now all any wannabe owner of a place for quiet contemplation need do is pray for some sunshine \u0095 The Sitooteries is at Belsay Hall, Northumberland until September 30. Details on: 01661 881636.",

      "body": "<p>The holy well is a complete surprise. Magical, astonishing - like suddenly finding your own name inscribed on a monument you have never visited. Neither of us had the least idea that it would be here until we almost fell headfirst into it. Which goes to show that those Edwardians in their galoshes and charabancs were absolutely right. There's more to this game than holding rulers to maps. You have to get out and walk.</p> <p>Lionel Stanbrook needs no persuading. See him trudge the Sussex downs with kids and dogs and weekend wellies, and you see a happy man. Happy to soak up his beloved English landscape. Happier still to let the stresses and strains of the advertising business blow to the four winds.</p> <p>Not that we are in Sussex today, for Lionel has brought me to Herefordshire, the mysterious border county strewn with the hummocks and humps and stumps of wayside crosses that speak of human habitation over countless millennia. And nor are we here for an idle stroll, but rather to ramble with purpose. For Lionel senses a pattern among these apparently random landscape features, and he wants me to be there when he runs it to ground.</p> <p>See that stone in the meadow, he tells me, and with your eye track a roadway from the Iron Age fort. And now from the wall that skirts this Lord's half acre, see a second church beyond and, in alignment behind it, another. A path once passed this way, he says, ascending perhaps to the ridge of that hill. And a break in the hedge betrays the ghost of another, do you think? But not even he can be sure.</p> <p>It is the third church in the line that catches us unawares. We are startled by a woman priest who appears without warning, but more so by what she says to us. \"Have you seen our well?\" she asks, then ushers us into a carpeted room that opens off the nave. A wooden lid covers the narrow shaft, and she raises it to show us the water below. \"It is St Ethelbert's well,\" she says. \"But its origins are pre-Christian.\"</p> <p>As she talks about Offa, of Mercia and the Marches, it becomes apparent that Lionel and I have each taken the same vow of silence. We will ask the priest about the well, take a leaflet, drop loud coins into the box. But as to its peculiar significance for us this afternoon, not a word will we breathe. \"A ley line?\" she would say. \"You're looking for a ley line? Silly boys.\"</p> <p>She might not, of course. Everyone's heard of ley lines these days. And, while they might not know what one is, they're more than happy to accept that such things exist.</p> <p>\"Ley lines may hold key to sick building,\" said a newspaper headline recently. Quite matter-of-fact, it was. Armed with copper \"dowsing rods\", an expert had inspected a council building whose occupants had suffered an unusually high incidence of illness. It was, said the dowser, the worst case of \"negative earth energy lines, or ley lines\", running through a building that he had ever come across. \"If they are negative or 'black' lines,\" he explained, \"they drain a person's energy, leading to illness.\" While the dowser recovered from his ordeal, the council was \"evaluating\" his report. \"We cannot dismiss this man's findings out of hand,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>The existence of ley lines seemed not to be in question - only whether they were to blame in this particular case. As I read the story, I couldn't help wondering how a mere pipedream, conjured out of the air one summer's day less than three years after the Great War, had survived beyond the end of the most technological of centuries. One thing was certain: the dreamer would be hard-pressed to recognise his progeny. He might even have trouble recognising himself.</p> <p>Alfred Watkins, an American magazine article proclaimed recently, was \"a British mystic\" who discovered the earth's \"energy bands\" in the 20s. A more accurate description would have been: a pillar of county town society, businessman, local councillor and inventor of the photographic light meter. Watkins was born in 1855 into a well-to-do Herefordshire farming family. His father had brewing, hotel and milling interests, and Alfred developed a popular brown loaf, which he called the Vagos, the Roman name for the River Wye. His daytime job of visiting the brewery's clients meant that he had a detailed knowledge of the Welsh border country. And when not working for the brewery, he took photographs - especially landscape photographs - with a simple camera that he'd made out of a cigar box.</p> <p>Watkins was a pioneering photographer, and wrote a number of popular manuals on the subject. He was also a businessman, a beekeeper, an archaeologist, a naturalist and an antiquarian. Somehow, this solid, practical, family man even found time to serve on the local council and to campaign for the Liberal cause (he organised a series of impressive lantern-slide lectures). And then came the ley lines.</p> <p>On the last day of June 1921, Watkins visited a friend in Blackwardine, near Leominster, and like any self-respecting antiquarian, he scanned the locality for features of interest. Suddenly, it struck him that a number of these features appeared to form a straight line. When he took a ruler to his map, it was indeed true. In fact, all across the countryside, churches and standing stones, crossroads and burial mounds, moats and beacon hills, holy wells and old stone crosses, fell into perfect alignment. It was, as he described it later, a moment of revelation.</p> <p>Watkins attributed neither mystical nor electrical properties to these alignments. Rather, he felt certain that they were the visible remains of a prehistoric system of tracks or trading routes, and he was to devote the last 14 years of his life to refining this theory. Characteristically, he used a slide show to tell the world about his discovery, and in 1922 he worked it up into a book called Early British Trackways. Then, in 1925, came the publication on which his fame now rests. More popular even than the Watkins photographic manuals, The Old Straight Track remains in print to this day. And deservedly so. For nobody who loves the countryside, and who also has a taste for mystery and history, can fail to be charmed by this book.</p> <p>Watkins argued that, long before the Romans built their paved military roads, the inhabitants of Britain were aware that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and accordingly set about surveying a system of unsurfaced paths that enabled them to travel efficiently about the country. These routes, he reckoned, were set out visually - by lighting beacons on high points, for example - and then lining up markers across the intervening land. Once surveyed, the paths would have been indicated at key points with boulders, or with mounds or clumps of trees, or with notches cut into prominent ridges or with ponds whose water, reflecting the light of the sky, would be visible for miles.</p> <p>And now we come to the beautiful part of the argument. For Watkins maintained that, although these insubstantial trackways had been lost over countless centuries, many of their mark points survive, handed down to us in the guise of all those features that first caught his antiquarian's eye on the Ordnance Survey map. For the original intersections and way-marks gradually became meeting places and markets. Long after their original purpose was forgotten, individual marker stones acquired local significance, becoming obvious sites for burial mounds or for pagan temples, many of which were subsequently converted into Christian churches.</p> <p>Thus it is, says The Old Straight Track, that features that may have been constructed thousands of years apart - a late medieval church, say, and a Bronze Age long barrow - can be linked into a common system of alignments, which, in turn, could be seen to pivot on fixed points such as hilltops.</p> <p>Throughout the book, it is the details that charm and entice the reader. For once Watkins got the bit between his teeth, he didn't rest until he had almost chewed through it. His choice of the word \"ley\" is explained in great detail, deriving from a word that means a clearing, pasture or field. And from \"ley\" he moves on to other words associated with the straight tracks, with the people who made them and with the goods that were carried along them, and argues that echoes of these words may be detected today in our common place names. A farm called Hillend, for instance, suggests the end of a track sighted on a hill point, and any number of Bradleys, Bradlows, Broadways and Bredenburys are called upon to give evidence of \"broad tracks\". Surmising that the surveyors of old must have been a special class of men with names denoting their rank and occupation, Watkins dwells at length on the frequent recurrence of the elements \"col\", \"cole\" and \"cold\" in English place names. King Cole, he concludes, was a surveyor-in-chief, probably responsible for firing up those hilltop beacons. The most memorable - and fanciful - of these philological ramblings concerns the Dodman.</p> <p>Now \"Dod\" and its derivatives, says Watkins, are found everywhere: in Doddingtree, Dodderhill, Dodesley and Doddington - even, if you look hard enough, in Deadman's Acre and Deadman's Hole. Which leads him to conclude that the ancient surveyor who, in time-honoured fashion, sighted straight lines with the aid of two wooden staves, was known as the Dod-man. Why? Well, says Watkins, \"there is an old name for a snail, quoted by Dickens in David Copperfield. 'I am a regular Dodman, I am,' said Mr Peggotty, by which he meant snail.\" Watkins describes how the link came to him. \"The sight of a snail out for a walk one warm, moist morning solved the problem,\" he says. \"He carries on his head the dod-man's implements, the two sighting staves.\"</p> <p>How did the starched world of the 20s react to all this talk of snails and tracks and sighting ponds? By and large, the archaeological establishment was dismissive. Until the 60s - when Professor Alexander Thom made detailed measurements of stone circles, from which he concluded that prehistoric societies had considerable knowledge of mathematics, geometry and astronomy - it was considered that the ancient Britons were a primitive bunch, incapable of the surveying feats for which The Old Straight Track gave them credit.</p> <p>But among amateurs, Watkins's theories were warmly received. The Old Straight Track Club was set up (Watkins was president), and also The Straight Track Postal Portfolio Club, a sort of lugubrious precursor of the internet, whose 40 members circulated news of local discoveries with the aid of gummed stickers, postcards and printed notepaper. In 1927, Watkins published The Ley Hunter's Manual, setting out the \"rules\" of the game (only alignments of four or more points were considered significant; verification, preferably by walking a line, was essential, and so on).</p> <p>Whatever the establishment thought (and there were a few professional archaeologists in The Old Straight Track Club), lay-people were eager to become ley people. After all, anybody could do it, weather permitting. All it took was a map, a ruler and a reasonably sharp pencil, a pair of serviceable walking shoes and a free Sunday. What better way to have an open-air adventure? What better excuse for a country ramble? What happier way to discover the real truth about our past? The long summer of ley hunting endured until 1939. And then another world war, even more bloody than the first, made the present seem suddenly more pressing than the past.</p> <p>Lionel is in his London office, a gruelling train ride away from the hills and meadows of his weekend rambles. But his commitment to the true cause of ley-hunting shines as brightly as it did on the day we stumbled together upon St Ethelbert's Well. \"What we have to do,\" he says, \"is drag the subject back from the excesses of intellectual hippydom. Frankly, I'm pissed off with the way it's been marginalised for so many years. The whole topic of ley lines has become like a less interesting edition of The X-Files.\"</p> <p>He is talking about the copper rods - the rods and the crystals and the positive and negative energy and the whole baggage of electro-magnetic mumbo jumbo that somehow attached itself to The Old Straight Track, so that it now tints the glass through which all but the purest purist views the original thesis. Where did it come from, all this mystical paraphernalia?</p> <p>After 20 years of silence, it was a squadron of UFOs that flew to the rescue of Watkins's forgotten ley lines, although today, Lionel Stanbrook is not alone in believing that these extra-terrestrials did the cause of The Old Straight Track nothing but harm. In the late 50s, Aim\u00e9 Michel plotted French UFO sightings on a map and claimed (his findings were later dismissed by \"ufologists\") that many fell in straight lines. In 1961, Michel's observations were combined with English ley-line theory in a book called Skyways And Landmarks. Its author, ex-RAF pilot Tony Wedd, argued that, if UFOs were flying along leys, it must be because the lines were useful as navigation aids. Was this a visual thing, or were the spacecraft picking up on some sort of magnetism? And if the latter, then were ley lines not trading routes, after all, but some form of electrical energy? It was like a Saturn rocket, and it propelled the entire subject out of the post-Edwardian world of galoshes and charabancs and rural rambles, straight into the Age of Aquarius. In 1962, the Ley Hunters Club was set up by a bunch of flying-saucer spotters, and before long the movement had its own magazine, The Ley Hunter.</p> <p>Across the great divide, in the world of orthodox archaeology, things were moving, too. In one of those general revisions of time-scales that ancient history undergoes periodically, it was decided that western European monuments such as Stonehenge were older than had been imagined, and therefore had been built independently of eastern civilisations, by people who were clearly more advanced than had been supposed. Add to this the claims by Alexander Thom and others that some megalithic monuments in Britain and France were aligned to objects visible in the night sky, and it was only a matter of time before the term \"golden age\" was heard in the land.</p> <p>And what an age it was. Many and varied were the powers attributed to the nature-loving inhabitants of neolithic Britain by those whose imaginations were fuelled by a little learning and a great deal of disillusionment with modern times. The ancients, it was said - indeed, still is said in some quarters - were able to sense the presence of ley lines, redirect them, intensify them, store them and, ultimately, harness their power. All this they achieved with their cunningly-placed mounds and stones. And once they had the earth's power at their disposal, they used it to achieve such wonders as multiple harvests, heightened mental states, levitation (of those 40-ton megaliths, for example) and inter-planetary travel. All of which made the despised 20th century seem a pretty grubby place.</p> <p>Throughout the 60s and 70s, ley-line theory was to mutate and bifurcate, to bend with every passing fad, so that it frequently seemed as though its only purpose was to highlight the failings of our own times. And with each twist and turn, it became ever more firmly enmeshed in a thicket of mysticism, neo-paganism and plain superstition. By 1983, the entire edifice seemed ripe for demolition. And what better way to demolish a structure than by blasting away its foundations?</p> <p>I still treasure my copy of The Old Straight Track. My father bought it for me, and wrote in the front: \"To David with love, Christmas 1979.\" For some years, Watkins was to inform my every excursion into the countryside. I would slow down on passing gaps in ancient field walls. I would keep an eye open for old milestones and I would linger over fords. Then, one day, I stumbled on a book by two young academics, and the spell was broken.</p> <p>Ley Lines In Question is out of print. But its joint authors, Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, are still very much together - \"We are the first couple with PhDs from Jesus College, Cambridge, ever to have offspring\". I track down Williamson at the University of East Anglia, where he teaches and studies the development of the landscape, and ask him to describe how he and his future wife satisfied themselves - and me - that Watkins was wrong. \"Good God!\" he says. \"It all comes flooding back. All those wasted afternoons.\"</p> <p>What the couple did was take head-on the basic premise that a collection of ancient sites fall in straight lines more often than chance would predict. \"The evidence for this is supposed to be that a number of dots randomly spread across a bit of paper the size of an Ordnance Survey map line up less often than the same number of ancient sites on the map,\" says Williamson. \"And that is true. I will admit it. However, it is an unfair comparison for two reasons.</p> <p>\"The first is that an awful lot of the things used as mark points on ley lines are not dots. Maiden Castle, for example, isn't a dot. It's a large area. And the more you increase the size, the more its alignability increases. The second thing, which is more subtle, is that the ancient sites are not randomly distributed across the map. They are patterned and structured as the result of very complicated processes. For example, you tend to get clusters of round barrows along chalk escarpments, in part because there always were more on those light soils, but in part because they have been destroyed more in other places by farming. River valleys are roughly linear and they may have villages strung along them, like beads on a thread. So the churches within the villages will already be approximating more to a straight line than you would expect by chance. And so on.</p> <p>\"Now, it's impossible to simulate those structuring principles because they are so complex. So we did something quite easy, if excruciatingly boring. We took the map for the land around Avebury and went through every single ley marker and connected it up to every single other ley marker until the map was covered in lines, and we kept a score of the number of points there were in each alignment.\" He digs out a copy of his old book and turns up the results. \"They were quite impressive. We found 130 alignments of six points, 44 of seven, 14 of eight and five of nine.\"</p> <p>It seemed to endorse Alfred Watkins's original proposition. But then the pair repeated the exercise, only with one crucial difference. This time, they randomised the positions of each of the features within each grid square on the map - just drew it in where the fancy took them, while keeping it within roughly the same area. This meant that the broad distribution of points across the entire map still mirrored reality, but the relationship between any one point and any of the others was now arbitrary.</p> <p>\"We then went through the whole bloody palaver again, and found 127 six-point alignments, 48 of seven, 12 of eight, and six of nine. In other words, the score on the simulated, randomised map was slightly better than on the original. That doesn't in itself disprove the existence of ley lines. But it disproves the original proposition that if you simply take old stuff on Ordnance Survey maps, it falls into alignment more than chance would predict. It doesn't.\"</p> <p>Having exposed the statistical fallacy at the heart of ley-line theory, Williamson and Bellamy went on to pre-empt the most likely response - namely that ley lines would originally have been clear in the landscape, but a lot of the marker points have been destroyed. They took a map of south Cambridgeshire, an area which Watkins himself had studied in detail, and drew on it all the alignments he had recorded, plus a few he had missed.</p> <p>\"Then we went to the Cambridge aerial photography library and plotted on the map the positions of all the ring ditches, which are little circular crop marks left by ploughed-out round barrows. These can't be seen from the ground. So, in ley-hunters' terms, we were recovering lots of mark points that had been lost. One would assume that if the lines drawn by Watkins and others were in any sense real and meaningful, then a significant proportion of these rediscovered points would plot neatly on to the lines. But none did. Not one.\"</p> <p>The pair have long since turned their backs on ley lines. \"After the book came out, I had a sense of knocking my head against a brick wall,\" says Williamson. \"Archaeologists weren't particularly interested, and ley-line people were hostile.\" But while they clearly failed to stop Watkins in his tracks, so to speak, the thorough mauling to which they subjected his theories may have had a sobering effect on the more sophisticated among his latterday followers. As I prepare to leave, the retired ley-buster has a wicked smile on his face. \"So tell me the latest news,\" Williamson says. \"Are ley lines still straight?\"</p> <p>In later years, even Alfred Watkins was beginning to bend. While his belief in the existence of definite lines in the landscape remained firm, he was increasingly prepared to accept that, in some instances - where two leys ran close together, for instance - his trade-route theory made little sense. But if not ancient paths, then what?</p> <p>Agroup of large cardboard boxes, each with a sturdy lid containing three air holes, has been taken out of storage by staff at Hereford library, and Lionel Stanbrook is poring over their contents. With him are Danny Sullivan, an architect and former editor of The Ley Hunter journal, and Danny's wife, Jo. They have been coming here for weeks, sifting through the buff envelopes and \"Snap\" files (\"Quality No 1\") that contain the annals of The Straight Track Postal Portfolio Club, and every session brings new fresh insights into the minds of the early ley-hunters.</p> <p>Among the quaint reports of \"lantern lectures\", of summer outings (\"bring a field glass\") and of open-air rallies at which men in plus-fours would enlist the help of entire scout troups, there is evidence that the early ley-hunters, in Sullivan's words, \"excelled themselves with lateral thinking\".</p> <p>One correspondent, for instance, notes that in Korea the twisting and turning of native roads is explained by the belief that evil spirits travel only in straight lines. Watkins himself responds to this observation, suggesting that Christian churches in the British Isles might have been built on straight lines precisely in order to block the passage of evil. Briefly, it seems, religion and the rituals associated with death were seen as possible alternative explanations for leys.</p> <p>Seventy years later, this possibility was taken up by Paul Devereux and Nigel Pennick in their 1989 book, Lines On The Landscape. Pulling in evidence from around the world, Devereux was subsequently to lay the foundations for an entirely new approach to ley-hunting - an approach that Danny Sullivan now believes is more feasible than anything proposed by Watkins, and sufficiently rooted in fact to sidestep even the fundamental objections raised by the Williamsons.</p> <p>\"The Ley Lines In Question argument is a bit old hat these days,\" he says. \"Most of it I would tend to agree with. Back in those days, the whole thing was quite easy to deal with because it was conducted on a very amateurish basis. But what Paul Devereux's work has done is drag the subject out of that backwater of stupidity and into a far more interesting arena. We are talking to archaeologists and anthropologists now, and considering ways in which human consciousness itself relates to landscape.\"</p> <p>There is, says Sullivan, no single phenomenon that is a ley. \"There are lots of different things - old tracks, alignments between sites, astronomical alignments, and so on - which could all come under the ley lines umbrella. Watkins, at the end, was saying that there were different classes of alignments. What was he really seeing?\"</p> <p>The more convincing alignments, Sullivan believes, were probably corpse ways or funeral paths. These designated paths by which the dead were carried to their place of burial have been documented all over Europe, frequently showing up on medieval maps and sometimes surviving into this century in the form of local folklore. Some were deliberately crooked - in order, perhaps, that the spirit of the deceased might not return to haunt the living. But others were straight, and clearly sighted on the towers of churches.</p> <p>\"In China,\" says Sullivan, \"evil spirits were thought to travel in straight lines, so the route had to be blocked with a wall containing a charm. In Ireland, 'fairy passes' ran between places of ancient sanctity. In Bolivia, straight lines run from hilltops, where spirits were thought to live, directly into towns and churches. In South America and the south-west US, where these things are still on the ground, they conform uncannily to Watkins's original ideas. Yet they are on another continent and belong to a completely different culture, which suggests that there's something going on that is universal.\"</p> <p>The common thread, it seems, is the widespread belief that spirits, ghosts and fairies all travel in straight lines - a notion that Devereux thinks might derive from the sensations experienced in all places and at all times by humans in those altered states of consciousness known to be induced by shamanic rituals or the use of hallucinogens.</p> <p>Shamanism? Hallucinogens? At first glance, it's a far cry from the stiff-collared, sepia world of Alfred Watkins. And yet there's another common thread running through all of this - a thread that links the first ley-hunters with their most modern counterparts. I refer not to any out-of-body experience, but to the simple out-of-car experience that Lionel Stanbrook describes.</p> <p>\"It can be left to a coterie of hardened intellectuals to discuss the whys and wherefores of shamanism or whatever,\" he says. \"But for me, it's about getting people off the sofa and into the open air. It's about being excited by our own heritage and about climbing to the tops of hills and admiring the view with a sense of adventure and of mystery and imagination.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Ley Lines - A Comprehensive Guide To Alignments, by Danny Sullivan, is published by Piatkus Books, priced \u00a316.99.

Neither of us had the least idea that it would be here until we almost fell headfirst into it. Which goes to show that those Edwardians in their galoshes and charabancs were absolutely right. There's more to this game than holding rulers to maps. You have to get out and walk. Lionel Stanbrook needs no persuading. See him trudge the Sussex downs with kids and dogs and weekend wellies, and you see a happy man. Happy to soak up his beloved English landscape. Happier still to let the stresses and strains of the advertising business blow to the four winds. Not that we are in Sussex today, for Lionel has brought me to Herefordshire, the mysterious border county strewn with the hummocks and humps and stumps of wayside crosses that speak of human habitation over countless millennia. And nor are we here for an idle stroll, but rather to ramble with purpose. For Lionel senses a pattern among these apparently random landscape features, and he wants me to be there when he runs it to ground. See that stone in the meadow, he tells me, and with your eye track a roadway from the Iron Age fort. And now from the wall that skirts this Lord's half acre, see a second church beyond and, in alignment behind it, another. A path once passed this way, he says, ascending perhaps to the ridge of that hill. And a break in the hedge betrays the ghost of another, do you think? But not even he can be sure. It is the third church in the line that catches us unawares. We are startled by a woman priest who appears without warning, but more so by what she says to us. \"Have you seen our well?\" she asks, then ushers us into a carpeted room that opens off the nave. A wooden lid covers the narrow shaft, and she raises it to show us the water below. \"It is St Ethelbert's well,\" she says. \"But its origins are pre-Christian.\" As she talks about Offa, of Mercia and the Marches, it becomes apparent that Lionel and I have each taken the same vow of silence. We will ask the priest about the well, take a leaflet, drop loud coins into the box. But as to its peculiar significance for us this afternoon, not a word will we breathe. \"A ley line?\" she would say. \"You're looking for a ley line? Silly boys.\" She might not, of course. Everyone's heard of ley lines these days. And, while they might not know what one is, they're more than happy to accept that such things exist. \"Ley lines may hold key to sick building,\" said a newspaper headline recently. Quite matter-of-fact, it was. Armed with copper \"dowsing rods\", an expert had inspected a council building whose occupants had suffered an unusually high incidence of illness. It was, said the dowser, the worst case of \"negative earth energy lines, or ley lines\", running through a building that he had ever come across. \"If they are negative or 'black' lines,\" he explained, \"they drain a person's energy, leading to illness.\" While the dowser recovered from his ordeal, the council was \"evaluating\" his report. \"We cannot dismiss this man's findings out of hand,\" said a spokesman. The existence of ley lines seemed not to be in question - only whether they were to blame in this particular case. As I read the story, I couldn't help wondering how a mere pipedream, conjured out of the air one summer's day less than three years after the Great War, had survived beyond the end of the most technological of centuries. One thing was certain: the dreamer would be hard-pressed to recognise his progeny. He might even have trouble recognising himself. Alfred Watkins, an American magazine article proclaimed recently, was \"a British mystic\" who discovered the earth's \"energy bands\" in the 20s. A more accurate description would have been: a pillar of county town society, businessman, local councillor and inventor of the photographic light meter. Watkins was born in 1855 into a well-to-do Herefordshire farming family. His father had brewing, hotel and milling interests, and Alfred developed a popular brown loaf, which he called the Vagos, the Roman name for the River Wye. His daytime job of visiting the brewery's clients meant that he had a detailed knowledge of the Welsh border country. And when not working for the brewery, he took photographs - especially landscape photographs - with a simple camera that he'd made out of a cigar box. Watkins was a pioneering photographer, and wrote a number of popular manuals on the subject. He was also a businessman, a beekeeper, an archaeologist, a naturalist and an antiquarian. Somehow, this solid, practical, family man even found time to serve on the local council and to campaign for the Liberal cause (he organised a series of impressive lantern-slide lectures). And then came the ley lines. On the last day of June 1921, Watkins visited a friend in Blackwardine, near Leominster, and like any self-respecting antiquarian, he scanned the locality for features of interest. Suddenly, it struck him that a number of these features appeared to form a straight line. When he took a ruler to his map, it was indeed true. In fact, all across the countryside, churches and standing stones, crossroads and burial mounds, moats and beacon hills, holy wells and old stone crosses, fell into perfect alignment. It was, as he described it later, a moment of revelation. Watkins attributed neither mystical nor electrical properties to these alignments. Rather, he felt certain that they were the visible remains of a prehistoric system of tracks or trading routes, and he was to devote the last 14 years of his life to refining this theory. Characteristically, he used a slide show to tell the world about his discovery, and in 1922 he worked it up into a book called Early British Trackways. Then, in 1925, came the publication on which his fame now rests. More popular even than the Watkins photographic manuals, The Old Straight Track remains in print to this day. And deservedly so. For nobody who loves the countryside, and who also has a taste for mystery and history, can fail to be charmed by this book. Watkins argued that, long before the Romans built their paved military roads, the inhabitants of Britain were aware that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and accordingly set about surveying a system of unsurfaced paths that enabled them to travel efficiently about the country. These routes, he reckoned, were set out visually - by lighting beacons on high points, for example - and then lining up markers across the intervening land. Once surveyed, the paths would have been indicated at key points with boulders, or with mounds or clumps of trees, or with notches cut into prominent ridges or with ponds whose water, reflecting the light of the sky, would be visible for miles. And now we come to the beautiful part of the argument. For Watkins maintained that, although these insubstantial trackways had been lost over countless centuries, many of their mark points survive, handed down to us in the guise of all those features that first caught his antiquarian's eye on the Ordnance Survey map. For the original intersections and way-marks gradually became meeting places and markets. Long after their original purpose was forgotten, individual marker stones acquired local significance, becoming obvious sites for burial mounds or for pagan temples, many of which were subsequently converted into Christian churches. Thus it is, says The Old Straight Track, that features that may have been constructed thousands of years apart - a late medieval church, say, and a Bronze Age long barrow - can be linked into a common system of alignments, which, in turn, could be seen to pivot on fixed points such as hilltops. Throughout the book, it is the details that charm and entice the reader. For once Watkins got the bit between his teeth, he didn't rest until he had almost chewed through it. His choice of the word \"ley\" is explained in great detail, deriving from a word that means a clearing, pasture or field. And from \"ley\" he moves on to other words associated with the straight tracks, with the people who made them and with the goods that were carried along them, and argues that echoes of these words may be detected today in our common place names. A farm called Hillend, for instance, suggests the end of a track sighted on a hill point, and any number of Bradleys, Bradlows, Broadways and Bredenburys are called upon to give evidence of \"broad tracks\". Surmising that the surveyors of old must have been a special class of men with names denoting their rank and occupation, Watkins dwells at length on the frequent recurrence of the elements \"col\", \"cole\" and \"cold\" in English place names. King Cole, he concludes, was a surveyor-in-chief, probably responsible for firing up those hilltop beacons. The most memorable - and fanciful - of these philological ramblings concerns the Dodman. Now \"Dod\" and its derivatives, says Watkins, are found everywhere: in Doddingtree, Dodderhill, Dodesley and Doddington - even, if you look hard enough, in Deadman's Acre and Deadman's Hole. Which leads him to conclude that the ancient surveyor who, in time-honoured fashion, sighted straight lines with the aid of two wooden staves, was known as the Dod-man. Why? Well, says Watkins, \"there is an old name for a snail, quoted by Dickens in David Copperfield. 'I am a regular Dodman, I am,' said Mr Peggotty, by which he meant snail.\" Watkins describes how the link came to him. \"The sight of a snail out for a walk one warm, moist morning solved the problem,\" he says. \"He carries on his head the dod-man's implements, the two sighting staves.\" How did the starched world of the 20s react to all this talk of snails and tracks and sighting ponds? By and large, the archaeological establishment was dismissive. Until the 60s - when Professor Alexander Thom made detailed measurements of stone circles, from which he concluded that prehistoric societies had considerable knowledge of mathematics, geometry and astronomy - it was considered that the ancient Britons were a primitive bunch, incapable of the surveying feats for which The Old Straight Track gave them credit. But among amateurs, Watkins's theories were warmly received. The Old Straight Track Club was set up (Watkins was president), and also The Straight Track Postal Portfolio Club, a sort of lugubrious precursor of the internet, whose 40 members circulated news of local discoveries with the aid of gummed stickers, postcards and printed notepaper. In 1927, Watkins published The Ley Hunter's Manual, setting out the \"rules\" of the game (only alignments of four or more points were considered significant; verification, preferably by walking a line, was essential, and so on). Whatever the establishment thought (and there were a few professional archaeologists in The Old Straight Track Club), lay-people were eager to become ley people. After all, anybody could do it, weather permitting. All it took was a map, a ruler and a reasonably sharp pencil, a pair of serviceable walking shoes and a free Sunday. What better way to have an open-air adventure? What better excuse for a country ramble? What happier way to discover the real truth about our past? The long summer of ley hunting endured until 1939. And then another world war, even more bloody than the first, made the present seem suddenly more pressing than the past. Lionel is in his London office, a gruelling train ride away from the hills and meadows of his weekend rambles. But his commitment to the true cause of ley-hunting shines as brightly as it did on the day we stumbled together upon St Ethelbert's Well. \"What we have to do,\" he says, \"is drag the subject back from the excesses of intellectual hippydom.

Where did it come from, all this mystical paraphernalia? After 20 years of silence, it was a squadron of UFOs that flew to the rescue of Watkins's forgotten ley lines, although today, Lionel Stanbrook is not alone in believing that these extra-terrestrials did the cause of The Old Straight Track nothing but harm.

It was like a Saturn rocket, and it propelled the entire subject out of the post-Edwardian world of galoshes and charabancs and rural rambles, straight into the Age of Aquarius.

I would slow down on passing gaps in ancient field walls. I would keep an eye open for old milestones and I would linger over fords. Then, one day, I stumbled on a book by two young academics, and the spell was broken. Ley Lines In Question is out of print. But its joint authors, Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, are still very much together - \"We are the first couple with PhDs from Jesus College, Cambridge, ever to have offspring\". I track down Williamson at the University of East Anglia, where he teaches and studies the development of the landscape, and ask him to describe how he and his future wife satisfied themselves - and me - that Watkins was wrong. \"Good God!\" he says. \"It all comes flooding back. All those wasted afternoons.\" What the couple did was take head-on the basic premise that a collection of ancient sites fall in straight lines more often than chance would predict. \"The evidence for this is supposed to be that a number of dots randomly spread across a bit of paper the size of an Ordnance Survey map line up less often than the same number of ancient sites on the map,\" says Williamson. \"And that is true. I will admit it. However, it is an unfair comparison for two reasons. \"The first is that an awful lot of the things used as mark points on ley lines are not dots. Maiden Castle, for example, isn't a dot. It's a large area. And the more you increase the size, the more its alignability increases. The second thing, which is more subtle, is that the ancient sites are not randomly distributed across the map. They are patterned and structured as the result of very complicated processes. For example, you tend to get clusters of round barrows along chalk escarpments, in part because there always were more on those light soils, but in part because they have been destroyed more in other places by farming. River valleys are roughly linear and they may have villages strung along them, like beads on a thread. So the churches within the villages will already be approximating more to a straight line than you would expect by chance. And so on. \"Now, it's impossible to simulate those structuring principles because they are so complex. So we did something quite easy, if excruciatingly boring. We took the map for the land around Avebury and went through every single ley marker and connected it up to every single other ley marker until the map was covered in lines, and we kept a score of the number of points there were in each alignment.\" He digs out a copy of his old book and turns up the results. \"They were quite impressive. We found 130 alignments of six points, 44 of seven, 14 of eight and five of nine.\" It seemed to endorse Alfred Watkins's original proposition. But then the pair repeated the exercise, only with one crucial difference. This time, they randomised the positions of each of the features within each grid square on the map - just drew it in where the fancy took them, while keeping it within roughly the same area. This meant that the broad distribution of points across the entire map still mirrored reality, but the relationship between any one point and any of the others was now arbitrary. \"We then went through the whole bloody palaver again, and found 127 six-point alignments, 48 of seven, 12 of eight, and six of nine. In other words, the score on the simulated, randomised map was slightly better than on the original. That doesn't in itself disprove the existence of ley lines. But it disproves the original proposition that if you simply take old stuff on Ordnance Survey maps, it falls into alignment more than chance would predict. It doesn't.\" Having exposed the statistical fallacy at the heart of ley-line theory, Williamson and Bellamy went on to pre-empt the most likely response - namely that ley lines would originally have been clear in the landscape, but a lot of the marker points have been destroyed. They took a map of south Cambridgeshire, an area which Watkins himself had studied in detail, and drew on it all the alignments he had recorded, plus a few he had missed. \"Then we went to the Cambridge aerial photography library and plotted on the map the positions of all the ring ditches, which are little circular crop marks left by ploughed-out round barrows. These can't be seen from the ground. So, in ley-hunters' terms, we were recovering lots of mark points that had been lost. One would assume that if the lines drawn by Watkins and others were in any sense real and meaningful, then a significant proportion of these rediscovered points would plot neatly on to the lines. But none did. Not one.\" The pair have long since turned their backs on ley lines. \"After the book came out, I had a sense of knocking my head against a brick wall,\" says Williamson. \"Archaeologists weren't particularly interested, and ley-line people were hostile.\" But while they clearly failed to stop Watkins in his tracks, so to speak, the thorough mauling to which they subjected his theories may have had a sobering effect on the more sophisticated among his latterday followers. As I prepare to leave, the retired ley-buster has a wicked smile on his face. \"So tell me the latest news,\" Williamson says. \"Are ley lines still straight?\" In later years, even Alfred Watkins was beginning to bend. While his belief in the existence of definite lines in the landscape remained firm, he was increasingly prepared to accept that, in some instances - where two leys ran close together, for instance - his trade-route theory made little sense. But if not ancient paths, then what? Agroup of large cardboard boxes, each with a sturdy lid containing three air holes, has been taken out of storage by staff at Hereford library, and Lionel Stanbrook is poring over their contents. With him are Danny Sullivan, an architect and former editor of The Ley Hunter journal, and Danny's wife, Jo. They have been coming here for weeks, sifting through the buff envelopes and \"Snap\" files (\"Quality No 1\") that contain the annals of The Straight Track Postal Portfolio Club, and every session brings new fresh insights into the minds of the early ley-hunters. Among the quaint reports of \"lantern lectures\", of summer outings (\"bring a field glass\") and of open-air rallies at which men in plus-fours would enlist the help of entire scout troups, there is evidence that the early ley-hunters, in Sullivan's words, \"excelled themselves with lateral thinking\". One correspondent, for instance, notes that in Korea the twisting and turning of native roads is explained by the belief that evil spirits travel only in straight lines. Watkins himself responds to this observation, suggesting that Christian churches in the British Isles might have been built on straight lines precisely in order to block the passage of evil. Briefly, it seems, religion and the rituals associated with death were seen as possible alternative explanations for leys. Seventy years later, this possibility was taken up by Paul Devereux and Nigel Pennick in their 1989 book, Lines On The Landscape. Pulling in evidence from around the world, Devereux was subsequently to lay the foundations for an entirely new approach to ley-hunting - an approach that Danny Sullivan now believes is more feasible than anything proposed by Watkins, and sufficiently rooted in fact to sidestep even the fundamental objections raised by the Williamsons. \"The Ley Lines In Question argument is a bit old hat these days,\" he says. \"Most of it I would tend to agree with. Back in those days, the whole thing was quite easy to deal with because it was conducted on a very amateurish basis. But what Paul Devereux's work has done is drag the subject out of that backwater of stupidity and into a far more interesting arena. We are talking to archaeologists and anthropologists now, and considering ways in which human consciousness itself relates to landscape.\" There is, says Sullivan, no single phenomenon that is a ley. \"There are lots of different things - old tracks, alignments between sites, astronomical alignments, and so on - which could all come under the ley lines umbrella. Watkins, at the end, was saying that there were different classes of alignments. What was he really seeing?\" The more convincing alignments, Sullivan believes, were probably corpse ways or funeral paths. These designated paths by which the dead were carried to their place of burial have been documented all over Europe, frequently showing up on medieval maps and sometimes surviving into this century in the form of local folklore. Some were deliberately crooked - in order, perhaps, that the spirit of the deceased might not return to haunt the living. But others were straight, and clearly sighted on the towers of churches. \"In China,\" says Sullivan, \"evil spirits were thought to travel in straight lines, so the route had to be blocked with a wall containing a charm. In Ireland, 'fairy passes' ran between places of ancient sanctity. In Bolivia, straight lines run from hilltops, where spirits were thought to live, directly into towns and churches. In South America and the south-west US, where these things are still on the ground, they conform uncannily to Watkins's original ideas. Yet they are on another continent and belong to a completely different culture, which suggests that there's something going on that is universal.\" The common thread, it seems, is the widespread belief that spirits, ghosts and fairies all travel in straight lines - a notion that Devereux thinks might derive from the sensations experienced in all places and at all times by humans in those altered states of consciousness known to be induced by shamanic rituals or the use of hallucinogens. Shamanism? Hallucinogens? At first glance, it's a far cry from the stiff-collared, sepia world of Alfred Watkins. And yet there's another common thread running through all of this - a thread that links the first ley-hunters with their most modern counterparts. I refer not to any out-of-body experience, but to the simple out-of-car experience that Lionel Stanbrook describes. \"It can be left to a coterie of hardened intellectuals to discuss the whys and wherefores of shamanism or whatever,\" he says. \"But for me, it's about getting people off the sofa and into the open air. It's about being excited by our own heritage and about climbing to the tops of hills and admiring the view with a sense of adventure and of mystery and imagination.\" \u0095 Ley Lines - A Comprehensive Guide To Alignments, by Danny Sullivan, is published by Piatkus Books, priced \u00a316.99.

      "body": "<p>At the age of 10, Andrea Dworkin would travel from her suburban home to attend Hebrew school in the city. One day, she arrived to find the school closed, so she went to her cousin's house to call her mother. She found her cousin going crazy. \"She was bouncing off the walls, I mean, I'd never seen anything like it,\" said Dworkin. \"It was April, and she said that every April she remembered.\" Passover, which usually occurs in April, is the time when Jews remember the Holocaust. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising began on the eve of Passover. Remembering is a big Jewish thing. </p> <p>Dworkin's cousin was doing more than remembering. \"She was having what we now call flashbacks. At that point [in 1956] the Jewish community was not talking about the Holocaust, and the survivors were not talking about it, so I had the incredible experience - not of being there, but of really seeing the viscera of somebody who had been there. I had no intellectual defence for this. I could see what she was describing to me, even now, and I would say something fairly stupid, like, but why did they do that? She described the babies being used as targets by the guy that Ralph Fiennes played in Schindler's List and eventually we called my mother and she came and got me and did something to help her, I'm not sure what.\" </p> <p>Dworkin's cousin had been in the Krakow ghetto, then Plaszow, Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald. Finally, she had survived a death march. When Dworkin got to college, years later, the first thing she did was to \"sit down in the library with the Nuremberg trials and read them, volumes of them. I've been very involved in trying to learn about the Holocaust and trying to understand it, which is probably pointless. I have read Holocaust material, you might say compulsively, over a lifetime. I might go through six months when I won't read it and a few months when I will and I have been doing that since I was a kid.\" </p> <p>Dworkin is, in the popular imagination, the spearhead of radical feminism, of anti-pornography. Her books (with titles such as Woman Hating, Pornography: Men Possessing Women, and Life And Death: Unapologetic Writings On The Continuing War Against Women) are filled with descriptions of what she considers the inherent violence of heterosexual relations, and the sadism that permeates the sex industry. The common view is that Dworkin began to write about porn because of her own traumatic marriage, in which being beaten and kicked wasn't an occasional incident, but the everyday. But now it turns out she is a woman who, for almost all her life, has been drawn to horror. Since she first sat down in the college library to find out what her cousin was raving about, she has been reading about sadism. Fascism, misogyny, they're all the same to her. The exposure began at an impressionable age. </p> <p>And now she has published what she believes to be her life's work, nine years in the making; not another assault on gender relations or the sex industry but a polemical account of modern Israel and the lessons it holds for women. It is a book which many Zionists, non-Zionists, Palestinians, scholars of the Holocaust, pacifists, the left, women, men, are bound to find offensive. Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel And Women's Liberation, sparked by a visit to Israel in 1988, is a critique of Middle East politics which sees the whole situation as a product of wounded and then enraged testosterone. It is an analysis of the Holocaust and Israel through the eye of gender relations, drawing together strands of Zionism, feminism and Holocaust studies to produce a radical new thesis: that the Jews, downtrodden, had to fight back; and that women, downtrodden, must do the same. </p> <p>I jumped at the chance to meet Andrea Dworkin. Why? Because she is Andrea Dworkin. Many people think she is totally crazy, and indeed she seems to have turned her own life's experience, as an abused wife, into a universal principle. But she remains, for me, the woman who showed us the dark core of pornography, the punishing hatred of women that pervades it. There is nothing erotic about being sexually sold, she told us. The sex industry is founded on factories which turn human beings very quickly into waste material. Often people found her work unbearable to read, they couldn't understand why she wanted to go grubbing around in such filth. We didn't want to know. Like the Holocaust back in the 50s, porn was not something you talked about; and anyway, we were anti-censorship, weren't we? She made us face up to the reality of porn. </p> <p>At first she wanted me to meet her at her local Starbucks, but I protested against the noise. Reluctantly, she agreed to let me meet her at her house but asked a young friend round to answer the door and sit in on the interview. She told me certain very innocuous things, which she said were off the record, though I've no idea why. I was warned that she is \"a very private person\". I had to come at night because that is when she is awake. Early evening is morning for her. She lives in a sombre brownstone in Brooklyn with her friend and partner, the writer John Stoltenberg. The house is all dark wood floors, a dark wooden staircase and the walls a murky pink, where they can be seen at all beneath shelves and shelves and shelves of books, many of them about the evil things that go on in this world of ours. The light fittings are original, from the turn of the century, except for a few, which are duplicates she found in second-hand shops. </p> <p>We sat in the kitchen. She was wearing round her neck a small piece of jewellery, a star of David. She is a very Jewish Jew. \"I have been reading about Jewish history all of my life,\" she said. \"I had a very strong Jewish education, and Jewish scholarship taught me scholarship, that's how I learnt to think analytically.\" When our time was up and I was waiting for my taxi, when the tape was off and she seemed to relax because I was going, we talked about how we had both grown up in traditional Jewish homes, where the women went to the synagogue and sat in the ladies gallery watching the men below get on with the business of the religion. Her mother was, she says, \"all surfaces\". I described how I had watched my father being \"called up\", the moment of great honour when a man of the congregation gets to go and read aloud from the holiest of Jewish texts and how when he had finished he would walk along the rows of seats while eager hands reached out to shake his, to congratulate him on this mitzvah. \"And I wanted to do that but I couldn't because I was a woman,\" I said. \"Well,\" Dworkin replied, \"I wanted to be the rabbi.\" </p> <p>She was a good Jewish girl in a pro-Israel home: \"And all of my remaining family are, I would say, Zionist zealots.\" She remains a supporter of Israel's right to exist, of the Jewish right to have their own state and the Jewish right to fight back against those who tried and still try to kill them; just as she thinks that women have the right to fight back, even kill, the men who have abused them. \"I've been a pacifist all of my life, currently lapsed, and maybe before I die I'll go back to my religion, which is pacifism,\" she said. </p> <p>She begins her book with a torrent of rage against anti-Semitism. After what was done to the Jews, how could they not arm themselves, she asks? This book, like the others on misogyny and pornography, spares the reader nothing in its gruelling accounts of what actually happened during 2,000 years of Jew hating. Page after page peers into the dark abyss: state-sponsored pogroms, death camps, Jews with their skin flayed off and thrown to the dogs. She writes about things hardly ever spoken of before: the role women played in the wartime Resistance that history seems to have ignored; the fabled heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising who, during the height of their defiance against the Nazis, rounded up three Jewish women and used them as prostitutes; and most chillingly, the activities of Irma Grese, the camp guard at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen who reached orgasm by whipping women to death. </p> <p>Unlike many on the Left, including the Jewish Left, Dworkin was never anti-Israel. She attributed to the country ideas about socialism and equality which were indeed part of the founding vision, right up to the Declaration of Independence. So that 1988 visit, her first, came as a big shock: \"I was devastated by the situation of women, so the obvious thing for me to ask was, why are Jewish women so subordinated and treated so badly, have so few rights? I met with a lot of activists, feminists, and I came back to the United States really, really angry that feminists who had been to Israel a whole lot more than I had, had basically been keeping all this stuff secret. It enraged me. And I couldn't shake it. And that's why I started writing.\" </p> <p>What she found in Israel was a male- dominated, militaristic society. Okay, women did compulsory military service but not in combat roles. The rabbis had to declare Golda Meir an honorary male before they could recognise her as prime minister. She understood why Israeli men were such tough nuts but was furious at the effect on society. \"Pacifism was dead, killed by the Nazis along with the six million,\" she writes. \"There would be no more feminised, gentle, Jewish males, no more 'Yid'.\" With the death of the bookish \"nebbish\" - the Woody Allen type - the new, tough Jews emerged, not victims but the invincible Israeli army. Jewish machismo turned the 1948 Israeli Declaration of Independence, which specifically spoke of equality and women's rights, into a travesty - \"Debased men need to degrade women . . . Once debased, men become powerful men, the degrading of women becomes a state protected right.\" </p> <p>Moreover, she found that Israel was a country built on a form of \"near apartheid\" against Palestinians and Arab Israelis. The Israeli army tortured Palestinian men and then went home to masturbate to Holocaust-themed pornography (the army's use of torture \"eliminates ethical Judaism from the boundaries of the Israeli state and state action,\" she writes); Israeli soldiers clandestinely took photographs of Palestinian women in shop changing-rooms to blackmail them into collaborating. Dworkin sees the whole of post-war history as a game of consequences, with women always the losers: the Nazis emasculated the Jews, the Jews took it out on the Palestinians and Jewish women; and the Palestinians, emasculated in turn by the Jews, vented their loss of masculinity on the only people left who were weaker than themselves - Palestinian women. \"For certain Israel is a nation state,\" she writes. \"For certain no one kicks sand in the face of the Israeli men; for certain hatred of Arabs is useful in sustaining male rage and a willingness to injure and kill; for certain, militarist heroes do not get bashed by the international community or Amnesty International or human rights groups for beating their wives or for killing them.\" </p> <p>Seeing Israel through the lens of gender instead of race or religion or geopolitics cuts through much of the heated ideology that surrounds any attempt to find some kind of just solution to the two sets of victims in the Middle East. I have very little patience with the question asked by some non-Jews, \"How could the Jews, who went through the Holocaust, behave like that?\" Because, as Dworkin writes, inflict pain on someone and they'll inflict pain on someone else. We know this from the psychology of sexual abuse when the abused themselves may become an abuser. But the Palestinians - abused by the abused - are not let off lightly in this book: she claims that the Arab world maintains the refugee camps at Gaza to further their own political ends; that the Palestinians fall for Holocaust denial to undermine Israel's right to exist; that many Arab feminists romanticise freedom fighters who, in the name of religion and nationalism, abuse women. But most of all, Dworkin is enraged with Israeli men for betraying what she regards as elemental Jewish morality and values - the ones she held dear when she dreamed of being a rabbi and a scholar. </p> <p>Back home in America, she has been berated for criticising Israel from a comfortable distance. \"People always say to me, the Israelis are there, they're the ones whose lives are at stake. It's not me that's going to die if somebody thinks I'm right and they end up with a bullet in their brain. But I must say that looking at the situation of women suggests to me that the Israelis need enemies. I see the consistency of women being an internal enemy in virtually every country I look at, and certainly throughout the Middle East. Israel is not an exception. If there weren't the Palestinians, who are they going to shoot? Who are they going to define themselves against? They had to prove that they were virile. After the Holocaust, every Jewish man had to prove that he had not been castrated and nobody could come and take him away, and the Israeli army became the form for doing that.\" </p> <p>Dworkin hasn't been back to Israel since the 1988 visit and Scapegoat is very far from being a book of reportage. It is an analysis of source material - of scholarly works, diaries, letters, survivor testimony, eye witness accounts; there is little contemporary detail. No mention is made, for instance, of Dana International, the transsexual who was Israel's official entry to the Eurovision Song Contest two years ago. When I asked why, I was completely astounded to discover that Dworkin had never heard of her. Okay, Eurovision may not be shown on American television but if you are engaged in a nine-year study of Israel and gender you'd have thought that a sex-change diva singing to 500 million people would not have escaped your attention. Dana International is the Israel of the new millennium - not just the gay community's heroine but representing the young people of Tel Aviv's Shenkin Street, for whom the army is an unwelcome interruption between high school and the hippie trail to Goa and Thailand. </p> <p>Dworkin remained unimpressed. She's not interested in gay men, she's interested in women. \"It's almost always a mistake to take tokenism as real movement. When I was there I found that there was only one lesbian who was prepared to come out. John and I watched a movie called Trick before you arrived, and it's about a young man looking for love and he somehow finds it with this ideal-looking other man - but the whole thing was built on hatred of women, it was absolutely extraordinary. So you can have those permutations of masculinity, which look like a big change, but they don't actually change the machismo factor. I do it as much as anybody else, looking for social change and thinking okay, at least that has moved a little bit but it usually is really a very little bit, I think.\" </p> <p>Scapegoat displays a kind of love-hate relationship with Israel. Dworkin loves the idea of Jews fighting in, and for, a Jewish state; hates the fact that misogyny and violence are the result of it. At the end of the book's longest chapter, which makes a link between Zionism and women's liberation, she asks an extremely pertinent question: \"What will women do? Is there a plan? And if not, why not?\" When one wonders how the Jews managed to create a country, and why they managed to defend it despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered, the answer is - there was a plan. There was a strategy, there were tactics. If the Jews knew anything it was how to organise, how to maintain discipline, how to be tough and how to be single-minded in their goals. As for feminism, there no longer seems to be any plan at all, no political organisation, no goals, no strategy. </p> <p>\"It's been the biggest breach between me and other feminists,\" Dworkin says, \"that I believe that the women's movement is a political movement and a political movement has aims and strategies and makes advances and sometimes suffers defeat but then goes on. I had two really interesting experiences. One was talking to Emile Habiby, a very fine Palestinian writer and the first Arab to be given the Israel Prize [for literature]. He's been a left radical for a long time. He was blown away by Mercy [Dworkin's 1990 novel, about sexual abuse] but he said to me at one point, 'I have the feeling that you mean it' and I said to him, 'Yes, I do.' And I had the same experience in the Republic of Ireland where some very tired, corrupt IRA person was talking with me. And he said, 'Wait a minute, you intend to win' and I said 'Yes'. This is a political struggle, it's not a social movement for a different kind of clothes, it's not a lifestyle movement. I think that's where all of our trouble is. Great numbers of women felt very happy in finding out things that they had not known before about women's history and women's lives but were not prepared to do what the Jews did. We were not prepared to decide strategically what do we need to do, what do we want and how do we get it.\" </p> <p>So now we come to what Andrea Dworkin wants and it is this: she wants women to have their own country. But that's mad, I said to her. Why bother discussing it? It isn't going to happen. To which she has a reply - didn't they say that about Israel? And didn't the world think that Theodor Herzl, the founder of the Zionist movement, was a crank? The Jews got a country because they had been persecuted, said that enough was enough, decided what they wanted and went out and fought for it. Women should do the same. And if you don't want to live in Womenland, so what? Not all Jews live in Israel, but it is there, a place of potential refuge if persecution comes to call. Furthermore, Dworkin says, as the Jews fought for Israel so women have the right to execute - that's right, execute - rapists and the state should not intervene. I couldn't really believe she was serious, but she is. </p> <p>\"The last chapter - that's my favourite chapter,\" she said, regarding the section of her book proposing a nation state for women, and her face lit up when I referred to it. \"The first time I thought about this, strangely enough, was when I was reading for my book on pornography and I read half a dozen books on the Marquis de Sade and it occurred to me that if his first victim had shot him, all the other victims wouldn't have happened, and I think - I really believe - that a woman has the right to execute a man who has raped her. If a woman is raped she has a right to retaliate and the state doesn't have a right to intervene.\" </p> <p>But that's not going to happen, I protested, again. \"It might happen, it could happen,\" she said. Then we began to talk about this women's country. Wouldn't it wind up exactly like Israel itself - a utopian dream which like all utopias, inevitably turns out not quite as expected? \"No, I don't think it would be an ideal place,\" Dworkin agreed. \"Women tried to establish co-ops and communes throughout the 70s and a lot of them broke down, not because of outside pressure but because of internal politics. I'm not saying that's the only solution but I'm saying it's an incredible thing to overlook as a possibility. We've never dealt with the issue of sovereignty and I think that's because we've never understood that what we want we can only get through a really serious political movement. It would have many parts, it would have to; it would have the ladies, it would have the girls, it would have everybody and all different shades of politics would be necessary.\" </p> <p>And the female sadists? Would a woman's state have the Irma Greses, the Rosemary Wests, the Myra Hindleys? What distinguishes Dworkin from many of her contemporaries is that she has never swallowed any of the guff about women having all that nurturing caring gentleness encoded within the DNA. \"In the last five or 10 years I've got sick of this endless 'Women can be bad, too, women can commit crimes',\" she says. \"Look at these women who were the guards at Birkenau and other camps as well. Maybe what the Nazis created was a celebration for sadists and maybe in other circumstances that sadist would have stayed at home and beaten her children, I don't know. But there is no question about whether women can be evil, it's not a question. The only place where hate really plays a role in my life is around the Nazis, I really hate them and I really hate those women.\" </p> <p>Perhaps there is something prurient about Dworkin's interest both in fascism and in pornography - George Steiner once wrote that the problem with this stuff is that it flatters the attention. Sometimes Dworkin almost seems to be too fascinated as she extracts yet another atrocity - against Jews, against women - from the shadows. Rape or pogrom, snuff movie or death camp, what's the difference? On the other hand, Steiner also speaks of the \"sheer incapacity of the 'normal' mind to imagine and hence give active belief to the enormities of the circumstance\". And perhaps Dworkin does not have a normal mind and so can do what the rest of us cannot do: go on reading when anyone with any sense would say, \"Enough. I know what happened. I don't need to know everything that happened.\" But maybe someone has to know, read, catalogue all the horrors. As Gloria Steinem said, \"In every century, there are a handful of writers who help the human race evolve. Andrea is one of them.\" </p> <p>Is she mad? Not in the sense of those American feminists such as Kate Millett and Shulamith Firestone, who really did lose their minds. Millett lives in poverty in New England, selling Christmas trees on the street. Firestone, says Dworkin, is \"poor and crazy. She rents a room in a house and fills it with junk, then gets kicked out and moves into another room and fills that with junk.\" </p> <p>Dworkin lives in a nice, comfortable house in a middle-class Brooklyn neighbourhood. People pay attention to what she says. To Dworkin, herself, everything she says and thinks and writes has its logic and she can't understand why others don't always see it. In her book, Intercourse, she argued that every act of penetrative sex is potentially an act of rape. It wasn't a metaphor. She is always literal. I went to see her with a million questions - \"How can you think this? It's not practical! It doesn't make sense!\" But she will not be deflected. </p> <p>In person she is not angry. She is calm. She gets up and feeds the cat. She pours cranberry juice mixed with seltzer. She only wants you to know what she knows and if you did, then how could you not draw the same conclusions as she does? And you have to say this about her: she has survived to go on writing long after many of her contemporaries in the women's movement - Ti-Grace Atkinson, Robin Morgan, Mary Daly - are names known only within a dwindling circle. But, whomever I talked to, male or female, when I said I was going to meet Andrea Dworkin they knew exactly who she was and they all asked the same thing. Is she crazy? What's she like? Does she really mean all that stuff? </p> <p>Well, yes, she does </p> <p><strong>Dworkin: What I believe</strong></p> <p>I am an enemy of nationalism and male domination. This means that I repudiate all nationalism except my own and reject the dominance of all men except those I love. In this I am like every other woman, a pretender to rebellion because to break with patriarchy I would need to betray my own: the ones with whom I share a group identity, in this case Jewish, and a presumed history, in this case Jewish men. They have not hesitated to betray me through assertions of superiority intended to hurt my human rights and my human dignity. In this, too, I am like every other woman. Feminists try hard to fight for women at the same time maintaining special loyalties to sub-groups of men. How could we not? I have grown sick of those loyalties, which protect brutal acts as if they were heroic.</p> <p>The line between self-defence and aggression has been breached by my particular ethnic group represented by the Israeli government; the line itself is often not self-evident in that violent acts sometimes serve to head off enemy attack and are arguably a form of self-defence. I believe that threatened peoples and individuals have a right to self-defence.</p> <p>This goes against the pacifism that has been instrumental in my political life. My pacifism was first challenged when, working on my book on pornography in the late 70s, Pornography: Men Possessing Women, I read a half-dozen biographies of the Marquis de Sade. A life of rape and sexual violence, including kidnapping and possibly murder, would have been stopped short if his first (known) victim, Jeanne Testard, had killed him. I will say here what I have never said before: my pacifism was not challenged by the beating and torture I experienced in marriage some 30 years ago; I finally got away not because I knew that he would kill me, but because I thought I would kill him.</p> <p>Understand: this is true generally of women - his life meant more to me than my own; but also I was not willing to kill, even to escape beating and his own promise, which I believed, that he would kill me. Once having had the serious and true thought that one of his victims should have offed the good Marquis, it was impossible not to apply that insight to the widespread, contemporary beatings and rapes that women sustain. Especially, I have seen a legal system designed to protect male privilege work to do just that. I have seen a generation of anti-rape activists and anti-battery activists sit through trials of guilty men who almost always walk. Like those advocates, I have seen rapists acquitted, batterers put back in the home, child-rapers given custody of the incested child. The legal system is so genuinely perverse that women rarely report crimes involving either rape or battery.</p> <p>I am, as a result, a lapsed pacifist. I truly abhor violence, and I believe that both nationalism and male dominance are systems that promote and produce violence. With extreme difficulty and reluctance, I have come to believe that women have to be literate in both strategic violence and the violence of self-defence. It is one thing to choose not to kill; it is quite another to be defenceless by virtue of ignorance and socialisation. Women have mastered the articulation of violence on behalf of national liberation movements, including the Jewish liberation movement called Zionism, the claim of a material right to land and sovereignty in the ancient territory of Palestine.</p> <p>For a couple of thousand years - after the destruction of the second Temple in 70 CE - Jews, including Jewish men, were seen as inherently pacifistic, genetically pacifistic, as are women; the existence of the 20th-century Jewish state and its defence suggest that this pacifism was socially constructed and had no relationship at all to any particle of DNA or to testosterone or any other inevitable hormone or biological fact. The perceived gentleness of Jewish men before the establishment of the state never suggested to anyone that men as a whole could live the way that Jewish men had lived: which is to say, without publicly committed violence. Rather, this perception encouraged group violence against Jews in pogroms and in the Holocaust.</p> <p>Is it the same with women? I have been trying to grasp the Holocaust since I was 10 years old and had Auschwitz-Birkenau told to me by a survivor who was having unbearable flashbacks. In 1988, I went to Israel. I had the honour (as had happened in Northern Ireland in 1983) of meeting a great number of women activists (in Israel both Jewish and Arab) in a very short time. There was no small talk. I was distressed by what I found, including Holocaust-themed pornography and battered and raped women. Why would I expect it to be different? The answer is simple: because the Israelis are my guys, a miracle of self-determination and courage. Well, they took the land; but they had to. I continue to believe that they (we) had to; but brutality has become institutionalised in Israel as expressions of male dominance and state sovereignty - over Jewish/Israeli women as well as over Palestinian men and women.</p> <p>Would I be so troubled if Jewish women were not among the conquered? Yes, but: I think that women are the internal enemy regardless of the ethnic or racial or nationalist status of the group's men; and that Israel is a perfect example of how male dominance grows in a new state - it needs the subordination of one's own women and the subordination of a racial or ethnic other: it needs internal and external scapegoats. Israel both embodies and protects male Jews; but the Jewish women inside the state have been disarmed - the pattern for women in liberation struggles that succeed.</p> <p>Yet across the ethnic conflict, Israeli and Palestinian women, often motivated by feminist ambitions and feminist ideas, have found ways to work together. This is a fact more hopeful than the outcome of any election or provisional dictatorship. Cooperation is the female equivalent of male conflict, a way of operating in a world filled with injury and hate. This is a social, not a biological, point. In the nine-year course of writing this book, I have become certain of one thing: that women cannot be free of male dominance without challenging the men of one's own ethnic group and destroying their authority. This is a willed betrayal, as any assault on male dominance must be. </p> <p>\u0095 Scapegoat: Jews, Israel And Women's Liberation, by Andrea Dworkin, is published by Virago on June 8, priced \u00a322.50.

      "bodyText": "At the age of 10, Andrea Dworkin would travel from her suburban home to attend Hebrew school in the city. One day, she arrived to find the school closed, so she went to her cousin's house to call her mother. She found her cousin going crazy. \"She was bouncing off the walls, I mean, I'd never seen anything like it,\" said Dworkin. \"It was April, and she said that every April she remembered.\" Passover, which usually occurs in April, is the time when Jews remember the Holocaust. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising began on the eve of Passover. Remembering is a big Jewish thing. Dworkin's cousin was doing more than remembering. \"She was having what we now call flashbacks. At that point [in 1956] the Jewish community was not talking about the Holocaust, and the survivors were not talking about it, so I had the incredible experience - not of being there, but of really seeing the viscera of somebody who had been there. I had no intellectual defence for this. I could see what she was describing to me, even now, and I would say something fairly stupid, like, but why did they do that? She described the babies being used as targets by the guy that Ralph Fiennes played in Schindler's List and eventually we called my mother and she came and got me and did something to help her, I'm not sure what.\" Dworkin's cousin had been in the Krakow ghetto, then Plaszow, Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald. Finally, she had survived a death march. When Dworkin got to college, years later, the first thing she did was to \"sit down in the library with the Nuremberg trials and read them, volumes of them. I've been very involved in trying to learn about the Holocaust and trying to understand it, which is probably pointless. I have read Holocaust material, you might say compulsively, over a lifetime. I might go through six months when I won't read it and a few months when I will and I have been doing that since I was a kid.\" Dworkin is, in the popular imagination, the spearhead of radical feminism, of anti-pornography. Her books (with titles such as Woman Hating, Pornography: Men Possessing Women, and Life And Death: Unapologetic Writings On The Continuing War Against Women) are filled with descriptions of what she considers the inherent violence of heterosexual relations, and the sadism that permeates the sex industry. The common view is that Dworkin began to write about porn because of her own traumatic marriage, in which being beaten and kicked wasn't an occasional incident, but the everyday. But now it turns out she is a woman who, for almost all her life, has been drawn to horror. Since she first sat down in the college library to find out what her cousin was raving about, she has been reading about sadism. Fascism, misogyny, they're all the same to her. The exposure began at an impressionable age. And now she has published what she believes to be her life's work, nine years in the making; not another assault on gender relations or the sex industry but a polemical account of modern Israel and the lessons it holds for women. It is a book which many Zionists, non-Zionists, Palestinians, scholars of the Holocaust, pacifists, the left, women, men, are bound to find offensive. Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel And Women's Liberation, sparked by a visit to Israel in 1988, is a critique of Middle East politics which sees the whole situation as a product of wounded and then enraged testosterone. It is an analysis of the Holocaust and Israel through the eye of gender relations, drawing together strands of Zionism, feminism and Holocaust studies to produce a radical new thesis: that the Jews, downtrodden, had to fight back; and that women, downtrodden, must do the same. I jumped at the chance to meet Andrea Dworkin. Why? Because she is Andrea Dworkin. Many people think she is totally crazy, and indeed she seems to have turned her own life's experience, as an abused wife, into a universal principle. But she remains, for me, the woman who showed us the dark core of pornography, the punishing hatred of women that pervades it. There is nothing erotic about being sexually sold, she told us. The sex industry is founded on factories which turn human beings very quickly into waste material. Often people found her work unbearable to read, they couldn't understand why she wanted to go grubbing around in such filth. We didn't want to know. Like the Holocaust back in the 50s, porn was not something you talked about; and anyway, we were anti-censorship, weren't we? She made us face up to the reality of porn. At first she wanted me to meet her at her local Starbucks, but I protested against the noise. Reluctantly, she agreed to let me meet her at her house but asked a young friend round to answer the door and sit in on the interview. She told me certain very innocuous things, which she said were off the record, though I've no idea why. I was warned that she is \"a very private person\". I had to come at night because that is when she is awake. Early evening is morning for her. She lives in a sombre brownstone in Brooklyn with her friend and partner, the writer John Stoltenberg. The house is all dark wood floors, a dark wooden staircase and the walls a murky pink, where they can be seen at all beneath shelves and shelves and shelves of books, many of them about the evil things that go on in this world of ours. The light fittings are original, from the turn of the century, except for a few, which are duplicates she found in second-hand shops. We sat in the kitchen. She was wearing round her neck a small piece of jewellery, a star of David. She is a very Jewish Jew. \"I have been reading about Jewish history all of my life,\" she said. \"I had a very strong Jewish education, and Jewish scholarship taught me scholarship, that's how I learnt to think analytically.\" When our time was up and I was waiting for my taxi, when the tape was off and she seemed to relax because I was going, we talked about how we had both grown up in traditional Jewish homes, where the women went to the synagogue and sat in the ladies gallery watching the men below get on with the business of the religion. Her mother was, she says, \"all surfaces\". I described how I had watched my father being \"called up\", the moment of great honour when a man of the congregation gets to go and read aloud from the holiest of Jewish texts and how when he had finished he would walk along the rows of seats while eager hands reached out to shake his, to congratulate him on this mitzvah. \"And I wanted to do that but I couldn't because I was a woman,\" I said. \"Well,\" Dworkin replied, \"I wanted to be the rabbi.\" She was a good Jewish girl in a pro-Israel home: \"And all of my remaining family are, I would say, Zionist zealots.\" She remains a supporter of Israel's right to exist, of the Jewish right to have their own state and the Jewish right to fight back against those who tried and still try to kill them; just as she thinks that women have the right to fight back, even kill, the men who have abused them. \"I've been a pacifist all of my life, currently lapsed, and maybe before I die I'll go back to my religion, which is pacifism,\" she said. She begins her book with a torrent of rage against anti-Semitism. After what was done to the Jews, how could they not arm themselves, she asks? This book, like the others on misogyny and pornography, spares the reader nothing in its gruelling accounts of what actually happened during 2,000 years of Jew hating. Page after page peers into the dark abyss: state-sponsored pogroms, death camps, Jews with their skin flayed off and thrown to the dogs. She writes about things hardly ever spoken of before: the role women played in the wartime Resistance that history seems to have ignored; the fabled heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising who, during the height of their defiance against the Nazis, rounded up three Jewish women and used them as prostitutes; and most chillingly, the activities of Irma Grese, the camp guard at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen who reached orgasm by whipping women to death. Unlike many on the Left, including the Jewish Left, Dworkin was never anti-Israel. She attributed to the country ideas about socialism and equality which were indeed part of the founding vision, right up to the Declaration of Independence. So that 1988 visit, her first, came as a big shock: \"I was devastated by the situation of women, so the obvious thing for me to ask was, why are Jewish women so subordinated and treated so badly, have so few rights? I met with a lot of activists, feminists, and I came back to the United States really, really angry that feminists who had been to Israel a whole lot more than I had, had basically been keeping all this stuff secret. It enraged me. And I couldn't shake it. And that's why I started writing.\" What she found in Israel was a male- dominated, militaristic society. Okay, women did compulsory military service but not in combat roles. The rabbis had to declare Golda Meir an honorary male before they could recognise her as prime minister. She understood why Israeli men were such tough nuts but was furious at the effect on society. \"Pacifism was dead, killed by the Nazis along with the six million,\" she writes. \"There would be no more feminised, gentle, Jewish males, no more 'Yid'.\" With the death of the bookish \"nebbish\" - the Woody Allen type - the new, tough Jews emerged, not victims but the invincible Israeli army. Jewish machismo turned the 1948 Israeli Declaration of Independence, which specifically spoke of equality and women's rights, into a travesty - \"Debased men need to degrade women . . . Once debased, men become powerful men, the degrading of women becomes a state protected right.\" Moreover, she found that Israel was a country built on a form of \"near apartheid\" against Palestinians and Arab Israelis. The Israeli army tortured Palestinian men and then went home to masturbate to Holocaust-themed pornography (the army's use of torture \"eliminates ethical Judaism from the boundaries of the Israeli state and state action,\" she writes); Israeli soldiers clandestinely took photographs of Palestinian women in shop changing-rooms to blackmail them into collaborating. Dworkin sees the whole of post-war history as a game of consequences, with women always the losers: the Nazis emasculated the Jews, the Jews took it out on the Palestinians and Jewish women; and the Palestinians, emasculated in turn by the Jews, vented their loss of masculinity on the only people left who were weaker than themselves - Palestinian women. \"For certain Israel is a nation state,\" she writes. \"For certain no one kicks sand in the face of the Israeli men; for certain hatred of Arabs is useful in sustaining male rage and a willingness to injure and kill; for certain, militarist heroes do not get bashed by the international community or Amnesty International or human rights groups for beating their wives or for killing them.\" Seeing Israel through the lens of gender instead of race or religion or geopolitics cuts through much of the heated ideology that surrounds any attempt to find some kind of just solution to the two sets of victims in the Middle East. I have very little patience with the question asked by some non-Jews, \"How could the Jews, who went through the Holocaust, behave like that?\" Because, as Dworkin writes, inflict pain on someone and they'll inflict pain on someone else. We know this from the psychology of sexual abuse when the abused themselves may become an abuser. But the Palestinians - abused by the abused - are not let off lightly in this book: she claims that the Arab world maintains the refugee camps at Gaza to further their own political ends; that the Palestinians fall for Holocaust denial to undermine Israel's right to exist; that many Arab feminists romanticise freedom fighters who, in the name of religion and nationalism, abuse women. But most of all, Dworkin is enraged with Israeli men for betraying what she regards as elemental Jewish morality and values - the ones she held dear when she dreamed of being a rabbi and a scholar. Back home in America, she has been berated for criticising Israel from a comfortable distance. \"People always say to me, the Israelis are there, they're the ones whose lives are at stake. It's not me that's going to die if somebody thinks I'm right and they end up with a bullet in their brain. But I must say that looking at the situation of women suggests to me that the Israelis need enemies. I see the consistency of women being an internal enemy in virtually every country I look at, and certainly throughout the Middle East. Israel is not an exception. If there weren't the Palestinians, who are they going to shoot? Who are they going to define themselves against? They had to prove that they were virile. After the Holocaust, every Jewish man had to prove that he had not been castrated and nobody could come and take him away, and the Israeli army became the form for doing that.\" Dworkin hasn't been back to Israel since the 1988 visit and Scapegoat is very far from being a book of reportage. It is an analysis of source material - of scholarly works, diaries, letters, survivor testimony, eye witness accounts; there is little contemporary detail. No mention is made, for instance, of Dana International, the transsexual who was Israel's official entry to the Eurovision Song Contest two years ago. When I asked why, I was completely astounded to discover that Dworkin had never heard of her. Okay, Eurovision may not be shown on American television but if you are engaged in a nine-year study of Israel and gender you'd have thought that a sex-change diva singing to 500 million people would not have escaped your attention. Dana International is the Israel of the new millennium - not just the gay community's heroine but representing the young people of Tel Aviv's Shenkin Street, for whom the army is an unwelcome interruption between high school and the hippie trail to Goa and Thailand. Dworkin remained unimpressed. She's not interested in gay men, she's interested in women. \"It's almost always a mistake to take tokenism as real movement. When I was there I found that there was only one lesbian who was prepared to come out. John and I watched a movie called Trick before you arrived, and it's about a young man looking for love and he somehow finds it with this ideal-looking other man - but the whole thing was built on hatred of women, it was absolutely extraordinary. So you can have those permutations of masculinity, which look like a big change, but they don't actually change the machismo factor. I do it as much as anybody else, looking for social change and thinking okay, at least that has moved a little bit but it usually is really a very little bit, I think.\" Scapegoat displays a kind of love-hate relationship with Israel. Dworkin loves the idea of Jews fighting in, and for, a Jewish state; hates the fact that misogyny and violence are the result of it. At the end of the book's longest chapter, which makes a link between Zionism and women's liberation, she asks an extremely pertinent question: \"What will women do? Is there a plan? And if not, why not?\" When one wonders how the Jews managed to create a country, and why they managed to defend it despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered, the answer is - there was a plan. There was a strategy, there were tactics. If the Jews knew anything it was how to organise, how to maintain discipline, how to be tough and how to be single-minded in their goals. As for feminism, there no longer seems to be any plan at all, no political organisation, no goals, no strategy. \"It's been the biggest breach between me and other feminists,\" Dworkin says, \"that I believe that the women's movement is a political movement and a political movement has aims and strategies and makes advances and sometimes suffers defeat but then goes on. I had two really interesting experiences. One was talking to Emile Habiby, a very fine Palestinian writer and the first Arab to be given the Israel Prize [for literature]. He's been a left radical for a long time. He was blown away by Mercy [Dworkin's 1990 novel, about sexual abuse] but he said to me at one point, 'I have the feeling that you mean it' and I said to him, 'Yes, I do.' And I had the same experience in the Republic of Ireland where some very tired, corrupt IRA person was talking with me. And he said, 'Wait a minute, you intend to win' and I said 'Yes'. This is a political struggle, it's not a social movement for a different kind of clothes, it's not a lifestyle movement. I think that's where all of our trouble is. Great numbers of women felt very happy in finding out things that they had not known before about women's history and women's lives but were not prepared to do what the Jews did. We were not prepared to decide strategically what do we need to do, what do we want and how do we get it.\" So now we come to what Andrea Dworkin wants and it is this: she wants women to have their own country. But that's mad, I said to her. Why bother discussing it? It isn't going to happen. To which she has a reply - didn't they say that about Israel? And didn't the world think that Theodor Herzl, the founder of the Zionist movement, was a crank? The Jews got a country because they had been persecuted, said that enough was enough, decided what they wanted and went out and fought for it. Women should do the same. And if you don't want to live in Womenland, so what? Not all Jews live in Israel, but it is there, a place of potential refuge if persecution comes to call. Furthermore, Dworkin says, as the Jews fought for Israel so women have the right to execute - that's right, execute - rapists and the state should not intervene. I couldn't really believe she was serious, but she is. \"The last chapter - that's my favourite chapter,\" she said, regarding the section of her book proposing a nation state for women, and her face lit up when I referred to it. \"The first time I thought about this, strangely enough, was when I was reading for my book on pornography and I read half a dozen books on the Marquis de Sade and it occurred to me that if his first victim had shot him, all the other victims wouldn't have happened, and I think - I really believe - that a woman has the right to execute a man who has raped her. If a woman is raped she has a right to retaliate and the state doesn't have a right to intervene.\" But that's not going to happen, I protested, again. \"It might happen, it could happen,\" she said. Then we began to talk about this women's country. Wouldn't it wind up exactly like Israel itself - a utopian dream which like all utopias, inevitably turns out not quite as expected? \"No, I don't think it would be an ideal place,\" Dworkin agreed. \"Women tried to establish co-ops and communes throughout the 70s and a lot of them broke down, not because of outside pressure but because of internal politics. I'm not saying that's the only solution but I'm saying it's an incredible thing to overlook as a possibility. We've never dealt with the issue of sovereignty and I think that's because we've never understood that what we want we can only get through a really serious political movement. It would have many parts, it would have to; it would have the ladies, it would have the girls, it would have everybody and all different shades of politics would be necessary.\" And the female sadists? Would a woman's state have the Irma Greses, the Rosemary Wests, the Myra Hindleys? What distinguishes Dworkin from many of her contemporaries is that she has never swallowed any of the guff about women having all that nurturing caring gentleness encoded within the DNA. \"In the last five or 10 years I've got sick of this endless 'Women can be bad, too, women can commit crimes',\" she says. \"Look at these women who were the guards at Birkenau and other camps as well. Maybe what the Nazis created was a celebration for sadists and maybe in other circumstances that sadist would have stayed at home and beaten her children, I don't know. But there is no question about whether women can be evil, it's not a question. The only place where hate really plays a role in my life is around the Nazis, I really hate them and I really hate those women.\" Perhaps there is something prurient about Dworkin's interest both in fascism and in pornography - George Steiner once wrote that the problem with this stuff is that it flatters the attention. Sometimes Dworkin almost seems to be too fascinated as she extracts yet another atrocity - against Jews, against women - from the shadows. Rape or pogrom, snuff movie or death camp, what's the difference? On the other hand, Steiner also speaks of the \"sheer incapacity of the 'normal' mind to imagine and hence give active belief to the enormities of the circumstance\". And perhaps Dworkin does not have a normal mind and so can do what the rest of us cannot do: go on reading when anyone with any sense would say, \"Enough. I know what happened. I don't need to know everything that happened.\" But maybe someone has to know, read, catalogue all the horrors. As Gloria Steinem said, \"In every century, there are a handful of writers who help the human race evolve. Andrea is one of them.\" Is she mad? Not in the sense of those American feminists such as Kate Millett and Shulamith Firestone, who really did lose their minds. Millett lives in poverty in New England, selling Christmas trees on the street. Firestone, says Dworkin, is \"poor and crazy. She rents a room in a house and fills it with junk, then gets kicked out and moves into another room and fills that with junk.\" Dworkin lives in a nice, comfortable house in a middle-class Brooklyn neighbourhood. People pay attention to what she says. To Dworkin, herself, everything she says and thinks and writes has its logic and she can't understand why others don't always see it. In her book, Intercourse, she argued that every act of penetrative sex is potentially an act of rape. It wasn't a metaphor. She is always literal. I went to see her with a million questions - \"How can you think this? It's not practical! It doesn't make sense!\" But she will not be deflected. In person she is not angry. She is calm. She gets up and feeds the cat. She pours cranberry juice mixed with seltzer. She only wants you to know what she knows and if you did, then how could you not draw the same conclusions as she does? And you have to say this about her: she has survived to go on writing long after many of her contemporaries in the women's movement - Ti-Grace Atkinson, Robin Morgan, Mary Daly - are names known only within a dwindling circle. But, whomever I talked to, male or female, when I said I was going to meet Andrea Dworkin they knew exactly who she was and they all asked the same thing. Is she crazy? What's she like? Does she really mean all that stuff? Well, yes, she does Dworkin: What I believe I am an enemy of nationalism and male domination. This means that I repudiate all nationalism except my own and reject the dominance of all men except those I love. In this I am like every other woman, a pretender to rebellion because to break with patriarchy I would need to betray my own: the ones with whom I share a group identity, in this case Jewish, and a presumed history, in this case Jewish men. They have not hesitated to betray me through assertions of superiority intended to hurt my human rights and my human dignity. In this, too, I am like every other woman. Feminists try hard to fight for women at the same time maintaining special loyalties to sub-groups of men. How could we not? I have grown sick of those loyalties, which protect brutal acts as if they were heroic. The line between self-defence and aggression has been breached by my particular ethnic group represented by the Israeli government; the line itself is often not self-evident in that violent acts sometimes serve to head off enemy attack and are arguably a form of self-defence. I believe that threatened peoples and individuals have a right to self-defence. This goes against the pacifism that has been instrumental in my political life. My pacifism was first challenged when, working on my book on pornography in the late 70s, Pornography: Men Possessing Women, I read a half-dozen biographies of the Marquis de Sade. A life of rape and sexual violence, including kidnapping and possibly murder, would have been stopped short if his first (known) victim, Jeanne Testard, had killed him. I will say here what I have never said before: my pacifism was not challenged by the beating and torture I experienced in marriage some 30 years ago; I finally got away not because I knew that he would kill me, but because I thought I would kill him. Understand: this is true generally of women - his life meant more to me than my own; but also I was not willing to kill, even to escape beating and his own promise, which I believed, that he would kill me. Once having had the serious and true thought that one of his victims should have offed the good Marquis, it was impossible not to apply that insight to the widespread, contemporary beatings and rapes that women sustain. Especially, I have seen a legal system designed to protect male privilege work to do just that. I have seen a generation of anti-rape activists and anti-battery activists sit through trials of guilty men who almost always walk. Like those advocates, I have seen rapists acquitted, batterers put back in the home, child-rapers given custody of the incested child. The legal system is so genuinely perverse that women rarely report crimes involving either rape or battery. I am, as a result, a lapsed pacifist. I truly abhor violence, and I believe that both nationalism and male dominance are systems that promote and produce violence. With extreme difficulty and reluctance, I have come to believe that women have to be literate in both strategic violence and the violence of self-defence. It is one thing to choose not to kill; it is quite another to be defenceless by virtue of ignorance and socialisation. Women have mastered the articulation of violence on behalf of national liberation movements, including the Jewish liberation movement called Zionism, the claim of a material right to land and sovereignty in the ancient territory of Palestine. For a couple of thousand years - after the destruction of the second Temple in 70 CE - Jews, including Jewish men, were seen as inherently pacifistic, genetically pacifistic, as are women; the existence of the 20th-century Jewish state and its defence suggest that this pacifism was socially constructed and had no relationship at all to any particle of DNA or to testosterone or any other inevitable hormone or biological fact. The perceived gentleness of Jewish men before the establishment of the state never suggested to anyone that men as a whole could live the way that Jewish men had lived: which is to say, without publicly committed violence. Rather, this perception encouraged group violence against Jews in pogroms and in the Holocaust. Is it the same with women? I have been trying to grasp the Holocaust since I was 10 years old and had Auschwitz-Birkenau told to me by a survivor who was having unbearable flashbacks. In 1988, I went to Israel. I had the honour (as had happened in Northern Ireland in 1983) of meeting a great number of women activists (in Israel both Jewish and Arab) in a very short time. There was no small talk. I was distressed by what I found, including Holocaust-themed pornography and battered and raped women. Why would I expect it to be different? The answer is simple: because the Israelis are my guys, a miracle of self-determination and courage. Well, they took the land; but they had to. I continue to believe that they (we) had to; but brutality has become institutionalised in Israel as expressions of male dominance and state sovereignty - over Jewish/Israeli women as well as over Palestinian men and women. Would I be so troubled if Jewish women were not among the conquered? Yes, but: I think that women are the internal enemy regardless of the ethnic or racial or nationalist status of the group's men; and that Israel is a perfect example of how male dominance grows in a new state - it needs the subordination of one's own women and the subordination of a racial or ethnic other: it needs internal and external scapegoats. Israel both embodies and protects male Jews; but the Jewish women inside the state have been disarmed - the pattern for women in liberation struggles that succeed. Yet across the ethnic conflict, Israeli and Palestinian women, often motivated by feminist ambitions and feminist ideas, have found ways to work together. This is a fact more hopeful than the outcome of any election or provisional dictatorship. Cooperation is the female equivalent of male conflict, a way of operating in a world filled with injury and hate. This is a social, not a biological, point. In the nine-year course of writing this book, I have become certain of one thing: that women cannot be free of male dominance without challenging the men of one's own ethnic group and destroying their authority. This is a willed betrayal, as any assault on male dominance must be. \u0095 Scapegoat: Jews, Israel And Women's Liberation, by Andrea Dworkin, is published by Virago on June 8, priced \u00a322.50.

      "body": "<p>There are many reasons to berate the wet weather this spring, not least because it delayed the start of the asparagus-cutting season. Even in a good year, English asparagus graces our tables for just two months, and growers usually begin their annual harvest in mid-April. But two weeks ago, Paul Hayden at the Birlingham Nursery, in Pershore, Worcestershire (01386 750668) had barely begun cutting (that is, hand-slicing the shoots from the soil). </p> <p>Still, when you've waited four years for the plant to mature sufficiently to yield the best crop, what's a few weeks more? Those who bemoan the expense of the English spear should be aware that these tender greens, which are at their best for only a few days, are the end result of a very long toil. \"You have to be constantly looking a long way ahead,\" Hayden explains. \"The problem with growing asparagus is that you should always have started five years ago.\" </p> <p>The life of an asparagus grower is indeed lived in the slow lane. First, the seeds (at Birlingham, they use Dutch hybrids) are sown. Then, after maybe two years, you can if you want start to cut a little. But if it's the really fine stuff you're after - the fleshy, thick stems of a typical English asparagus yield - then you'll be waiting a good four years. </p> <p>Only then - and for just two short months, May and June, to boot - you can call the cutters in. And there's no point trying to bend the rules. \"If you continue cutting after mid-June,\" says Hayden, \"it doesn't allow energy back into the crown, so there'll be no crop the next year. You must say, 'No more.'\" </p> <p>Fortunately, Hayden has a retail nursery to keep him busy for the 10 months when his asparagus is doing little more than recovering its strength for next season's spurt. It is eight years since he committed to asparagus, although the location of the nursery - in the heart of the Vale of Evesham, that fertile basin between the Cotswolds and the Malvern and Bredon Hills - made the choice rather straightforward: \"I was aware that asparagus was historically grown in the area, and it did spring to mind because of that.\" </p> <p>The Birlingham operation is not entirely traditional, however. Unusually among growers, part of this crop is cultivated under glass, so this year's late cutting has not meant a lazy spring for Hayden and his two co-workers. The indoor asparagus was deemed ready for cutting on March 5, when it reached peak condition - compact heads, good green colour (unlike the white asparagus that is grown under the soil and that is so favoured on the continent, especially in the Low Countries, our stuff is allowed to see what sun we have). Every day since, Hayden and co have been busy cutting, grading and packing, all by hand. </p> <p>As anyone who has ever cooked or eaten asparagus will insist on telling you, it is essential that the spears are eaten as soon after cutting as is possible. Hayden is particularly proud of the fact that around one third of his crop is sold directly to the public from the Birlingham shop. \"It's the one edible crop that people are willing to drive a distance for,\" he says. \"We've tried tomatoes and other vegetables, too, but they just didn't pull people in in the same way. And people are happy to pay maybe two or three times more than they would for the Spanish, because it's so much better.\" </p> <p>Ah yes, the price - if there's one thing that stops people from cheerfully bunging a couple of bundles into their weekly shopping basket, it's the expense. Hayden, who sells his crop for \u00a32.95 per round (about 1lb in weight) in his own shop, blames the short season and the high level of imports. </p> <p>Asparagus, which traditionally grew wild on the banks of the Nile and elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean region, is now cultivated in the unlikeliest of places across the world. Peru, the US and Spain are the biggest producers, and it's those names that you're most likely to find on the supermarket labels. Talk of seasonal availability can sound suspiciously like conspiracy when bright green shoots can be bought all year round. </p> <p>\"The only way English asparagus can sell is on quality,\" says Hayden. Good thing, too. Asparagus always has been a treasured vegetable - it is, after all, a member of the fashionable lily family. Some cultures praised its medicinal qualities - it has been credited with curing everything from gout to toothache to bee stings, while Native Americans used it to treat bladder infections (indeed, few texts on the subject fail to mention the effect asparagus has on the odour of urine, and, in the interests of conformity, nor will this - it's all to do with the body's inability to break down aspergin). It was the Romans, however, who hit the nail on the head when they took a shine to Asparagus officinalis for just one reason: its taste. So keen were they that they even set up designated asparagus fleets for ferrying the freshest spears to the emperor's dining table. </p> <p>There's no need for such decadence to get hold of the finest English asparagus, however. Hayden is toying with the idea of selling it via mail order, and the advent of a rival growing region, East Anglia (which is perfect for more than just its light soils: \"Asparagus is happy near the sea,\" says Hayden), should ensure a ready supply of English stems, for the early summer months at least.

      "body": "<p>All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> Rice with asparagus</strong></p> <p><strong>450g very fresh asparagus </strong></p> <p><strong>Water </strong></p> <p><strong>60g unsalted butter </strong></p> <p><strong>1 medium onion, finely chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>450g carnaroli or arborio rice </strong></p> <p><strong>1 big chunk good Parmesan </strong></p> <p><strong>1 small handful flat-leaf parsley</strong> </p> <p>Test the stalks of the asparagus and snap them where they yield. Peel them if their skin seems tough. Fill a deep, wide pan with water, enough to generously to cover the asparagus, though not so much that the flavour of the vegetable will be diluted; add a little salt, and bring to the boil. Lay in the spears, and boil for three to four minutes only. Transfer the asparagus to a draining rack, to allow it to cool slightly, tip the cooking liquor into a large jug or somesuch, and wipe dry the pot. </p> <p>Add the butter to the dried pot, melt over a medium flame, then add the onion and cook until it is soft and pale. Pour in the rice, stir for a minute or two to coat the grains, then add a ladle of the cooking water and stir until it is absorbed by the rice. Repeat thus until all the rice is plumped and cooked - about 15-20 minutes - with each grain remaining intact. The consistency should err towards the liquid. Finely chop the parsley, add to the rice, stir in as much freshly-grated Parmesan as you like, remove from the heat, gently stir in the asparagus and serve at once. </p> <p><strong> Asparagus with scrambled eggs on toast </strong></p> <p> One of the simplest yet most sublime combinations of egg and asparagus. </p> <p><strong> 36 very fresh asparagus spears </strong></p> <p><strong>6 thick slices bread (preferably from a pan loaf) </strong></p> <p><strong>12 eggs </strong></p> <p><strong>A little double cream </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp Dijon mustard </strong></p> <p><strong>100g unsalted butter </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt and milled pepper</strong> </p> <p>Heat the grill. Set a big pot of water on to boil. Peel the asparagus, cut the spears in half and keep only the tips (the stalks can be used in a soup). Crack the eggs into a large bowl and beat them together. When the water is beginning to boil, add the mustard to the eggs, along with a generous splash of cream, salt and pepper. Over a low heat, melt 50g of the butter in a heavy-based pot. </p> <p>Put the asparagus into the boiling water, and cover at once so that it returns to the boil quickly. When the butter has melted in the pan, put the bread under the grill and tip the eggs into the butter pan. Stir the eggs slowly but constantly until large curds form. </p> <p>Generously butter the toasted bread, and place the slices on the plates in readiness. When the eggs are cooked but still soft, spoon them over the toast. Drain the asparagus, place a spear or two atop each egg and serve immediately. </p> <p><strong> Asparagus with hot anchovy dip</strong></p> <p> The dipping sauce of Piedmont, bagna cada, is traditionally served in winter, but an exception is made for asparagus. </p> <p><strong> 36 very fresh asparagus spears </strong></p> <p><strong>2 cloves garlic, chopped fine </strong></p> <p><strong>40g unsalted butter </strong></p> <p><strong>180ml very good olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>10 finest anchovy fillets</strong> </p> <p>Trim and peel the asparagus. Set a large pot of salted water on to boil. In a small pan, warm the oil and butter until a foam forms. Fry the garlic without letting it colour, then add the anchovies and stir. Cook slowly, stirring frequently, until the fish have dissolved into a paste. Add a little salt, if required, and transfer to the table.

      "bodyText": "All recipes serve six. Rice with asparagus 450g very fresh asparagus Water 60g unsalted butter 1 medium onion, finely chopped 450g carnaroli or arborio rice 1 big chunk good Parmesan 1 small handful flat-leaf parsley Test the stalks of the asparagus and snap them where they yield. Peel them if their skin seems tough. Fill a deep, wide pan with water, enough to generously to cover the asparagus, though not so much that the flavour of the vegetable will be diluted; add a little salt, and bring to the boil. Lay in the spears, and boil for three to four minutes only. Transfer the asparagus to a draining rack, to allow it to cool slightly, tip the cooking liquor into a large jug or somesuch, and wipe dry the pot. Add the butter to the dried pot, melt over a medium flame, then add the onion and cook until it is soft and pale. Pour in the rice, stir for a minute or two to coat the grains, then add a ladle of the cooking water and stir until it is absorbed by the rice. Repeat thus until all the rice is plumped and cooked - about 15-20 minutes - with each grain remaining intact. The consistency should err towards the liquid. Finely chop the parsley, add to the rice, stir in as much freshly-grated Parmesan as you like, remove from the heat, gently stir in the asparagus and serve at once. Asparagus with scrambled eggs on toast One of the simplest yet most sublime combinations of egg and asparagus. 36 very fresh asparagus spears 6 thick slices bread (preferably from a pan loaf) 12 eggs A little double cream 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 100g unsalted butter Sea salt and milled pepper Heat the grill. Set a big pot of water on to boil. Peel the asparagus, cut the spears in half and keep only the tips (the stalks can be used in a soup). Crack the eggs into a large bowl and beat them together. When the water is beginning to boil, add the mustard to the eggs, along with a generous splash of cream, salt and pepper. Over a low heat, melt 50g of the butter in a heavy-based pot. Put the asparagus into the boiling water, and cover at once so that it returns to the boil quickly. When the butter has melted in the pan, put the bread under the grill and tip the eggs into the butter pan. Stir the eggs slowly but constantly until large curds form. Generously butter the toasted bread, and place the slices on the plates in readiness. When the eggs are cooked but still soft, spoon them over the toast. Drain the asparagus, place a spear or two atop each egg and serve immediately. Asparagus with hot anchovy dip The dipping sauce of Piedmont, bagna cada, is traditionally served in winter, but an exception is made for asparagus. 36 very fresh asparagus spears 2 cloves garlic, chopped fine 40g unsalted butter 180ml very good olive oil 10 finest anchovy fillets Trim and peel the asparagus. Set a large pot of salted water on to boil. In a small pan, warm the oil and butter until a foam forms. Fry the garlic without letting it colour, then add the anchovies and stir. Cook slowly, stirring frequently, until the fish have dissolved into a paste. Add a little salt, if required, and transfer to the table. Plunge the spears into the boiling water and cook until just tender. Drain, put upon a plate and serve swiftly. Asparagus in onions, garlic, lemon and herbs Aka, asperges marin\u00e9es \u00e0 la Ni\u00e7oise - Julia Child had the original recipe from Jacques M\u00e8decin, who recommends wild asparagus 'as thin as little pencils that grow in the crooked feet of the olive tree in the month of April and whose taste is absolutely inimitable'. My search for such asparagus was fruitless, but the more familiar green stuff works a treat anyway. 2 medium onions, sliced thin 5 cloves garlic, sliced thin 1 lemons, zested and cut into fine strips 7-8 tbsp excellent olive oil 12 black peppercorns 150ml white wine 6 tbsp lemon juice 600ml water 1 tsp sea salt 36 very fresh asparagus spears 1 sprig thyme 1 bayleaf 1 small handful flat-leaf parsley Warm a big, heavy pot and cook the onion, garlic and lemon slowly in the olive oil. Once softened, add the peppercorns, wine, lemon juice, water and salt, and simmer for 20 minutes. Peel the asparagus and put into the simmering marinade. Add a little water if the marinade has reduced while cooking. Cover the pot and simmer very slowly for 20 minutes until the asparagus is tender.

Occasionally, by some miracle of self-deception, certain of us might believe ourselves to be saved by love, but ultimately this cannot rescue us. The moment we part company with our youth, we are doomed; from then on, we are simply waiting to die, marooned in a world that no longer has the remotest faith in any life after death - and not a great deal in life before it. </p> <p>To describe Michel Houellebecq's extraordinary novel as nihilistic would be a grave understatement. On its publication in France as Les Particules El\u00e9mentaires, it shot up the bestseller charts while provoking outrage for its strands of homophobia, racism and misogyny, not to mention explicit and frequently voyeuristic sex and violence. Houellebecq, now based in Ireland, found himself the subject of countless newspaper articles and the pariah of the literary journal Perpendiculaire, which he had helped to found. </p> <p>His novel deals with a crisis that ostensibly originates in the west but has ramifications for the entire human race. The only remedy for humanity's predicament is the extinction of the species, and this chilling development is plausibly consigned to the category of \"metaphysical mutation\". These mutations have happened before - the rise of Christianity, the cult of the individual - and the death of the human, hastened by the inexorable logic of scientific advance, might well be another. </p> <p>In Atomised, that futuristic fantasy is played out in the lives of two grotesque half-brothers, Michel and Bruno. Interspersed with an account of their woeful progress through the decades are the cool observations of a dispassionate narrator on the crises and failures of contemporary society, the rise of science and the decline of religion, the animalistic nature of sexual desire and the inability of the liberal western intellect to come up with any coherent response to the disasters that enfold it. </p> <p>The circumstances of his characters' births present Houellebecq with an opportunity to tether his philosophy to a specific social malfunction. This might be termed the permissive society, but can also be viewed as an unavoidable consequence of an obsession with free will. Their mother, a shiftless pleasure-seeker, abandons them to different grandmothers without batting an eyelid. At the fag end of the 1950s she takes off for California, where \"something radical\" is happening, and joins a commune headed by an Aldous Huxley-inspired, sex-obsessed charlatan. The result of her absence affects her sons in opposite but equally disabling ways. </p> <p>Bruno, the elder, is a sexual inadequate whose life is consumed by the pursuit of women. His \"adventures\" are chronicled with gallows humour, moving from childhood depravity to bleak, self-knowing middle-age. Early on we encounter a teenage Bruno sneaking into his mother's bedroom, kneeling reverentially in front of her vagina, and then masturbating outside before stoving a cat's head in with a rock.</p> <p>Later on, after decades of prostitutes, unreliable erections and premature ejaculation, Bruno finds something approximating love with the sexually liberated anti-feminist Christiane. It's no great surprise - nor any great pity, for Houellebecq's characters are not built to last - that she ends up collapsing while being penetrated from behind in a night-club; a short time later, trapped in a wheelchair by her rotting coccyx, she hurls herself down a stairwell. </p> <p>Michel has no inclination towards sex, despite an intense childhood relationship with the saintly Annabelle. She, by the way, also commits suicide, after an unhappy life and a short struggle with cancer; but it would be spurious to point out that all the women in this novel meet their deaths as victims. After all, nobody exactly has a ball. Michel in particular is afflicted by sadness, his hyper-intelligence condemning him to all too frank an apprehension of the way things are going. A physicist turned molecular biologist, his findings on mutations in DNA provide the foundations of the new \"metaphysical mutation\" that closes the book. A reluctant prophet, his intellect ruthlessly shuts down our options until there is, literally, no point to human life. </p> <p>This is an anti-novel in the sense that it consistently diminishes any sense of its own possibilities. It lurches from misanthropic farce to dissociated tragedy, from philosophical speculation to sarcastic sideswipes at the luminaries of recent French thought. The situationist Debord appears merely in a reference to his suicide, committed for no other reason than that he could not bear the thought of his own physical decline, while Gilles Deleuze inspires \"lengthy intellectual justifications of porn\" from a minor blue-movie starlet. </p> <p>Much of Houellebecq's barely concealed rage is directed towards the incapacity of those in the ivory towers to deal with the big questions: religion, sex and death. Tellingly, the reclusive Michel plucks a Christian tract out of a rubbish bin and, after casually perusing it, turns instead to a shopping catalogue, in which he finds \"a more thoughtful, historically informed insight into Europe's current malaise\". But while Michel is simultaneously repelled and attracted by the blandishments of consumer society, his creator offers the reader no corresponding solace. His vision of a post-existentialist, rationalist world, in which any attempts at human happiness are not only doomed but risibly beside the point, is completely without mitigation. </p> <p>Do we take Houellebecq seriously? Atomised is so complex in its subject matter, and yet so excessively repulsive in its execution, that it verges, at times, on adolescent foot-stamping. It allows little room for the reader to take issue with it, so defiantly pessimistic are its parameters and its conclusions. And although it is a novel of evident stature, which immediately invites comparison with writers such as Celine, Beckett and Camus, it also deliberately situates itself outside any such canon. </p> <p>There is little so radical or reductive that it can't be absorbed into the mainstream, which underlines Houellebecq's various points about the velvet jackboot of consumerism. And yet, finishing this book, one is genuinely excited by its author's daring and conviction, even when that conviction reads like an elaborate practical joke. One hesitates to say that Houellebecq is the Next Big Thing, but he may be the best we see for a long time.</p>",

Braving violent gusts of pathetic fallacy, five people disembark from a boat on a Swiss lake. They are Byron, Shelley, Mary Shelley, Claire Clairmont and Byron's secretary, John Polidori. Staying at the Villa Diodati, they will embark on the famous yarn-spinning contest that leads to the composition of Frankenstein. </p> <p>Polidori is wracked by literary envy of his master, so the group is amazed when he reads them his brilliant entry, The Vampyre. But the novel has been written by a monstrous crone, Annette Legrand, who, with her two sisters, travels the world drinking semen in order to survive. Polidori must pay for the manuscript with his own tasty seed. </p> <p>This dark lady explains her predicament in a series of letters. She began life as a slimy, ratlike adjunct to the birth of two beautiful sisters. When it became clear that if one were to die, they all would, she was allowed to flee, and grew up underground cultivating her remarkable literary powers in the usual manner, by eating books. </p> <p>The story unfolds through a mixture of mannered narration of life with the holidaying poets and epistolary Gothic pastiche, as Annette softens up the secretary for her demands on his testicles. It is translated from Spanish by the estimable Alberto Manguel, and the result is a superficial, velvety elegance, but Manguel cannot do much with the jarring cliches of Andahazi's characterisation - Shelley is \"graceful as a gazelle\"; Byron is given to \"sulky brooding\". </p> <p>There is a desultory interpolation of suspense as a young man is murdered on the lake, but otherwise the narrative proceeds with a lazy, becalmed inevitability. And the skeletal pastiche sadly fails to play by the rules it has chosen. It is framed with a fictional foreword by a modern scholar who has found some hitherto undiscovered documents, thanks to a helpful eccentric who calls himself a \"teratologist\", a taxonomist of monsters. But The Merciful Women fails as a contribution to the teratological imagination because Annette remains defiantly unmonstrous. We are constantly reassured that she is covered with hair and weeping pustules, but that wouldn't get her an entry into a Pok\u00e9mon game, let alone a bestiary of the abominable. </p> <p>What she can do is write books in return for manly elixir. But why are such bargains struck for certain men when her siblings have taken to killing other victims after milking them dry? The sisters' mercy is merely an arbitrary fix that allows the writer to get his story onto the page. The best horror fiction works to a relentless calculus of cause and effect: the axioms may be fantastical, but they combine in consistent ways. The Merciful Women therefore fails as horror, and the reader of this comically gynophobic confection is left, as presumably are its titular antiheroines, with a faintly sour taste in the mouth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Merciful Women Federico Andahazi Doubleday, \u00a312.99, 188pp Buy it at BOL It is a dark and stormy afternoon in 1816. Braving violent gusts of pathetic fallacy, five people disembark from a boat on a Swiss lake. They are Byron, Shelley, Mary Shelley, Claire Clairmont and Byron's secretary, John Polidori. Staying at the Villa Diodati, they will embark on the famous yarn-spinning contest that leads to the composition of Frankenstein. Polidori is wracked by literary envy of his master, so the group is amazed when he reads them his brilliant entry, The Vampyre. But the novel has been written by a monstrous crone, Annette Legrand, who, with her two sisters, travels the world drinking semen in order to survive. Polidori must pay for the manuscript with his own tasty seed. This dark lady explains her predicament in a series of letters. She began life as a slimy, ratlike adjunct to the birth of two beautiful sisters. When it became clear that if one were to die, they all would, she was allowed to flee, and grew up underground cultivating her remarkable literary powers in the usual manner, by eating books. The story unfolds through a mixture of mannered narration of life with the holidaying poets and epistolary Gothic pastiche, as Annette softens up the secretary for her demands on his testicles. It is translated from Spanish by the estimable Alberto Manguel, and the result is a superficial, velvety elegance, but Manguel cannot do much with the jarring cliches of Andahazi's characterisation - Shelley is \"graceful as a gazelle\"; Byron is given to \"sulky brooding\". There is a desultory interpolation of suspense as a young man is murdered on the lake, but otherwise the narrative proceeds with a lazy, becalmed inevitability. And the skeletal pastiche sadly fails to play by the rules it has chosen. It is framed with a fictional foreword by a modern scholar who has found some hitherto undiscovered documents, thanks to a helpful eccentric who calls himself a \"teratologist\", a taxonomist of monsters. But The Merciful Women fails as a contribution to the teratological imagination because Annette remains defiantly unmonstrous. We are constantly reassured that she is covered with hair and weeping pustules, but that wouldn't get her an entry into a Pok\u00e9mon game, let alone a bestiary of the abominable. What she can do is write books in return for manly elixir. But why are such bargains struck for certain men when her siblings have taken to killing other victims after milking them dry? The sisters' mercy is merely an arbitrary fix that allows the writer to get his story onto the page. The best horror fiction works to a relentless calculus of cause and effect: the axioms may be fantastical, but they combine in consistent ways. The Merciful Women therefore fails as horror, and the reader of this comically gynophobic confection is left, as presumably are its titular antiheroines, with a faintly sour taste in the mouth.",

Poet or lesbian: it's a tough call. At least we know that she was a poet, probably the greatest lyric poet of ancient Greece, and a native of the island of Lesbos, living around 600BC. That she was a lesbian is pure conjecture, based on some indisputably gendered grammar and scurrilous gossip about the cult of Aphrodite. But it's not easy to scotch a rumour that's been doing the rounds for 2,600 years - as many anxious gentleman scholars of Sappho have discovered. </p> <p>Plato's \"tenth Muse\" has been enjoying something of a revival lately; the last few years have seen a rush of Sappho translations, editions and critical works, inspired in part by a new generation of scholarship in ancient Greek and in part by the growth industries of feminist studies and lesbian critical theory. </p> <p>Margaret Reynolds's blockbuster anthology of Sapphorabilia, The Sappho Companion, clearly marks out its stake within this academic milieu, but has been designed to appeal well beyond the library. Lovingly researched and admirably readable, it is a book to return to at leisure rather than to plough through and reshelve. </p> <p>As well as a fascinating narrative of the Sappho story, it includes a selection of the original fragments, a taste of the variety of their translations, and a kaleidoscopic catalogue of literary and artistic Sapphic reinventions through the ages. All of which show, argues Reynolds, that Sappho is at once whatever you want her to be and ultimately elusive: \" 'Sappho' is not a name, much less a person. It is, rather, a space. A space for filling in the gaps, joining up the dots, making something out of nothing.\" </p> <p>What has been made out of nothing really is quite something. Sappho has been reincarnated by other writers since as early as the fourth century BC, just 200 years after her death. Refracted through the looking glass of scholars, translators, poets, dramatists, librettists, artists, sculptors, suffragists and lesbian acolytes, she has been mother, muse, wife, predatory lesbian, victim of unrequited heterosexual love, prostitute, bluestocking, dominatrix, exile, philosophical ideal and tragic suicide.</p> <p>In the first century BC, Catullus made her the quintessential poet of love. Not long after, Ovid bitchily reinvented her as a dowdy ex-lesbian. In the 18th century, Pope's even bitchier reworking of Ovid would be largely responsible for \"Sappho\" becoming a term of abuse directed at women writers. </p> <p>The medieval intellectual Christine de Pisan made her an intellectual; the Elizabethan playwright John Lyly made her Elizabeth I; and John Donne made her himself, or himself her. Edmund Burke made her an icon of the sublime, while Madame de Sta\u00ebl made her Corinne, or Italy.</p> <p>The Romantics invoked her; Christina Rossetti empathised with her; and Queen Christina of Sweden blamed her for arousing her passions with That Chambermaid. Baudelaire and Swinburne wanted both to be her and to possess her. Natalie Barney and Ren\u00e9e Vivien wanted both to be her and to dress up like her. Ezra Pound and HD wanted to strip her down and Virginia Woolf wanted to play her up. Monique Wittig and Judy Grahn wanted her to come out in violet. Pat Califia wanted her to come out in leather. Eventually, there was nowhere left for her just to sit still and be a poet. </p> <p>Jeanette Winterson's Sappho wants to know, \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY POEMS?\" But the problem is that the poems are fiction, too. None of Sappho's work was written down during her lifetime, and all that remains of her lost nine books, beyond the snippets recorded by near-contemporaries after her death, are the famous fragments: dog-eared scraps of old papyrus, themselves fictions of quotation, memory and invention, dating from the second or third centuries AD and miraculously dug up from a rubbish dump in Egypt at the turn of the last century.</p> <p>And yet, coming upon her for the first time, you find that she is already in your bones, her tropes so stealthily absorbed into our symbolic world that they have become clich\u00e9s - which is to say, expressions of archetypal truth. How could moonlight not always have been silvery, or desire a fire beneath the skin and a roaring in the ears? </p> <p>Reynolds offers a Sappho for our time in the cool, impassioned, muscular tones of translators such as Mary Barnard, Josephine Balmer and David Constantine, and in the structured metre, pace and space of reinventors Eavan Boland, Anne Carson and Ruth Padel. Of course, Reynolds's muse - \"difficult, diffuse, many-syllabled, many-minded, vigorous and hard\" - is as revealing of its author as the fictions that precede it. Her Sappho - butch, proud and prone to silences - is not afraid of leaving gaps unfilled; of beckoning, bittersweet and hard to get, from the future. One of Sappho's fragments says simply: \"Someone, I say to you, / will think of us / in some future time\". She can have had no idea.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Margaret Thatcher Volume One: The Grocer's Daughter </strong> <br>John Campbell <br>Jonathan Cape, \u00a325, 512pp</p> <p>First, a brief exercise in what-if history. It is autumn 1978. Heartened by a clutch of broadly favourable opinion polls, and after a starring appearance at the TUC conference, James Callaghan decides to go to the country. The short, bitter election campaign that follows is dominated by some unexpectedly useful economic statistics and a serious Tory gaffe over immigration. The trades unions are cajoled into issuing a policy statement that could just be decoded as implying support for further wage restraint. In the end, Labour wins a small but workable majority. </p> <p>Rattled by its third election defeat in four years, the Conservative Party implodes into civil war. Margaret Thatcher is pushed out by a cabal of grandees (Whitelaw, Pym, Gilmour et al) who then steer through, oh, I don't know, James Prior or Geoffrey Howe as a \"unity\" candidate. The Winter of Discontent, the Social Democratic Party and the Falklands don't happen, Labour wins a fourth election in a row and Thatcher - for the past three years an embittered backbench sybil surrounded by a dissident fringe - resigns her seat to run the Open University. </p> <p>Now, none of this sounds especially plausible or even - let us be honest - desirable, does it? And yet Callaghan very nearly did go to the country late in 1978 (Melvyn Bragg wrote a novel about this phantom election, Autumn Manoeuvres). Had he done so, there was a fair chance of victory. Had he won, the break-up and reformation of the Old Left - a virtual guarantee of Thatcher's two subsequent landslides - would probably still have happened, but in a much less dramatic and more electorally manageable way. </p> <p>All down to luck, then - a commodity with which Thatcher the politician, as John Campbell shows in the first half of a planned two-volume life, was almost effortlessly endowed. Her rise to the top of the Tories' greasy pole early in 1975 was, as he points out, achieved only by way of some swingeing strokes of good fortune.</p> <p>Heath could have held on, had he immediately submitted himself for re-election after the October 1974 defeat, but he queered his pitch by petulance. Sir Keith Joseph, the Right's standard-bearer, blew it with an injudicious speech about the underclass. Edward du Cann, who could have had the leadership on a plate at one point, found that his business affairs wouldn't stand up to the inevitable public scrutiny. Helped by an astute campaign manager, Airey Neave, party-wide dislike of Heath and some particularly weedy opponents, Mrs Thatcher found herself borne aloft on a tide of grassroots adulation to the party throne. </p> <p>Perhaps, on the other hand, the charmed political life that she led in the mid-1970s was merely a reward for early tenacity. While the account of her formative years in The Grocer's Daughter lacks something of the drama occasionally offered in the council-slum-to-Westminster biographies of one or two (but not many) Labour politicians, nobody should doubt the very real obstacles that the young Miss Roberts had to climb over in order to make something of her life. </p> <p>Of course dad was a local politician-cum-shopkeeper (Mrs Roberts looks simply to have vanished from her daughter's memory), of course she made it to grammar school, but her adolescent life seems to have consisted of laborious progress along a path measured out in exacting toll-gates: schoolmistresses who doubted her ability (she enjoyed snubbing them on celebrity revisits); snooty, left-leaning dons who frankly despised the religious and conservative tradesman's daughter for not being \"one of us\".</p> <p>Campbell's Oxford chapter is particularly revealing of a dogged, lonely girl, occupying time not spent in the labs with solitary walks and the John Wesley Society, and patronised rotten by her tutors. The retrospective verdicts pronounced by Somerville luminaries such as Janet Vaughan and Dorothy Hodgkin (sample: \"She was a perfectly adequate chemist. I mean, nobody thought anything of her\") seem peculiarly malicious, if only because of their skewed values - such Olympian academic standards used to judge a 19-year-old barely disguise the fact that the snub is a reward for present, not past, inadequacies. </p> <p>What was the young Miss Roberts like? All Campbell's evidence, whether from college contemporaries, twenty-something onlookers or later political colleagues, tells the same story: fanatically hard-working, bursting with drive and enthusiasm, let down by a lack of \"imagination\". When given a task to accomplish - finals, bar exams, or, in 1950 and 1951, election campaigns in a hopeless Labour seat - she simply got on with it, won golden opinions and, occasionally, scared people with the intensity of her application. </p> <p>The political ambitions, in place since college days, were boosted by what might be called her defining stroke of luck - marriage to the wealthy divorc\u00e9 whose modest fortune effectively subsidised her ascent through the Tory hierarchy. Even then, though - even with Denis, the twins and their nannies - it was a struggle.</p> <p>Safe Home Counties seats in the 1950s wanted decorous ex-public schoolboys. Once in parliament, on the 1959 Macmillan floodtide, she was a ripe target for cheery Labour chauvinism. Dispatch-box appearances in the role of pensions minister were punctuated by banter about \"vital statistics\". Showing the first hint of the unworldliness that characterised her political life, Thatcher often brought her own innuendoes to the chamber. \"I have got a really hot figure...\" she innocently proposed at one point. </p> <p>As Campbell shows, the young parliamentarian was an isolated figure - spurned by the grandees, thought overly \"suburban\" by her peers. Her efficiency was undeniable, though, and the role of the party's 1960s \"token woman\" seemed to have been made for her. Heath put her in his 1970 cabinet as education secretary, and subsequently appointed her to the shadow Treasury team fighting the 1974 finance bill. In giving her the chance to shine in front of an appreciative Tory audience, he probably sealed his own doom. </p> <p>Like his earlier life of Heath, Campbell's biography is brilliantly - and horribly - acute. With diligent research among the Conservative Central Office archives and a sharp eye for the amnesiac wool-pulling practised in the subject's own memoirs, he locates the roots of the Thatcher agenda - roll back the state, individual freedom, the whole updated Manchester liberal package - far back in her career. At the same time she was an enthusiastic trimmer when circumstances demanded it: chary of privatisation when the mid-1960s consensus frowned upon it, and as education secretary offering notably little resistance to the Croslandite reforms, outlined in circular 10/65, which secured the forward march of the comprehensive schools. </p> <p>The book ends with its subject quoting Gide on the steps of Downing Street, already a markedly different creature from the woman with the mumsy hairstyle and splendiferous teeth who had won the leadership four years before. As Campbell winningly demonstrates, the spin doctors got hold of her at a relatively early stage, played up the lower-middle-class background (Denis's wealth was conveniently forgotten) and trammelled the rhetoric to produce a series of provocative but oddly insubstantial implications.</p> <p>The 1978 immigration speeches were a classic example of hinting a great deal but saying remarkably little: Campbell shrewdly calls it a \"measure of her political weakness... that she was obliged to hint at attitudes whose implications she could not fully expound, but a mark of her political skills that she was able to do so successfully\".</p> <p>How did she do it? Unlike the majority of left-wing critics of the past 20 years, who allowed their distaste for Thatcher to blind them to the nature of her appeal and the feebleness of her opponents, Campbell is in no doubt as to her allure for millions of exasperated middle-class voters in 1979. Exhausted state corporatism and self-aggrandising trades unions were no match for the values of the god-fearing, counter-jumping petit bourgeoisie. Like many another newly enfranchised 18-year-old, I voted Conservative in 1979. At the time it seemed a perfectly straightforward reaction to the stew of rubbish, lies and refusal to face facts that marked out the 1970s. As Campbell's second volume will no doubt show, the embarrassment - and the regret - came later.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Margaret Thatcher Volume One: The Grocer's Daughter John Campbell Jonathan Cape, \u00a325, 512pp First, a brief exercise in what-if history. It is autumn 1978. Heartened by a clutch of broadly favourable opinion polls, and after a starring appearance at the TUC conference, James Callaghan decides to go to the country. The short, bitter election campaign that follows is dominated by some unexpectedly useful economic statistics and a serious Tory gaffe over immigration. The trades unions are cajoled into issuing a policy statement that could just be decoded as implying support for further wage restraint. In the end, Labour wins a small but workable majority. Rattled by its third election defeat in four years, the Conservative Party implodes into civil war. Margaret Thatcher is pushed out by a cabal of grandees (Whitelaw, Pym, Gilmour et al) who then steer through, oh, I don't know, James Prior or Geoffrey Howe as a \"unity\" candidate. The Winter of Discontent, the Social Democratic Party and the Falklands don't happen, Labour wins a fourth election in a row and Thatcher - for the past three years an embittered backbench sybil surrounded by a dissident fringe - resigns her seat to run the Open University. Now, none of this sounds especially plausible or even - let us be honest - desirable, does it? And yet Callaghan very nearly did go to the country late in 1978 (Melvyn Bragg wrote a novel about this phantom election, Autumn Manoeuvres). Had he done so, there was a fair chance of victory. Had he won, the break-up and reformation of the Old Left - a virtual guarantee of Thatcher's two subsequent landslides - would probably still have happened, but in a much less dramatic and more electorally manageable way. All down to luck, then - a commodity with which Thatcher the politician, as John Campbell shows in the first half of a planned two-volume life, was almost effortlessly endowed. Her rise to the top of the Tories' greasy pole early in 1975 was, as he points out, achieved only by way of some swingeing strokes of good fortune. Heath could have held on, had he immediately submitted himself for re-election after the October 1974 defeat, but he queered his pitch by petulance. Sir Keith Joseph, the Right's standard-bearer, blew it with an injudicious speech about the underclass. Edward du Cann, who could have had the leadership on a plate at one point, found that his business affairs wouldn't stand up to the inevitable public scrutiny. Helped by an astute campaign manager, Airey Neave, party-wide dislike of Heath and some particularly weedy opponents, Mrs Thatcher found herself borne aloft on a tide of grassroots adulation to the party throne. Perhaps, on the other hand, the charmed political life that she led in the mid-1970s was merely a reward for early tenacity. While the account of her formative years in The Grocer's Daughter lacks something of the drama occasionally offered in the council-slum-to-Westminster biographies of one or two (but not many) Labour politicians, nobody should doubt the very real obstacles that the young Miss Roberts had to climb over in order to make something of her life. Of course dad was a local politician-cum-shopkeeper (Mrs Roberts looks simply to have vanished from her daughter's memory), of course she made it to grammar school, but her adolescent life seems to have consisted of laborious progress along a path measured out in exacting toll-gates: schoolmistresses who doubted her ability (she enjoyed snubbing them on celebrity revisits); snooty, left-leaning dons who frankly despised the religious and conservative tradesman's daughter for not being \"one of us\". Campbell's Oxford chapter is particularly revealing of a dogged, lonely girl, occupying time not spent in the labs with solitary walks and the John Wesley Society, and patronised rotten by her tutors. The retrospective verdicts pronounced by Somerville luminaries such as Janet Vaughan and Dorothy Hodgkin (sample: \"She was a perfectly adequate chemist. I mean, nobody thought anything of her\") seem peculiarly malicious, if only because of their skewed values - such Olympian academic standards used to judge a 19-year-old barely disguise the fact that the snub is a reward for present, not past, inadequacies. What was the young Miss Roberts like? All Campbell's evidence, whether from college contemporaries, twenty-something onlookers or later political colleagues, tells the same story: fanatically hard-working, bursting with drive and enthusiasm, let down by a lack of \"imagination\". When given a task to accomplish - finals, bar exams, or, in 1950 and 1951, election campaigns in a hopeless Labour seat - she simply got on with it, won golden opinions and, occasionally, scared people with the intensity of her application. The political ambitions, in place since college days, were boosted by what might be called her defining stroke of luck - marriage to the wealthy divorc\u00e9 whose modest fortune effectively subsidised her ascent through the Tory hierarchy. Even then, though - even with Denis, the twins and their nannies - it was a struggle. Safe Home Counties seats in the 1950s wanted decorous ex-public schoolboys. Once in parliament, on the 1959 Macmillan floodtide, she was a ripe target for cheery Labour chauvinism. Dispatch-box appearances in the role of pensions minister were punctuated by banter about \"vital statistics\". Showing the first hint of the unworldliness that characterised her political life, Thatcher often brought her own innuendoes to the chamber. \"I have got a really hot figure...\" she innocently proposed at one point. As Campbell shows, the young parliamentarian was an isolated figure - spurned by the grandees, thought overly \"suburban\" by her peers. Her efficiency was undeniable, though, and the role of the party's 1960s \"token woman\" seemed to have been made for her. Heath put her in his 1970 cabinet as education secretary, and subsequently appointed her to the shadow Treasury team fighting the 1974 finance bill. In giving her the chance to shine in front of an appreciative Tory audience, he probably sealed his own doom. Like his earlier life of Heath, Campbell's biography is brilliantly - and horribly - acute. With diligent research among the Conservative Central Office archives and a sharp eye for the amnesiac wool-pulling practised in the subject's own memoirs, he locates the roots of the Thatcher agenda - roll back the state, individual freedom, the whole updated Manchester liberal package - far back in her career. At the same time she was an enthusiastic trimmer when circumstances demanded it: chary of privatisation when the mid-1960s consensus frowned upon it, and as education secretary offering notably little resistance to the Croslandite reforms, outlined in circular 10/65, which secured the forward march of the comprehensive schools. The book ends with its subject quoting Gide on the steps of Downing Street, already a markedly different creature from the woman with the mumsy hairstyle and splendiferous teeth who had won the leadership four years before. As Campbell winningly demonstrates, the spin doctors got hold of her at a relatively early stage, played up the lower-middle-class background (Denis's wealth was conveniently forgotten) and trammelled the rhetoric to produce a series of provocative but oddly insubstantial implications. The 1978 immigration speeches were a classic example of hinting a great deal but saying remarkably little: Campbell shrewdly calls it a \"measure of her political weakness... that she was obliged to hint at attitudes whose implications she could not fully expound, but a mark of her political skills that she was able to do so successfully\". How did she do it? Unlike the majority of left-wing critics of the past 20 years, who allowed their distaste for Thatcher to blind them to the nature of her appeal and the feebleness of her opponents, Campbell is in no doubt as to her allure for millions of exasperated middle-class voters in 1979. Exhausted state corporatism and self-aggrandising trades unions were no match for the values of the god-fearing, counter-jumping petit bourgeoisie. Like many another newly enfranchised 18-year-old, I voted Conservative in 1979. At the time it seemed a perfectly straightforward reaction to the stew of rubbish, lies and refusal to face facts that marked out the 1970s. As Campbell's second volume will no doubt show, the embarrassment - and the regret - came later.",

But Mr Taylor has also breathed fresh life into a pseudo-issue: flags. He wants to make sure the Union Jack flies from official buildings during public holidays. With self-serving gestures like this, which make life so much tougher for Mr Trimble and all those who seek peace, it is hard to believe that anything would ever be enough. The likes of Jeffrey Donaldson and Martin Smyth, Unionism's no-men, would surely reject even a white flag waved by Sinn Fein and the IRA - complaining that the republicans had not sung God Save the Queen as they offered their surrender. Still, Mr Trimble and his fellow accommodationists ought not lose heart. BBC Northern Ireland this week conducted an admirably thorough survey of opinion in the province. It found that two in three UUP voters want the party to go back into the executive in time for the May 22 deadline. Even if the margin in the 858-member council will be much narrower than that, Mr Trimble need not fear for his political life nor the life of the peace process. For the hardliners in the council are not in step with the party's own electorate. According to the BBC poll, those Unionist voters are with their leader - and for peace.",
