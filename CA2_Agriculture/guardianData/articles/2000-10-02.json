The factsheet, while helpful, places the burden on consumers to get hold of the information and then contact firms and work out compensation, it added.</p> <p>Comments from FSA chairman Howard Davies that endowment customers have fared better than repayment ones were dismissed as ridiculous. A spokesperson for the Consumers Association said: \"People took out endowments because they thought they would pay of their mortgages. To say someone paying endowment premiums over the past 10 years will have paid out less and, therefore, be better off than someone paying by repayment is irrelevant and ridiculous. Less money may have left the endowment policyholder's bank account, but they still don't have enough money to repay their mortgage and will need to increase the monthly payment. On the other hand, someone using a repayment policy will have paid off significant amounts of their mortgage and, in our opinion, have fared significantly better than endowment holders.\"</p> <p>The endowments selling fiasco centres on the projections customers were given for the growth of their policy when they bought it. Many were quoted annual growth rates of between 8% and 11% and had premiums set accordingly. But policies have only been growing at around 6% or 7% a year, leaving customers with endowments that will not pay off their mortgage at maturity. </p> <p>Research by the Guardian in April revealed that up to 3m UK households could be affected by a shortfall, some by as much as 40%. These policyholders have several options, including increasing their monthly premiums, cashing the policy or taking out an additional mortgage product to pay of the shortfall.</p>",

The factsheet, while helpful, places the burden on consumers to get hold of the information and then contact firms and work out compensation, it added. Comments from FSA chairman Howard Davies that endowment customers have fared better than repayment ones were dismissed as ridiculous. A spokesperson for the Consumers Association said: \"People took out endowments because they thought they would pay of their mortgages. To say someone paying endowment premiums over the past 10 years will have paid out less and, therefore, be better off than someone paying by repayment is irrelevant and ridiculous. Less money may have left the endowment policyholder's bank account, but they still don't have enough money to repay their mortgage and will need to increase the monthly payment. On the other hand, someone using a repayment policy will have paid off significant amounts of their mortgage and, in our opinion, have fared significantly better than endowment holders.\" The endowments selling fiasco centres on the projections customers were given for the growth of their policy when they bought it. Many were quoted annual growth rates of between 8% and 11% and had premiums set accordingly. But policies have only been growing at around 6% or 7% a year, leaving customers with endowments that will not pay off their mortgage at maturity. Research by the Guardian in April revealed that up to 3m UK households could be affected by a shortfall, some by as much as 40%. These policyholders have several options, including increasing their monthly premiums, cashing the policy or taking out an additional mortgage product to pay of the shortfall.",

Redknapp was speaking for all of the claret-and-blue persuasion when he declared: \"It'll be a bad weekend for me.\" </p> <p>Redknapp's almost weekly brave words predicting a top-half finish - repeated here despite his diatribe - are beginning to drift away on the wind. And expectations will drop as inevitably as the autumn leaves if West Ham do not soon get a grip on early season. Even Joe Cole, the youngest of the crew, senses it. </p> <p>\"There's an inconsistency in our game that we've got to do something about,\" said the 18-year-old prospective England midfielder. \"The players are not worried about it at this stage of the season. But I don't want to stand here and have egg on my face at the end of it.\" </p> <p>Cole is less troubled about England than his club. \"I want to start against Germany; it wouldn't faze me at all. I've played against German internationals like Christian Zeige and Dietmar Hamann. But I don't know at this stage whether I'm in the [final] squad or the team.\" </p> <p>The midfielder strengthened his international cause by cleverly heading in Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9's fine cross for a second goal in successive league matches but then weakened it by fading, like West Ham, after the interval. It is a trait only partially explained by man marking, first by Jamie Lawrence and then by the substitute Gunnar Halle, or by some crude earlier challenges from Bradford players. </p> <p>Bradford's manager Chris Hutchings took justified pride in his side's persistence in gaining a first goal and first point away, and by eventually subduing two \"world-class players\", but Cole is clearly not ready for a competitive international and Di Canio, on his utterly unproductive second- half performance, will not, at 32, be receiving any belated call-up from the Azzurri. </p> <p>Di Canio effectively signed off here by being booked after 83 minutes for kicking the ball away at a free-kick. The Italian would have been better advised following the example of the 19-year-old Michael Carrick, who had by now taken over the baton from Cole as West Ham midfielder to watch. This teenager provided composure, thoughtful distribution and one cunning shot that was somehow turned on to a post by Matt Clarke. </p> <p>No one was more robustly defiant for Bradford than Dean Windass - booked for a hack on Cole - and afterwards the \u00e7ity player added to Redknapp's weekend woes. \"In the second half we had them on the back foot and they didn't know what to do,\" he said. \"West Ham had a go at each other, just like they did when we were 4-2 up here last season. They've got weaknesses in defence.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Even Joe Cole, the youngest of the crew, senses it. \"There's an inconsistency in our game that we've got to do something about,\" said the 18-year-old prospective England midfielder. \"The players are not worried about it at this stage of the season. But I don't want to stand here and have egg on my face at the end of it.\" Cole is less troubled about England than his club. \"I want to start against Germany; it wouldn't faze me at all. I've played against German internationals like Christian Zeige and Dietmar Hamann. But I don't know at this stage whether I'm in the [final] squad or the team.\" The midfielder strengthened his international cause by cleverly heading in Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9's fine cross for a second goal in successive league matches but then weakened it by fading, like West Ham, after the interval. It is a trait only partially explained by man marking, first by Jamie Lawrence and then by the substitute Gunnar Halle, or by some crude earlier challenges from Bradford players. Bradford's manager Chris Hutchings took justified pride in his side's persistence in gaining a first goal and first point away, and by eventually subduing two \"world-class players\", but Cole is clearly not ready for a competitive international and Di Canio, on his utterly unproductive second- half performance, will not, at 32, be receiving any belated call-up from the Azzurri. Di Canio effectively signed off here by being booked after 83 minutes for kicking the ball away at a free-kick. The Italian would have been better advised following the example of the 19-year-old Michael Carrick, who had by now taken over the baton from Cole as West Ham midfielder to watch. This teenager provided composure, thoughtful distribution and one cunning shot that was somehow turned on to a post by Matt Clarke. No one was more robustly defiant for Bradford than Dean Windass - booked for a hack on Cole - and afterwards the \u00e7ity player added to Redknapp's weekend woes. \"In the second half we had them on the back foot and they didn't know what to do,\" he said. \"West Ham had a go at each other, just like they did when we were 4-2 up here last season. They've got weaknesses in defence.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to editor@footballunlimited.co.uk",

Fulham, nine wins on the bounce, have it sewn up and the others are competing for the minor placings. </p> <p>That theory, which became more compelling after Jean Tigana's remarkably consistent team eased their way to victory at Bolton, is a trifle harsh on Watford, who have themselves started as though the season is a sprint and not a marathon. </p> <p>This was their eighth win in nine games, they have yet to lose and, in addition to rewriting their own record books, they are assembling a strong case for an instant return to the Premiership.

      "bodyText": "September has only just slipped by but the bookies have effectively closed the betting on the First Division title race. Fulham, nine wins on the bounce, have it sewn up and the others are competing for the minor placings. That theory, which became more compelling after Jean Tigana's remarkably consistent team eased their way to victory at Bolton, is a trifle harsh on Watford, who have themselves started as though the season is a sprint and not a marathon. This was their eighth win in nine games, they have yet to lose and, in addition to rewriting their own record books, they are assembling a strong case for an instant return to the Premiership. True, Graham Taylor's side lacked something in the way of style yesterday but the defeat of a close rival gains a currency over and above the value of another three points. Two second-half goals which thankfully drew a veil over what had gone before enabled Watford to bring Fulham back into view. The gap is now two points with Watford's advantage over Bolton extended to five. \"For those of us below Fulham and Watford it's obviously a concern that they have both made such an unbelievable start,\" said Trevor Francis, the Birmingham manager. \"That was in our minds today.

They curbed soaring oil prices by coaxing Opec into production increases (aided by a controversial release of 30m barrels from the US strategic stockpile) and they intervened on the foreign exchange markets to stem what was beginning to look like the free fall of the euro. What they didn't do was address the biggest single economic problem of them all - the prospect of a hard landing for the US economy. </p> <p>Some economists believe that the US has become a miracle economy. It is now in its (unprecedented) ninth year of sustained economic growth with low inflation. For the past three years it has expanded by over 4% and this year it could even hit 5%. The fashionable theory is that the growth of the US economy - which now accounts for over 35% of all economic output in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development area - is the result of a step change in productivity growth driven by the country's pioneering exploitation of technologies related to the internet.

The 25% collapse of the euro is not the result of Eurosclerosis any more. Europe's economy is recovering quite nicely. It is the result of a tidal wave of money being invested from Europe in stocks and bonds on Wall Street and on acquiring companies.

      "bodyText": "The dramatic events in the world economy during the past two weeks may have lulled governments into a false sense of security. On the surface they have succeeded in fixing two of the main destabilising elements. They curbed soaring oil prices by coaxing Opec into production increases (aided by a controversial release of 30m barrels from the US strategic stockpile) and they intervened on the foreign exchange markets to stem what was beginning to look like the free fall of the euro. What they didn't do was address the biggest single economic problem of them all - the prospect of a hard landing for the US economy. Some economists believe that the US has become a miracle economy. It is now in its (unprecedented) ninth year of sustained economic growth with low inflation. For the past three years it has expanded by over 4% and this year it could even hit 5%.

While designing the Focus, Ford's engineers - who are obviously a nimble bunch - would climb into a Third-Age Suit in order, according to Ford's literature, \"to simulate driving capabilities of people often 30 years or more older than themselves\". The suit would slow the engineers down and restrict their movements, \"giving them a feel for the needs of an older generation\". </p> <p>I'm not sure Ford needed to consult scientists on this garment; I once had a suit from Next that had much the same effect.

Everything in the car seems to be within comfortable reach. </p> <p>If you want to sing the praises of the Focus, you have to join the queue. Only Tiger Woods has won more prizes recently. The Focus was named 2000 North American Car of the Year not long ago. It had already been awarded European Car of the Year and became the first car in the history of the awards to win both titles. It has also won its share of earnest, industry medals (What Car? gave it a Security Award for, among other things, its lockable bonnet, which should see off your local hot-wire crew) and it was nominated a Millennium Product by the Design Council. (There's a special, limited edition Millennium version of the car in a punishingly bright yellow with a Millennium Product logo stamped on its alloys, if that excites you.) </p> <p>There are more than 130,000 Ford Focuses on the road in Britain and in recent months it has been battling with its elder and now completely d\u00e9class\u00e9 sister, the Ford Fiesta, for overall dominance of the British market. And little wonder. The Focus is perhaps the first genuinely covetable Ford since the glory days of the Anglia, and a triumphant vindication for that change of heart a few years ago, whereby Ford, formerly a byword for conservatism and crashingly dull good sense, suddenly went all courageous and groovy on us, issuing the badly named but likeably different Ford Ka and the deeply svelte (for Ford) Puma and Cougar which followed it. </p> <p>Once it had seemed that the entire point of the Ford operation was to provide somewhere for young sales executives to hang their jackets. But no longer. Probably only Skoda in our time has undergone such an abrupt image reversal. That flash of white sock and whiff of wide-boy which pretty much defined Ford's output throughout the 80s was entirely missing from this new generation of incautiously designed, dead cute oddities. Gone, too, was the Ford boredom factor. (Try and say \"Ford Fiesta\" without yawning.) </p> <p>The Focus is not remotely soporific, certainly not in the Zetec variant, which gives the entry-level car a sporty makeover: moulded front seats, alloy wheels, some leather on the steering wheel, metallic dials - the usual sub-Colin McCrae gimmicks. Here, though, those features don't come across entirely as impostors. The car feels nippy and light but sturdy, as if fit for the occasional bit of rough road. </p> <p>It's also easy on the eye without being bland. The tendency of modern cars to look like tentative experiments in glass-blowing is ameliorated in the Focus by the sharp lines around the wheel arches. The same goes for the triangular side-indicators. Though definitely part of the culture of the blob, the Focus has some discernible edges, too, which is a relief. </p> <p>This is less true of the interior where - again, in common with pretty much every new car in production - the dashboard and instrument panels seem to take as their essential influence the kidney-shaped dressing table (albeit a kidney-shaped dressing table turned on its side).

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> T he London offices of iVillage UK - the US import, Tesco-backed women's network - are bereft of the usual luxuries associated with dot.coms. There are no inflatable meeting rooms, ergonomic furniture, or silk-stream air sculptures. Instead, the network that hopes to be the place where British women \"find answers\" is housed in cramped, albeit temporary, offices in a Mayfair business centre. </p> <p> Here, 25 staff slave away at 23 screens, and the walls are decorated with mission statements on photocopied A4: \"The voice of women in the UK,\" screams the first. \"It does what it says on the tin,\" instructs the second. And finally: \"Community is a group of people, being in one place with shared ownership\" (a line straight out of a Californian management consultant's manual). These precepts, explains the newly appointed editorial director, Tina Gaudoin, are at the heart of iVillage UK and how it defines itself. </p> <p> Arguably, Gaudoin herself and not the product strategy is iVillage's best-kept secret weapon. Rival UK women's portals scoff and say the Yanks - despite having launched the largest women's network in the world, last valued at \u00a3150m - will never get inside the head of the British public. But with Gaudoin - former deputy editor of Tatler, Times writer and founding editor of high- brow fashion magazine Frank - iVillage has bought in a piece of the British establishment and ensured an experienced editorial team, from print, TV and radio journalism. </p> <p> Gaudoin has the added attraction for her US employers of having worked in the States for several years (writing for the New York Times, Mirabella, American Vogue and Harper's Bazaar); indeed she met iVillage's CEO, Candice Carpenter, while working on an upmarket home-shopping channel. The story goes that Carpenter, who has been seeking an editorial captain since January, brought in Gaudoin as a consultant, and in the middle of a meeting clicked her fingers and said, \"Heck, Tina , why don't you do it?\" Or something like that. </p> <p> It must have been a tempting pay packet (pushing six figures) to lure her away from Triyoga, the yoga centre she has set up, her two young children and an easy freelance writing gig. \"It was the community model that attracted me,\" says Gaudoin, who admits she had no experience of online editing. \"It's completely different from a women's magazine: this is a bottom-up medium. You look at what members want and provide programming around it. It's about providing a place where people can share experiences - where you can get advice on getting your figure back into shape from, say, a mum in Cornwall. Real women providing real advice.\" </p> <p> She cites a case history from the US site where one woman posted a desperate plea: \"Help, someone! I want to murder my three-year-old!\" This stimulated a huge Samaritan-style response and an online debate about child abuse which went on for weeks. The parenting channel, with chatroom, message boards and online experts, is one of the first to be developed on the UK site (still at demo stage) along with others devoted to beauty, careers, relationships, diet and fitness and computers and the internet. </p> <p> iVillage US now claims 9m unique visitors a month (1m more than women.com, its main competitor). When it launched five years ago, it was hailed as a political movement: a network for women by women, to improve their lives, counteract ignorance and promote solidarity and \"speaking out\". Its UK sibling tried out its political wings at last week's Labour conference with a debate hosted by Cherie Blair. It is also working to promote affordable childcare and fairer deals for mothers. Whether British women will embrace this right-on variety of US community en masse remains to be seen. </p> <p> Gaudoin faced a similar challenge in 1997 with Frank, when she attempted to break the glossy mould by combining politics with attitude and frocks. It didn't sell well enough, however, and was pulled last year. Apart from the \"tell it like it is\" approach, Gaudoin insists, the comparison ends there. Fashion comes way down the agenda with iVillage. \"It's not about being glossy and glamorous,\" she says. \"It's about providing answers for women. I don't think it needs 'an identity' in the same way a glossy magazine does. But I think we can assume women don't just want to know about lipsticks and frocks.\" </p> <p> Unlike Associated New Media's Charlotte Street and IPC's Beme - which one year on are consolidating into niched areas - iVillage intends to stay broad spectrum, aiming at ages 24 to 55. It has the advantage over its competitors of having five years of market research to justify its decision and has built up a detailed profile of its already existing UK visitors from their marital status to their cornflakes. No UK publisher can claim that. \"Women don't have a lot of time. They come to iVillage to find answers. Once they've got them, they leave,\" says the US head of marketing, Hilary Graves. </p> <p> \"It's a bit like the Tesco philosophy: why go anywhere else when you can get the information all in one place?\" says Gaudoin (hence \"what it says on the tin\"). The content, she says, is already \"pretty deep\" (the parenting channel has 800 articles), but it will take at least 18 months before it has the girth of the mother site. High-profile writers she can confirm include Sally Ann Lasson (famous for having a high-society affair) on dating, Annabel Heseltine (political and news analysis) and Christine Hill (leading ante- and postnatal expert). </p> <p> Both iVillage and its fellow US \u00e9migr\u00e9e, women.com, differentiate themselves from the current market leader, Handbag.com (which has just announced 312,158 unique users for July), by being \"deeper and richer in content\" and providing \"more interactive tools\". For some reason these tools - which include everything from a prenatal calendar, to a self- explanatory Make over O-matic and the more elusive Keyboard Yoga - are seen as unique selling points. </p> <p> Unlike other UK women's sites, however, which are desperate for commerce, Gaudoin is keen to distance iVillage from the online shopping mall experience. So what does Tesco get for the \u00a312m plus \u00a325m marketing budget it has pledged over three years - apart from its 50% stake? Ostensibly, it's satisfied with being the exclusive online grocer and having tie-in promotions and click-to-buys on the parenting and food channels. </p> <p> On advertising and sponsorship revenue alone, iVillage UK will have to stretch the Tesco cash for three years, when it is calculated it will break even. Whether or not Gaudoin will be around to witness the red figures turning to black - with a young family and ambitions still to get back into print journalism it seems unlikely - she wants to make it \"the market leader\". \"In the US, we know what works\", she says, rather incongruously.</p>",

      "bodyText": "T he London offices of iVillage UK - the US import, Tesco-backed women's network - are bereft of the usual luxuries associated with dot.coms. There are no inflatable meeting rooms, ergonomic furniture, or silk-stream air sculptures. Instead, the network that hopes to be the place where British women \"find answers\" is housed in cramped, albeit temporary, offices in a Mayfair business centre. Here, 25 staff slave away at 23 screens, and the walls are decorated with mission statements on photocopied A4: \"The voice of women in the UK,\" screams the first. \"It does what it says on the tin,\" instructs the second. And finally: \"Community is a group of people, being in one place with shared ownership\" (a line straight out of a Californian management consultant's manual). These precepts, explains the newly appointed editorial director, Tina Gaudoin, are at the heart of iVillage UK and how it defines itself. Arguably, Gaudoin herself and not the product strategy is iVillage's best-kept secret weapon. Rival UK women's portals scoff and say the Yanks - despite having launched the largest women's network in the world, last valued at \u00a3150m - will never get inside the head of the British public. But with Gaudoin - former deputy editor of Tatler, Times writer and founding editor of high- brow fashion magazine Frank - iVillage has bought in a piece of the British establishment and ensured an experienced editorial team, from print, TV and radio journalism. Gaudoin has the added attraction for her US employers of having worked in the States for several years (writing for the New York Times, Mirabella, American Vogue and Harper's Bazaar); indeed she met iVillage's CEO, Candice Carpenter, while working on an upmarket home-shopping channel. The story goes that Carpenter, who has been seeking an editorial captain since January, brought in Gaudoin as a consultant, and in the middle of a meeting clicked her fingers and said, \"Heck, Tina , why don't you do it?\" Or something like that. It must have been a tempting pay packet (pushing six figures) to lure her away from Triyoga, the yoga centre she has set up, her two young children and an easy freelance writing gig. \"It was the community model that attracted me,\" says Gaudoin, who admits she had no experience of online editing. \"It's completely different from a women's magazine: this is a bottom-up medium. You look at what members want and provide programming around it. It's about providing a place where people can share experiences - where you can get advice on getting your figure back into shape from, say, a mum in Cornwall. Real women providing real advice.\" She cites a case history from the US site where one woman posted a desperate plea: \"Help, someone! I want to murder my three-year-old!\" This stimulated a huge Samaritan-style response and an online debate about child abuse which went on for weeks. The parenting channel, with chatroom, message boards and online experts, is one of the first to be developed on the UK site (still at demo stage) along with others devoted to beauty, careers, relationships, diet and fitness and computers and the internet. iVillage US now claims 9m unique visitors a month (1m more than women.com, its main competitor). When it launched five years ago, it was hailed as a political movement: a network for women by women, to improve their lives, counteract ignorance and promote solidarity and \"speaking out\". Its UK sibling tried out its political wings at last week's Labour conference with a debate hosted by Cherie Blair. It is also working to promote affordable childcare and fairer deals for mothers. Whether British women will embrace this right-on variety of US community en masse remains to be seen. Gaudoin faced a similar challenge in 1997 with Frank, when she attempted to break the glossy mould by combining politics with attitude and frocks. It didn't sell well enough, however, and was pulled last year. Apart from the \"tell it like it is\" approach, Gaudoin insists, the comparison ends there. Fashion comes way down the agenda with iVillage. \"It's not about being glossy and glamorous,\" she says. \"It's about providing answers for women. I don't think it needs 'an identity' in the same way a glossy magazine does. But I think we can assume women don't just want to know about lipsticks and frocks.\" Unlike Associated New Media's Charlotte Street and IPC's Beme - which one year on are consolidating into niched areas - iVillage intends to stay broad spectrum, aiming at ages 24 to 55. It has the advantage over its competitors of having five years of market research to justify its decision and has built up a detailed profile of its already existing UK visitors from their marital status to their cornflakes. No UK publisher can claim that. \"Women don't have a lot of time. They come to iVillage to find answers. Once they've got them, they leave,\" says the US head of marketing, Hilary Graves. \"It's a bit like the Tesco philosophy: why go anywhere else when you can get the information all in one place?\" says Gaudoin (hence \"what it says on the tin\"). The content, she says, is already \"pretty deep\" (the parenting channel has 800 articles), but it will take at least 18 months before it has the girth of the mother site. High-profile writers she can confirm include Sally Ann Lasson (famous for having a high-society affair) on dating, Annabel Heseltine (political and news analysis) and Christine Hill (leading ante- and postnatal expert). Both iVillage and its fellow US \u00e9migr\u00e9e, women.com, differentiate themselves from the current market leader, Handbag.com (which has just announced 312,158 unique users for July), by being \"deeper and richer in content\" and providing \"more interactive tools\". For some reason these tools - which include everything from a prenatal calendar, to a self- explanatory Make over O-matic and the more elusive Keyboard Yoga - are seen as unique selling points. Unlike other UK women's sites, however, which are desperate for commerce, Gaudoin is keen to distance iVillage from the online shopping mall experience. So what does Tesco get for the \u00a312m plus \u00a325m marketing budget it has pledged over three years - apart from its 50% stake? Ostensibly, it's satisfied with being the exclusive online grocer and having tie-in promotions and click-to-buys on the parenting and food channels. On advertising and sponsorship revenue alone, iVillage UK will have to stretch the Tesco cash for three years, when it is calculated it will break even. Whether or not Gaudoin will be around to witness the red figures turning to black - with a young family and ambitions still to get back into print journalism it seems unlikely - she wants to make it \"the market leader\". \"In the US, we know what works\", she says, rather incongruously.",

      "bodyText": "HIT Entertainment, the producer and distributor of children's TV programmes, has piled on the profits thanks to the hard work of Bob the Builder. The global success of the pre-school kids' favourite helped push up half-year pre-tax profits from \u00a33.1m to \u00a35m, on turnover of \u00a320.3m, against \u00a315.3m last year. The Bob the Builder merchandising and licensing franchise has now been sold in 100 countries. HIT's chief executive, Peter Orton, said: \"Every two to five-year-old loves to play with lorries, tractors and diggers. The TV series is beautifully crafted and it has clearly caught children's imagination.\" HIT will target the US market in the second half, after signing deals with toy giants Mattel, Hambro and Lego. The company has sold its Bob the Builder series to US children's network Nickelodeon, which will screen the 30-minute show five days a week. Mr Orton revealed that HIT had been approached by an entertainment company to produce a Bob the Builder arena show next year, though it is still reviewing the proposal. The character will also be making a bid for the coveted Christmas number one spot when he releases a single in December. Shares in HIT shares rose 3.4% to 450p.",

      "bodyText": "When President Hugo Chavez last week hosted the summit of the Organisation of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (Opec) in Venezuela's chaotic capital, Caracas, the charismatic leader launched himself as an international statesman and a champion of the developing world. For those who have followed Chavez's rise from renegade paratrooper to Venezuela's most powerful president in 43 years of democracy, the way he dominated the summit can be compared to how he has reshaped almost every other institution he has been part of. In the year and a half that he has been head of state, Chavez, aged 45, has dissolved congress, rewritten the constitution, installed allies in the judiciary, been re-elected for six years and won enhanced new executive powers. He is Latin America's most outspoken leader, counts Fidel Castro of Cuba as a close personal friend, and is not afraid to incur the wrath of the industrialised world - as he did in August when he became the first world leader to visit Saddam Hussein in Iraq since the Gulf war. Supporters of Chavez say that he is a leftwing visionary with great popular appeal who is uniquely capable of restoring the fortunes of a country where 80% live below the poverty line. But an increasing number of critics say that he is a demagogue-in-waiting, a throwback to the stereotypical Latin American strongman who relies on authoritarian rule. But Chavez, who models himself on South American independence hero Simon Bolivar, has achieved through the ballot box more than he originally attempted through violence. As a young military commander in 1992, he led a botched coup for which he spent two years in jail. On his release he traveled the country to gather support for what he calls his \"peaceful revolution\" of the oil-rich nation. Once he was elected president at the end of 1998, he launched into campaign to dismantle all the democratic institutions and replacing them with versions in his own image. He closed down the congress, setting up a temporary \"constituent assembly\" while a new constitution was written. Once the constitution was approved by a referendum, he won a general election and the new congress is filled with his supporters. He has installed military friends in many high-ranking jobs, giving him a stranglehold on the administration of the country. Even though some of Chavez's former coup plotters have broken with him, saying he has betrayed the revolution, Chavez remains overwhelmingly popular with the Venezuelan poor. He has a masterful populist touch as was evident in his folksy Opec speeches. When he ended with a traditional poem, commentators said he was being restrained - he usually breaks into song. While no one doubts that the regime that he took over from was corrupt, analysts worry that Chavez's anti-business stance and centralisation of power is simply replacing one bad system with another. Venezuela's economy is dependent on oil and Chavez has been lucky that the price has tripled since he took power. However, few believe that the price will stay as high and once it drops the country will face more difficulties. As things stand, despite Venezuela having the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East, the nation of 24m people already has one of the worst poverty rates in Latin America. With the Opec summit giving him the appearance of a world statesman, the high price of oil alleviating pressures on the economy and the six-year mandate won in August, Chavez is currently enjoying a better-than-expected political honeymoon. He now has all the powers he desired to implement his \"revolution\". But it remains to be seen whether he can bring long-term prosperity to the country that he has already renamed the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.",

      "bodyText": "Ericsson is ploughing $60m (\u00a338.7m) into a global advertising assault to spearhead its vision for the mobile internet. The campaign, through Publicis, breaks next month and incorporates TV, radio, print and outdoor ads across 15 markets, including the UK. The work will target network operators and service providers, as well as promoting awareness and understanding of mobile internet among the general public. The catchline reads \"The mobile internet. It's an everyday thing.\" Three TV executions were directed on location in Europe by J\u00f6rgen L\u00f6\u00f6f, whose previous work includes spots for Ikea and SAS in Sweden. A mixture of US and European actors were used to offer evidence of the ads' multicultural appeal. And the print campaign was shot by the photographer Kelvin Murray. John Giere, vice-president of branding and marketing communications at Ericsson, said: \"We want to break through the hype surrounding mobile internet and to present the facts clearly and simply. The campaign shows that it will not dramatically affect our lives, but instead make a lot of everyday tasks easier to manage.\" Ericsson estimates that by 2004 there will be as many as 600m users of mobile internet devices - more people than will be using fixed internet access.",

The move follows a downgrading of its share price last week by broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.</p> <p>The company is thought to be moving towards a \"hybrid\" sales model, with some dedicated sales executives working on specific magazine titles.</p> <p>Last week Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, one of Emap's two brokers, cut its credit rating from \"outperform\" to \"neutral\". The brokerage lowered Emap's target price to \u00a311.50 from \u00a313 and reduced its pre-tax profits forecast for the year to March 2001 to \u00a3137m from \u00a3143.5m and for the following year to \u00a3150m from \u00a3160.7m.</p> <p>Schroder Salomon Smith Barney would not comment on specific reasons for the share downgrade. But Merrill Lynch analyst Meg Geldens said analysts were worried about the value of the dollar, which had had a negative impact on the potential profits of Emap's parent company, as well as advertisers' qualms about Emap's cross-media sales model.</p> <p>Advertisers wishing to buy space in a consumer magazine such as Q may be encouraged to buy a package, giving them ads on Emap's music magazine programme, The Box, and online space.</p> <p>Ms Geldens said some consumer magazine brands had suffered from the company's strategy of regrouping in order to sell across platforms. \"The picture is quite mixed,\" she said. \"Radio and business to business is doing quite well, but some of the consumer magazines seem to be suffering under this model.\"</p> <p>Another media analyst, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the strategy of selling across media appeared to benefit the broadcast media at the expense of some magazine brands. He said: \"They've failed to extract the full value from magazine brands.\"</p> <p>Emap was unavailable for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Emap is understood to be refocusing its sales operations in a retreat from its cross-media sales strategy. The move follows a downgrading of its share price last week by broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. The company is thought to be moving towards a \"hybrid\" sales model, with some dedicated sales executives working on specific magazine titles. Last week Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, one of Emap's two brokers, cut its credit rating from \"outperform\" to \"neutral\". The brokerage lowered Emap's target price to \u00a311.50 from \u00a313 and reduced its pre-tax profits forecast for the year to March 2001 to \u00a3137m from \u00a3143.5m and for the following year to \u00a3150m from \u00a3160.7m. Schroder Salomon Smith Barney would not comment on specific reasons for the share downgrade. But Merrill Lynch analyst Meg Geldens said analysts were worried about the value of the dollar, which had had a negative impact on the potential profits of Emap's parent company, as well as advertisers' qualms about Emap's cross-media sales model. Advertisers wishing to buy space in a consumer magazine such as Q may be encouraged to buy a package, giving them ads on Emap's music magazine programme, The Box, and online space. Ms Geldens said some consumer magazine brands had suffered from the company's strategy of regrouping in order to sell across platforms. \"The picture is quite mixed,\" she said. \"Radio and business to business is doing quite well, but some of the consumer magazines seem to be suffering under this model.\" Another media analyst, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the strategy of selling across media appeared to benefit the broadcast media at the expense of some magazine brands. He said: \"They've failed to extract the full value from magazine brands.\" Emap was unavailable for comment.",

A Kremlin statement issued while Mr Putin was flying to India on a visit referred to both men as candidates in the second round of the Yugoslav presidential election - an implicit recognition of the official first round results. \"As president of Russia I am prepared to receive in the next few days in Moscow both candidates who have gone through to the second round...to discuss means of finding a way out of the current situation,\" the statement said.

How can you have a ceasefire between stones and guns. It's a big joke,\" said Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, who is in charge of security cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli forces. \"The only possibility for ceasefire is to remove a military camp from our territory. They must take their boot off our heads.\"</p> <p>By yesterday afternoon, every Palestinian in Gaza appeared to have seen the sickening television footage of Rami's death. Hit by four bullets, he collapsed in his father's arms on Saturday, after cowering behind a concrete water butt during a gun battle between the Israelis in their armoured watchtowers and Palestinian youths.</p> <p>His father, who was hit by eight bullets, had waved desperately at the Israelis on the other side of the junction to let his son live. But the 15 craters in the patch of wall where they were trapped make it plain that the Israelis directed their machine guns on the pair.

They see the fortress at Netzarim as a symbol of the fact that there is no sign of peace, or of a Palestinian state.</p> <p>\"We see our kids dying and we can not help them,\" Gen Ali raged. \"They [the Israelis] are terrorists. Even though they are wearing army uniforms, that is exactly what they are.\"</p> <p>The protests have cast a powerful spell on the young. Yesterday children as young as six and eight set up roadblocks of burning tyres on roads in Gaza.</p> <p>A few days ago, in Rami's breeze block and corrugated tin-roofed home in the Bourij refugee camp, he was mesmerised by footage of the riots on television. \"When he saw what happened in Jerusalem on TV, he asked me: 'Can I go to join the protests in Net zarim?' I did not dare to answer him. I did not want him to go,\" said his mother, Amal.</p> <p>Death sought Rami out anyway; the boy was killed as he returned from a shopping trip to Gaza, where he and his father had looked at a used car.</p> <p>In Bourij, where nearly all of the houses have a photograph of the Dome of the Rock, they are calling Rami a martyr for Jerusalem. His mother is afraid to tell her five younger children how he died - in case they fall under the martyr's spell. \"Nothing good will come of this. We will have many more martyrs, and nothing will change,\" she said.</p> <p>And the dead will be even younger than Rami. Among those killed yesterday was a 10-year-old boy, shot dead by Israeli helicopter gunships near a Jewish enclave in the West Bank city of Nablus. Fighting raged too in the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron, and in Jerusalem security forces evacuated Jews from their holiest shrine, the Western Wall, because of tension.</p> <p>Most worrying for Mr Barak was the spread of the violence to Israel proper yesterday. In Nazareth, hundreds of masked youths threw stones at Israeli police near the spot where the angel Gabriel is believed to have foretold the birth of Jesus. One Israeli Arab was killed and dozens injured in clashes in the northern town of Umm al-Fahim.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mr Barak was adamant that it fell to the Palestinian forces - and to Mr Arafat - to end the violence. \"Absence of such activity may bring about an escalation,\" a statement from his office said. He repeated Israel's claim that it only fired on protesters when the lives of soldiers and civilians were endangered.</p> <p>In reply, Mr Arafat demanded that Israel first withdraw its forces from the entrances of Palestinian towns, and stop firing on his people. He threatened to take several \"measures\" if Israel did not stop the bloodshed in 24 hours, including an appeal to the UN security council.</p> <p>The fighting talk from both men comes despite the personal intervention of President Bill Clinton, who called on both sides to cool tempers.</p>",

In Bourij, where nearly all of the houses have a photograph of the Dome of the Rock, they are calling Rami a martyr for Jerusalem. His mother is afraid to tell her five younger children how he died - in case they fall under the martyr's spell. \"Nothing good will come of this. We will have many more martyrs, and nothing will change,\" she said. And the dead will be even younger than Rami. Among those killed yesterday was a 10-year-old boy, shot dead by Israeli helicopter gunships near a Jewish enclave in the West Bank city of Nablus. Fighting raged too in the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron, and in Jerusalem security forces evacuated Jews from their holiest shrine, the Western Wall, because of tension. Most worrying for Mr Barak was the spread of the violence to Israel proper yesterday. In Nazareth, hundreds of masked youths threw stones at Israeli police near the spot where the angel Gabriel is believed to have foretold the birth of Jesus. One Israeli Arab was killed and dozens injured in clashes in the northern town of Umm al-Fahim. Nevertheless, Mr Barak was adamant that it fell to the Palestinian forces - and to Mr Arafat - to end the violence. \"Absence of such activity may bring about an escalation,\" a statement from his office said. He repeated Israel's claim that it only fired on protesters when the lives of soldiers and civilians were endangered. In reply, Mr Arafat demanded that Israel first withdraw its forces from the entrances of Palestinian towns, and stop firing on his people. He threatened to take several \"measures\" if Israel did not stop the bloodshed in 24 hours, including an appeal to the UN security council. The fighting talk from both men comes despite the personal intervention of President Bill Clinton, who called on both sides to cool tempers.",

      "byline": "Madeleine Bunting",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>All across the country, cinemas this week are full of the discreet sniffs, surreptitious wiping of wet eyes and shuffling in seats that constitute British emotion. The cause? Billy Elliot. Already billed to shoot an unknown child actor, Jamie Bell, from Teeside to Oscar nominations, the film has moved the toughest critics to shedding more tears than they can remember. Yes, it's sentimental, the reviewers acknowledge, before going on to lavish praise on the director, Stephen Daldry. Unbelievably, it seems we're going to forgive Daldry what was regarded as unforgivable in good cinema: this film is loaded with the most blatant button-pressing sentimentality. But all of us old cynics are happily sobbing away as we hear Billy recite from memory the letter his mother wrote from her deathbed. </p> <p>What are we all crying about? Two things. The first is the intense vulnerability of a young boy, portrayed with engaging brilliance by Bell, struggling to reconcile his love of ballet with the concepts of masculinity of his Durham mining community in general and his miner father and brother in particular. The second theme is familiar but portrayed with tragic impact by using the miners' strike as the backdrop to the film: the disintegration of traditional concepts of masculinity during the mid-eighties collapse of mining and heavy industry. </p> <p>Anxiety about the vulnerability of boys is a growing cultural preoccupation. It is introducing into the long-running gender debate a revived protectiveness towards boys. Billy Elliot captures this. So does the winner of this year's John Kobal photographic award currently on exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. In the photograph, a nine-year-old boy has his back to us. His shoulders are narrow and tensed, his elbows scarred, and he faces into a blank whiteness looming above his over-large head. His thick black hair is touched with grey; he looks both old and young. It is an eerily disturbing photo of boyish defiance, fragility and the vacuum into which he is growing up. </p> <p>You don't have to be the mother of a son to worry about what kind of men we are asking boys to grow into when so many of the old role models are redundant. Male identity has always been built on the subordination of women. If girls are achieving so much more academically, how will boys accommodate women's equality? In the conclusion to his book, On Men, Anthony Clare quotes scary predictions of what faces men. Rising suicide rates, one in three men living alone and 1.5m men excluded from the workforce either because of early retirement or because they don't have the education and skills for employment. Perhaps, Clare hopes, women will find a compassionate awareness of men's insecurities, while not compromising their own legitimate self-assertion. </p> <p>The second theme of Billy Elliot is, if anything, even more painful. We constructed a masculine identity that served the industrial revolution well; we exiled men from home and children to work in factories and down mines, destroying the family units of the agrarian and pre-industrial cottage industry economy. Now heavy industry is finished, their masculinity is as redundant as their labour. Billy Elliot, like The Full Monty, is humourously playing with a history that lies heavily on the British heart: the decline of heavy manufacturing has destroyed not just communities, but souls. It was the exertions of such regions that were the foundation of our industrial development, and now, we've uneasily turned our back on them. We like Billy Elliot and The Full Monty, these parables of men and industrial decline, because they explore middle England's guilt, purporting to offer feel-good answers that, for all their wit, are criminally deceitful. </p> <p>In The Full Monty, the redundant steel workers turned themselves into sexual objects (just as poverty turns women to prostitution) casting themselves roles in a sexually voyeuristic culture, offering fantasy sex to titillate women. Even as we laughed, we knew this was the cruellest of hoaxes. </p> <p>Billy Elliot is more subtle. Here is the American dream of the individual who makes good - and the age-old co-option mechanism that has kept the English middle class securely on top of the pile through two centuries while revolutions reverberated all around it: you cream off the working-class talent and exile it from its roots. Billy's desire to dance is represented as a desire to escape the confines of the mining town.

      "bodyText": "All across the country, cinemas this week are full of the discreet sniffs, surreptitious wiping of wet eyes and shuffling in seats that constitute British emotion. The cause? Billy Elliot. Already billed to shoot an unknown child actor, Jamie Bell, from Teeside to Oscar nominations, the film has moved the toughest critics to shedding more tears than they can remember. Yes, it's sentimental, the reviewers acknowledge, before going on to lavish praise on the director, Stephen Daldry. Unbelievably, it seems we're going to forgive Daldry what was regarded as unforgivable in good cinema: this film is loaded with the most blatant button-pressing sentimentality. But all of us old cynics are happily sobbing away as we hear Billy recite from memory the letter his mother wrote from her deathbed. What are we all crying about? Two things. The first is the intense vulnerability of a young boy, portrayed with engaging brilliance by Bell, struggling to reconcile his love of ballet with the concepts of masculinity of his Durham mining community in general and his miner father and brother in particular. The second theme is familiar but portrayed with tragic impact by using the miners' strike as the backdrop to the film: the disintegration of traditional concepts of masculinity during the mid-eighties collapse of mining and heavy industry. Anxiety about the vulnerability of boys is a growing cultural preoccupation. It is introducing into the long-running gender debate a revived protectiveness towards boys. Billy Elliot captures this. So does the winner of this year's John Kobal photographic award currently on exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. In the photograph, a nine-year-old boy has his back to us. His shoulders are narrow and tensed, his elbows scarred, and he faces into a blank whiteness looming above his over-large head. His thick black hair is touched with grey; he looks both old and young. It is an eerily disturbing photo of boyish defiance, fragility and the vacuum into which he is growing up. You don't have to be the mother of a son to worry about what kind of men we are asking boys to grow into when so many of the old role models are redundant. Male identity has always been built on the subordination of women. If girls are achieving so much more academically, how will boys accommodate women's equality? In the conclusion to his book, On Men, Anthony Clare quotes scary predictions of what faces men. Rising suicide rates, one in three men living alone and 1.5m men excluded from the workforce either because of early retirement or because they don't have the education and skills for employment. Perhaps, Clare hopes, women will find a compassionate awareness of men's insecurities, while not compromising their own legitimate self-assertion. The second theme of Billy Elliot is, if anything, even more painful. We constructed a masculine identity that served the industrial revolution well; we exiled men from home and children to work in factories and down mines, destroying the family units of the agrarian and pre-industrial cottage industry economy. Now heavy industry is finished, their masculinity is as redundant as their labour. Billy Elliot, like The Full Monty, is humourously playing with a history that lies heavily on the British heart: the decline of heavy manufacturing has destroyed not just communities, but souls. It was the exertions of such regions that were the foundation of our industrial development, and now, we've uneasily turned our back on them. We like Billy Elliot and The Full Monty, these parables of men and industrial decline, because they explore middle England's guilt, purporting to offer feel-good answers that, for all their wit, are criminally deceitful. In The Full Monty, the redundant steel workers turned themselves into sexual objects (just as poverty turns women to prostitution) casting themselves roles in a sexually voyeuristic culture, offering fantasy sex to titillate women. Even as we laughed, we knew this was the cruellest of hoaxes. Billy Elliot is more subtle. Here is the American dream of the individual who makes good - and the age-old co-option mechanism that has kept the English middle class securely on top of the pile through two centuries while revolutions reverberated all around it: you cream off the working-class talent and exile it from its roots. Billy's desire to dance is represented as a desire to escape the confines of the mining town. In his triumph - he performs at Covent Garden for the enjoyment of the middle classes - it is not suggested that he may lose as much as he gains among the emotionally stultified middle classes. Salvation is only for individuals. The rest are stuffed. The strike is lost, the men go back down the pit. So, 16 years on from the miners' strike, the fictional Billy Elliot is now in the Royal Ballet, Jamie Bell has the possibility of an Oscar, and unemployment in the north-eastern towns where Billy Elliot was filmed (and where Bell comes from) is three times that of the south-east.

So why are these the very designers belting their little hearts out as one from the Now That's What I Call the 80s songbook, leaving it to the older kids on the block to cheer us up with something that we could reasonably wear for spring/summer 2001, rather than for a Duran Duran concert? </p> <p>It's not hard to see why the 80s are so fascinating for a designer trying to make a statement and make their name. A dalliance with the uncomfortable, with the boundaries of taste and the definition of beauty, is central to cutting-edge fashion. This is what 80s revivalism is all about: the style of the decade is still too close, too embarrassing, to make comfortable viewing, which is what makes it abrasive and difficult. The trouble with multiple variations on the theme, however, is that the shock value fades, while the ugliness remains. </p> <p>But if too many collections were scented with the era of Poison and Giorgio Beverly Hills, there were also some very good ones. Markus Lupfer and Marcus Constable infused their collections with a clarity of vision that shone through in the colours, the tailoring, even in the way the models walked - somehow a designer's clarity of thought shines through in the catwalk presence of the models. Lupfer showed his skill with skirts of harlequin-patterned feathers and of ribboned leather, and a new half-batwing sleeve shape: kimono-style from the front, batwing from the back. This collection was strong enough to satisfy the critics, confident enough to convince American buyers. Marcus Constable's electric blues, fire-engine reds and banana yellows made up one of the most stunning palettes of the week, while his exquisite shapes, unusually for a designer considered leftfield, have a Valentino quality, sexy and flattering. </p> <p>With bright white and graffiti-influenced fluorescent prints, Luella produced a collection that was hard-edged but upbeat. Short, broad-shouldered jackets took on matador proportions, while \"LB\" logo pelmet skirts and tight bright jeans look destined for sellout status. Emma Cook had some beautiful pieces - a coral silk trumpet-sleeved blouse, a green backless dress garlanded with green suede flowers - but the batwings and droopy jersey urchin skirts were a little drab, as were Sophia Kokosalaki's drop-waisted skirts and flat boots with tight trousers, although Kokosalaki's chevronned leather pencil skirt was perfect. Both collections had perhaps too many echoes of Nicholas Ghesquiere's draped-jersey designs. </p> <p>Boudicca have a reputation for being the most cerebral of designers. This collection had some interesting ideas, such as the batwing sleeves that tied apron-style at the back of a dress, but the 10 different linen blouses printed with stars, wiggles, crosses and circles were less than enthralling. Tristan Webber gave us the kind of collection that could only happen in London, full of pervy surgical fetish motifs: thigh-high red latex leggings over high heels and a black leather neck brace. The less weird pieces, like a red leather miniskirt with indents in the waistband to hook your thumbs into, were the sexiest; it would have been a treat to have more of the painted velvet dresses and capes, which were beautiful. Even Clements Ribeiro, producer of some of the most glorious London collections of the past few years, were sucked into the 80s vortex. They showed some of the most desirable trousers of the week, but the bottle-green one-sleeved tops and hole-punched red and black leather, while slotting neatly into the prevailing trend, were a departure and felt as if the designers' hearts weren't quite in them. </p> <p>The star collection of the week came from Alexander McQueen, who fashioned showpiece dresses from the shells of razor clams and mussels, but also produced some of his prettiest, most commercial pieces ever, suits and simple dresses in shadow shades of palest ice blue and rose pink. The scope of his vision was matched only by that of Hussein Chalayan, who showed a fiercely modern floral print made of computer-generated poppies and fired the final shots of the week from a space-age set that featured an animated video and models shattering their dresses with ice picks. </p> <p>Julien Macdonald has a more straightforward but equally reliable method of getting attention: celebrity models and bare breasts. Not for nothing is Macdonald termed Britain's answer to Donatella Versace - his clothes broadcast sex appeal at ghetto-blaster volume - but Elspeth Gibson also seemed to be having a Donatella moment, showing her sauciest collection yet. Gauzy chiffon mini-kaftans over bikinis with high strappy gold sandals were just right for Jerry Hall, while slinky black trousers were slit from waist to ankle. It was all done with humour and a light touch: a camel cardigan was embroidered with a leopard, complete with feather-boa tail; an itsy-bitsy miniskirt had \"EG\" picked out in pearls on the back. </p> <p>The gold, white and black strappy shoes and high boots made by Jimmy Choo for Gibson compete for shoes of the week with the Aubrey Beardsley print ankle straps at Liberty, also by Choo. Liberty looked strong this season, with gorgeous prints featuring on everything from minuscule sequin shorts to palazzo pants, and tiered in an indulgent hippy-chick long skirt. The Boyd show was buoyantly commercial and slick, but the candy stripes and peach rah-rah skirts were almost a little too sugar-sweet; much stronger were the pieces which showed a little edge, like the abstract starfish prints and Bognor, Margate and Newquay T-shirts. There were some highly desirable pieces, too, at Sheila Maloney (curved-hem ice-cream-coloured skirts with an underskirt of watery black sequins), Betty Jackson (a vintage-look rose-embroidered sheer white net blouse edged with ribbon), and Nicole Farhi (neat pleated tennis-style minis). </p> <p>One of the highlights of the week was the return to form of Matthew Williamson. Williamson's skill as a colourist can make his shows a joy: diagonal stripes of nostalgic seaside pastels, knits in lime and rose, a silky camouflage-pattern camisole in shades of the sky. Hold on in there folks: maybe there is light at the end of the batwing tunnel after all.</p>",

For the moment, however, United face the unusual task of overtaking Leicester, whom they meet at Filbert Street on Saturday week. </p> <p>Wenger's side owed yesterday's victory to their tradition of being able to grab a goal against the run of play and hold that narrow lead for the larger part of the game. United had a lot of the play territorially, particularly in the second half, and enjoyed the bulk of the possession. But they were seldom able to produce the quality of pass or centre needed to disturb the command of Martin Keown and Tony Adams at the heart of Arsenal's defence. </p> <p>Arsenal created the greater number of significant chances in breakaways and would have won by more but for the anticipation and agility of Fabien Barthez, back in the United goal after injury, and some indifferent finishing. The finish that won the match, however, will rarely be bettered anywhere in the Premiership this season. </p> <p>Henry scored 25 times for Arsenal last season and his successful conversion from winger to striker more than compensated for the loss of Nicolas Anelka. Yet he went into yesterday's encounter having failed to find the net in nearly a month of football, and a striker without goals becomes a little lost, like a dog that has forgotten where it has buried a bone. </p> <p>For half an hour yesterday Henry, despite some excellent support play and a dash past three United defenders that ended when Mickael Silvestre cut out a low centre, offered little hint of what was to come. The play had quickly slipped into a slough of predictable passes and pedestrian movement, with little width on either side and the midfield too crowded for the football to breathe. </p> <p>Then David Beckham was cautioned for fouling Fredrik Ljungberg, and Nwankwo Kanu tapped the free-kick to Gilles Grimandi, who in turn found Henry near the left edge of the penalty area and with his back to goal. The Frenchman then flicked the ball on to an instep before pivoting to lob a shot past Barthez and into the top far corner of the net. </p> <p>\"You can't do anything about a goal like that,\" Sir Alex Ferguson admitted afterwards. \"I couldn't believe it.\" </p> <p>\"When you haven't been scoring goals, sometimes you need to try something a little bit crazy,\" said Wenger, \"something you don't have to think about but just do it. Thierry played with much more freedom once he had scored.\" </p> <p>United seldom performed with the freedom that has distinguished much of their football this season. Ferguson recalled seven of the players who had missed last Tuesday's Champions League game in Eindhoven, when PSV punished his weakened defence with a 3-1 victory. But for United yesterday a change was not as good as a rest. </p> <p>Although the champions increased the tempo in the second half they remained surprisingly sluggish in midfield, where normally their football is at its most tenacious. Roy Keane's response to the busy, bustling presence of Ray Parlour was placid - not a description often applied to his game - and Paul Scholes took up threatening positions without making much of them. </p> <p>Individually there were some admirable qualities in United's performance; Beckham's tireless capacity for hard work, for example, and Andy Cole's undying enthusiasm for taking on Keown or Adams. But Teddy Sheringham's ineffectiveness belied the case that had been made for his England recall and Ryan Giggs, isolated on the left wing, often had to move into the middle to find the ball. </p> <p>Parlour and Grimandi were influential in denying United their familiar rhythm. Although Arsenal will be glad to see the return of Patrick Vieira, who completed a five-match suspension yesterday, the way this pair consistently denied Keane, Scholes and Beckham space and time on the ball made it easier for Adams and Keown to snuff out any danger up front. </p> <p>The result was that David Seaman was rarely called into urgent action. His best save, and United's best moment, came at the start of the second half when Cole's persistence on the right set up Beckham for a centre which Giggs met with a rising shot which Seaman tipped over the bar. </p> <p>Once Wenger had replaced Kanu with a defender, Nelson Vivas, United found it even harder to break Arsenal down, and had Parlour not trodden on the ball after a 50-yard dash by Henry set him up for a goal, Highbury would have been spared an anxious last few minutes. </p> <p>This was United's first Premiership defeat since losing 3-0 at Newcastle on February 12 and they have now beaten Arsenal only once in seven encounters. \"You get these blips occasionally,\" said Ferguson, but Highbury bleeped merrily all the same. </p> <p>\u0095 Martin Keown (ankle), David Beckham (knee) and Paul Scholes (foot) will need treatment after reporting for England duty this evening. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Roy Keane's response to the busy, bustling presence of Ray Parlour was placid - not a description often applied to his game - and Paul Scholes took up threatening positions without making much of them. Individually there were some admirable qualities in United's performance; Beckham's tireless capacity for hard work, for example, and Andy Cole's undying enthusiasm for taking on Keown or Adams. But Teddy Sheringham's ineffectiveness belied the case that had been made for his England recall and Ryan Giggs, isolated on the left wing, often had to move into the middle to find the ball. Parlour and Grimandi were influential in denying United their familiar rhythm. Although Arsenal will be glad to see the return of Patrick Vieira, who completed a five-match suspension yesterday, the way this pair consistently denied Keane, Scholes and Beckham space and time on the ball made it easier for Adams and Keown to snuff out any danger up front. The result was that David Seaman was rarely called into urgent action. His best save, and United's best moment, came at the start of the second half when Cole's persistence on the right set up Beckham for a centre which Giggs met with a rising shot which Seaman tipped over the bar. Once Wenger had replaced Kanu with a defender, Nelson Vivas, United found it even harder to break Arsenal down, and had Parlour not trodden on the ball after a 50-yard dash by Henry set him up for a goal, Highbury would have been spared an anxious last few minutes. This was United's first Premiership defeat since losing 3-0 at Newcastle on February 12 and they have now beaten Arsenal only once in seven encounters. \"You get these blips occasionally,\" said Ferguson, but Highbury bleeped merrily all the same. \u0095 Martin Keown (ankle), David Beckham (knee) and Paul Scholes (foot) will need treatment after reporting for England duty this evening. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

He landed a touch a while back on, if memory serves me right, Liverpool v Manchester City and this week he turned his attention to the seemingly innocuous Southampton v Middlesbrough game. To the rest of us this was just another mediocre mid-table clash but to Mr M it was a money-making opportunity. I like that kind of thinking. </p> <p>It is often the more esoteric markets that offer the best value because these are the markets the bookies spend least time pricing up. If you can find a market you like and really concentrate on it - undertake some detailed (preferably statistical) research, price events up yourself before you see the bookies' odds - there is no doubt you can stay one step ahead of the bookies. There are punters out there who make a good living by betting on bookings alone.</p> <p>I'm not sure Scott is quite ready to go full-time yet - indeed I can't help thinking there is a large element of luck to his success so far - but he could have a future if he puts the hours in.</p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle </strong><br> Sunderland to beat Leicester \u00a38 @ 11/10 </p> <p>Regulars readers of this column will know I don't tend to have a lot of time for Mr Ingle. It's nothing personal but something about him irks me. I don't know what it is but I do know I find it irksome. This week, however, I am determined not to be such a curmudgeon.</p> <p>Let's look on the bright side. Mr Ingle restricted himself to just one selection this week, a policy that meets with my hearty approval. Moreover, the inestimable Mr I announces his intention to \"creep slowly above the \u00a3100 mark\", veritable music to my ears. Indeed, Mr I, the aspiration to creep slowly, if something more than just a passing fancy, may be the beginning of your transformation into a winner. Patience is more than just a virtue - it is a necessity. I believe I have said it before, more than once, but I will say it again - it is a marathon not a sprint.</p> <p>In this new-found spirit of magnanimity I will pass over the actual bet itself, pausing only to observe that it failed to win but applauding the restraint implied within it. I do wish you'd stop backing favourites though, Mr Ingle.

He landed a touch a while back on, if memory serves me right, Liverpool v Manchester City and this week he turned his attention to the seemingly innocuous Southampton v Middlesbrough game. To the rest of us this was just another mediocre mid-table clash but to Mr M it was a money-making opportunity. I like that kind of thinking. It is often the more esoteric markets that offer the best value because these are the markets the bookies spend least time pricing up. If you can find a market you like and really concentrate on it - undertake some detailed (preferably statistical) research, price events up yourself before you see the bookies' odds - there is no doubt you can stay one step ahead of the bookies. There are punters out there who make a good living by betting on bookings alone. I'm not sure Scott is quite ready to go full-time yet - indeed I can't help thinking there is a large element of luck to his success so far - but he could have a future if he puts the hours in. Sean Ingle Sunderland to beat Leicester \u00a38 @ 11/10 Regulars readers of this column will know I don't tend to have a lot of time for Mr Ingle. It's nothing personal but something about him irks me. I don't know what it is but I do know I find it irksome. This week, however, I am determined not to be such a curmudgeon. Let's look on the bright side. Mr Ingle restricted himself to just one selection this week, a policy that meets with my hearty approval. Moreover, the inestimable Mr I announces his intention to \"creep slowly above the \u00a3100 mark\", veritable music to my ears. Indeed, Mr I, the aspiration to creep slowly, if something more than just a passing fancy, may be the beginning of your transformation into a winner. Patience is more than just a virtue - it is a necessity. I believe I have said it before, more than once, but I will say it again - it is a marathon not a sprint. In this new-found spirit of magnanimity I will pass over the actual bet itself, pausing only to observe that it failed to win but applauding the restraint implied within it. I do wish you'd stop backing favourites though, Mr Ingle. Search out the value and you shall be rewarded. Paul MacInnes Arsenal to draw with Manchester United, and Chelsea to draw with Liverpool: \u00a34.67 double @ 9/4 and 2/1 Ah, the dual disasters that are draw doubles, to wallow in alliteration for one excruciatingly extended moment.

      "body": "<p>Last Monday, Andi Peters went on This Morning to plug the start of Celebrity!, the new teatime showbiz programme he's fronting. By Wednesday, Richard and Judy had got their pound of flesh as the undemanding Celebrity! \"took us behind the scenes\" of This Morning. It won't surprise anyone to hear that Celebrity! is made by Carlton. With its reliance on ITV stars (well, it was rustled up in six weeks), it is budget TV, wall-to-wall easy-view plugs and pop videos: a stereotypical Carlton project. </p> <p>Except that that is not the whole story. As Celebrity! was bedding down, Steve Hewlett, Carlton's director of programmes, was in Washington, sealing a deal with Time magazine and the Washington Post to develop factual programming together. (This mirrors an arrangement by Granada with the New York Times.) Stacked by Hewlett's TV set in his Portman Square offices in London's West End are tapes of Britain at War, a follow-up series to the award-winning Second World War in Colour. </p> <p>Celebrity!, warts and all, fits into a larger quest, to build a production business, in volume as well as value terms, after the failed collaboration with OK! magazine. Hewlett has made sure that a seasoned team is in charge, used to making live, daily television. Another department of Carlton Productions is, even now, casting actors for the remake of Crossroads; sets are under construction in the company's Nottingham studios and production starts in December. Landing a daily soap was, Hewlett observes, \"the holy grail\". He tenderly produces a huge box file containing Crossroads scripts and storylines. </p> <p>At 42, Hewlett is a large, shrewd and resilient man, whose past career spans a successful stint as editor of Panorama, and another as head of factual programmes at Channel 4. Delegates at this year's Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival watched him anchor a key session on Big Brother, forcing Peter Bazalgette to disclose that he was automatically signing up contestants for his talent agency. </p> <p>Lawyers for Richard Desmond, chairman of Northern and Shell, which publishes OK!, have written to Carlton warning it that they will be swelling the audience watching Celebrity! to make sure OK! isn't being ripped off. \"For us it is a fantastic opportunity. ITV is prepared to trust Carlton with a live and daily programme - that's quite a new phenomenon,\" observes Hewlett. \"Richard Desmond is his own man, used to running his own company, and everything jumps to his tune. It's his thing. Television requires a different approach, collaborative. It's harder to be finicky.\" Hewlett then goes off the record to describe some ripe Desmond-style exchanges. </p> <p>Carlton is already locked in a legal dispute with the News of the World, over allegations of fakery on The Cook Report. The strand remains off air while the libel war dance is played out. Hewlett confirms that series editor Mike Morley left the company's employ over the summer, but is still a consultant. </p> <p>Hewlett was recruited to inject gravitas and editorial controls after the disaster of The Connection, a programme that faked drug-trafficking evidence, leading to a record fine from the independent television commission, and no little discredit for the company. \"Those problems are historic, not current,\" insists Hewlett. But what about The Cook Report? \"There was never any suggestion that the audience was misled. The issues are about the way the programme was being run. We are disputing the veracity of what they [the NoW] are saying. </p> <p>\"At its best the programme, and Roger Cook, showed themselves capable of bringing investigative journalism to a wide audience. If we could bring it back, splendid. At the moment, until the News of the World case is resolved, it is in suspended animation. The problem for The Cook Report, although we reject the serious allegations, is that because it delves into areas of criminality, it is always dealing with people who are unreliable. As soon as questions are raised about reliability, it's an open invitation for someone to claim he's been traduced. So it's just not practicable to run it.\" </p> <p> Surely Hewlett's collaborative TV team skills have been tested to the limit since Lord (Waheed) Alli of Planet 24 was brought into Carlton 18 months ago, seemingly to do the same job? \"I'm not going to say it wasn't a bit difficult at first. It was. Partly because at that time I was only six months into what you can see the results of. I'm director of programmes, part of Carlton Television. I report to Waheed. When you look at the production division, out of a turnover of \u00a3140m, \u00a3120m of it is here with me.\" </p> <p>So Hewlett has nothing to do with The Big Breakfast? \"It's run as separate companies. Planet 24 [now a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlton] doesn't report to me. Going forward, who knows? Anyway, the point is, there were difficult moments in the beginning. The reason it was a bit tricky is that in the end we were saying the same thing, and both trying to create a vibrant in-house talent base. </p> <p>\"At the launch of The Railway Children, Waheed was host. But the celebrity launch of World War Two in Colour - I'll host that. These things are never easy, but in the fundamentals, there is some evidence that we are succeeding. In a curious way our skills are complementary. </p> <p>\"I'm used to working in big organisations. I have broader, longer and more direct production experience. And I'm plugged into genres that he has no knowledge of. Whereas in entertainment, in dealing with talent, he's pretty plugged in.\" </p> <p>Carlton is also making the UK version of Survivor, the reality gameshow that has taken the US by storm. The format was devised by Alli and his partner Charlie Parsons, but was not part of the Planet 24 sale to Carlton (according to some accounts of the deal, Carlton chairman Michael Green was dismissive of the show). But for all Alli's showbusiness nous - it was he who fronted the bid to get ITV to commission Crossroads - he is not taking a hand in Celebrity!. </p> <p>Carlton's fundamental problem, as Hewlett sees it, is that it isn't Thames. \"The problem for Carlton, once Michael Green had taken the licence off Thames, was that it was seen as part of the whole Thatcher project. Everyone hated them. I don't have that much to do with Michael Green. He's fairly hands-off in terms of the way the business is run; I get a note from him every now and then saying 'I really enjoyed that, thanks very much.'\" </p> <p>Carlton, he adds, was set up on a fundamentally flawed concept, as a publisher/broadcaster. \"It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time. Except why should independent producers bother with a TV franchise holder when they could go direct to the ITV network centre\". Or anywhere else. The abiding truth seems to be that \"content is king\", especially in the new media. Between 1994 and 1999, Carlton, by now buttressed by the takeover of Central, saw a 45% decline in its production business. In addition what was Central Productions, with a great tradition in a wide range of programming, just withered in the hands of centralised management. Last year Carlton accounted for 13% of network programmes, while the Granada bulldozer made 50%. The danger now is that Carlton, loser in the TV merger game, will itself wither as a minor player in ITV. </p> <p>\"I don't accept that,\" argues Hewlett. \"Carlton has the two biggest, most lucrative licences, and can't be messed around with. We intend to proceed in the spirit of partnership. The merger doesn't disadvantage us, though it is unsettling. In production we didn't get over-panicked - these people here are sufficiently good to have a future. ITV needs programmes and the ones we make. The production businesses really are separate from broadcasting,\" he says. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, adds Hewlett, there has been a big reorganisation at Carlton in the past two years, to separate out production. \"I inherited a commissioning structure. We've transformed it to a production centre.\" </p> <p>In-house production is shooting up: Barbara, Big Bad World, The Vice, Peak Practice, now up to 26 episodes a year (and discussing a further increase with ITV network centre). But there is a downside: Carlton declined to go on making Monsignor Renard, a John Thaw star vehicle, because, at a cost of \u00a32m an episode (not fully paid back by ITV), it was losing money without hefty guaranteed overseas sales. It marked the point when Alli was cracking the boss's whip. </p> <p>Hewlett says his key input was to hire the right people to turn around Carlton's image. \"Factual programmes, in my view, were desperate for the credibility.\" He pays tribute to Polly Bide, Carlton's controller of factual programmes: \"She's fantastically sure-footed in matters of editorial.\" He points to the two episodes of Horizon made for the BBC, a new series for Channel 4 and Discovery's Learning Channel, Hell in the Pacific, marking the anniversary of Pearl Harbor. </p> <p>\"In terms of Carlton's image and appearance, these programmes are absolutely vital.

      "bodyText": "Last Monday, Andi Peters went on This Morning to plug the start of Celebrity!, the new teatime showbiz programme he's fronting. By Wednesday, Richard and Judy had got their pound of flesh as the undemanding Celebrity! \"took us behind the scenes\" of This Morning. It won't surprise anyone to hear that Celebrity! is made by Carlton. With its reliance on ITV stars (well, it was rustled up in six weeks), it is budget TV, wall-to-wall easy-view plugs and pop videos: a stereotypical Carlton project. Except that that is not the whole story. As Celebrity! was bedding down, Steve Hewlett, Carlton's director of programmes, was in Washington, sealing a deal with Time magazine and the Washington Post to develop factual programming together. (This mirrors an arrangement by Granada with the New York Times.) Stacked by Hewlett's TV set in his Portman Square offices in London's West End are tapes of Britain at War, a follow-up series to the award-winning Second World War in Colour. Celebrity!, warts and all, fits into a larger quest, to build a production business, in volume as well as value terms, after the failed collaboration with OK! magazine. Hewlett has made sure that a seasoned team is in charge, used to making live, daily television. Another department of Carlton Productions is, even now, casting actors for the remake of Crossroads; sets are under construction in the company's Nottingham studios and production starts in December. Landing a daily soap was, Hewlett observes, \"the holy grail\". He tenderly produces a huge box file containing Crossroads scripts and storylines. At 42, Hewlett is a large, shrewd and resilient man, whose past career spans a successful stint as editor of Panorama, and another as head of factual programmes at Channel 4. Delegates at this year's Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival watched him anchor a key session on Big Brother, forcing Peter Bazalgette to disclose that he was automatically signing up contestants for his talent agency. Lawyers for Richard Desmond, chairman of Northern and Shell, which publishes OK!, have written to Carlton warning it that they will be swelling the audience watching Celebrity! to make sure OK! isn't being ripped off. \"For us it is a fantastic opportunity. ITV is prepared to trust Carlton with a live and daily programme - that's quite a new phenomenon,\" observes Hewlett. \"Richard Desmond is his own man, used to running his own company, and everything jumps to his tune. It's his thing. Television requires a different approach, collaborative. It's harder to be finicky.\" Hewlett then goes off the record to describe some ripe Desmond-style exchanges. Carlton is already locked in a legal dispute with the News of the World, over allegations of fakery on The Cook Report. The strand remains off air while the libel war dance is played out. Hewlett confirms that series editor Mike Morley left the company's employ over the summer, but is still a consultant. Hewlett was recruited to inject gravitas and editorial controls after the disaster of The Connection, a programme that faked drug-trafficking evidence, leading to a record fine from the independent television commission, and no little discredit for the company. \"Those problems are historic, not current,\" insists Hewlett. But what about The Cook Report? \"There was never any suggestion that the audience was misled. The issues are about the way the programme was being run. We are disputing the veracity of what they [the NoW] are saying. \"At its best the programme, and Roger Cook, showed themselves capable of bringing investigative journalism to a wide audience. If we could bring it back, splendid. At the moment, until the News of the World case is resolved, it is in suspended animation. The problem for The Cook Report, although we reject the serious allegations, is that because it delves into areas of criminality, it is always dealing with people who are unreliable. As soon as questions are raised about reliability, it's an open invitation for someone to claim he's been traduced. So it's just not practicable to run it.\" Surely Hewlett's collaborative TV team skills have been tested to the limit since Lord (Waheed) Alli of Planet 24 was brought into Carlton 18 months ago, seemingly to do the same job? \"I'm not going to say it wasn't a bit difficult at first. It was. Partly because at that time I was only six months into what you can see the results of. I'm director of programmes, part of Carlton Television. I report to Waheed. When you look at the production division, out of a turnover of \u00a3140m, \u00a3120m of it is here with me.\" So Hewlett has nothing to do with The Big Breakfast? \"It's run as separate companies. Planet 24 [now a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlton] doesn't report to me. Going forward, who knows? Anyway, the point is, there were difficult moments in the beginning. The reason it was a bit tricky is that in the end we were saying the same thing, and both trying to create a vibrant in-house talent base. \"At the launch of The Railway Children, Waheed was host. But the celebrity launch of World War Two in Colour - I'll host that. These things are never easy, but in the fundamentals, there is some evidence that we are succeeding. In a curious way our skills are complementary. \"I'm used to working in big organisations. I have broader, longer and more direct production experience. And I'm plugged into genres that he has no knowledge of. Whereas in entertainment, in dealing with talent, he's pretty plugged in.\" Carlton is also making the UK version of Survivor, the reality gameshow that has taken the US by storm. The format was devised by Alli and his partner Charlie Parsons, but was not part of the Planet 24 sale to Carlton (according to some accounts of the deal, Carlton chairman Michael Green was dismissive of the show). But for all Alli's showbusiness nous - it was he who fronted the bid to get ITV to commission Crossroads - he is not taking a hand in Celebrity!. Carlton's fundamental problem, as Hewlett sees it, is that it isn't Thames. \"The problem for Carlton, once Michael Green had taken the licence off Thames, was that it was seen as part of the whole Thatcher project. Everyone hated them. I don't have that much to do with Michael Green. He's fairly hands-off in terms of the way the business is run; I get a note from him every now and then saying 'I really enjoyed that, thanks very much.'\" Carlton, he adds, was set up on a fundamentally flawed concept, as a publisher/broadcaster. \"It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time. Except why should independent producers bother with a TV franchise holder when they could go direct to the ITV network centre\". Or anywhere else. The abiding truth seems to be that \"content is king\", especially in the new media. Between 1994 and 1999, Carlton, by now buttressed by the takeover of Central, saw a 45% decline in its production business. In addition what was Central Productions, with a great tradition in a wide range of programming, just withered in the hands of centralised management. Last year Carlton accounted for 13% of network programmes, while the Granada bulldozer made 50%. The danger now is that Carlton, loser in the TV merger game, will itself wither as a minor player in ITV. \"I don't accept that,\" argues Hewlett. \"Carlton has the two biggest, most lucrative licences, and can't be messed around with. We intend to proceed in the spirit of partnership. The merger doesn't disadvantage us, though it is unsettling. In production we didn't get over-panicked - these people here are sufficiently good to have a future. ITV needs programmes and the ones we make. The production businesses really are separate from broadcasting,\" he says. Behind the scenes, adds Hewlett, there has been a big reorganisation at Carlton in the past two years, to separate out production. \"I inherited a commissioning structure. We've transformed it to a production centre.\" In-house production is shooting up: Barbara, Big Bad World, The Vice, Peak Practice, now up to 26 episodes a year (and discussing a further increase with ITV network centre).

So technology has moved on again and a war is developing over who wins the right to filter our viewing experience for us. </p> <p>The personal video recorder technology (PVR), which is also intelligent enough to work out which pro grammes we like to watch and then record them for us, was heralded by the director-general of the BBC, Greg Dyke, as having the power to change the TV industry for ever. And as he gleefully pointed out in his keynote speech at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival last month, PVRs jeopardise the entire economic structure of commercial TV. </p> <p>Perhaps that is why the two biggest names in the PVR business, TiVo and ReplayTV, have sold fewer than 100,000 units in the US between them after nearly two years. Broadcasters have been understandably resistant to the idea of technology taking away their advertising revenues and the whole idea has gone down like a lead balloon among advertisers. </p> <p>The cracks have already begun showing in the PVR wonder box even before it hits the high street in Britain. It will go on sale for \u00a3400 this month for use on BSkyB's digital network. But it will be superseded early next year by a new and cheaper set-top box from Pace Micro Technology and NDS Technologies, a division of News Corporation, which puts the remote control back in the hands of broadcasters. </p> <p>The new box most definitely will not allow you to skip the adverts. Quite the opposite in fact. It collects information about the viewer for the benefit of the broadcaster - not the other way round. That means it is better able to target adverts at the right people, which means more advertising revenues for broadcasters. Impulse buying is so much easier with digital TV: all you need to do is press a button. </p> <p>The Pace-NDS box contains a 40 gigabyte recordable hard drive and two tuners so that consumers can view their programmes and record a different channel simultaneously. It offers the same functionality as the TiVo box, and much more besides, but it will be cheaper. It offers enough storage for broadcasters to download everything from Yellow Pages, home shopping catalogues, online games and digital music files to the week's top 10 films. TiVo is working hard to stand still by adding the same capabilities to its platform. </p> <p>\"All broadcasters are looking at these embedded PVR products - we're in intense discussions with a number of them,\" says Malcolm Miller, chief executive at Pace. \"We've been working on this for the last two years and we think we're ahead of anyone else.\" </p> <p>It is no coincidence that the first customer for the Pace-NDS box is BSkyB, which also happened to sign an exclusive agreement to sell the TiVo box. That may explain why TiVo will cost more than the Pace-NDS box. </p> <p>Certainly, \u00a3400 is an ambitious price for a nation that has grown accustomed to getting set-top boxes and mobile phones for \"free\". Costs for mobile phones are buried in monthly service charges, but broadcasters have been prepared to take a hit on set-top boxes in order to drive digital penetration. </p> <p>Faced with the arrival of the hard-drive product next year, TiVo and ReplayTV have begun reshaping their strategy to conform with broadcasters' and advertisers' wishes. It boils down to survival. </p> <p>They have started positioning themselves as not just box suppliers, but also service providers. They are working hard at packaging advertising and programming in their boxes before they ship them out of the factories in order to offer a service to broadcasters which don't hold content rights. Operators such as BSkyB have built their own services and TiVo is working on storing original content such as programme previews, infomercials, short films and features on the PGA golf tour. Similarly, Coca-Cola will launch an ad campaign on ReplayTV's box this month in the US and a promotional campaign with Universal Pictures is planned. </p> <p>TiVo is even working with Nielsen Media Research to measure audience interaction with its service. The two companies also plan to experiment with finding more effective advertising vehicles for PVR services by using a 1,500-person panel of TiVo customers. </p> <p>For all the talk about technology transforming our experience of watching television, it appears to have been snatched from under our noses. </p> <p>Far from getting less in advertising revenue, with the Pace/NDS box the broadcaster gets more because it will be able to tell advertisers that it can reach exactly the consumers they want. TiVo will argue that it can do the same. </p> <p>Since BSkyB signed an exclusive agreement with TiVo, it can keep any other pay-TV networks in the UK from getting their hands on it. </p> <p>Still, companies have started finding ways to get round the status quo and others are expected to follow. Last week, Videonet rolled out the first commercial video-on-demand service in the UK using British Telecom's ADSL souped-up phone network. It claims to offer similar functions to the TiVo box. </p> <p>Called HomeChoice, the service is heavily subsidised: customers pay a one-off set-top box charge of \u00a340 and monthly charges start at \u00a36 for access to a range of films and television programmes. The cost to Videonet is considerably more. It pays British Telecom \u00a362 per ADSL line customer and \u00a3100 for each set-top box. Profit at the company is some way off, but chief executive Simon Hochhauser says that unlike other on-demand television companies, including Yes Television and Filmgroup, he has not cancelled plans for a stock market flotation. </p> <p>\"We are also looking at strategic relationships with other companies in order to raise money, but we might well do an IPO,\" he says. </p> <p> HomeChoice is available now to 2.5m households in London, and the company plans to extend it to 70% of British homes by the end of next year, with Birmingham and Manchester next on the list. </p> <p>Slice it or dice it whichever way you want - a range of businesses from phone companies to internet upstarts plan to start offering personalised TV and e-commerce services to British consumers over phone lines, satellite and terrestrial networks from now on. If the choice seems overwhelming, it's meant to be. There is everything to play for and projections for growth in on-demand digital services are awe-inspiring. </p> <p>According to UK-based Kagan World Media, by 2006 42% of the UK, or around 11m homes, will be able to subscribe to on-demand television services compared with just 3% now. Beyond the UK, there will be 410m digital cable and satellite homes worldwide by 2010, representing 37% of the world's television households, according to research company Baskerville Communications. Together, these homes are expected to generate $21bn in pay-per-view film revenues. </p> <p>So TiVo may have peaked before its time but the concept behind the box is alive and kicking. That said, for all Greg Dyke's predictions of seismic change in the industry, it looks as if advertising is very much here to stay. </p> <p> \u0095 Dawn Hayes is UK bureau chief at the 451</p>",

New research by media agency CIA UK, revealed here exclusively by the Guardian, shows digital is totally changing the way many of us look at our TV. </p> <p>Sky has established itself as the dominant digital platform. Around four out of five digital households have gone with Sky, but it has now converted the majority of its traditional analogue users on to digital. CIA's research shows that digital penetration will slow over the next 12 months to around two-thirds of the last year's level. Switching those who have resisted multichannel TV for so long is going to be far harder. </p> <p>But for those who have switched, the result is positive. Sky's programming is the dominant attraction and not just thanks to the volume of channels but also because the digibox gives consumers access to their favourite programming - sport. CIA's research found four of the top five shows that could make Sky Digital viewers change supplier are football, namely home nations World Cup qualifiers (top with 28%), Premiership football, Champions League and Match of the Day. The other top five show was EastEnders. </p> <p>Football's dominance could be seen as a weakness but with its current offering, Sky is in a position of strength. The other weapon in its armoury is the development of interactive channels such as Sky Sports Extra. Subscribers listed it as the second most important reason for purchase, behind increased number of channels. Interactive services such as email, internet access and shopping through Open weren't given as major reasons for purchase but once they have them, 44% of digital subscribers enjoyed using them. UK adults as a whole put interactive channels fourth in terms of appeal behind more channels and better picture and sound. </p> <p>Interestingly, the growing number of channels isn't seen by many digital subscribers as a straight trade-off with quality. A third agree that more channels will be detrimental but 44% don't think quality will suffer. Among the general public (including those with digital) CIA found just under half expecting programming to suffer while 29% said it wouldn't. Three years ago CIA found 56% expecting quality to fall as quantity rose, suggesting that the public is slowly coming round to the charms of multichannel programming. </p> <p>One yardstick of quality is news. The Sensor research asked people which of the current rolling news services they would turn to first in terms of quality. BBC News 24 got the highest vote with 38% saying it would be their number one choice, while ITN's new service came second with 31%. Although the difference isn't statistically significant Sky News looks like the winner in Sky Digital households, scoring 36% versus 32% for BBC News 24, while ITN got just 18%. </p> <p>Does this support the idea that Sky is better than many people give it credit for? Is the experience so much better than people expect that they suddenly feel able to trust Sky with delivering programming as important as news or are digital households (biased towards young middle-class families) less able to discern quality? </p> <p>What happens when we've all gone digital is anyone's guess but the fact is that Sky is doing well at present. The selection of news channel has enormous implications for broadcasters. What time BBC or ITV shows news is just a sideshow for the digital audience. Rolling news services deliver the news almost on demand, permanently head-to-head; when we all have digital, the need to run a news programme primetime on an entertainment channel will go. Instead the consumer's decision will be between news brand and not broadcast time. In this situation, it will be a straight choice. </p> <p>Indeed such issues will affect every programme as technology such as the much-vaunted TiVo demonstrates. The ability of TiVo to record shows without being programmed and to pause live broadcasts means a future of time-shift viewing. Implications for advertisers as well as broadcasters are as yet uncertain. </p> <p>But when CIA asked people how much they would be willing to pay for TiVo, only 3% said they would pay the \u00a3400 plus \u00a310 monthly fee that looks set to be the launch price. This rises to 8% among 15- to 35-year-olds. Interestingly, 57% of all adults wouldn't pay anything, confirming that the UK population is comfortable with advertising as part of their viewing experience. </p> <p>What is clear from CIA's work is that the TV is going through a revolution and many of those buying into it are enjoying the experience and looking forward to further developments. At the other end is a hard core of around 25% of adults who never intend to go digital. They may become a major issue for any government intending to switch off the UK's analogue transmitters.</p> <p>\u0095 Oliver Rowe is Head of Insight at CIA Media- Lab.

Three years ago CIA found 56% expecting quality to fall as quantity rose, suggesting that the public is slowly coming round to the charms of multichannel programming. One yardstick of quality is news. The Sensor research asked people which of the current rolling news services they would turn to first in terms of quality. BBC News 24 got the highest vote with 38% saying it would be their number one choice, while ITN's new service came second with 31%. Although the difference isn't statistically significant Sky News looks like the winner in Sky Digital households, scoring 36% versus 32% for BBC News 24, while ITN got just 18%. Does this support the idea that Sky is better than many people give it credit for? Is the experience so much better than people expect that they suddenly feel able to trust Sky with delivering programming as important as news or are digital households (biased towards young middle-class families) less able to discern quality? What happens when we've all gone digital is anyone's guess but the fact is that Sky is doing well at present. The selection of news channel has enormous implications for broadcasters. What time BBC or ITV shows news is just a sideshow for the digital audience. Rolling news services deliver the news almost on demand, permanently head-to-head; when we all have digital, the need to run a news programme primetime on an entertainment channel will go. Instead the consumer's decision will be between news brand and not broadcast time. In this situation, it will be a straight choice. Indeed such issues will affect every programme as technology such as the much-vaunted TiVo demonstrates. The ability of TiVo to record shows without being programmed and to pause live broadcasts means a future of time-shift viewing. Implications for advertisers as well as broadcasters are as yet uncertain. But when CIA asked people how much they would be willing to pay for TiVo, only 3% said they would pay the \u00a3400 plus \u00a310 monthly fee that looks set to be the launch price. This rises to 8% among 15- to 35-year-olds. Interestingly, 57% of all adults wouldn't pay anything, confirming that the UK population is comfortable with advertising as part of their viewing experience. What is clear from CIA's work is that the TV is going through a revolution and many of those buying into it are enjoying the experience and looking forward to further developments. At the other end is a hard core of around 25% of adults who never intend to go digital. They may become a major issue for any government intending to switch off the UK's analogue transmitters. \u0095 Oliver Rowe is Head of Insight at CIA Media- Lab.

      "body": "<p>Imagine, if you can, that appearances by Denise Van Outen accounted for 30% of all the women you saw on a major terrestrial channel. It might be hard to believe that individual actors could dominate a channel's output in that way, but that's the reality if you're an Asian watching ITV. </p> <p>According to a recent study of a week's prime-time output on British television, seven appearances by newsreader Shulie Ghosh accounted for 30% of all Asian women in speaking roles on ITV. Meanwhile four appearances by Vikram Desai in Coronation Street accounted for 40% of all Asian men on the channel. </p> <p>These figures were extrapolated from an annual research study for the broadcasting standards commission (BSC). Taken at face value the study made happy reading for UK broadcasters, with ethnic minorities over-represented compared to their percentage in the UK population. But the detailed channel by channel breakdown shows a more complex picture, producing surprising outcomes in terms of relative channel performances and highlighting a major problem of Asian invisibility. </p> <p>The BSC logged the race of participants with speaking roles over a \"composite week\" to minimise distortions (Monday from one week, Tuesday from another week). Starting in late March 2000, they watched 475 programmes in total, broadcast between 5.30pm and midnight. </p> <p>In all programmes shown across the five major terrestrial channels and Sky One the BSC counted 7,610 appearances, of which 570 (7.5%) were black or Asian. In UK-produced programmes there were 359 ethnic minority participants - or 6.3% of the total. Both of these figures compare well to the ethnic minority population of the UK, which is 5.5%. </p> <p>Of course these figures are a snapshot, and therefore carry a health warning, but consider them from the perspective of ethnic minority viewers, especially Asian viewers, who never sees their lives, issues or achievements reflected back to them by the major UK channels. </p> <p>It all feels very gloomy, but I do get a sense things are starting to change for the better. You can see shifts in ITV drama such as The Vice, Always and Everyone, The Knock and London's Burning. The new BBC2 drama Attachments has a black character in a lead role, as did the recent BBC1 series Clocking Off. And as Patrick Robinson leads in the new detective series on Channel 5, the Untold season of black and Asian history which begins tonight on Channel 4 follows on from our Caribbean Summer. All these are developments broadcasters can be proud of. </p> <p>But the main reason I'm optimistic is because this time, after many false starts, the issue isn't just being driven by the liberal ideals of fairness and equality but also by the politics of the licence fee and the big, economic issues of demographics and advertising. </p> <p>Black and Asian viewers are mov ing away from terrestrial television faster than any other sub-demographic in our audience. They are the early adopters of cable and satellite, with around 12 dedicated channels now providing Asian language news, film and music programming and a great deal of activity under way to establish a black/urban channel. </p> <p>This shift in viewing patterns coincides with a demographic revolution already under way in British society. Currently ethnic minorities account for 5.5% of the UK population as a whole, but they account for 10% of the under-30s and 12% of the under-fives. Conservative projections predict 40% of the under-25s in London will be black, Asian and/or mixed race within 10 years. </p> <p>So, the fastest growing section of the audience is also switching away from terrestrial television in record numbers - that combination makes licence fee advocates and advertising-driven commercial companies sit up and take notice. It is what has led to the establishment of the Cultural Diversity Network (CDN); an industry body \"committed to changing the face of British television\". </p> <p>Right now senior executives in all the major broadcasters are drafting their action plans which will be pub lished this month, and submitted to culture secretary Chris Smith. Most will be setting targets for staff, at junior and senior level, with other initiatives around portrayal and talent. </p> <p>At Channel 4 we already have to comply with a licence requirement of \"not less than three hours on average per week of multicultural programming\". It's a requirement we welcome, and because we have to deliver, the responsibility for multiculturalism has moved out of the narrow confines of the multicultural programmes department and become a duty of the channel as a whole. </p> <p>So part of Channel 4's response to the CDN is a process of consolidating a range of initiatives we're already piloting. For example, every proposal for consideration will in future have to state how it intends to be appropriately multicultural, either in terms of content and/or production personnel and/or on-screen talent. To help them achieve that we're establishing a talent database, because most recruitment is informal, unadvertised and based around the \"people you know\". </p> <p>It all seems so simple, but if it really is to work this time the broadcasters have to be held to account. Chris Smith has already pledged to make sure chief executives keep promises they've made, but what about the ITC and the BBC governors, shouldn't they have a role? </p> <p>For example, how does the BBC shift responsibility for multiculturalism away from its specialist units into the channels as a whole? Most of the movement within the BBC has been on the staffing front, which will bring rewards in the long term if they can keep people from leaving. But how do they ensure that the next time they do a drama based in Glasgow, such as Glasgow Kiss, we'll actually see the Asian population of Glasgow represented? And if they can turn Gary Lineker into a decent football presenter, what black or Asian talent are they working with in sport? Should BBC2 have an hours remit like C4? These are all questions the BBC will need to consider if it is to make progress at the same rate as the change going on around it. </p> <p>ITV, on the other hand, may find itself in the situation where its major component companies, Carlton and Granada, are pushing hard to increase the ethnic mix in their offers without a similar shift in the commissioning attitudes of the Network Centre - look how long it took to get an Asian family into Coronation Street. </p> <p>It does involve all of us changing the way we work, and there will be mistakes. When we asked one independent company how many black or Asian staff they employed, they replied: \"We interviewed a number of ethnic minority directors, and the ones we recommended you [C4] rejected.\" But at least now it's all out in the open. And remember the scene at the end of Big Brother where Craig, Anna and Darren - a white working class scouser, an Irish lesbian ex-nun and a black father of three - were all hugging each other, ecstatic in their shared moment of triumph. The Big Brother house may have been artificial, but the people were real, and that effortless multiculturalism and their ease of presence in each other's company is what we need to aspire to, day in day out, on British television. Especially if Big Brother, or even Big Chris, is watching.</p> <p> <strong>How do six major TV channels compare when it comes to race representation?</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Sky One</strong> <br></p> <p>Sky One was the best performer. If you look at its overall output, including imports, it had by far the highest percentage of ethnic minority appearances at 13% - 8% black, 1% Asian and 4% others. However, when you took out imports such as Star Trek, the number fell from 62 to just 12, although the percentage only fell to 10% which still leaves it in first place. This 10% breaks down as seven black appearances, three by Asians and two by others. However, as all the Asians were in the same programme, an edition of British Tribes, it means Asians were entirely absent from the remaining 40-plus hours of Sky's UK programming surveyed. </p> <p><strong> Channel 5</strong> </p> <p>When it comes to UK-produced programmes, 7% of appearances on Channel 5 were by people from ethnic minorities. This put it in joint second place after Sky One. However, three male characters on its soap Family Affairs accounted for more than 70% of all the black men on Channel 5, and the five black members of the Family Affairs cast accounted for more than 50% of the channel's entire ethnic rep resentation. As for Asians, over the week there was one solitary Asian appearance - on Night Fever. </p> <p><strong> ITV</strong> </p> <p>In UK-produced programmes on ITV, ethnic minorities accounted for 7% of those surveyed, compared with 5.5% in the population at large. This put ITV in joint second place with Channel 5 and Channel 4, but the combined appearances of newsreader Shulie Ghosh and Coronation Street's Vikram Desai alone accounted for 32% of all the Asians on the channel - hardly a representative portrayal of British Asians. </p> <p><strong> BBC1</strong> </p> <p>In UK-produced programmes on BBC1, ethnic minorities accounted for 6% of those surveyed. However, three Asian women, Shefalia Oza, Nina Nanaar and Blue Peter's Konnie Huq, accounted for 50% of all Asian women appearing on the channel - and Oza and Nanaar can only be seen by viewers of the BBC Midlands news programme. </p> <p><strong> Channel 4</strong> </p> <p>Channel 4 is the only channel with a specific remit on portraying racial and cultural diversity. In UK-produced programmes on C4, 3% were black (29 people), 3% were Asian (29 people) and 1% others. Ethnic minorities accounted for 7% of those surveyed overall. Even here the Asian issue remains, because 15 of the Asians (50% of the Asians surveyed) were in one programme, a Cutting Edge documentary on the curry houses of Manchester. </p> <p><strong> BBC2</strong> </p> <p>The worst performing of all channels was BBC2, where 97% of the characters in speaking roles were white, 2% were black and 1% were Asian (five people). This is the channel that gave us Goodness Gracious Me and the iconic Millie in This Life, but once again the fragility of the Asian presence is apparent - of the five Asians surveyed, three were guests on Newsnight, one was a contestant on University Challenge and one was in a Video Nation Short.</p>",

And the BBC's Eve might need more than a fig leaf if rumours of early sales figures are true. </p> <p>Why, then, is Cabal Communications trying to buck the trend with Mondo, our new magazine to be launched on Wednesday? As the lifestyle magazine for the global hedonist (it will be racked on the stands with the men's titles), we believe we have an idea whose time has come - bear market or not. More practically, as publishers of Real Homes and Front - whose improving circulations stand in contrast to the bumpier ride endured by much of our competition despite their deeper pockets, we believe we know how to reach and keep the flesh-and-blood readers who lie behind the zeitgeist. </p> <p>No idea, however inspired, succeeds purely on its own merit - or its creators' self-belief. When Cabal started in 1998, the pressure was on to launch high-circulation titles as quickly as possible, knowing that months of advertising forward bookings would have to be sacrificed to the urgent necessity of establishing to the whole industry our credibility as a publisher of reader-friendly magazines. So it proved, although today's much healthier advertising revenues - up 100% year on year - suggest what might have been achieved had Front and Real Homes spent six months present ing to the advertising industry before launch. </p> <p>But, with Mondo, Cabal could afford to take its time to tune the launch of a radically different magazine proposition with a hitherto untargeted upscale potential readership. It is fully 14 months since its inventors, editor Push and deputy editor Mark Wernham, quit their successful careers on the IPC magazines Muzik and Melody Maker in order to develop the Mondo concept with fellow IPC renegade Sally O'Sullivan (our proprietress who, along with Front's editor Piers Hernu, stole every scene in BBC2's four-part documentary on Cabal broadcast earlier this year). </p> <p>For Push and Wernham, Mondo realises a dream. For O'Sullivan it is a magazine that not only adds to Cabal's strength in the male lifestyle market, but is a proposition that only a publisher with its tuned-in talent pool and lack of costly corporate impedimenta could achieve efficiently and without the fatal dilution that afflicts so many launches by big magazine combines. Think Later. Think Heat. Think of numerous short-lived titles published to fill a perceived gap in the market or protect a cash-cow title. </p> <p>By early spring, Push, Wernham and Cabal's advertising director, Mark Lonergan, had their pitch to the advertising industry polished to a high gleam, and Mondo's launch was scheduled for May. But two months before the due date, we switched the light from green to amber. Why? Firstly, Push collapsed and had to be hospitalised with a serious kidney complaint. Secondly, display space on the news-stands was at a premium in May due to intense promotional activity by our competitors, and Mondo could not be guaranteed the visibility on the shelves that is vital to any consumer magazine launch. </p> <p>Now, in October, we have plenty of prime shelf-space and an editor who is pursuing a slightly healthier lifestyle. In the weeks to come we at Cabal will see how well Mondo can swim. Being talked about in the right places should help. With its unapologetically libertarian, pleasure-seeking agenda and appeal to all those who have ever turned on, tuned in and gone travelling, tongues will wag. Furthermore, unlike existing male lifestyle magazines, Mondo is not a bunker to protect bruised male self-esteem. It does not hang a sign saying \"Girls keep out\". Addressing itself to self-confident, adventurous men, it will also provide a clubhouse for women who like to walk on the wild side. </p> <p>And being seen in the right places should prove the clincher. Mondo's launch strategy is geared to high visibility where it ultimately matters - at point of sale. From there, we believe that once we get the magazine into the hands of the intrigued or even mildly curious, its quality will convert the impulse buy into a habit. And then into a readership. And then into a brand. Watch this space, playmates.</p> <p> \u0095 Mat Snow is editorial director of Mondo</p>",

For O'Sullivan it is a magazine that not only adds to Cabal's strength in the male lifestyle market, but is a proposition that only a publisher with its tuned-in talent pool and lack of costly corporate impedimenta could achieve efficiently and without the fatal dilution that afflicts so many launches by big magazine combines. Think Later. Think Heat. Think of numerous short-lived titles published to fill a perceived gap in the market or protect a cash-cow title. By early spring, Push, Wernham and Cabal's advertising director, Mark Lonergan, had their pitch to the advertising industry polished to a high gleam, and Mondo's launch was scheduled for May. But two months before the due date, we switched the light from green to amber. Why? Firstly, Push collapsed and had to be hospitalised with a serious kidney complaint. Secondly, display space on the news-stands was at a premium in May due to intense promotional activity by our competitors, and Mondo could not be guaranteed the visibility on the shelves that is vital to any consumer magazine launch. Now, in October, we have plenty of prime shelf-space and an editor who is pursuing a slightly healthier lifestyle. In the weeks to come we at Cabal will see how well Mondo can swim. Being talked about in the right places should help. With its unapologetically libertarian, pleasure-seeking agenda and appeal to all those who have ever turned on, tuned in and gone travelling, tongues will wag. Furthermore, unlike existing male lifestyle magazines, Mondo is not a bunker to protect bruised male self-esteem. It does not hang a sign saying \"Girls keep out\". Addressing itself to self-confident, adventurous men, it will also provide a clubhouse for women who like to walk on the wild side. And being seen in the right places should prove the clincher. Mondo's launch strategy is geared to high visibility where it ultimately matters - at point of sale. From there, we believe that once we get the magazine into the hands of the intrigued or even mildly curious, its quality will convert the impulse buy into a habit. And then into a readership. And then into a brand. Watch this space, playmates. \u0095 Mat Snow is editorial director of Mondo",

      "body": "<p>I have two outstanding memories from my childhood years spent glued to Saturday morning kids' TV and neither of them particularly please the BBC head of children's entertainment, Chris Bellinger. The first dates back to a Going Live phone-in when the then pop sensation Five Star were given a verbal lambasting by a caller who bellowed down the phone how crap he thought they were before swiftly hanging up. \"That's only happened twice in the history of live children's phone-ins but it's always those that people remember,\" says Bellinger, as I re-enact the incident. </p> <p>The second is a clear image of a red front door neatly emblazoned with the bright, yellow number 73. Bellinger frowns when I mention this because it tells him, in no uncertain terms, that I am exactly what he dreads. \"Oh dear,\" he says, casting his eyes away from me and across the room, \"you're an ITV child.\" </p> <p>The problem for Bellinger is that there are too many \"ITV children\" around these days. Last year, and for what many believe to be the first time in the history of Saturday morning children's broadcasts, ITV beat BBC in the ratings game, pulling in approximately 364,000 more viewers per week. After wheeling out the same old formula for seven years, BBC's Live &amp; Kicking looked tired. The children noticed. They noticed too, that ITV's SM:TV had gained a certain verve or, as Bellinger puts it, \"started getting their act together after, let's face it, a pretty shaky start\". After that, the switch was easy. </p> <p>If you grew up with Saturday morning TV, chances are you grew up with Bellinger. He was there throughout the 70s and 80s, moulding Multi-Coloured Swap Shop and tweaking Saturday Superstore. He then fashioned and fine-tuned Going Live before bringing us Live &amp; Kicking throughout the 90s. Having been in the game almost 25 years, last year's poor performance was a blow. Yet this Saturday, Live &amp; Kicking returns to our screens in the hope of enticing back its lost viewers. It will be a task and a half, but Bellinger believes he has made the right moves to poach back the defectors. </p> <p>As well as four new presenters - among them former Blue Peter stalwart Katy Hill - the new, improved Live &amp; Kicking will also boast several series acquisitions which they hope will rival the popularity of SM:TV's Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Pok\u00e9mon. When I ask Bellinger for specifics, he scans his papers before concluding that, despite being keen to plug the new show, he doesn't actually want to say. All he will concede is that the changes are long overdue, citing his \"theory\" that the Saturday programmes tend to have a lifespan of about five or six years. \"I think ideally one would have refreshed the whole title at the end of about six years. We didn't,\" he admits, \"but we're doing it now.\" </p> <p>So, eight years in - and not a moment too soon - the BBC is ready to bear the cost of new music, sets, design and content. Interestingly, though, the title sticks. \"Well yes, because there's a tremendous amount of goodwill attached to it,\" says Bellinger before adding, like a true child of Birtism, that all their \"research\" and \"focus group work\" has borne that out. \"The brand is there,\" he says, \"Good, solid and strong.\" </p> <p>There is little doubt that that brand was strongest during the heyday years of Zo\u00eb Ball and Jamie Theakston. Not only were they a hard act for presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson to follow but, as Bellinger acknowledges, they changed the face and landscape of children's TV as well. These days, being a \"fun\" presenter is no longer enough. Shades of sexy, funky and more than a smidgen of funny have to be part of the package too. When Ball and Theakston upped and left, there were big shoes to fill. Unfortunately for Bellinger, SM:TV's Ant, Dec and Cat Deeley slipped neatly into them. </p> <p>For the BBC, the success of Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly is a double blow. Back in 1996, they had the Geordie duo as part of their portfolio but got twitchy about a flow of complaint letters suggesting they were all smut and no substance. The Ant and Dec Show was axed after only nine episodes and Bellinger now admits he is sorry they lost them to the opposition. \"They have grown with the audience, they understand the audience and occasionally, yeah, they do seem to overstep the mark with their cheeky banter but, hey, that tends to be inevitable with live shows.\" </p> <p>While both Katy Hill and her ITV rivals boast a core band of followers, where the double act prevail is in capturing the young adult market as well. Being outside his remit, it is not a loss that particularly irks Bellinger. \"We know what our core audience is and young adults are who we're aiming for,\" he says, succinctly. \"If we bring masses and masses of young adults in by-the-by, well, so be it. Jolly good. But that's not what we aspire to.\" </p> <p>Of course, the key ingredient to a successful children's show is to treat all viewers as adults: playing and performing to but never patronising its spectators. Bellinger may not be in front of the camera but he manages this feat extraordinarily well, nearly always referring to \"the audience\" rather than the children, and all the time alluding to the value of their point of view. Even amid last year's debacle he never questioned his ability to know his constituency. \"That's my job,\" he says, confidently, \"some of the stuff is gut feeling but we get a lot of advice on what they want because they write to us. That's the wonderful thing about kids. They write and tell you things while all adults ever do is write to complain. With our audience, we read their letters. We talk to them. We take notice of what they say. Maybe they like Pok\u00e9mon and Sabrina, but they certainly like what we do too.\" </p> <p>Still, SM:TV, with its short, attention-holding sketches and year-round presence, has an edge that even Bellinger will have a job chipping away at. Which may be why the arrival of Nigel Pickard, the brains behind the competition, is one of the most eagerly awaited BBC signings this side of the Teletubbies. Due to contractual obligations at ITV, Pickard can't take up his new post as CBBC controller before the Live &amp; Kicking relaunch, but Bellinger admits he \"can hardly wait for him to come and tell me how it works\". The very mention of Pickard seems to lift him. \"I'm delighted he's coming to join us, I have to say,\" he says, chuckling with excitement. \"What with his experience of Saturday mornings and my experience of Saturday mornings, I hope it will stand us in some stead.\" </p> <p>Yet while it looks set to be a winning team behind the scenes, there are no guarantees it will be so on screen. In 1996, Ant and Dec got a dressing down from the independent television commission after insinuating on one of their live shows that Katy Hill was \"asking for it\". Four years on, Hill is set to go head-to-head with her slanderers who now happen to be two of the best presenters in children's TV. It will be a tough job and one that will truly test the strength of her crowd-pulling charms. But by taking the reins of an ailing title in the first place, you could even say she is asking for it.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Friday's announcement of a link-up between US film giant Universal and cable operator NTL typifies the market for digital television in the UK: everyone wants a piece. The list of players involved is a who's who of media big hitters. NTL is linked to BSkyB, which is linked to French media giant Vivendi, which is linked to Universal. A winter of manoeuvring is approaching and the question on everyone's lips is, will this circle of convenience hold? </p> <p>The NTL and Universal channel is to be called The Studio, combining the UK's largest broadband company with a major Hollywood studio which has a catalogue of blockbusters including The Mummy, Notting Hill and Babe. It's an intimidating team, and sends out the message to Sky, the dominant player in UK digital TV, that the opposition are finally getting their act together. </p> <p>The deal is open to NTL subscribers at basic tier entry-level at no extra cost, and will be available on all platforms when it launches in the next six months. It is therefore not a premium channel, unlike Sky's movie offerings, and the considerable Universal archive will give it added appeal. </p> <p>NTL denies it is an aggressive move, pointing out that it recently signed a five-year carriage deal with BSkyB, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Its unexpected anxiety about staying onside with Sky relates as much to the other key pay-TV content, football, as it does to the new battleground of Hollywood movies. </p> <p>Both NTL and Sky hold stakes in several Premier League clubs, both own a slug of the next season's pay-TV screening rights, NTL on pay-per-view matches, Sky on basic. The arrangement between the two is expected to lead to pay-per-view football channels. For the moment, at least, they are allies. Steve Wagner, managing director of NTL, says: \"I speak to BSkyB all the time and they understand what we are doing. We are trying to change the economics of the digital business, to let consumers benefit. If consumers benefit, then BSkyB will do even better. This is a win and win situation.\" </p> <p>Wagner adds that The Studio has been offered to Sky Digital, though no deal has been concluded. Analysts point out that NTL has committed millions of pounds every year to marketing Sky's premium channels, including its movie package, as part of the carriage deal. But NTL saw the potential in Universal's offer and is obviously itching to get its hands on exclusive content and stop Sky from surging ahead. </p> <p>\"Universal and NTL are trying to set up a basic movie channel and see if it works,\" says one analyst. \"Sky will want to see how long they can wait to carry it, which will be interesting to watch, though they will certainly carry it eventually.\" </p> <p>NTL knows it has to get its skates on. Sky has 4.5m subscribers, of whom 80% receive a digital service, while NTL has a target of just 500,000 subscribers by the end of the year. But it should not feel too self-conscious - as the third player in the digital market, ONdigital, co-owned by ITV big hitters Carlton and Granada, only has 750,000 users. </p> <p>NTL's trump card is its cable coverage. Since snapping up telecoms company Cable &amp; Wireless, its broadband network has the capacity to reach 12m homes. If this distribution platform can be married to content - and there must be more joint ventures in the broadband pipeline - then Sky will be looking over its shoulder on a more regular basis. </p> <p>And Sky's streak into the distance has come at a cost. Moody's Investors Service, a major credit rating agency, recently downgraded the debt rating of Sky due to a \"continuing weakness in the company's financial profile\". Its aggressive push into the digital market has seen its debts soar from \u00a3665m in June 1999 to \u00a31.1bn 12 months later. However, Sky insists that analogue television can be switched off by 2006, and if it stays ahead of the competition, it will reap the benefits. </p> <p>But the key - and still somewhat shadowy - figure in the NTL and Universal agreement is Vivendi, the French media conglomerate. Vivendi is in the process of securing European Commission approval of its \u00a323bn merger with Seagram of Canada, which owns Universal Studios and Universal Music. The upshot is that very, very quietly - there is not a mention of Vivendi or its pay-TV giant Canal Plus on the press release - last week's deal suddenly puts the company nose-to-nose with Sky. </p> <p>Eyebrows are raised in Isleworth because Vivendi holds a 25% stake in Sky, yet has decided to launch The Studio with another operator. Even though Universal is technically not yet part of Vivendi, it is known that the French company has encouraged the deal all the way. </p> <p>So why fly in the face of Murdoch? The answer lies with Jean-Marie Messier, the Vivendi chairman, who is determined to make inroads into the UK market. His first steps have been made with the multiple-access internet portal Vizzavi, which has been soft-launched in the UK with mobile phone operator Vodafone, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>Messier wants access to the digital market not just here but all over the world, and, analysts say, he is anxious to do this with Murdoch rather than against him. However, Murdoch has held off from letting Vivendi fold its Sky stake into Sky Global Networks, the soon-to-float umbrella company formed from News Corporation's satellite operations. </p> <p>For the first time, Murdoch is showing signs that he is willing to dilute his family's grip on NewsCorp, as underlined by last week's share-swap with US cable giant Liberty Media. Under the terms of the deal, Liberty took a 4.7% stake in Sky Global and increased its holding in NewsCorp from 7% to 18%. </p> <p>Messier is now waiting for Murdoch to approach his company with an offer and the Australian-born magnate has indicated that he is willing to do so. If Murdoch prevaricates, then Vivendi will continue to take a slice of the UK, and global, digital market by alternative means. </p> <p>A senior observer close to the NTL and Universal deal said last week: \"Sky will be hacked off that the arrangement carries no commitment to them, but it might concentrate their minds towards Vivendi. There is a lot of stuff that they can do together, and a movie channel is the very least they can do. </p> <p>\"That said, if little beginnings can grow to bigger alliances, then they can also lead to bigger bust-ups.\" </p> <p>It is true that the Universal and NTL deal is not an earth-shaker, but the bigger rumblings are sure to come.</p>",

The upshot is that very, very quietly - there is not a mention of Vivendi or its pay-TV giant Canal Plus on the press release - last week's deal suddenly puts the company nose-to-nose with Sky. Eyebrows are raised in Isleworth because Vivendi holds a 25% stake in Sky, yet has decided to launch The Studio with another operator. Even though Universal is technically not yet part of Vivendi, it is known that the French company has encouraged the deal all the way. So why fly in the face of Murdoch? The answer lies with Jean-Marie Messier, the Vivendi chairman, who is determined to make inroads into the UK market. His first steps have been made with the multiple-access internet portal Vizzavi, which has been soft-launched in the UK with mobile phone operator Vodafone, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Messier wants access to the digital market not just here but all over the world, and, analysts say, he is anxious to do this with Murdoch rather than against him. However, Murdoch has held off from letting Vivendi fold its Sky stake into Sky Global Networks, the soon-to-float umbrella company formed from News Corporation's satellite operations. For the first time, Murdoch is showing signs that he is willing to dilute his family's grip on NewsCorp, as underlined by last week's share-swap with US cable giant Liberty Media. Under the terms of the deal, Liberty took a 4.7% stake in Sky Global and increased its holding in NewsCorp from 7% to 18%. Messier is now waiting for Murdoch to approach his company with an offer and the Australian-born magnate has indicated that he is willing to do so. If Murdoch prevaricates, then Vivendi will continue to take a slice of the UK, and global, digital market by alternative means. A senior observer close to the NTL and Universal deal said last week: \"Sky will be hacked off that the arrangement carries no commitment to them, but it might concentrate their minds towards Vivendi. There is a lot of stuff that they can do together, and a movie channel is the very least they can do. \"That said, if little beginnings can grow to bigger alliances, then they can also lead to bigger bust-ups.\" It is true that the Universal and NTL deal is not an earth-shaker, but the bigger rumblings are sure to come.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Trevor Kavanagh is the most influential man in British politics. So said former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke of the Sun's political editor, and he wasn't joking. </p> <p>When I ask Kavanagh to comment, just as I expected, he brushes the notion aside. \"I am not personally influential. I just happen to work for the most influential newspaper in Britain.\" But there is a twinkle in those bright eyes. However sincere the modest response - and Kavanagh is certainly no show-off - he can't help but take pleasure from Clarke's encomium. </p> <p>Whatever crude public image exists of a tabloid hack, Kavanagh certainly doesn't fit it. Tall, slim, with a neatly-trimmed grey beard, he might easily be mistaken for an academic or a country solicitor. </p> <p>He is undemonstrative, self-controlled and, in his radio and TV interviews, comes across as a man of sweet reason while answering questions in a deep, well-modulated voice. At 57, he is one of the most experienced of Sun staff. From my years as a colleague, I remember him as the most unflappable of executives, coping well under pressure. Amidst the welter of froth and trivia that is the Sun's main diet, he has always been an oasis of sobriety. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" he says with a half-smile. \"I'm the fig leaf for page three. I'm the serious one writing on page two, on the respectable side of the paper.\" </p> <p>He is well aware of his image, telling an anecdote from his days as a industrial correspondent. At a union conference he was sharing a cab with Donald MacIntyre, then with the Times, and Charlie Rae of the Daily Star. The cabbie, asked to guess who represented which paper, \"thought Donald was with the Star, Charlie was on the Sun and was convinced I was the Times man.\" He says: \"I haven't tried to project that image. It's amazing what a bald head and a beard can do for you.\" </p> <p>But there is grit too, illustrated well in his persistent cross-questioning of Tony Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell during a lobby briefing filmed by Michael Cockerell's documentary team. On Campbell, Kavanagh - who confided to me before the election that the ex-Mirror reporter would soon be \"found out\" - appears to have totally changed his mind. \"Alastair has grown in my estimation substantially as the years have passed. He's a self-confessed propagandist, but basically, he is an honest man even if, when necessary, he diverts you from the path you would prefer you to go down. When it comes to the test, when all the big issues have been revealed in leaks and stories, Alastair has been on the side of the angels. Overall, he is extremely good news for Tony.\" </p> <p>Sun readers, if they notice at all, know Kavanagh through what he writes, and that's what really counts. Surely, by acknowledging the Sun's considerable influence, his status as political editor puts him in the ideological driving seat? </p> <p>\"I suppose that implication might be drawn,\" he says, \"but what counts is the paper not the person.\" He qualifies even this when I ask if he believes that the Sun - the paper wot claimed to have won it for Major in 1992 and backed Blair enthusiastically in 1997 - can deliver decisive election-winning votes. </p> <p>\"There are two totally contradictory academic reports on this. One concluded that we could perhaps sway 2% of the voters in a certain direction, while the other said we have no effect at all. </p> <p>\"I think you should see instead us as pushing at an open door. If the country's mood is going one way, and so are we, then I guess we might have an effect on some of our readers, confirming their prejudices at the time.\" </p> <p>Roughly 11m people a day read the Sun, people said by most psephologists to matter crucially at elections because most are swing voters without a firm party allegiance. A Mori poll taken before the summer of discontent showed 54% of Sun readers would vote Labour and only 29% Tory. Earlier this month, Mori found just 40% of Sun readers prepared to vote Labour and the Tories up to 34%. </p> <p>Are the Sun and Kavanagh responsible because they adopted a much more trenchant line against Blair, or is that the wider public view, unaffected by what newspapers have said? If the readers opened the door, did the Sun give them the key? Kavanagh agrees that the Sun has \"a unique position in the British media. It has a cutting edge, perhaps even a jagged edge occasionally, which is very effective in pushing or opposing policy\". </p> <p>His commentaries have certainly been cutting in the past week. He wrote that Blair is guilty of a \"breach of trust\" ... \"once-pristine Labour has been tarnished\" ... ministers have told \"outrageous lies about refinery protesters\". Ominously, he also warned of bad times to come because \"other skeletons are rattling in the cupboard\". </p> <p>He has given the government a pasting over petrol, pensions, the Dome and the reawakened storm over Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m donation. And two years ago Kavanagh was the man behind the \"Tell us the truth Tony: Are we being run by a gay mafia?\" splash. </p> <p>Those are just the bits under his byline. His influence goes deeper because his counsel is valued by editor David Yelland, as it was by his predecessor Stuart Higgins - and by the Sun's owner Rupert Murdoch, it's widely assumed, although he denies having a direct line to Rupert, and, asked if he speaks to him often, replies \"very infrequently\". He therefore plays a leading role in making Sun policy. Ultimately, this affects not only the content of leading articles but the way stories are angled and, by extension, those front-page headlines which sum up the paper's increasingly critical attitude towards Labour. </p> <p>For those of us unconvinced by the paper's support for Blair in the first place, this is no surprise. But Kavanagh prefers to see the Sun's political allegiances in terms of policies rather than parties. \"We are for good economic management, small government, small taxes, law and order and strong defence.\" Then he reminds me that the paper supported Blair as distinct from the Labour party. \"Really, our trust is implicitly in Tony Blair.\" </p> <p>In him alone, not in chancellor Gordon Brown? \"We were pleasantly impressed with Brown, and to some extent surprised at the way he has handled the economy. We do have reservations about the move towards redistribution, which is gathering pace. The S-word that was mentioned during the speeches wasn't sorrow, it was socialism. And there is definitely a hint of a drift back to that. They're going to pour more money into all the state areas, health and education and whatever it is that the left wing are very pleased to hear about.\" </p> <p>So the National Health Service and schooling is leftwing, eh? The truth is that you're a Tory, I tell him, and your heart must have sunk the day you were told that Rupert Murdoch decided to back Blair rather than John Major in the last election. </p> <p>Kavanagh says: \"There's no secret about the fact that I was opposed to a direct switch from Tories to Labour. But I could see the argument about the Tories having got to the end of the road for the time being, and it wasn't such a dramatic change to support Blair.\" </p> <p>Kavanagh had, like the Sun, been one of Margaret Thatcher's greatest supporters: \"It was a tremendous cavalry charge through the 80s and we enjoyed being the Tories' bugler.\" </p> <p>Born into a Labour-supporting family, with a Dublin-born father who was an upholsterer, he regarded himself as a working-class lad. His political conversion began in Australia. After leaving his Surrey grammar school, he started his career on a local weekly before joining the Hereford Evening News as agricultural correspondent. </p> <p>After a spell on various papers in Australia, he went to work on a Murdoch paper, becoming a political correspondent in Canberra during one of the country's most tempestuous political periods.\"I witnessed Gough Whitlam's Labour government coming apart at the seams because it was incompetent. Then, in a visit back to Britain in 1977, I realised the same sort of thing was happening here.\" He returned for good the following year with an Australian wife. They have two grown-up sons who both went to a comprehensive school. </p> <p>\"I literally walked back into the winter of discontent,\" recalls Kavanagh. \"Whatever Labour sympathies I had were diluted by seeing the results of our tribal labour movement. Then they evaporated altogether when I became the Sun's industrial correspondent which meant, in effect, being the strikes reporter.\" </p> <p>It was in 1983, when editor Kelvin MacKenzie fired Walter Terry - \"the doyen, a legend\", says Kavanagh - that he was surprised to be chosen as his successor. He had a tough time at the beginning, as everyone did at the Sun in those days, but MacKenzie grew to appreciate his work. </p> <p>Last week he told me he regarded Kavanagh as \"one of the best six journalists ever on the Sun\". He also suffered much less than the rest of us from MacKenzie's sharp tongue. There is something about Kavanagh's bearing, a modesty and cool demeanour, which warns off the ranters. </p> <p>\"Anyway,\" recalls Kavanagh, \"politically, Kelvin and I were in broad agreement and we worked very well together. The proprietor, the editor and the readership were totally in tune with the country at large.\" </p> <p>He argues that the paper supported Thatcher because of her policies and that the Sun has maintained a consistent line on policies ever since. </p> <p>Perhaps the most obvious Sun obsession is its hostility to further European integration, especially the idea of a single currency. \"In our mind, the argument against is crystal clear and the argument for is clouded. Essentially, it's about sovereignty. The alternative is undemocratic, unrepresentative and bureaucratic.\" </p> <p>Building on its oppositional platform on Europe, the Sun appears to have added new tiers recently. Is the paper planning to support William Hague's Tories instead? It would seem not. </p> <p>\"Blair hasn't given us any reason to change the views we expressed in the last election. The economy is still going well, which is the crucial, number-one issue. He has shown himself much stronger on defence than we could have expected. </p> <p>\"There are certain areas in difficulty, devolution and regional mayors are a mess, we're at loggerheads over the Dome and on the pensions issue, though we think they're right: you can't link them to earnings. So there are areas where we are at odds. But on the big issues, I don't think we could say he's betrayed our trust.\" </p> <p>He adds quickly: \"Anyway, the final decision is obviously not mine, or even the editor's. But I see no indication that we are going to change.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Roy Greenslade was assistant editor of the Sun from 1981-6</p>",

Last night not even Michael Aspel's Antiques Roadshow presenting debut (7.1m/33%, 6.45-7.30pm) and the return of the original Nasty Nick - Cotton - to EastEnders (8.3m/32%, from 8pm) could halt the ITV ratings juggernaut.</p> <p>Kids Say the Funniest Things (7.1m/33%) level-pegged with Antiques Roadshow from 7pm.

(12.2m/47%).</p> <p>From 9pm, Tough Love, ITV's police drama starring Ray Winstone and Adrian Dunbar, opened with 7.5m/33%, holding its own against BBC1 line-up Down to Earth (7.1m/28%), a Vicar of Dibley repeat (7.4m/32%) and the conclusion of Joanna Trollope adaptation Other People's Children (4.3m/23%).</p> <p>On Friday night ITV sucessfully repeated James Bond movie Goldeneye (8.8m, 41%) from 8.40pm, wiping the floor with Penelope Keith - Lady of the Manor (5.6m, 25%), News (4.7m, 21%), Parkinson (5.2m, 24%) and a repeat of Robson Green drama vehicle The Student Prince (3.5m, 25%) on BBC1. </p> <p>Earlier that night, the return of Ground Force (7.9m/36%) at 8pm against The Bill (7.5m/34%), gave BBC1 a rare peak time ratings victory.</p> <p>Channel 4's Friday night audience figures have slipped back post-Big Brother. Last Friday, Friends (2.7m/12%) still outgunned Room 101 (2.1m/9%) from 9pm, but then at 9.30pm critically lauded new Graham Linehan/Dylan Moran sitcom Black Books (1.3m/6%) opened disappointingly against Never Mind the Buzzcocks (2.1m/9%).</p> <p>The drop in viewing figures is not restricted to Friday night. In the week ending Sunday 17 September, when Big Brother finished, Channel 4 notched up an 11.2% share of weekly viewing. In the following seven-day period - to Sunday 24 September - the weekly share figure dipped to 8.5%.</p> <p>On Sunday night from 8pm, Channel 4's William Hague profile, Just William &amp; Ffion (1.4m/6%), narrowly beat the final instalment of weighty BBC2 Robert Hughes documentary Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore (1.2m/5%). </p> <p>From 9pm, Peter Kosminsky's latest docu-drama, Innocents, which dealt with the Bristol Royal Infirmary baby heart surgery scandal, drew 1.2m/6%. At the same time Channel 5 was getting a cost-effective 2.6m/12%, with imported Jean-Claude Van Damme street fighting film Awol.</p> <p>Following on from Van Damme at 10.55pm, Channel 5's US documentary series, Murder Detectives (1.8m/20%), benefited from arts programming on other channels. The South Bank Show (1.8m/18%, 10.45-11.50pm) returned to ITV with a profile of Andrew Lloyd Webber/ Ben Elton musical The Beautiful Game and BBC2 was covering The Leeds International Piano Competition (0.6m/5%, 10pm-12 midnight).</p> <p>BBC1's Olympic coverage finished with a ratings flourish yesterday morning, helped by two more British gold medals and the spectacular closing ceremony. Between 6am and 1pm, the channel's audience share was over 50% for all but one 45-minute period. </p> <p>Live coverage of the closing events on Olympic Grandstand averaged 1.6m/54%, 6-9am; then Olympic Review had 3.8m/51%, 9-9.50am; while Olympic Grandstand returned for the closing ceremony, with a majestic 5.3m/59%, up to 1pm.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BBC1's Jill Dando tribute show, A Song For Jill, failed to turn public sympathy into top ratings on Saturday night, losing out to yet another Denis Norden-hosted funny clips show on ITV. A Song For Jill averaged 6m/28% share from 8.55-9.45pm; while Denis Norden's Fifth Laughter File drew 7.6m/35% from 8.55-9.55pm, according to unofficial overnights. The general pattern of ITV peak time dominance was repeated across the weekend. Last night not even Michael Aspel's Antiques Roadshow presenting debut (7.1m/33%, 6.45-7.30pm) and the return of the original Nasty Nick - Cotton - to EastEnders (8.3m/32%, from 8pm) could halt the ITV ratings juggernaut. Kids Say the Funniest Things (7.1m/33%) level-pegged with Antiques Roadshow from 7pm. Then from 7.30pm the ITV big guns kick in, with Coronation Street (13.8m/57%) followed by a 60-minute Who Wants to be a Millionaire? (12.2m/47%). From 9pm, Tough Love, ITV's police drama starring Ray Winstone and Adrian Dunbar, opened with 7.5m/33%, holding its own against BBC1 line-up Down to Earth (7.1m/28%), a Vicar of Dibley repeat (7.4m/32%) and the conclusion of Joanna Trollope adaptation Other People's Children (4.3m/23%). On Friday night ITV sucessfully repeated James Bond movie Goldeneye (8.8m, 41%) from 8.40pm, wiping the floor with Penelope Keith - Lady of the Manor (5.6m, 25%), News (4.7m, 21%), Parkinson (5.2m, 24%) and a repeat of Robson Green drama vehicle The Student Prince (3.5m, 25%) on BBC1. Earlier that night, the return of Ground Force (7.9m/36%) at 8pm against The Bill (7.5m/34%), gave BBC1 a rare peak time ratings victory. Channel 4's Friday night audience figures have slipped back post-Big Brother. Last Friday, Friends (2.7m/12%) still outgunned Room 101 (2.1m/9%) from 9pm, but then at 9.30pm critically lauded new Graham Linehan/Dylan Moran sitcom Black Books (1.3m/6%) opened disappointingly against Never Mind the Buzzcocks (2.1m/9%). The drop in viewing figures is not restricted to Friday night. In the week ending Sunday 17 September, when Big Brother finished, Channel 4 notched up an 11.2% share of weekly viewing. In the following seven-day period - to Sunday 24 September - the weekly share figure dipped to 8.5%. On Sunday night from 8pm, Channel 4's William Hague profile, Just William &amp; Ffion (1.4m/6%), narrowly beat the final instalment of weighty BBC2 Robert Hughes documentary Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore (1.2m/5%). From 9pm, Peter Kosminsky's latest docu-drama, Innocents, which dealt with the Bristol Royal Infirmary baby heart surgery scandal, drew 1.2m/6%. At the same time Channel 5 was getting a cost-effective 2.6m/12%, with imported Jean-Claude Van Damme street fighting film Awol. Following on from Van Damme at 10.55pm, Channel 5's US documentary series, Murder Detectives (1.8m/20%), benefited from arts programming on other channels. The South Bank Show (1.8m/18%, 10.45-11.50pm) returned to ITV with a profile of Andrew Lloyd Webber/ Ben Elton musical The Beautiful Game and BBC2 was covering The Leeds International Piano Competition (0.6m/5%, 10pm-12 midnight). BBC1's Olympic coverage finished with a ratings flourish yesterday morning, helped by two more British gold medals and the spectacular closing ceremony. Between 6am and 1pm, the channel's audience share was over 50% for all but one 45-minute period. Live coverage of the closing events on Olympic Grandstand averaged 1.6m/54%, 6-9am; then Olympic Review had 3.8m/51%, 9-9.50am; while Olympic Grandstand returned for the closing ceremony, with a majestic 5.3m/59%, up to 1pm.",

The prime minister has delivered a widely admired prime ministerial address to his conference. The chancellor has kissed his pretty new lady in red. There are disgruntled senior citizens and difficult Danes to think about now.</p> <p>A certain insouciance, indeed, begins to infect Labour thinking. One poll, at least, shows them marginally on the mend. John Prescott is suddenly cocky enough to hurl insults at the petrol blockaders. Lord Macdonald of Tradeston (Lord Nuts-and-bolts of Transport) boldly informs his fellow peers that he sees nil need for apologies. \"No group should seek to derail democratic decision-making through disruption to essential services.\"</p> <p>The plans against any future refinery problems are in place. The government is still standing - and professes itself more concerned about the many (pensioners) rather than the few (farmers and hauliers). Even Europe, which hasn't happened yet and may never happen at this rate, seems a jollier topic for prognostication. At least Copenhagen has dragged William Hague's Bournemouth back into the old routines of never-never-hardly-ever land.</p> <p>Gordon Brown talks about \"hard-working families\". Tony Blair speaks of \"a fight worth fighting\". The rhetoric that put Al Gore back in business is seamlessly nicked - and the spasm of early September is deemed just that. A passing twitch. Ministers refer to it as \"a blip\". Such blips, apparently, come and go. Who'll remember a motley crew of no-account blipping Poujadists (yes, that word again) next spring? A blip today is a clear blue sky tomorrow.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. Just because the old gang's gone down to the seaside and spent a few bibulous days cheering itself up in a cocoon of comradeship doesn't mean the blip verdict is wrong. But it does not mean it's right, either.</p> <p>The secondary curse of the pump rebellion is that all the interested parties have tacked their favourite conclusions on to the same frail framework of facts. Thus the Daily Mail sees Euro-arrogance as the root of revolt. Thus Big John finds a fox-hunter in his tank. Thus Barbara Castle gets another chance to do her number about restoring the link.</p> <p>All bridges too far. The truth may be far simpler. Look back to the last time an elected government, after due parliamentary scrutiny, decided to levy a new tax. It had many good arguments on its side. Its proposition was manifestly fairer - especially to anxious pensioners - than what had gone before. It gave those who believed in democracy a stake in the workings of that democracy. It exalted responsible spending and penalised the profligate. And - just like filling up your car with unleaded - it was an automatic impost devoted to the greater glory of roads and social services and public health.</p> <p>You will recall Mrs T's community charge (though, in Frankenstein food mode, you'll probably recall the poll tax more clearly). The Lady, 10 years back, was still in her pomp. According to The Spectator, \"her years of government have shown that Tories can successfully risk much more than in the 60s and 70s they thought possible.\" The charge fitted \"comfortably with traditional Tory attitudes\". God bless all who sailed in it.</p> <p>And what happened? Bloody riots in the streets, not to mention Trafalgar Square. Mass campaigns of non-payment and defiance. Months of utter turmoil (featuring at least 30 Labour MPs as well as a motley crew of Trots and small businessmen that Poujade would have been proud to call his own). Result: headlong retreat - plus the head of the prime minister.</p> <p>It is, perhaps, not surprising that nobody had striven to make much of the parallel. Conservative newspapers can recite every clause of Maastricht, but the poll tax doesn't feature in their folk memory. Labour, too, would prefer to forget a tricky period when the party wriggled on the fence of duty and legality. We ought to remember, though. We ought to remember how things can go terribly wrong.</p> <p>Simply, that tax - replacing the acknowledged shamble called rates - required those who lived in a borough to pay something towards the cost of the services their local authority provided for them: the schools, the care, the buses and meals on wheels, the fundamentals of decent living. It wasn't fair that a widow living alone in the family house should have to pay as much as the family of six (four of them working) next door. It was hopeless to expect budgetary restraint when the prime customers for council services were used to getting them free.</p> <p>A tolerable case? Forget it. Those who had paid nothing were asked to pay something. They didn't like it. Those who had paid something were often asked to pay more. Ditto. You could have said that the energy-intensive house next door (all those baths and all that central heating) was environmentally unfriendly and deserved to do an extra spot of polluter-paying: but Mrs Thatcher, unlike Mr Brown, wasn't into green stuff. The brutal fact was that it wouldn't have mattered, any more than the debating lines of harassed ministers at the dispatch box mattered.</p> <p>The community charge was a charge too far.

      "bodyText": "And so the agenda moves on, as agendas tend to do. It is three long weeks since the worst of the fuel fracas. The prime minister has delivered a widely admired prime ministerial address to his conference. The chancellor has kissed his pretty new lady in red. There are disgruntled senior citizens and difficult Danes to think about now. A certain insouciance, indeed, begins to infect Labour thinking. One poll, at least, shows them marginally on the mend. John Prescott is suddenly cocky enough to hurl insults at the petrol blockaders. Lord Macdonald of Tradeston (Lord Nuts-and-bolts of Transport) boldly informs his fellow peers that he sees nil need for apologies. \"No group should seek to derail democratic decision-making through disruption to essential services.\" The plans against any future refinery problems are in place. The government is still standing - and professes itself more concerned about the many (pensioners) rather than the few (farmers and hauliers). Even Europe, which hasn't happened yet and may never happen at this rate, seems a jollier topic for prognostication. At least Copenhagen has dragged William Hague's Bournemouth back into the old routines of never-never-hardly-ever land. Gordon Brown talks about \"hard-working families\". Tony Blair speaks of \"a fight worth fighting\". The rhetoric that put Al Gore back in business is seamlessly nicked - and the spasm of early September is deemed just that. A passing twitch. Ministers refer to it as \"a blip\". Such blips, apparently, come and go. Who'll remember a motley crew of no-account blipping Poujadists (yes, that word again) next spring? A blip today is a clear blue sky tomorrow. Well, perhaps. Just because the old gang's gone down to the seaside and spent a few bibulous days cheering itself up in a cocoon of comradeship doesn't mean the blip verdict is wrong. But it does not mean it's right, either. The secondary curse of the pump rebellion is that all the interested parties have tacked their favourite conclusions on to the same frail framework of facts. Thus the Daily Mail sees Euro-arrogance as the root of revolt. Thus Big John finds a fox-hunter in his tank. Thus Barbara Castle gets another chance to do her number about restoring the link. All bridges too far. The truth may be far simpler. Look back to the last time an elected government, after due parliamentary scrutiny, decided to levy a new tax. It had many good arguments on its side. Its proposition was manifestly fairer - especially to anxious pensioners - than what had gone before. It gave those who believed in democracy a stake in the workings of that democracy. It exalted responsible spending and penalised the profligate. And - just like filling up your car with unleaded - it was an automatic impost devoted to the greater glory of roads and social services and public health. You will recall Mrs T's community charge (though, in Frankenstein food mode, you'll probably recall the poll tax more clearly). The Lady, 10 years back, was still in her pomp. According to The Spectator, \"her years of government have shown that Tories can successfully risk much more than in the 60s and 70s they thought possible.\" The charge fitted \"comfortably with traditional Tory attitudes\". God bless all who sailed in it. And what happened? Bloody riots in the streets, not to mention Trafalgar Square. Mass campaigns of non-payment and defiance. Months of utter turmoil (featuring at least 30 Labour MPs as well as a motley crew of Trots and small businessmen that Poujade would have been proud to call his own). Result: headlong retreat - plus the head of the prime minister. It is, perhaps, not surprising that nobody had striven to make much of the parallel. Conservative newspapers can recite every clause of Maastricht, but the poll tax doesn't feature in their folk memory. Labour, too, would prefer to forget a tricky period when the party wriggled on the fence of duty and legality. We ought to remember, though. We ought to remember how things can go terribly wrong. Simply, that tax - replacing the acknowledged shamble called rates - required those who lived in a borough to pay something towards the cost of the services their local authority provided for them: the schools, the care, the buses and meals on wheels, the fundamentals of decent living. It wasn't fair that a widow living alone in the family house should have to pay as much as the family of six (four of them working) next door. It was hopeless to expect budgetary restraint when the prime customers for council services were used to getting them free. A tolerable case? Forget it. Those who had paid nothing were asked to pay something. They didn't like it. Those who had paid something were often asked to pay more. Ditto. You could have said that the energy-intensive house next door (all those baths and all that central heating) was environmentally unfriendly and deserved to do an extra spot of polluter-paying: but Mrs Thatcher, unlike Mr Brown, wasn't into green stuff. The brutal fact was that it wouldn't have mattered, any more than the debating lines of harassed ministers at the dispatch box mattered. The community charge was a charge too far. It, too, was unfair. Those who had more should pay more. The demonstrators went wild. The quieter populace looked on benignly, silently applauding. People power wrecked Westminster power. Sorry? Got the message? Absolutely: the message was unmistakable. Exit Thatcher, enter Major (and Heseltine pouring treacle over the remnants of poll taxation). And the lessons were easy. Politicians aren't always good at knowing what they can sell. Errors and delusions pile on top of each other. The public can demand a change of course and leaders who don't listen can wind up blobs.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Sophie Raworth, the pretty half of the BBC's new breakfast team, has caused quite a stir among blue-chip types. Eyebrows were raised at BBC news after she was found to have a website set up by a celebrity stalker. And it gets worse. Sophie's name mysteriously yields a link to a US adult site called Celeb Secrets: \"The web storehouse for nude celebrities\". Meanwhile, as the battle of the breakfast bulletins shapes up, it's nice to know GMTV isn't reacting by running upmarket. Monkey understands that a well-known ballerina, whose agent approached the network offering an exclusive interview, was turned down on the grounds that \"ballet dancers are too upmarket for us. They turn off our viewers\". </p> <p>\u0095 Anyone remember Stefano Hatfield, the former editor-in-chief of Campaign who defected to the monthly US trade mag Ad Age International? Tall bloke, lots of hair? Well he's been working his little Gucci socks off over in New York to relaunch and rebrand the title as Ad Age Global - and what an enormous difference it has made. Introducing the new-look magazine, Hatfield asks readers to \"let us know what you think\" about the revamp by email. Unfortunately his new email address is shatfield@crain.com. Apparently the magisterial Shatfield has issued edicts to his minions that he \"doesn't want any jokes\". So no comments about the shat hitting the fan or shatting on your own doorstep. </p> <p>\u0095 Monkey prints without further comment an email sent last week from Tonight with Trevor McDonald editor Jeff Anderson to his production team: \"Did any of you watch Panorama last night? Apparently there was a fuel crisis a couple of weeks ago with garages running dry, food shortages in the shops and hospital operations being cancelled. Why didn't any of you tell me about this at the time? Can none of you spot a story? Thank God there's at least one programme out there doing proper current affairs. You're all fired.\" </p> <p>\u0095 BBC governors are to debate the News at Ten issue at their next meeting on October 19, after facing cross-party demands for a climbdown. Those with an inside track say they are likely to split down the middle, play for time, and produce a fudge. Chairman Sir Christopher Bland and Greg Dyke remain most gung ho about going to head to head with ITV, but Tony Hall, director of BBC News, is briefing key figures that the move has been pushed back from September to November 2001 - safely after an October election. Chris Smith and Number 10 also have two other lines of attack: the BBC has to consult over its changes to services, and the appointment of a BBC vice-chair to succeed Baroness (Barbara) Young has yet to be made. </p> <p>\u0095 The extraordinary game of musical chairs taking place in television drama is set to continue. Jo Wright, controller of drama at LWT - the woman who tempted Ross Kemp away from the BBC - is expected to leave her post by the New Year after being wooed away by a major independent producer. Her deputy, Laura Mackie, was confirmed as heading to the BBC on Friday. Granada has already lost Simon Lewis and Sue Hogg to the BBC - they're setting up in the Radio 1 building. Why is Granada so careless with drama executives? \"The continuous financial pressures get to you, unless you are a Granada lifer,\" says one escapee. </p> <p>\u0095 Independent producers' lobby group Pact are furious at the way some TV series are being wrongly labelled as coming from the Midlands in the end credits - to give the appearance of complying with regional quotas - when they're actually made in London. Representatives say that offenders include Bazal's Flatmates and the BBC's Star for a Night. As for Mentorn Barraclough Carey's announcement that they are pulling out of Birmingham in favour of Oxford, a source says: \"They actually left their office last March, since then it's been up for sale. What is going on is disgraceful.\" </p> <p>\u0095 And they're off ... Media Monkey has been inspired by plucky Team GB's medal haul down under to launch its own Olympic ranking, based on which UK media outfit has the most top executives in Sydney on sports-related jollies.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Sophie Raworth, the pretty half of the BBC's new breakfast team, has caused quite a stir among blue-chip types. Eyebrows were raised at BBC news after she was found to have a website set up by a celebrity stalker. And it gets worse. Sophie's name mysteriously yields a link to a US adult site called Celeb Secrets: \"The web storehouse for nude celebrities\". Meanwhile, as the battle of the breakfast bulletins shapes up, it's nice to know GMTV isn't reacting by running upmarket. Monkey understands that a well-known ballerina, whose agent approached the network offering an exclusive interview, was turned down on the grounds that \"ballet dancers are too upmarket for us. They turn off our viewers\". \u0095 Anyone remember Stefano Hatfield, the former editor-in-chief of Campaign who defected to the monthly US trade mag Ad Age International? Tall bloke, lots of hair? Well he's been working his little Gucci socks off over in New York to relaunch and rebrand the title as Ad Age Global - and what an enormous difference it has made. Introducing the new-look magazine, Hatfield asks readers to \"let us know what you think\" about the revamp by email. Unfortunately his new email address is shatfield@crain.com. Apparently the magisterial Shatfield has issued edicts to his minions that he \"doesn't want any jokes\". So no comments about the shat hitting the fan or shatting on your own doorstep. \u0095 Monkey prints without further comment an email sent last week from Tonight with Trevor McDonald editor Jeff Anderson to his production team: \"Did any of you watch Panorama last night? Apparently there was a fuel crisis a couple of weeks ago with garages running dry, food shortages in the shops and hospital operations being cancelled. Why didn't any of you tell me about this at the time? Can none of you spot a story? Thank God there's at least one programme out there doing proper current affairs. You're all fired.\" \u0095 BBC governors are to debate the News at Ten issue at their next meeting on October 19, after facing cross-party demands for a climbdown. Those with an inside track say they are likely to split down the middle, play for time, and produce a fudge. Chairman Sir Christopher Bland and Greg Dyke remain most gung ho about going to head to head with ITV, but Tony Hall, director of BBC News, is briefing key figures that the move has been pushed back from September to November 2001 - safely after an October election. Chris Smith and Number 10 also have two other lines of attack: the BBC has to consult over its changes to services, and the appointment of a BBC vice-chair to succeed Baroness (Barbara) Young has yet to be made. \u0095 The extraordinary game of musical chairs taking place in television drama is set to continue. Jo Wright, controller of drama at LWT - the woman who tempted Ross Kemp away from the BBC - is expected to leave her post by the New Year after being wooed away by a major independent producer. Her deputy, Laura Mackie, was confirmed as heading to the BBC on Friday. Granada has already lost Simon Lewis and Sue Hogg to the BBC - they're setting up in the Radio 1 building. Why is Granada so careless with drama executives? \"The continuous financial pressures get to you, unless you are a Granada lifer,\" says one escapee. \u0095 Independent producers' lobby group Pact are furious at the way some TV series are being wrongly labelled as coming from the Midlands in the end credits - to give the appearance of complying with regional quotas - when they're actually made in London. Representatives say that offenders include Bazal's Flatmates and the BBC's Star for a Night. As for Mentorn Barraclough Carey's announcement that they are pulling out of Birmingham in favour of Oxford, a source says: \"They actually left their office last March, since then it's been up for sale. What is going on is disgraceful.\" \u0095 And they're off ... Media Monkey has been inspired by plucky Team GB's medal haul down under to launch its own Olympic ranking, based on which UK media outfit has the most top executives in Sydney on sports-related jollies. The inaugural table has United News &amp; Media placed third with Malcolm Wall - though it's a marginal decision, as by the end of the week he'll be a Granada employee - with the BBC (Greg Dyke and Peter Salmon) and Channel 5 (Dawn Airey and a flying visit from David Elstein) scrapping for silver. But storming to the finish line is ... Granada Media, with its three top execs \"observing\" for England. Congratulations to Charles Allen, Steve Morrison and Jules Burns whose purchase of that stake in Channel 7 (the Australian Olympic broadcaster) has finally paid off. \u0095 Contact media monkey at monkey@mediatheguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>William Hague last night moved to fend off a renewed bid by moderate One Nation Tories to recapture the soul of their party when he signalled a dramatic plan to create publicly funded, private \"partnership schools\" as a catalyst for reviving neglected inner cities.</p> <p>Hours before the opening of his Bournemouth conference, the Conservative leader will this morning formally unveil his blueprint for setting up \"regeneration companies\" in run-down neighbourhoods as a demonstration of this week's key conference slogan, A Conservative Party for All.</p> <p>The move came after key members of his praetorian guard had been forced to slap down a provocatively timed call by Michael Heseltine for his pro-European ally, Kenneth Clarke, to be recalled to the shadow cabinet - and allowed to go on expressing his dissident views.</p> <p>Calling the exclusion of such a heavy-hitter as \"ludicrous\" Mr Heseltine said Mr Hague should \"make a real concerted effort to bring Ken Clarke back into the shadow cabinet\" and campaign as a \"classic One Nation Conservative\".</p> <p>The timing of the former deputy prime minister's call on the eve of Mr Hague's crucial pre-election party conference was calculated to cause offence, even though Mr Heseltine dressed up his remarks as a constructive contribution to the Tory campaign to win back power at Westminster.</p> <p>Mr Hague's response was unmistakable. Though his inner city spokesman, Archie Norman, had been working for months on a plan for urban regeneration to rival John Prescott's strategy, his aides flagged up this morning's press conference to divert media attention from another damaging split on Europe.</p> <p>Flanked by senior MPs, Mr Hague - whose brief poll lead over Labour has disappeared - will admit: \"Inner city renewal is not normally associated with today's Conservative party\".

      "bodyText": "William Hague last night moved to fend off a renewed bid by moderate One Nation Tories to recapture the soul of their party when he signalled a dramatic plan to create publicly funded, private \"partnership schools\" as a catalyst for reviving neglected inner cities. Hours before the opening of his Bournemouth conference, the Conservative leader will this morning formally unveil his blueprint for setting up \"regeneration companies\" in run-down neighbourhoods as a demonstration of this week's key conference slogan, A Conservative Party for All. The move came after key members of his praetorian guard had been forced to slap down a provocatively timed call by Michael Heseltine for his pro-European ally, Kenneth Clarke, to be recalled to the shadow cabinet - and allowed to go on expressing his dissident views. Calling the exclusion of such a heavy-hitter as \"ludicrous\" Mr Heseltine said Mr Hague should \"make a real concerted effort to bring Ken Clarke back into the shadow cabinet\" and campaign as a \"classic One Nation Conservative\". The timing of the former deputy prime minister's call on the eve of Mr Hague's crucial pre-election party conference was calculated to cause offence, even though Mr Heseltine dressed up his remarks as a constructive contribution to the Tory campaign to win back power at Westminster. Mr Hague's response was unmistakable. Though his inner city spokesman, Archie Norman, had been working for months on a plan for urban regeneration to rival John Prescott's strategy, his aides flagged up this morning's press conference to divert media attention from another damaging split on Europe. Flanked by senior MPs, Mr Hague - whose brief poll lead over Labour has disappeared - will admit: \"Inner city renewal is not normally associated with today's Conservative party\". Poor quality of urban life has accentuated the flight of ambitious, talented people to the suburbs for 30 years, he will say. But his remedy will be controversial. Recognising the need for an outside catalyst to stimulate change Mr Norman has persuaded his old management consultant protege - Mr Hague - to accept public/ private partnerships called \"regeneration companies\" with sweeping powers across health, education and crime, as well as the built environment. Central to their efforts to persuade upwardly mobile families to stay in inner city areas will be education and the prospect of new \"partnership schools\" set up by independent bodies, charities, churches or businesses, but financed with public money. The move took pressure off Michael Ancram, the Conservative chairman, who had been forced to argue that Mr Clarke, the former chancellor, who lost the 1997 leadership contest to Mr Hague, had excluded himself by refusing to accept the policy ruling out UK membership of the eurozone for the next parliament. \"If you are in the shadow cabinet, you accept the collective responsibility of the shadow cabinet line. Those who do not accept it cannot expect to be in the shadow cabinet.\" Mr Heseltine's intervention 24 hours before John Major makes a fresh appeal for One Nation moderation, again underlined the Tory talent for destructive infighting over Europe just as Denmark's No vote on euro-membership is forcing Tony Blair's cabinet to make a tactical retreat on the timing of its euro referendum. To compound the offence, Mr Heseltine, who is stepping down as MP for Henley at the election, suggested to his fellow Tories that they should follow the example of one of their least favourite Labour politicians, the four-time election winner, Harold Wilson. For unity's sake, he allowed seven cabinet leftwingers to campaign for a No vote in the 1975 EU referendum. The Tories arrive in Bournemouth in good heart. But the latest clutch of opinion polls suggest Labour has managed to bounce back from the fuel crisis - and Mr Hague's 8% lead - since ICM put the government ahead again by 38% to 37% and 20% for the Lib Dems.

They are the ones, out of the 2,000 members of the Dow Jones global indices, judged to be ahead on social, environmental and economic criteria.</p> <p>In the changes to the index which come into effect on Friday two British companies have leapt to the top of their sectors. They are BG Group, soon to be split in two, and Thames Water, which is being acquired by the German group RWE. On the other hand Unilever has been ousted by one of the few US winners - its rival, Procter &amp; Gamble.</p> <p>Apart from BG and Thames Water, others among the 30 British representatives include recognised environmental leaders such as Anglian Water, BAA, British Airways, BT and Sainsbury.</p> <p>The analysis by Sustainable Asset Management (SAM), an asset management firm in Switzerland, is not based on individual incidents. The researchers look at strategy and management systems across the three categories of economic, environmental and social impacts. They examine risks and opportunities, looking for firms which are well placed to avoid environmental disasters, for example, and to capitalise on community involvement.</p> <p>SAM says BG is a clear leader in all three fields. It praises the gas company's thoroughness in environmental management and cites its establishment of the BG Foundation in the social sphere.</p> <p>Thames Water is praised for its approach to employee health and safety and its communication of environmental targets and policies.</p> <p>The new league table includes 236 companies from 27 countries, worth a total of $5.5 trillion (\u00a33.8 trillion). The US contributes 51 companies, including Dell and Intel but not Microsoft. In total the Americas constitute almost 44% of the index, marginally less than Europe, with the final 12% coming from Asia. These companies are the top 10% of their respective sectors, according to SAM's research.</p> <p>The purpose of the index is to give investors a means of buying into the world's sustainable business leaders. But from the investment point of view that is of no use unless they deliver financial returns as well as good social and environmental performance. So far, that is the case.</p> <p>In its first year the index performed marginally less well than the DJ global index from which it is drawn - 59.2% growth against 60%, but that was mainly because of the weak euro. Calculated over the past five years the sustainable companies' share prices grew 241% against 174% for the global basket. All the other figures are in favour of the new index - nearly 15% return on equity (from less than 10%), higher earnings growth leading to higher price-earnings ratios but also slightly higher dividend yields.</p> <p>Not that many investors have been attracted so far, however. Only 17 licences to use the index have been taken up to date, all in Europe. In Britain the sole licensee is Bear Stearns, with a capital guarantee note based on the index.</p> <p>The \"best in class\" approach - buying the best companies in each sector - is still a fairly novel development from the ethical investment tradition of avoiding poor companies or sectors.</p> <p>In Britain last year's ethical pension legislation has accelerated interest in positive discrimination, because trustees are keen not to limit the total potential investment population. But the preference of those funds which have addressed ethical issues has been for \"engagement\" - continuing to invest according to financial criteria but pressing those companies to improve their social and environmental performance.</p> <p>Mark Mansley of Claros Consulting, who advises on socially responsible investment, said: \"I have slightly mixed feelings about it.</p> <p>\"There is no engagement and it amounts to taking an active position on sustainable development and quite a passive position on financial performance.\"</p> <p>However, with pension funds slowly coming to terms with the requirement to confront ethical issues, next year's index could see more British takers.</p>",

On the other hand Unilever has been ousted by one of the few US winners - its rival, Procter &amp; Gamble. Apart from BG and Thames Water, others among the 30 British representatives include recognised environmental leaders such as Anglian Water, BAA, British Airways, BT and Sainsbury. The analysis by Sustainable Asset Management (SAM), an asset management firm in Switzerland, is not based on individual incidents. The researchers look at strategy and management systems across the three categories of economic, environmental and social impacts. They examine risks and opportunities, looking for firms which are well placed to avoid environmental disasters, for example, and to capitalise on community involvement. SAM says BG is a clear leader in all three fields. It praises the gas company's thoroughness in environmental management and cites its establishment of the BG Foundation in the social sphere. Thames Water is praised for its approach to employee health and safety and its communication of environmental targets and policies. The new league table includes 236 companies from 27 countries, worth a total of $5.5 trillion (\u00a33.8 trillion). The US contributes 51 companies, including Dell and Intel but not Microsoft. In total the Americas constitute almost 44% of the index, marginally less than Europe, with the final 12% coming from Asia. These companies are the top 10% of their respective sectors, according to SAM's research. The purpose of the index is to give investors a means of buying into the world's sustainable business leaders. But from the investment point of view that is of no use unless they deliver financial returns as well as good social and environmental performance. So far, that is the case. In its first year the index performed marginally less well than the DJ global index from which it is drawn - 59.2% growth against 60%, but that was mainly because of the weak euro. Calculated over the past five years the sustainable companies' share prices grew 241% against 174% for the global basket. All the other figures are in favour of the new index - nearly 15% return on equity (from less than 10%), higher earnings growth leading to higher price-earnings ratios but also slightly higher dividend yields. Not that many investors have been attracted so far, however. Only 17 licences to use the index have been taken up to date, all in Europe. In Britain the sole licensee is Bear Stearns, with a capital guarantee note based on the index. The \"best in class\" approach - buying the best companies in each sector - is still a fairly novel development from the ethical investment tradition of avoiding poor companies or sectors. In Britain last year's ethical pension legislation has accelerated interest in positive discrimination, because trustees are keen not to limit the total potential investment population. But the preference of those funds which have addressed ethical issues has been for \"engagement\" - continuing to invest according to financial criteria but pressing those companies to improve their social and environmental performance. Mark Mansley of Claros Consulting, who advises on socially responsible investment, said: \"I have slightly mixed feelings about it. \"There is no engagement and it amounts to taking an active position on sustainable development and quite a passive position on financial performance.\" However, with pension funds slowly coming to terms with the requirement to confront ethical issues, next year's index could see more British takers.",

      "bodyText": "It is not only Marks &amp; Spencer's grip on the nation's underwear that it is under threat. A report published yesterday said the high street retailer looks set to be overtaken as Britain's leading seller of children's clothing. The report from market research group Verdict identifies Woolworths, Asda own-label George and Next as vying for M&amp;S's top slot. This latest survey adds to an already bleak picture for the once overwhelmingly popular store. A sales slump at M&amp;S last year left it with 7% of the British childrenswear market down from 7.9%. Woolworths, in second place, has by contrast grown its share to within 0.2% of M&amp;S -less than \u00a310m difference - in sales. The main four contenders are separated by is a mere 1.2%, illustrating how competitive the market has become. Retailers are also con cerned by the increasing sophistication of children who, the report notes, are getting \"older\" at progressively younger ages. While Woolworths has expanded its share of childrenswear by taking an increasingly tough stance on pricing, George at Asda has also been gaining at M&amp;S' expense. Five years ago it had 2.7% of the British childrenswear market. Today it has 6.3%. Moreover, M&amp;S is not the only traditionally strong retailer of childrenswear experiencing difficulties. Bhs and Mothercare have also suffered.",

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin has launched a high-risk - but potentially rewarding - diplomatic initiative to broker a peaceful handover of power from President Slobodan Milosevic to the opposition in Belgrade. In a weekend of intensive diplomacy following last week's disputed Yugoslav elections, President Vladimir Putin spoke to President Clinton, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and the Italian prime minister, Giuliano Amato, about the increasingly isolated Milosevic regime. For the first time Russia has conceded that the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, won the poll in the first round. Two senior Russian diplomats arrived in Belgrade yesterday for talks. Earlier Mr Putin offered to send the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to Belgrade to defuse the standoff. An influential Russian foreign policy official said that Moscow should mediate in Belgrade, checking all versions of election returns to assess whether a second round runoff scheduled for next Sunday was warranted. \"If it [a runoff] is not needed, it would make sense to discuss the conditions that would ensure the transfer of power,\" said Vladimir Lukin, a deputy parliament speaker and a former Russian ambassador in Washington. \"Russia has a chance to play a very big role in this process.\" That seemed to reflect the views of Mr Putin, who appears to be relishing the opportunities afforded to enhance Russian prestige by succeeding in some crisis management which would leave the west in its debt. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed that Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, and Alexander Tolkach, a foreign ministry official, were in Belgrade for talks with the Milosevic and Kostunica camps. Russian media reports suggest that the Kremlin is engaged in a high-risk strategy to edge Mr Milosevic out peacefully, but it appears that Moscow is advising Mr Kostunica not to boycott any runoff. Rumours have been rife for days that Mr Milosevic could flee to Russia, and that Mr Kostunica may go to Moscow for talks on the crisis with Mr Putin, who is due to leave for a four-day visit to India today. The key issue would be to organise when Mr Milosevic leaves power. The Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, has said the constitution allows the president to stay until next summer. This is unacceptable to the opposition, but there may be room for compromise on finding a date which allows Mr Milosevic to stay on for a shorter period or by guaranteeing his security if he resigns immediately. In Belgrade, Mr Milosevic, continues to ignore internal and international pressures to step down. According to one inside source he expects next Sunday's runoff to go ahead. Mr Kostunica, a law professor, insists he has already won and such a runoff would be an insult to the voters. He is trying to unseat Mr Milosevic by legal challenges, international pressure and by persuading Mr Milosevic's allies to desert him. His aim is to corrode Mr Milosevic's powerbase without violence. \"There must be no blood because Serbia is already bleeding,\" an opposition speaker told a rally in Belgrade on Saturday. \"We know you are tired.

Article 2 imposes on the state a positive obligation to protect the right to life. The case shows how profoundly the Human Rights Act may affect precedents laid down by the courts under common law. The common law states that doctors must act in the best interests of their patients, and the House of Lords held in the Bland case that there are circumstances in which death is in the best interests of a vegetative patient with no hope of recovery. Mr Oates, representing the two unrelated patients, is considering arguing in the two test cases that withdrawing tube feeding would breach their right to life. The three-day hearing will be presided over by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court's family division, and could go to the court of appeal and even the House of Lords, to set a precedent for the handling of future PVS cases. Ben Emmerson QC, a colleague of Cherie Booth QC in the new human rights Matrix chambers, will put the arguments for Mr Oates. The case originally concerned only the first patient, who has been in PVS for some time after an anaesthetic mishap. But the court agreed to hear the second case at the same time. That case is more sensitive because the patient, whose brain was deprived of oxygen when she had a heart attack in hospital, is not in full PVS, and she has been in her current state only since last January. Guidelines lay down that withdrawal of feeding should not usually be considered until a patient been vegetative for at least a year, to rule out any chance of recovery. But her feeding tube has become blocked and it would require an operation to put it right. Her family and doctors want to let nature take its course, but that would mean death within a few weeks. In her case, Mr Oates may argue that taking a decision now, rather than replacing the blocked tube and reassessing the situation, would breach Article 6 of the convention by depriving her of a fair hearing in determining her civil rights. Both families want their loved ones to be allowed to die, and lawyers for the families and doctors are likely to argue that Article 3 of the convention, the ban on inhuman and degrading treatment, and the right to \"moral and physical integrity\" in Article 8, justify that course of action. In the Bland case, the House of Lords gave great weight to the indignities the patient was required to undergo during his care, even though he was oblivious to them. Judges are bracing themselves for a barrage of cases arguing human rights points, both good and bad, from tomorrow. The civil rights organisation, Liberty, is planning a series of test cases, including an application by a brother and sister, Adam and Joanna Rose, conceived through artificial insemination by sperm donors, who want information about their biological fathers.

      "body": "<p>Reggie Kray said he hoped to reinvent himself \"first as a man and eventually as an author, poet and philosopher.\"</p> <p>Yet as his life slipped away yesterday, drawn out of him by an incurable bladder cancer that might have killed a less stubborn soul weeks ago, he remained nothing more than the gangster he was in the 1950s and 60s.</p> <p>Twin of Ronnie, younger brother of Charlie, the last of a family whose \"firm\" ruled east London with a merciless brutality that was feared, revered and ultimately lionised in a way none of them could have imagined back then.</p> <p>Perversely, the Krays spawned a legitimate if ghoulish film and book industry that was much more lucrative than any of the protection rackets they had run.</p> <p>In crude terms, Reggie Kray was the brains of the outfit, and Ronnie the brawn. Reggie was, nevertheless, a vicious killer. He stabbed Jack \"the Hat\" McVitie to death in a flat in Stoke Newington, north London, and was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in 1969.</p> <p>He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he serve not less than 30 years.</p> <p>Freed from Wayland prison, Norfolk, on August 26 by the home secretary, Jack Straw, on compassionate grounds because of his deteriorating health, he spent his last days in the honeymoon suite at the Beefeater Town House hotel, at Thorpe St Andrew, near Norwich, with his 41-year-old wife Roberta.</p> <p>Reggie was the only one of the three brothers to die a free man. Ronnie, jailed for life for the murder of George Cornell at the Blind Beggar pub in Mile End Road, died of a heart attack in 1995. Their elder brother, Charlie, died in April aged 73, while in Parkhurst prison for drug offences.</p> <p>Kray's friends had hoped that Reggie, who was 66, might live for six months following his release, but he rarely had the strength to get out of bed and could not walk without help.</p> <p>He refused lucrative offers to give a final interview, preferring to spend time with his wife. According to his lawyer, Mark Goldstein, he died peacefully in his sleep.</p> <p>Although details of the funeral have not been released, Mr Goldstein said it was likely to be \"a very big occasion.\"</p> <p>The actor Barbara Windsor, whose ex-husband Ronnie Knight was a friend of the Krays, was one of the first to pay tribute. \"You have to speak as you find. Charlie and Reggie came to see me after a show. They were charming and polite.\"</p> <p>Tony Lambrianou, the man who disposed of McVitie by locking his body in a car and crushing the vehicle into a 3ft sq cube, said Reggie's past should be forgotten. \"They were not evil men. Let's get this in perspective here. They done unto those what they would have done to them and this involved other villains. It's not an excuse, that's just facts. The shame was that he did not have a couple of years of proper freedom.\"</p> <p>\"Dodgy\" Dave Courtney, another former gangster, said he was grief-stricken. \"It was an outrage that he was kept in for so long. I think the authorities have done themselves no favours by keeping him in for so long. They have lost the support of decent law-abiding people throughout the country, who feel Reggie's sentence was too harsh.\"</p> <p>Leonard \"Nipper\" Read, the officer who trailed the twins and eventually brought them to court, remembers them differently. \"They were courteous and always referred to me as Mr Read during interviews. But I was never in any doubt of what they were capable of. They were killers and I was often in fear of my life.</p> <p>\"I find it odd that people think of the Krays as criminal masterminds. They were not clever. If they had been, they would never have been caught.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Reggie Kray said he hoped to reinvent himself \"first as a man and eventually as an author, poet and philosopher.\" Yet as his life slipped away yesterday, drawn out of him by an incurable bladder cancer that might have killed a less stubborn soul weeks ago, he remained nothing more than the gangster he was in the 1950s and 60s. Twin of Ronnie, younger brother of Charlie, the last of a family whose \"firm\" ruled east London with a merciless brutality that was feared, revered and ultimately lionised in a way none of them could have imagined back then. Perversely, the Krays spawned a legitimate if ghoulish film and book industry that was much more lucrative than any of the protection rackets they had run. In crude terms, Reggie Kray was the brains of the outfit, and Ronnie the brawn. Reggie was, nevertheless, a vicious killer. He stabbed Jack \"the Hat\" McVitie to death in a flat in Stoke Newington, north London, and was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in 1969. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he serve not less than 30 years. Freed from Wayland prison, Norfolk, on August 26 by the home secretary, Jack Straw, on compassionate grounds because of his deteriorating health, he spent his last days in the honeymoon suite at the Beefeater Town House hotel, at Thorpe St Andrew, near Norwich, with his 41-year-old wife Roberta. Reggie was the only one of the three brothers to die a free man. Ronnie, jailed for life for the murder of George Cornell at the Blind Beggar pub in Mile End Road, died of a heart attack in 1995. Their elder brother, Charlie, died in April aged 73, while in Parkhurst prison for drug offences. Kray's friends had hoped that Reggie, who was 66, might live for six months following his release, but he rarely had the strength to get out of bed and could not walk without help. He refused lucrative offers to give a final interview, preferring to spend time with his wife. According to his lawyer, Mark Goldstein, he died peacefully in his sleep. Although details of the funeral have not been released, Mr Goldstein said it was likely to be \"a very big occasion.\" The actor Barbara Windsor, whose ex-husband Ronnie Knight was a friend of the Krays, was one of the first to pay tribute. \"You have to speak as you find. Charlie and Reggie came to see me after a show. They were charming and polite.\" Tony Lambrianou, the man who disposed of McVitie by locking his body in a car and crushing the vehicle into a 3ft sq cube, said Reggie's past should be forgotten. \"They were not evil men. Let's get this in perspective here. They done unto those what they would have done to them and this involved other villains. It's not an excuse, that's just facts. The shame was that he did not have a couple of years of proper freedom.\" \"Dodgy\" Dave Courtney, another former gangster, said he was grief-stricken. \"It was an outrage that he was kept in for so long. I think the authorities have done themselves no favours by keeping him in for so long. They have lost the support of decent law-abiding people throughout the country, who feel Reggie's sentence was too harsh.\" Leonard \"Nipper\" Read, the officer who trailed the twins and eventually brought them to court, remembers them differently. \"They were courteous and always referred to me as Mr Read during interviews. But I was never in any doubt of what they were capable of. They were killers and I was often in fear of my life. \"I find it odd that people think of the Krays as criminal masterminds. They were not clever. If they had been, they would never have been caught.\"",

Hurel's case was essentially one of frustration. Every autumn, leaves of the wrong sort fall on Britain's railway tracks, causing trains to slip, stall and delay commuters. Even more frustrating to this Cartesian train manager is the way the crazy English grumble about said leaves while, most irrationally, rather enjoying this annual joke against themselves. </p> <p>Three years on, Railtrack has said it will massacre thousands of trees by means of \"track-mounted flail machines\", to prevent leaf falls along hundreds of miles of tracks.

The classical temple, said Laugier, was derived from trees. And this makes sense. Although columns later came to represent people in Greek civilisation, they were made initially of tree trunks. The roofs, of course, were made of timbers.

Many of the finest architectural achievements have demonstrated this balance.

Yet trees used in an architectural manner are a defining characteristic of the French landscape, just as much as they are part and parcel of Britain's annual leaves-on-the-line comedy act. </p> <p>Today, despite the number of trees axed in the quest to build more trash housing, junk offices and shopping complexes, architects have tended to become more, not less, sensitive to trees - not just to their plight but to their architectural and symbolic value. In Hungary, Imre Makovecz has made extensive use of trees in his highly animated timber buildings; he refers to these as \"building beings\".

The Ford Foundation in New York, designed by Kevin Roche (born 1922) and John Dinkeloo (1918-81), featured the first truly influential office atrium, a 12-storey jungle of trees that brought green life and delight into the otherwise rational, mechanistic heart of this fine office building. It dates from 1967 and its influence has been incalculable.

The act incorporates into UK law the European Convention on Human Rights, which could be invoked up to now only by exhausting the appeals process in the UK and then starting again at the human rights court in Strasbourg. Public authorities and those exercising public functions - including government departments, local councils, schools, hospitals, prisons, police, crown prosecution service and the courts - will be obliged to respect all rights laid down by the European convention. The new law will give greater power to the judges, who will not be able to strike down statutes passed by the UK parliament, but will have to interpret them so as to be compatible with the convention. If this is impossible, a judge may declare a law incompatible with the convention. Parliament will have new fast-track procedure by which such laws can be amended. The European Convention on Human Rights: \u0095 Right to Life 1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court after his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law. 2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary: (a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence; (b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection. \u0095 Prohibition of torture No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. \u0095 Right to a fair trial 1. In the determination of his civil rights or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has these minimum rights: (a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; (b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; (c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; (d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him \u0095 Right to respect for private and family life 1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. \u0095 Freedom of thought, conscience and religion 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance. 2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights of others. \u0095Freedom of expression 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. \u0095 Freedom of assembly and association 1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests. 2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary ... in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime ... or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. \u0095 Right to marry Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right. \u0095 Prohibition of discrimination The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.",

      "bodyText": "A novel weapon in the global war against heroin, a fungus that destroys opium poppies, might lead to an ecological disaster, scientists fear. Britain and the United States are funding researchers in Uzbekistan to work on the biological weapon, which they claim could lay waste to millions of opium poppies in central Asia. But a BBC Panorama investigation tonight will allege that the safety of the project, set up in 1998 under the United Nations drug control programme and overseen by a British scientist, is causing concern. Confidential documents from the UN, seen by Panorama, show the organisation has anxieties about the safety of the project. The documents highlight the possibility that once the fungus is spread on poppy fields, such as those of neighbouring Afghanistan, the source of 90% of Britain's illegal heroin, it might be difficult to contain. There is also concern that the fungus may mutate, or be used on food crops in offensive biological warfare. In field trials the virulent strain of Pleospora papaveracea, described as \"aggressive, infectious, self-propagating and deadly\", caused opium poppies to wilt and die while apparently leaving neighbouring crops unharmed. At the institute of plant genetics in Tashkent, Panorama discovered that some of the fungus had been prepared with talc and silica gel to make it capable of being sprayed from a plane. The Uzbek scientists at the institute, a former germ warfare plant, estimated the fungus would be ready for regular use within three years. Abdukarimov Abdusattar, the molecular biologist in charge of the institute, admitted there was a possibility of dangerous mutation of the fungus. He also revealed that he planned to use X-rays to encourage mutations in an attempt to produce even more virulent forms - a form of genetic engineering with unpredictable results. The programme suggests that, by opening a Pandora's box of genetic modifications such as this, the project would \"touch the edge of biological warfare\". Environmentalists warned of the risk of an ecological catastrophe if Pleospora were used. A British plant pathologist , Paul Rogers,said: \"The fungus sounds like a silver bullet, but it could easily become a poisoned chalice. \"Once you develop a technology to spread plant diseases intentionally you are developing a technology which could easily be misused by bad people against legitimate food crops.\" He added: \"If things drift into the private sector, then who are the paymasters? You are simply opening things out for a wider spread of this kind of technology.\" Professor Rogers also pointed out that there would be a further risk if the fungus were used to wipe out illicit drug harvests: \"Drug cartels could themselves acquire the technology and in revenge attacks use a form of agricultural terrorism against Britain or the US.\" He urged caution: \"I think that Britain should be extremely careful about a project like this. While it appears to offer a great prospect, the dangers are very considerable.

      "body": "<p>Peter Stringfellow is quietly plotting William Hague's path to glory. The man best known for his nightclubs, his celebrity friends, his 2,000 sexual conquests and his hair, has turned his attention to the Tory party.</p> <p>It's early afternoon. He's lounging in his Covent Garden love nest wearing nothing but a silk dressing gown and his best strategic thinking hat. Stringfellow not only gives money to the Conservatives, he sees himself as an informal adviser to Hague.</p> <p>It's such a shame that William is still misunderstood, Stringfellow says. \"There's a twinkle in his eye that somehow doesn't come over in photos. You have to be with him to see it. And Ffion is a beautiful girl. I said to him, 'You shouldn't be frightened, you're a young, good-looking, sexy couple. Come out and be it.\"</p> <p>So why does he seem so unsexy? \"I can't quite put my finger on it,\" Stringfellow says pensively. Lord Cecil, his white cat, jumps on to his shoulders and lashes his tail against Stringfellow's temple, giving him an even more peculiar haircut. \"I think he just has to lighten up a bit. My girlfriend puts it like this: 'When you listen to William you feel like you're being lectured. When you're listening to Tony - she's been in Tony's company, too - it's as if it's coming from the heart.' I said, 'Darling, he's in opposition, he's got to ram home the message.'\"</p> <p>Officially, Stringfellow still lives the bachelor life - just him, his mirrors and the three cats. But in fact Lucy, his 24-year-old girlfriend, is as good as a cohabitee. They have been going out for 18 months and are talking of settling in a house outside London with chickens and goats. There is a framed picture of her on a shelf - topless, of course - and he's ever so proud of her. \"She's very smart, very together. She's got her own website.\" He hopes to launch her as a singer-songwriter.</p> <p>He puts her demo on the CD player, and suddenly he's jiggling around, hand on hips, head rocking from side to side, playing air guitar. It's a nice little Abba-ish tune. Peter Stringfellow is 60 next week.</p> <p>\"I know this sounds like the patronising boyfriend, but I couldn't do that. She's bloody great. She's formed a group called COA. Go on, ask me. What does it stand for? Cabaret of Angels.\" Cabaret of Angels is the nightly revue at Stringfellows - 100 topless dancers performing tableside for gentlemen. \"They are not strippers, neither are they lap dancers. The girls are entertainers, dancers, end of story.\"</p> <p>Stringfellow says 60 is a suitable age to take life more seriously, share his wisdom, help William become prime minister. \"I have all the toys, man. It's all here. I have a club full of beautiful girls, eat and drink what the hell I want, go where the hell I want, when the hell I want. If there's a party I just ring up and say I'll accept. At the Conservative ball two days ago, it was brilliant, chatting to William. Ffion and Lucy get on like a house on fire. It's a wonderful life I've got.\"</p> <p>The new, grown-up Stringfellow says he's not even cheating on Lucy. \"What would be the point? It would be over for us if I was. I'm much more comfortable in myself. I've done all that kiddy stuff, running around, chasing other girls. Apart from that, man ... it's exhausting.\" He stops himself, wary of false promises. He worries about settling down - not just for himself, for Lucy too. When he was 24, he was home in Sheffield, a baby. True, he'd joined and quit the Merchant navy, worked in the steelworks and in a bakery, had been jailed for six weeks after a bread scam, and had just opened his first club, but he'd not really started living. He wouldn't change anything. He says his former wives are good friends, their new blokes are good friends, his former girls are good friends, so where's the trail of devastation?</p> <p>Jail transformed him. For starters, he couldn't get a job when he came out because of the shame. So he had to become self-employed. Before prison, he says, he was a loser. \"The magistrate looked at me and saw straight through to my soul and he said, 'You need a lesson', and was he right. I was very glib - in fact that was the word he used. I was pretending to cry in court. Superglib.\" How did it change him? \"I've never done anything criminal since. Frightened to death of prison and police.\"</p> <p>He insists that the real Peter Stringfellow is nothing like as crazy as you'd expect. \"Well, if you think I own an outrageously successful nightclub. Not only that, I've single-handedly brought the topless industry into the mainstream, so you think what my image should be...\" He doesn't touch drugs, won't touch girls who smoke.</p> <p>\"Ah, this is Lucy,\" he says as she walks in. \"Don't look at me, I've got no makeup on,\" she says in her Mrs Merton voice. She looks lovely without makeup. I ask Lucy whether she thinks he's different from his image. \"Uh, yeh. I've got to be careful here.\" She giggles. He giggles, too, before answering for her. \"I explain to Lucy it goes like this. It's no good trying to change the image out there. And it's unnecessary. It's fun. A fun image.\"</p> <p>So the 2,000 women are an exaggeration? \"Well, no, because I've been around a long time, man. Just by the sheer weight of years you're going to have a bunch of girls in your background.\" I tell him I know loads of 60-year-olds who haven't had sex with 2,000 women. Actually, he says, this story came out after a boys' night out with two rock stars. Does he keep a list? He looks offended. \"No, not me. For me, it's a laugh. I like the idea that I've forgotten the majority of girls I've been with and hopefully they've forgotten me.\"</p> <p>\"Ooooooh! I don't know,\" says Lucy. \"I think they'd remember that.\"</p> <p>What does she see in him? \"He's kind and generous and loving. And he makes me laugh,\" Lucy says before leaving. \"Right, give me a kiss,\" he says. \"Bye bye, sweetheart. She's very sweet. No hard edge to her at all.\"</p> <p>Has he got a hard edge? \"Oh yes. Let me put it this way. Let's say I'm 60. My girlfriend's 24. Shit, man! I know it all. But I have to keep my mouth shut sometimes to listen to Lucy's opinion of something. Otherwise it's constantly this Svengali thing.\"</p> <p>What is it about him and young girls? One girlfriend was 16 and had just come down from Newcastle. \"She wasn't 16,\" he says. \"She was 16, but she wasn't your average 16-year-old.\" He says he protected her, got on fabulously with her parents, George and Phyllis.</p> <p>A BBC crew is waiting in the club to talk to Stringfellow about his days as a northern soul disc jockey. He slips on a leopardskin shirt and a pair of silk trousers over his tiny naked bottom (he never wears underpants) wafts his hands through his mane, and we're off. We walk past the office where the walls are pasted in celebrity. A wall is dedicated to handshakes with royalty. The Queen looks very pleased to meet him.</p> <p>In the club, you are greeted by a warning against punters touching the girls as they dance. Do any celebrities misbehave? \"When Robbie Williams comes in he stands up and takes his shirt off. We say, 'Sit down, put your shirt back on, Robbie.' He chats up every girl that comes anywhere near him. But the girls say 'Ah! It's Robbie, you know.\" Is there a no-touching rule for Robbie? \"Oh yeh, and he was reminded of it just recently. He doesn't mind. Robbie's wonderful.\"</p> <p>A dancer walks up to Stringfellow and hugs him. \"You're not walking round like that, are you?\" he says. \"Too sexy. Too sexy. Is that not just too sexy? \"</p> <p>He says it would be unnatural for him not to go out with young girls - after all, he's surrounded by them. Is that the only reason? He answers elaborately. \"I take enough baggage to a relationship without going with a lady who's got her own baggage. Anyone in their 30s or 40s is carrying baggage. It's hard enough to have a relationship with me, with my experience, without me having a relationship with someone who's got a great deal of her own experience, and I am not talking sexual.\" He could never see himself with a woman in her 50s. \"It would be cruel.\" He explains by way of a story about a man who brought his wife into the club and told her he loved coming here because one \"drop-dead gorgeous girl\" reminded him of her younger self. Stringfellow says it's the crassest thing he's ever heard. It seems rather sad to me.</p> <p>He's worth around \u00a315m. Money earned by honest Tory graft. By looking after himself, he says, he can look after the 100 plus people who work for him.</p> <p>In his world, he says, there is no space for misery. We're back in the flat. He takes me on a quick tour of the luxury Jacuzzi. When he meets girls, his famous chat-up line is \"Why don't you come and have a Jacuzzi, baby?\" He stops. \"Lucy hates me throwing that around. It's just a bit of a laugh, really.\"</p> <p>Surely he doesn't still have sex every day? He's flabbergasted. \"Of course. I mean ... it's ... of course, of course I do. It's not the hardest thing in the world to do with a drop-dead beautiful 24-year-old.\"</p> <p>Does he think he's sleazy? \"No, not in the slightest. You see, there's a lot of honesty in my life and I know a lot of people are dishonest. Certainly with sex. They're frightened of exposing their feelings.\"</p> <p>He thinks again about what it is that girls like about him. \"I'm not vulgar, I'm not frightening, I'm comfortable to be with, I'm attentive, I have a reasonable amount of sexiness that would make it acceptable for a girl ... I think as a date I'm brilliant.\" He lies back and stares at his reflection on the mirror over the bed. After a dab of plastic surgery his face is in good nick, but his legs are skinny and slightly puffy at the ankles. \"You learn a lot from the mirror,\" he says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Stringfellow is quietly plotting William Hague's path to glory. The man best known for his nightclubs, his celebrity friends, his 2,000 sexual conquests and his hair, has turned his attention to the Tory party. It's early afternoon. He's lounging in his Covent Garden love nest wearing nothing but a silk dressing gown and his best strategic thinking hat. Stringfellow not only gives money to the Conservatives, he sees himself as an informal adviser to Hague. It's such a shame that William is still misunderstood, Stringfellow says. \"There's a twinkle in his eye that somehow doesn't come over in photos. You have to be with him to see it. And Ffion is a beautiful girl. I said to him, 'You shouldn't be frightened, you're a young, good-looking, sexy couple. Come out and be it.\" So why does he seem so unsexy? \"I can't quite put my finger on it,\" Stringfellow says pensively. Lord Cecil, his white cat, jumps on to his shoulders and lashes his tail against Stringfellow's temple, giving him an even more peculiar haircut. \"I think he just has to lighten up a bit. My girlfriend puts it like this: 'When you listen to William you feel like you're being lectured. When you're listening to Tony - she's been in Tony's company, too - it's as if it's coming from the heart.' I said, 'Darling, he's in opposition, he's got to ram home the message.'\" Officially, Stringfellow still lives the bachelor life - just him, his mirrors and the three cats.

As he stands in the dock at Bow Street magistrates court, two miles away at the House of Lords five law lords will be listening to the opening arguments in the first libel appeal to be heard in the brave new legal world we inhabit from today, thanks to the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>The act incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. It guarantees protection, enforceable for the first time in our courts, for a wide range of fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of expression, guaranteed by article 10 of the convention.</p> <p>The right of citizens to know what their elected representatives and other public figures are up to is an essential bulwark of democracy. As Lord Nicholls, the law lord, put it: \"The press discharges vital functions as a bloodhound as well as a watchdog.\"</p> <p>But how strong is the right of free speech if the watchdog is muzzled by oppressive libel laws? Archer may be acquitted of lying and asking a friend to tell lies in the libel action against the Daily Star over suggestions that he had sex with a prostitute, Monica Coghlan. His innocence or guilt will be for a jury to decide. What is not in doubt is that our libel laws up to now have been stacked against the media. They make it hard for the press to defend itself and easy for bullies, such as the disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, to stifle legitimate investigations into their affairs.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act will change that balance. \"The goalposts have been moved,\" says Eric Barendt, Goodman professor of media law at University College London. \"Newspapers should find it easier to resist libel actions because they're asserting their own freedom of expression rights. The courts will be much more concerned with the overall character of the article rather than the meaning of individual allegations.\"</p> <p>In most civil cases, the onus is on the person suing to prove the claim. In libel, the onus is on the defendant, the person who published the story, to prove it true (or that it was fair comment or privileged.) But the material required for that proof usually lies largely in the other side's hands. When Jonathan Aitken sued the Guardian, it was partly by chance that the paper got the information to show he was lying. For the former Tory minister, the outcome could easily have been a fat tax-free cheque instead of prison. For the Guardian, it could have been a \u00a32m bill.</p> <p>From today, judges will have to take account of judgments by the European court of human rights in Strasbourg in deciding cases which come before them - though they will not be obliged to follow Strasbourg case law slavishly. Cases decided in the past few years show that that the Strasbourg judges are much more media-friendly than our own. They give more leeway to the press in public interest cases, are more willing to categorise allegations as comment rather than fact, and don't insist that every allegation must be proved. Of 15 or so libel cases which have gone to Strasbourg, the court has ruled in all but two that operation of libel laws in national courts, including those of the UK, violated the right of free speech.</p> <p>In a 1992 case brought by an Icelandic journalist convicted of criminal libel over an article alleging police brutality, the court held that the conviction was a breach of article 10. The judges said the articles dealt with a matter of public concern, the language was not excessive, and the purpose of the criticism was to prompt the minister into setting up an inquiry. One incident of brutality was undisputed and the others were based on widespread rumours and stories. It was unreasonable to require the journalist to prove that those allegations were true.</p> <p>In 1998 the court ruled that Belgium breached article 10 when a court ordered a journalist and an editor to pay damages to judges they had accused of bias and ideological prejudice in awarding a father custody of his children. The allegations were an expression of opinion and there was some factual basis to them, the Strasbourg judges said.</p> <p>Officials of the Norwegian and Bergen police associations accused a professor of criminal law of wrongly making allegations of police brutality. He brought a successful defamation action, but the Strasbourg court held in 1998 that this violated the associations' right of free speech. The judges said allegations imputing improper motives to the professor were value judgments rather than fact. They had some factual support and were part of a lively public controversy, and so were protected by article 10.</p> <p>More recent cases include one in which the court held that journalists were entitled to rely on the contents of a report from an official body and did not have to investigate allegations independently. In the latest case, last May, the court ordered Norway to pay compensation equal to damages won by a cosmetic surgeon from a newspaper in Bergen which accused him of disfiguring women patients. The court said the paper had been raising matters of public concern, had accurately reported the women's complaints, and had given the surgeon an opportunity to defend himself. The Norwegian supreme court's judgment against the paper was a disproportionate restriction on press freedom and the state had to reimburse the paper for the damages it paid out.</p> <p>In the run up to the Human Rights Act, the impact of article 10 is already being felt in our libel courts. In a case brought against the Sunday Times by Albert Reynolds, the former Irish prime minister, the law lords ruled a year ago that newspapers may invoke a special \"qualified privilege\" defence when they report information the public has a right to know, even with factual inaccuracies.</p> <p>The protection will not apply if the paper knew the story was false or made no real efforts to check if it was true. It will be up to the judge to decide whether the defence succeeds, depending on factors such as the seriousness of the allegation and the public interest in the subject matter, the reliability of the sources, the steps taken to verify the information, and whether the subject of the story was given an opportunity to reply.</p> <p>Following that judgment, a high court judge ruled this year that the Yorkshire Post could invoke the defence over an article criticising the selling of an Australian karate system door-to-door even though the journalist had not given the company a proper chance to reply, had not mentioned that there were no complaints to trading standards officers, had failed to mention that the company was not breaking the law, and had misquoted a source. The public interest in the subject was great enough to outweigh the criticisms of the reporter, the judge held. But in a case brought against Mirror Group Newspapers, a different judge ruled that the paper could not rely on the defence because it had failed to make basic inquiries and had relied on a not wholly reliable source.</p> <p>In the case which goes to the Lords tomorrow, the Times is appealing against a libel win by the Northern Ireland law firm which acted for paratrooper Lee Clegg when he was charged with murdering a teenage joyrider. A reporter covered a press conference organised by the group campaigning for Clegg's release and reported comments by one of his supporters about the law firm.</p> <p>Reports of open meetings are protected by qualified privilege, so newspapers are liable only if they reported the words knowing they were untrue or not caring whether they were true or not. But the Northern Ireland courts held that a press conference was not a public meeting. Lord Lester QC, for Times Newspapers, will argue that to hold a paper liable in such circumstances violates the right of free speech guaranteed by the European convention.</p> <p>The big question is how free a rein UK judges will give the media in acting as the public's watchdog. Michael Skrein, head of media litigation at the City law firm Richards Butler, says: \"We should be entering a very different world. But there is a question as to whether we will be, and whether our judges will allow it.\"</p>",

But the material required for that proof usually lies largely in the other side's hands. When Jonathan Aitken sued the Guardian, it was partly by chance that the paper got the information to show he was lying. For the former Tory minister, the outcome could easily have been a fat tax-free cheque instead of prison. For the Guardian, it could have been a \u00a32m bill. From today, judges will have to take account of judgments by the European court of human rights in Strasbourg in deciding cases which come before them - though they will not be obliged to follow Strasbourg case law slavishly. Cases decided in the past few years show that that the Strasbourg judges are much more media-friendly than our own. They give more leeway to the press in public interest cases, are more willing to categorise allegations as comment rather than fact, and don't insist that every allegation must be proved. Of 15 or so libel cases which have gone to Strasbourg, the court has ruled in all but two that operation of libel laws in national courts, including those of the UK, violated the right of free speech. In a 1992 case brought by an Icelandic journalist convicted of criminal libel over an article alleging police brutality, the court held that the conviction was a breach of article 10. The judges said the articles dealt with a matter of public concern, the language was not excessive, and the purpose of the criticism was to prompt the minister into setting up an inquiry. One incident of brutality was undisputed and the others were based on widespread rumours and stories. It was unreasonable to require the journalist to prove that those allegations were true. In 1998 the court ruled that Belgium breached article 10 when a court ordered a journalist and an editor to pay damages to judges they had accused of bias and ideological prejudice in awarding a father custody of his children. The allegations were an expression of opinion and there was some factual basis to them, the Strasbourg judges said. Officials of the Norwegian and Bergen police associations accused a professor of criminal law of wrongly making allegations of police brutality. He brought a successful defamation action, but the Strasbourg court held in 1998 that this violated the associations' right of free speech. The judges said allegations imputing improper motives to the professor were value judgments rather than fact. They had some factual support and were part of a lively public controversy, and so were protected by article 10. More recent cases include one in which the court held that journalists were entitled to rely on the contents of a report from an official body and did not have to investigate allegations independently. In the latest case, last May, the court ordered Norway to pay compensation equal to damages won by a cosmetic surgeon from a newspaper in Bergen which accused him of disfiguring women patients. The court said the paper had been raising matters of public concern, had accurately reported the women's complaints, and had given the surgeon an opportunity to defend himself. The Norwegian supreme court's judgment against the paper was a disproportionate restriction on press freedom and the state had to reimburse the paper for the damages it paid out. In the run up to the Human Rights Act, the impact of article 10 is already being felt in our libel courts. In a case brought against the Sunday Times by Albert Reynolds, the former Irish prime minister, the law lords ruled a year ago that newspapers may invoke a special \"qualified privilege\" defence when they report information the public has a right to know, even with factual inaccuracies. The protection will not apply if the paper knew the story was false or made no real efforts to check if it was true. It will be up to the judge to decide whether the defence succeeds, depending on factors such as the seriousness of the allegation and the public interest in the subject matter, the reliability of the sources, the steps taken to verify the information, and whether the subject of the story was given an opportunity to reply. Following that judgment, a high court judge ruled this year that the Yorkshire Post could invoke the defence over an article criticising the selling of an Australian karate system door-to-door even though the journalist had not given the company a proper chance to reply, had not mentioned that there were no complaints to trading standards officers, had failed to mention that the company was not breaking the law, and had misquoted a source. The public interest in the subject was great enough to outweigh the criticisms of the reporter, the judge held. But in a case brought against Mirror Group Newspapers, a different judge ruled that the paper could not rely on the defence because it had failed to make basic inquiries and had relied on a not wholly reliable source. In the case which goes to the Lords tomorrow, the Times is appealing against a libel win by the Northern Ireland law firm which acted for paratrooper Lee Clegg when he was charged with murdering a teenage joyrider. A reporter covered a press conference organised by the group campaigning for Clegg's release and reported comments by one of his supporters about the law firm. Reports of open meetings are protected by qualified privilege, so newspapers are liable only if they reported the words knowing they were untrue or not caring whether they were true or not. But the Northern Ireland courts held that a press conference was not a public meeting. Lord Lester QC, for Times Newspapers, will argue that to hold a paper liable in such circumstances violates the right of free speech guaranteed by the European convention. The big question is how free a rein UK judges will give the media in acting as the public's watchdog. Michael Skrein, head of media litigation at the City law firm Richards Butler, says: \"We should be entering a very different world. But there is a question as to whether we will be, and whether our judges will allow it.\"",

Beijing's assumption that the issue of Tibet would resolve itself after the Dalai Lama's death was \"fatally flawed\", he added. The World Bank was forced recently to scrap a contentious $160m (\u00a3109m) loan to China which would have been used to resettle some 58,000 Chinese farmers in Qinghai province. Pro-Tibet campaigners argued that the loan would have had a devastating impact on the region's remaining 6m Tibetans, and the prospects for the survival of their ancient culture and Buddhist religion.",

From this mysterious maelstrom Simon Schama also emerged, torch in hand, like a pensive plumber not overly impressed by the state of your drains. Like Poseidon in an anorak and spectacles, his aim was to tell of how Britain came to be, how the green, and sometimes not-so-pleasant, land fared after the blue waters revealed its shores for the first time. </p> <p>Britain, he kicked off, was once a great object of desire, \"worth the conquest\" as the Romans would note. And what with the indoor toilets, large hearths and dressers - the precious things found at a Stone Age settlement at Skara Brae in the Orkneys - the Romans were probably right (though they must have been disappointed when the piles of pearls they imagined lying around failed to materialise). The toilets proved that while other peoples were living in caves, Britons were already building little houses where they even kept pet dogs. Had there been interaction with the Swedes in 3000BC, I dare say they would have furnished them with some proto-Ikea furniture - the Og axe and bone cabinet and the Ug ceremonial sacrifice table. </p> <p>As it happened, the interaction with Scandinavia didn't come until much later, but Schama eventually reached the appearance of the Vikings after a gallop through the Iron Age, Roman Britain and Saxon times. The Romans, it transpired, wrote letters home asking for beer and sent their loved ones gifts of underwear and socks. Once the Venerable Bede - a logocentric bureaucrat - appeared and codified history, the modern English character was only a throw of a bowler hat away. And they say stereotypes don't exist for a reason. </p> <p>While Schama's saga started in the Orkneys, Scotland didn't get much of a look-in as he made his way from Hadrian's Wall to East Anglia. Hopefully, that will be rectified in later programmes (there are another 15 to come); otherwise a call to the Trade Descriptions people wouldn't go amiss. Assuming Schama will turn his attention to Pictland soon, The History of Britain will be a landmark series in more ways than one. </p> <p> <strong> Blackadder Back and Forth</strong> (Sky One, Sunday) took a slightly different approach to history. The TV premiere of the final Blackadder, and one they said would only ever be shown in the Millennium Dome (well, they said a lot about the Dome that didn't actually happen, didn't they?), it was the kind of romp-with-a-message one would associate with a film made for a theme park. The message - \"Human beings are always the same. There's always a Blackadder, always a Baldrick\" - was hammered home with visits to prehistoric times, Roman times, medieval times (where they persuaded Robin Hood's merry men to turn on him) and Elizabethan times (where the pair made suitable mischief). An amusing diversion, it must have seemed Oscar-winning stuff if you'd wandered round the Dome before seeing it. And it was marvellous to see a member of Labour's NEC dressed in a PVC apron with inflatable breasts. Other than Peter Mandelson, I mean. </p> <p>And speaking of suspect characters, <strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC1, Sunday) went a bit over the top with the return of Nick Cotton. I once saw John Altman, who plays Nick, hosting a Miss UK competition in Blackpool (in which, in a doubly soapy moment, Katrina from Brookside was competing as Miss Liverpool). It was sponsored by a car security firm and the hall was half empty, so the original Nasty Nick - apart from Satan, obviously - doesn't scare me as much as he should. Maybe for this reason, his reappearance seemed a tad lazy on the part of EastEnders, as if they can't be bothered creating another baddie from scratch. Add to that a dream sequence slightly less dodgy than Kaffy's vision in which Fat Pat was her prison officer, plus some truly atrocious acting and writing, and this \"special\" must have actually added audience to ITV's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Without the occasional good line - \"Forget the pyramids, the only wonder of the world is London\" - and the unspoken threat embodied by that sword earring of his, Nick's resurrection wouldn't even have been mildly distracting. If and when he returns to the Square, you can only hope for some genuinely explosive storylines and not just the recycling of old. Don't hold your breath though.</p>",

The wonderful thing about making love is that you let things happen.\" </p> <p>Leiser and directorial partner Patrice Caurier are currently making things happen in Welsh National Opera's new production of Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice, which opens in Cardiff tonight. They will also be directing Rossini's La Cenerentola at Covent Garden over Christmas. </p> <p>Leiser, a Belgian, and Caurier, who is French, have worked together for the past 18 years, in the sort of producer partnership that is rare in opera. They have struck up a close relationship with Welsh National Opera, producing both Fidelio and an award-winningly claustrophobic Carmen in 1997. Their approach is similar to that underpinning WNO: long rehearsal periods, a commitment to ensemble acting, and a suspicion of megastars who fly in just before a performance and unpack their role along with their toothbrush. </p> <p>Leiser, who is dark, feisty and highly articulate, says that he could never work in those conditions, no matter how great the star. \"There are a lot of producers whose province is to make images, and that's their only concern. In that case the star can come, he will probably know his job and it will work. The problem is that it's like having a painting that has nothing but one wonderful colour in it. That's not a good painting.\" </p> <p>Since WNO could not afford the star's fee anyway, the question does not arise. In effect, the company makes a virtue of necessity and gets fine singers who may not be household names to give strong performances in an integrated show. </p> <p>\"We believe in opera as music theatre,\" says WNO's general manager, Anthony Freud. \"That is only possible on the basis of an intensive preparation period. The people who work with us do so because they want to take part in a preparation period of that length and quality.\" Each production is rehearsed for six weeks, is premiered in Cardiff and then goes on the road for two months or more - to Oxford, Southampton, Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham and the other towns that WNO has an obligation to serve under the terms of its Arts Council funding. </p> <p>In recent years that intensity has paid off, with critical plaudits, numerous awards - including an Olivier for Richard Jones's production of Hansel and Gretel - and rave reviews for Jones's recent The Queen of Spades. The latter, along with Orpheus and Eurydice and Carmen, makes up the autumn programme: large-scale Tchaikovsky, small-scale Gluck and a popular revival. That balance, says Freud, is all-important in terms of both production costs and box office: Carmen is a sure-fire winner, whereas Gluck may not be. </p> <p>\"Orpheus is high-risk compared with, say, a revival of Madam Butterfly,\" says Freud, \"but we lose vitality and validity if we are forced to retrench artistically into a corner from which we can only mount an unvarying diet of the most popular operas. It was important for us to mount a production of Orpheus and Eurydice for the first time in our history.\" </p> <p>Freud says, without making a song and dance of it, that WNO is less well funded than the London houses and that funding in real terms has been eroded over the past few years. But he is full of praise for the original Arts Council plan, dating back to the 1970s, that gave regional opera companies catchment areas to provide with quality work. WNO has a potential audience of 12m across Wales and a large swathe of England, and though the company is proud of its Welsh base, its touring function and its appeal in England are critical too. \"Touring is the reason for our existence,\" says Freud, \"and when we take Orpheus on the road the vast majority of people will be seeing it for the first time.\" </p> <p>Orpheus and Eurydice is being conducted by the early music specialist Paul McCreesh, who will be making his debut in a fully staged opera. I attended a rehearsal in Cardiff and was intrigued by the way Caurier and Leiser, both of whom read music, gather the singers round the piano and let the expression of feelings evolve from a close reading of the score. Weren't they, by offering suggestions on how passages should be sung, trespassing on the conductor's territory? </p> <p>\"I'm a relative novice to staged opera production,\" says McCreesh, \"but I know enough to know that their approach is unusual. To find producers who can read music is relatively rare. It's a joy, and I'm not saying that to be sycophantic. It means that if you have a dispute it comes from a state of interpretation and knowledge, rather than the producer saying, 'I have this conception.'\" </p> <p>\"The work we do around the piano is to find an interpretation that reflects what is happening to the characters,\" says Leiser. \"At the beginning we know more or less what world we want to travel in, but the paths and the turns we take will be discovered along with the conductor and the singers. We don't have closed ideas. As you work on a piece, you feel when you are inside the music. As much as we produce the piece, the piece produces itself.\" </p> <p>As Caurier and Leiser listen to the singers, they seem to share their suffering. Caurier has an odd habit of plucking his stomach as if he is in pain, while Leiser leaps into Eurydice's arms to show Orpheus precisely how to cradle her. Their working relationship must by now be second nature and they seem to communicate by occasional interjections and facial expressions rather than exact directions. What is most marked is the precision with which they approach the music: the score is being taken apart note by note and the characters' motives interrogated. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't say that somebody who cannot read the score is not a good director,\" says Leiser. \"There are plenty of directors who cannot read a score. But when we are working we find that 80% of the staging is musical interpretation. It must be organic. Opera only exists when music and theatre are in sympathy.\" </p> <p>\"An artistic experience is an exchange,\" adds Caurier. \"If an exchange doesn't exist...\" He doesn't complete the sentence, stalled either by his English, which is less fluent than Leiser's, or by the vision of dictatorial divas and uncooperative conductors. WNO, happily, is far too down to earth to accommodate either of those preening species, which is probably why its recent record speaks, or rather sings, for itself. </p> <p> \u0095 Orpheus and Eurydice is in rep at the New Theatre, Cardiff (029-2087 8889), till October 11, then tours.</p>",

Would you agree, even if someone offered you a million pounds and a date with Jude Law, to come back in a future life as Louise Adams, the younger, less fabulous sister of Posh Spice? Possibly not. Adams appears to be the latest casualty of Celebrity Sister, a game for two or more players that is guaranteed to leave the loser looking foolish and humiliated. A few days ago Adams attended a fashion awards ceremony with Posh, dressed in a similar outfit and identical hair extensions, a move which caused one gleeful gossip columnist to nickname her Posh Twice.</p> <p>Alas, the case for Adams as a person in her own right is not convincing. In recent months her ultra-famous sister has bought her a \u00a3480,000 house, paid for her two-year-old daughter Liberty to attend the same nursery school as Brooklyn Beckham and encouraged her to get a job as a reporter on Sky TV.</p> <p>Yet despite her sister's efforts to look after her best interests, one can't help feeling for Adams. There can be few states more ignoble than finding yourself for ever the wannabe, especially if you have been trying to live up to your role model since the day they were spitting pur\u00e9ed apple in your face from their high chair.</p> <p>One small comfort for her must be the knowledge that she is not alone. In recent weeks celebrity siblings have dominated the pages of the Hello! circuit. Karen Hurley, the utterly anonymous sister of Liz, was last week photographed attending a film premiere with her sister's ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant; Gemma Kidd took to the catwalk with her supermodel sister Jodie in aid of a breast cancer charity; the Corrs sisters become more terrifyingly identical with every album they release; and the antics of All Saints sisters Nicole and Natalie Appleton and their matching rock-star boyfriends are never more than a headline away.</p> <p>Not all celeb siblings are as gruesome. Actress Sadie Frost often waxes lyrical about her childhood as the eldest of five sisters, likening it to Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. If there's a common denominator among these high-profile sisters and the sisters we know and love in real life, then it must surely be this inexplicable desire to forge an identity and a sense of belonging through emulating our nearest and dearest.</p> <p>Personally, I am not in the habit of consciously copying the clothes, make-up and hairstyles of anyone, be they celebrities or close friends - except that is, those of my sister. She is four years younger than me, so it's not a habit that can be attributed to the old \"leader, follower\" dynamic. All I know is that in her company I have a glorious compulsion to become a copycat. The most common question during our conversations is not \"How are you?\" or \"How are Ayr United?\" but \"What other colours does it come in?\". This is perhaps a regression to the days when our mother used to dress us in matching psychedelic outfits.</p> <p>Professor Anne Woollett, a psychologist at the University of East London, has a theory about this. \"Siblings are sufficiently like one another to be impressed by each other. You'll see them wearing something and you automatically think, 'Oh, I might look good in that too,' in a way that you wouldn't with, say, your mother.\" Woollett has conducted research into family ties, and one finding was that adult sisters kept in far closer contact with one another than brothers.</p> <p>\"That might well be because men aren't as good at keeping in touch. And although there have been suggestions that male siblings are more competitive with one another, I've noticed a competitive edge among sisters too.\"</p> <p>Susan Van Scoyoc, a psychologist who runs the Women's Practice therapeutic centre in Essex, says that many of the women she sees in therapy are dealing with issues relating to sibling rivalry. \"In dysfunctional families, sisters will often be rivals for success and attention. Sisters are often pigeonholed as the pretty one or the clever one, when the chances are that each sister is striving desperately to be both of those things. The Freudian theory is that they're vying for daddy's attention, and those rivalries run deep.\"</p> <p>Culturally, sisterhood has ever been perceived as one of biology's most mesmerising tricks. When sisters fall out, or when one is seen to be eclipsed by the success of another, the world waits with bated breath to hear the tale. Hilary du Pre's account of growing up in the shadow of world class cellist Jacqueline was compelling because anyone with a sibling could to some extent imagine the extent of her pain.</p> <p>Other accounts are more crazed, but no less enthralling. In 1941, Joan Fontaine found herself being nominated for the same Oscar as her sister Olivia de Havilland, the latter being the favourite to win. When Joan was announced as the winner, a classic childhood regression kicked in. \"All the animus we'd felt towards each other as children, the hair pullings, the savage wrestling matches, the time Olivia fractured my collarbone, all came rushing back in kaleidoscopic imagery. My paralysis was total. I felt Olivia would spring across the table and grab me by the hair. I felt age four, being confronted by my older sister.\" Olivia didn't speak to her for 10 years.</p> <p>\"Children, vis-\u00e0-vis each other, have enormous power,\" explains Penelope Farmer, editor of Sisters, a new anthology published by Penguin which celebrates female siblings from Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell to Simone de Beauvoir and her doll-like sister Poupette. \"And childhood is a Kafkaesque world of arbitrary judgments and penalties, of enigmatic pronouncements and doom-filled confusion which sisters have the power to add to and invoke, and which equally they have the power to explain, to ease.\"</p> <p>Tracing the roots of sibling rivalry can be fascinating. Take the case of Margaret Drabble, who was far more famous than her sister AS Byatt until the latter won the Booker prize for Possession. Byatt even wrote a novel The Game about two sisters who were novelists and how one of them destroyed the other by writing a book about her.</p> <p>\"To pretend that sisters or brothers love each other is just rubbish,\" says Drabble. \"They are always fighting. What annoys me is the idea that Antonia and I should be lovey-dovey. Of course there was competition between us when we were children, which we've tried to grow out of. We were pitted against each other, by my mother, largely. Any sign of intelligence was praised, any interest in girly things ignored.\"</p> <p>To anyone who is blessed with a sister, this last point is the most revealing. No wonder they don't get along. The greatest pleasure in having a sister is having someone with whom you share a common history of girlhood, with whom you have a collective memory of dressing up in your mother's glittery evening slippers, making clothes for Sasha dolls and later of battling for possession of Miners eyeshadow in Disco Silver. It is hard to imagine having a sister and not sharing those bonds, for though they may sound more trivial than the rigorous intellectual games of the Byatt/Drabble childhood, they serve as a valuable compass for playing at being girls together well into adult life.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Hers was a Persian rug. His was a pair of cut-glass decanters in the shape of footballs. They were tokens of their love for each other. Yet, when it came to the divorce proceedings of this archetypal Mr and Mrs, their ownership was in dispute. It might have been her birthday, but he meant the rug for their house. She didn't intend the decanters, given on their second anniversary, to be for his use alone. Every exchange of presents between partners has a meaning beyond and below the pretty paper. There's no such thing as a gift without strings tied all around it.</p> <p>The politics of present-giving were unwrapped last week when Catherine Zeta Jones gave her beloved Michael Douglas a framed photo of his sons for his 56th birthday. \"It was very intimate,\" she said; \"Meanie Happy Returns,\" bleated one tabloid. For Jones's 31st on the same day (would he have even remembered it if it wasn't, I wonder?), Douglas gave her a \u00a360,000 sapphire and diamond necklace. Unlike the thoughtful family snap, this extravagance met with widespread approval. It showed he cared.</p> <p>Women's gifts to men, like Jones's, display thought and affection. Men often express emotion through an excess of money, knowing few other ways to show it. Former Playmate Anna Nicole Smith spent $2m of her 89-year-old Texan husband's fortune in one shopping trip to the jeweller. \"He bought me just about anything I wanted,\" Smith said, after winning \u00a3300m contesting his will. This she interpreted as taking care of her, \"and I loved him for it\". In this, as in so many other, more ordinary cases, it seems a bargain was struck.</p> <p>Not all exchanges are so calculated. I once saw John Major at the cosmetics counter of Dickens and Jones. It was just before Christmas, and he was buying some make-up for Norma, I presumed. Although he had a bodyguard with him, I felt I was witnessing an intimate moment in the former prime minister's marriage. Not many men in late middle-age venture into a department store to buy their wife's favourite face cream; few would know what it was.</p> <p>A gift can reveal your intimacy. But it can also display your ignorance. I was shocked when my boyfriend bought me a heavy Aran jumper, which I would not - and never have - worn. It made me question how much he really knew me, to buy something so obviously out of character.</p> <p>But perhaps my boyfriend knew I would never wear anything like that, and only longed for me to be a country kind of woman.

      "bodyText": "Hers was a Persian rug. His was a pair of cut-glass decanters in the shape of footballs. They were tokens of their love for each other. Yet, when it came to the divorce proceedings of this archetypal Mr and Mrs, their ownership was in dispute. It might have been her birthday, but he meant the rug for their house. She didn't intend the decanters, given on their second anniversary, to be for his use alone. Every exchange of presents between partners has a meaning beyond and below the pretty paper. There's no such thing as a gift without strings tied all around it. The politics of present-giving were unwrapped last week when Catherine Zeta Jones gave her beloved Michael Douglas a framed photo of his sons for his 56th birthday. \"It was very intimate,\" she said; \"Meanie Happy Returns,\" bleated one tabloid. For Jones's 31st on the same day (would he have even remembered it if it wasn't, I wonder?), Douglas gave her a \u00a360,000 sapphire and diamond necklace. Unlike the thoughtful family snap, this extravagance met with widespread approval. It showed he cared. Women's gifts to men, like Jones's, display thought and affection. Men often express emotion through an excess of money, knowing few other ways to show it. Former Playmate Anna Nicole Smith spent $2m of her 89-year-old Texan husband's fortune in one shopping trip to the jeweller. \"He bought me just about anything I wanted,\" Smith said, after winning \u00a3300m contesting his will. This she interpreted as taking care of her, \"and I loved him for it\". In this, as in so many other, more ordinary cases, it seems a bargain was struck. Not all exchanges are so calculated. I once saw John Major at the cosmetics counter of Dickens and Jones. It was just before Christmas, and he was buying some make-up for Norma, I presumed. Although he had a bodyguard with him, I felt I was witnessing an intimate moment in the former prime minister's marriage. Not many men in late middle-age venture into a department store to buy their wife's favourite face cream; few would know what it was. A gift can reveal your intimacy. But it can also display your ignorance. I was shocked when my boyfriend bought me a heavy Aran jumper, which I would not - and never have - worn. It made me question how much he really knew me, to buy something so obviously out of character. But perhaps my boyfriend knew I would never wear anything like that, and only longed for me to be a country kind of woman. Men buy gifts to transform their women. Sexy lingerie is only the most obvious example. More than 70% of women's razors are bought by men. It is not uncommon for husbands to give their wives facelifts for Christmas. Yet still, a present is marketed as proof that you care. \"Tell someone you love them,\" says the advertisement as a delighted woman holds up a dozen red roses delivered in the post. \"Diamonds are for ever\" is written along a woman's slender, bejewelled neck while a male finger massages her collarbone. It's true, every gift does bear a message, but not necessarily the message intended. Personally, a knock on the door from Interflora always rouses my suspicions; it's only guilty men who give flowers.

      "bodyText": "Charities could lose out on millions of pounds of funding becuase of the uncertainty over who will be awarded the next licence to run the national lottery. Camelot, which currently runs the game, said at the weekend it was likely to make another legal challenge against the national lottery commission if at the end of this month the licence is awarded to Sir Richard Branson's People's Lottery. An additional legal action is likely to delay the award of the licence even further, threatening to leave the lottery with no company in a position to run it after October next year. Dianne Thompson, Camelot's chief executive designate, wrote to the commission last week seeking assurances that it would act fairly, but a spokeswoman said none had yet been given. \"We are in an invidious position,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We don't have confidence in the process, and the statements they have made so far don't suggest they have an open mind ... \"If at the end of the month we feel they haven't been fair, then we will likely go to judicial review again. Either way there is a big prospect of legal challenge, because if we win the licence the People's Lottery would want to know: did the commission bend over backwards in order not to appear biased against us?\" The commission announced in August that neither bid could win the licence as it stood but said it would enter into exclusive talks with the People's Lottery to allay certain outstanding concerns.

Police detained several hundred members of the sect, kicking, punching and pulling them by the hair as they herded them on to buses after the protests broke out. Reuters, Beijing Flood victims fight for food Troops guarded relief supplies in flood-ravaged areas of eastern India yesterday after a mob of 2,000 hungry villagers surrounded local officials at Chandpara, near the Bangladesh border. Officials, police and soldiers quickly arranged for food to pacify the people. The worst floods in 22 years have left 758 dead and 200 missing in the state of West Bengal. Reuters, Chandpara Seven killed by Jeep gunmen Russian police were hunting two men yesterday suspected of killing seven people in two attacks. Three policemen and two bystanders were killed on Saturday when the driver and passenger of a Jeep opened fire with automatic weapons at a roadblock 190 miles north-east of Moscow, a police spokesman said. Several hours later, a policeman spotted the suspects and was killed, along with a local resident, in a gunfight. Reuters, Moscow It's a boy for Timorese leader East Timor's independence leader, Jose Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmao, and his Australian wife, Kirsty Sword, have had their first child, a son. Mr Gusmao was present at a Dili hospital for the birth of Alexandre Sword-Gusmao. He has two sons and a daughter by a previous marriage and another relationship. AP, Dili",

For example, firms trading in Asia where respect for age was important found they got on better by fielding older representatives. \u0095 Connectors. Organisations relying more on freelancers and contract workers needed team builders, mentors and connectors to create a sense of partnership between people and organisations, even in chaotic times. Older people were better at providing this organisational glue. \u0095 Strategists. Businesses needed someone to stand above the expanding sea of information to focus on longer term goals. According to venture capitalists, start-up firms were beginning to recognise the need for older people to bring their strategic vision. Charlotte Thorne, author of the report, said: \"Society and pressure groups have traditionally seen ageing as a time of loss and vulnerability ... What businesses are really after is wisdom, and that puts older workers in pole position.\" Some sectors of the economy were slow, however, to adapt to the trend. In the past 20 years the proportion of men between 50 and 65 who were not working doubled. And a third of people between 50 and the state retirement age do not work. The society said the government should take a lead by scrapping compulsory retirement at 60 for civil servants. \"Nineteenth century concepts of retirement have no place in the new economy.\" Formal retirement ages should be abandoned and rules changed for occupational pension schemes to make it easier for older people to work flexibly and take on part time work if they wish. \u0095 Margaret Hodge, the equal opportunities minister, last night announced the first 69 winners of a government competition to encourage a better balance between work and life. Organisations ranging from big business to small charities will get free consultancy to help them to introduce flexible working and improved productivity. Ms Hodge said: \"We all want to get a life, to spend time with our families, our children or our elderly parents or just to enjoy our hobbies.\"",

This summer Britain's longest-running rock festival was swamped by an estimated 100,000 illegal entrants who jumped the fence or sneaked in to join 80,000 ticket holders and 20,000 performers and staff. The deaths of nine young men who were trampled by the crowd at Roskilde festival near Copenhagen put safety at open air gigs under the microscope. Michael Eavis, who has been organising the Glastonbury festival on his farm near Pilton, Somerset, for three decades, is intent on winning the public relations battle and two weeks ago unveiled a 20ft high \"super-wall\" aimed at deterring fence-jumpers. But he faces an uphill struggle to convince the local authority, Mendip district council, which could refuse the festival a licence. A source on the council's regulatory board said: \"Of the 100,000 extra people, around 30,000 came in over the fence, the rest got in some other way - we are talking about a total breakdown of security.\" Overcrowding pushed safety levels to the margins of what was acceptable, according to Steve Anderson, the district council's head of environmental health. \"The event was not safe, as a pure function of the numbers of people on the site and the movement of those people.\" A number of fans needed to be pulled from the crowd watching headliners Travis after fainting in the crush, while movements of people to see star attractions such as Leftfield and Fat Boy Slim caused bottlenecks across the site.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Millennium Dome suffered yet another blow yesterday when attendance figures dropped to their lowest since a disastrous showing in January cost its former chief executive Jennie Page her job.</p> <p>Fewer than 15,500 people a day visited the attraction in September, the most torrid month in its history, when news of a further \u00a347m bail-out, revelations of financial chaos and a final government admission that it had \"failed to live up to expectations\" left its fortunes at an all-time low.</p> <p>The figures were nearly 50,000 down on August but the dome's irrepressible chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, who was forced to cede financial control to the City troubleshooter David James in last month's shake-up, still tried to paint the figures as a triumph.</p> <p>\"We are getting thousands of satisfied visitors through the dome every day, and the overwhelming majority enjoy a fantastic day out,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Gerbeau predicted that the fresh horrors he has planned for Halloween will pack in families over the half-term. \"There are only 91 days left in which to visit the dome and I would urge people not to miss out.\"</p> <p>Although Mr James has reduced the dome's target to 4.5m paying visitors, Mr Gerbeau still fervently believes the total figures can still reach 7m. With nearly 4.8m people having already gone through the turnstiles - with 3,847,911 of those paying - the dome is likely to attract at least 6m people before it closes on December 31, half the original target.

      "bodyText": "The Millennium Dome suffered yet another blow yesterday when attendance figures dropped to their lowest since a disastrous showing in January cost its former chief executive Jennie Page her job. Fewer than 15,500 people a day visited the attraction in September, the most torrid month in its history, when news of a further \u00a347m bail-out, revelations of financial chaos and a final government admission that it had \"failed to live up to expectations\" left its fortunes at an all-time low. The figures were nearly 50,000 down on August but the dome's irrepressible chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, who was forced to cede financial control to the City troubleshooter David James in last month's shake-up, still tried to paint the figures as a triumph. \"We are getting thousands of satisfied visitors through the dome every day, and the overwhelming majority enjoy a fantastic day out,\" he said. Mr Gerbeau predicted that the fresh horrors he has planned for Halloween will pack in families over the half-term. \"There are only 91 days left in which to visit the dome and I would urge people not to miss out.\" Although Mr James has reduced the dome's target to 4.5m paying visitors, Mr Gerbeau still fervently believes the total figures can still reach 7m. With nearly 4.8m people having already gone through the turnstiles - with 3,847,911 of those paying - the dome is likely to attract at least 6m people before it closes on December 31, half the original target. A big promotion push launched this week by Mr Gerbeau, aimed at drawing in repeat visitors with cut-price offers, could nudge that figure up, however. He believes that, as a BBC poll showed that nearly eight out of 10 visitors enjoyed their day, it should be easier to preach to the converted than attract new visitors. He is also counting on the \"Expo effect\" to start kicking in soon when the public realise it is their last chance. Nearly a third of the people who went to the last Expo in Lisbon did so in the last six weeks. Dome merchandise, already discounted last month, has been cut further, with cuddly toys of its mascots, Coggesley and Sprinx, being sold at a third of their original price. Meanwhile, Lord Falconer, the minister for the dome, who has so far ridden out a chorus of calls for his resignation, said he would make public the scathing auditors' report from PricewaterhouseCoopers that precipitated its last crisis. His spokesman said a copy of the report, which has already been widely leaked, would be placed in the Commons library later this week. But he has no plans to release reports by the accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche for the millennium commission, which his critics claim alerted him to the dome's financial mismanagement and \"pie-in-the-sky\" business plan as early as last February. His spokesman said: \"Those reports are the property of the commission and it is up to them to decide whether they should be published. Lord Falconer has no say in that whatsoever.\"",
