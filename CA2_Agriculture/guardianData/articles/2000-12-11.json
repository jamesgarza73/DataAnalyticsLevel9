So Sky's desire for drama and upset was satisfied. </p> <p>No one was more satisfied than Crittenden, who said: \"I spent five years at Chelsea waiting for moments like these. We always knew we were in with a chance against Blackpool. We had them watched several times and picked out their weaknesses.\" </p> <p>The runaway Conference leaders, who crushed Second Division Colchester in the first round, fear no one. \"We haven't lost for 10 games now so it's a case of bring on the big boys,\" Crittenden added. That will be Bolton, four times Cup winners but now in the First Division. </p> <p>After Crittenden struck, Yeovil's cult figure Warren Patmore, whose waistline was the subject of abuse from the home fans, lifted his shirt to expose an unflattering figure and chased after the scorer in homage to the \"lose the beerbelly\" television advert. </p> <p>Vintage stuff and part of an occasion that offered a glowing commendation for the increasingly maligned and often overlooked grassroots of professional football. </p> <p>\"They're such a young team you think you're taking the youth team in training some days,\" said Yeovil's experienced manager Colin Addison. </p> <p>\"Some of them haven't even been to Blackpool before and they've been so excited they've been up the Tower this morning.\" </p> <p>McMahon must have felt like throwing himself off it after his side squandered a host of chances. Even before the goal, John Murphy and Brett Ormerod had both been played through on Pennock, the former putting his attempt over the bar, the latter finding out this was Yeovil and their goalkeeper's afternoon. </p> <p>It became ever more so shortly after. Darren Way's cross found Crittenden who, having seen his first effort blocked, reacted more rapidly than his leaden-footed opponents and finished clinically. After the interval Patmore also had an excellent chance but was denied by the legs of Phil Barnes. But those moments apart, the movement was in one direction. </p> <p>Pennock was unflappable. Two years ago, his error cost Yeovil heavily against Cardiff. The goalkeeper said: \"It was just one of those days when everything went right. People still remind me about the Cardiff game, so it was nice to play a full 90 minutes on TV and have a good one.\" </p> <p>John Hills's effort and a header from Murphy were superbly stopped before, in the last minute, Pennock kept out a desperate shot from the substitute Phil Clarkson.</p>",

We had them watched several times and picked out their weaknesses.\" The runaway Conference leaders, who crushed Second Division Colchester in the first round, fear no one. \"We haven't lost for 10 games now so it's a case of bring on the big boys,\" Crittenden added. That will be Bolton, four times Cup winners but now in the First Division. After Crittenden struck, Yeovil's cult figure Warren Patmore, whose waistline was the subject of abuse from the home fans, lifted his shirt to expose an unflattering figure and chased after the scorer in homage to the \"lose the beerbelly\" television advert. Vintage stuff and part of an occasion that offered a glowing commendation for the increasingly maligned and often overlooked grassroots of professional football. \"They're such a young team you think you're taking the youth team in training some days,\" said Yeovil's experienced manager Colin Addison. \"Some of them haven't even been to Blackpool before and they've been so excited they've been up the Tower this morning.\" McMahon must have felt like throwing himself off it after his side squandered a host of chances. Even before the goal, John Murphy and Brett Ormerod had both been played through on Pennock, the former putting his attempt over the bar, the latter finding out this was Yeovil and their goalkeeper's afternoon. It became ever more so shortly after. Darren Way's cross found Crittenden who, having seen his first effort blocked, reacted more rapidly than his leaden-footed opponents and finished clinically. After the interval Patmore also had an excellent chance but was denied by the legs of Phil Barnes. But those moments apart, the movement was in one direction. Pennock was unflappable. Two years ago, his error cost Yeovil heavily against Cardiff. The goalkeeper said: \"It was just one of those days when everything went right. People still remind me about the Cardiff game, so it was nice to play a full 90 minutes on TV and have a good one.\" John Hills's effort and a header from Murphy were superbly stopped before, in the last minute, Pennock kept out a desperate shot from the substitute Phil Clarkson.",

John Dreyer twice went close with headers, but this late rally also served to reveal the quality to be found in the lower league; the goalkeeper Mark Smith and the Morecambe defenders were impressive. Their manager Jim Harvey, a former Tranmere Rovers player, said: \"Mark's goal was excellent but I've got to pick out and praise our defence. We were under the cosh in the last few minutes but when it came to the crunch my players stood up to the pressure. \"It was a performance that said everything about the quality of the Conference nowadays.\"",

Still without a league goal this season, he fluffed into the side netting early, then the referee Graham Poll strangely disallowed his headed goal after 37 minutes.

The home side were as dogged and uncompromising as ever; they have beaten both their north-east rivals this season and can justifiably claim to be the region's best. One day their lofty position will generate its own headlines, although they were happy to spend Saturday basking in El Tel's shadow. </p> <p>\"If we can sneak up the Premiership as quietly as possible, that's brilliant,\" said Gray. \"We had to scrap to win, but we don't want the limelight.

In fact it happened at least three times during his 13 years at Ipswich but that was long ago and greater defensive stability has been one of his prime achievements at Newcastle. </p> <p>On Saturday, however, he was forced by injuries to play the less-experienced Aaron Hughes and Steve Caldwell at centre-back with Robert Lee screening them. The plan was undone in the 13th minute, when Henry gathered a long pass from Tony Adams and cut inside Hughes to send a low shot into the far corner, and completely unravelled three minutes later as Parlour drove in his first goal after Andy Griffin's loss of the ball on the right had enabled Fredrik Ljungberg and Kwankwo Kanu to catch Newcastle on the break. </p> <p>With Alan Shearer waiting to hear if he needs surgery on an injured knee and Carl Cort another absentee, Newcastle's attacking resources were thin.

      "byline": "Patrick Butler",
      "main": "",

      "bodyText": "The government's proposal to \"fundamentally overhaul\" the consultant contract is one of the most symbolically important aspects of its National Health Service plan, reaching back as it does to \"unfinished business\" in the creation of the national health service in 1948. The then health minister Aneurin Bevan, Labour's architect of the NHS, agreed to a \"sweetheart deal\" in which senior hospital doctors gained highly preferential terms and conditions in return for their support for the nascent NHS, much to the shock of some in the Labour movement. Since then the consultant contract has remained largely unchanged, despite repeated criticism that it is open to abuse by consultants who carry out large amounts of private work, that it causes long NHS waiting lists and that it is not good value for money for the NHS. The government has disappointed NHS purists by declining to abolish NHS consultants' contractual right to carry out private practice. But it has ambitious plans to manage the contracts more closely, which is likely to bring it into conflict with the health service's most powerful interest group. Health secretary Alan Milburn has made it clear that he is determined to introduce an \"updated and modernised\" contract which will clarify consultants' minimum obligations to their NHS work and create financial rewards for those senior doctors who \"do most for the NHS\". According to the NHS Plan: \"Consultants' current contract is far from satisfactoryToo few have proper job plans setting out their key objectives, tasks and responsibilities and when they are expected to carry out these duties.\" Ministers want to introduce an annual appraisal of consultant performance and effective job plans \"to ensure that NHS employers are able to manage the consultant workforce effectively in order to ensure the best use of their time and of the resources of the trust\". The proposed new contract would require newly qualified consultants to \"work exclusively for the NHS for the first seven years of their career\" and agree to carry out a minimum amount of NHS work each week. Consultants will be able to carry out private work only when they have fulfilled their NHS requirements. In return, consultants stand to benefit from increased financial rewards, with the bulk of bonuses and distinction awards going to those consultants who make the biggest contribution to improving services and who make long-term commitments to the NHS. The government also promises a 30% expansion in consultant numbers and a greater role for consultants in shaping the NHS modernisation plans. Mr Milburn underlined his commitment to push through the proposed changes in his speech to the Labour conference this year, where he declared: \"For too long the issue of consultant's private practice has been left unresolved. Today we have the courage to make this change.\" Consultants' leaders responded favourably to some aspects of the proposal, but objected strongly to the attempts to place a limit on consultant's private practice, calling it \"an ill-conceived, vindictive attack on new consultants' freedom to work outside the NHS\". The British Medical Association (BMA) believes that attempts to tie in recently qualified consultants into working for the NHS for \"perhaps seven years\" may be illegal under Human Rights legislation. \"We don't think that you can control what qualified doctors do in their spare time,\" says BMA chairman Ian Bogle. Negotiations on the consultant contract continue. Perhaps more than any other part of the NHS Plan, it will be seen as a litmus test of government radicalism.

      "body": "<p>She is a red-haired, brown-eyed, witty and wise rebuke to those who parody \"the feminists\" as hard-faced agents of sexual prohibition or as shrieking harpies who eat testicles for tea. On Wednesday, Lynne Segal will give her inaugural lecture as professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College, University of London, the first in the discipline to take up such a post in one of British academia's most elite institutions.</p> <p>Coincidentally, it will be almost exactly 30 years since she arrived in London from Sydney, a dissident scholar in her early 20s with a brilliant PhD, a boy baby in her arms and her life a total mess. \"I felt so lost and confused, I almost didn't know my name,\" she says now.</p> <p>It's been a lively three decades, if not always in the ways Segal would have wished. As an activist, writer and university teacher, she has spent them developing, sustaining and, latterly, defending the kind of feminism she says she was saved by. This begins with the feminism of the 70s Women's Liberation Movement: a feminism that was optimistic, imaginative and inclusive, that said no to sexism but yes to whatever sort of sexual pleasure a woman could find; that took issue with misogyny and male domination, but welcomed engagement with generous, thoughtful men; and that has brought a sometimes dazzling set of intellectual insights to bear on a mixed-up world.</p> <p>For Segal, the crashing of feminism's \"second wave\" was not only desirable but inevitable: \"It just had to come.\" The postwar contradictions that blighted women's lives were simply too absurd to be sustained - an insight first acquired through raw experience. Segal grew up in Australia in what she bluntly calls \"the usual, unbelievably unhappy family of the 50s\" in which her mother \"cried herself to sleep every night\". She says that in the manner of Jewish families like hers, all three children had to excel in education, but that unlike their older brother, she and her younger sister were encouraged to see futures in which nice, rich husbands would come first.</p> <p>So, like her compatriot Germaine Greer, just a year or two her senior, Segal discovered revolt. At university, she studied psychology in order to understand people, but found that in those days \"psychology meant understanding rats\". So she took issue with the subject. Adapting a phrase of Wittgenstein's, her PhD was called Conceptual Confusions in Experimental Psychology ; it had to be sent to the US for marking because no one in Australia knew what to do with it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she had fallen in with a group called the Sydney Libertarians who set about \"opposing the hypocrisies of those 50s lives: the incredible hypocrisies. That's how I became a progressive person, just trying to expose those vicious little secrets.\"</p> <p>At that time she found feminists unnerving. \"It was because I loved being the centre of male attention - until I accidentally got pregnant.\" Under pressure from her family, she spared them the shame of a bastard grandchild by wedding the prospective father. A less suitable husband would have been difficult to find. \"It was clear by this time that he was homosexual - a homophobic homosexual. He said: 'If our son is homosexual, I'll shoot myself'.\"</p> <p>It was her tormented spouse who finally drove Segal to buy a plane ticket to England. \"If I left the house he would start ripping up my clothes and threaten to set fire to the building.\"</p> <p>It is a biography worthy of being set to music and sung by Gloria Gaynor. Segal, though, has never been claimed by celebrity. She is a problem for the media because she is unable to provide them with convenient \"gender clich\u00e9s\". Hacks and researchers call her on the phone, only to hang up disappointed. \"When my book on masculinity came out (Slow Motion, Virago, 1990), they said, well, have men changed: yes or no? What are they talking about? My point is that men never stop changing, just as women never stop changing. And they say, give us the clich\u00e9, give us a straightforward polarisation between men and women. And I have to say, there aren't any!\"</p> <p>Segal looks on in frustration at a culture now obsessed with comforting notions of fixed sexual essences, with trying to identify crude oppositions between all women on the one hand, all men on the other. From one direction comes evolutionary psychology, feeding the media mania for genetic explanations, urging us once again that biology will always be destiny in the end.</p> <p>It's time to thump the table: \"As human beings, we are never in any way at the mercy of biology. We are always able to do with our biology what the cultural and social and personal resources available to us allow. Anybody, given the right resources, can be almost anything at all. But here comes Helena Cronin, and here comes Richard Dawkins saying, well, men fundamentally want to do this, and women fundamentally want to do that, and what we've learned - from the Palaeolithic age! - is that this is the way we will be happy. I mean, it could not be more stupid!\"</p> <p>From another direction, bearing the same conservative message, come those who positively live on gender clich\u00e9s: Greer to shout that girls are much better than boys, Andrea Dworkin to demonise men, Camille Paglia to worship them. By absolute contrast, Segal poses a much better class of question: why begin with difference in the first place? Why be so preoccupied with mapping and defining things that barely exist? \"The truth is, there's not that much difference between men and women. The point about being human is we're so adaptable and adjustable. Trying to tell us that there's some fixed way of being anything is always going to be more foolish than helpful.\"</p> <p>There is another reason, though, why Segal has not become a star of the dreary old \"sex war\". It is that she has had better things to do. A conventional cv would say her 70s were spent teaching psychology - her kind of psychology (\"They all thought I was nuts\") - at what would eventually become Middlesex University but in those days was just plain Enfield Tech. Her greatest energies, though, went into grass roots politics in Islington, in women's centres, alternative newspapers, childcare facilities, socialist societies. \"We tried to create a community, crossing as many lines of class, race and sex as we could. We were on the side of the dispossessed.\"</p> <p>This grass roots socialist feminism achieved its greatest visibility when incorporated by Ken Livingstone into his Greater London Council in the early 80s. The establishment harrumphed, yet the crumbling of the left was already under way. In 1980, at the instigation of friend and ally Sheila Rowbotham, Segal had helped author Beyond the Fragments, a pamphlet arguing for broad alliances among trade unionists, feminists and left political groups. A subsequent conference drew an encouraging attendance, but the sectarian die was already cast, including within feminism. \"From about 1976, if you went to a women's liberation conference, you'd have a pretty lousy time. You'd just become engaged in the fiercest rows, usually with separatist lesbians.\"</p> <p>A desire to challenge the retreat of feminism into identity politics and defensive fundamentalism has informed much of Segal's more recent writing.

      "bodyText": "She is a red-haired, brown-eyed, witty and wise rebuke to those who parody \"the feminists\" as hard-faced agents of sexual prohibition or as shrieking harpies who eat testicles for tea. On Wednesday, Lynne Segal will give her inaugural lecture as professor of psychology and gender studies at Birkbeck College, University of London, the first in the discipline to take up such a post in one of British academia's most elite institutions. Coincidentally, it will be almost exactly 30 years since she arrived in London from Sydney, a dissident scholar in her early 20s with a brilliant PhD, a boy baby in her arms and her life a total mess. \"I felt so lost and confused, I almost didn't know my name,\" she says now. It's been a lively three decades, if not always in the ways Segal would have wished. As an activist, writer and university teacher, she has spent them developing, sustaining and, latterly, defending the kind of feminism she says she was saved by. This begins with the feminism of the 70s Women's Liberation Movement: a feminism that was optimistic, imaginative and inclusive, that said no to sexism but yes to whatever sort of sexual pleasure a woman could find; that took issue with misogyny and male domination, but welcomed engagement with generous, thoughtful men; and that has brought a sometimes dazzling set of intellectual insights to bear on a mixed-up world. For Segal, the crashing of feminism's \"second wave\" was not only desirable but inevitable: \"It just had to come.\" The postwar contradictions that blighted women's lives were simply too absurd to be sustained - an insight first acquired through raw experience. Segal grew up in Australia in what she bluntly calls \"the usual, unbelievably unhappy family of the 50s\" in which her mother \"cried herself to sleep every night\". She says that in the manner of Jewish families like hers, all three children had to excel in education, but that unlike their older brother, she and her younger sister were encouraged to see futures in which nice, rich husbands would come first. So, like her compatriot Germaine Greer, just a year or two her senior, Segal discovered revolt. At university, she studied psychology in order to understand people, but found that in those days \"psychology meant understanding rats\". So she took issue with the subject. Adapting a phrase of Wittgenstein's, her PhD was called Conceptual Confusions in Experimental Psychology ; it had to be sent to the US for marking because no one in Australia knew what to do with it. Meanwhile, she had fallen in with a group called the Sydney Libertarians who set about \"opposing the hypocrisies of those 50s lives: the incredible hypocrisies. That's how I became a progressive person, just trying to expose those vicious little secrets.\" At that time she found feminists unnerving. \"It was because I loved being the centre of male attention - until I accidentally got pregnant.\" Under pressure from her family, she spared them the shame of a bastard grandchild by wedding the prospective father. A less suitable husband would have been difficult to find. \"It was clear by this time that he was homosexual - a homophobic homosexual. He said: 'If our son is homosexual, I'll shoot myself'.\" It was her tormented spouse who finally drove Segal to buy a plane ticket to England. \"If I left the house he would start ripping up my clothes and threaten to set fire to the building.\" It is a biography worthy of being set to music and sung by Gloria Gaynor. Segal, though, has never been claimed by celebrity. She is a problem for the media because she is unable to provide them with convenient \"gender clich\u00e9s\". Hacks and researchers call her on the phone, only to hang up disappointed. \"When my book on masculinity came out (Slow Motion, Virago, 1990), they said, well, have men changed: yes or no? What are they talking about? My point is that men never stop changing, just as women never stop changing. And they say, give us the clich\u00e9, give us a straightforward polarisation between men and women. And I have to say, there aren't any!\" Segal looks on in frustration at a culture now obsessed with comforting notions of fixed sexual essences, with trying to identify crude oppositions between all women on the one hand, all men on the other. From one direction comes evolutionary psychology, feeding the media mania for genetic explanations, urging us once again that biology will always be destiny in the end. It's time to thump the table: \"As human beings, we are never in any way at the mercy of biology. We are always able to do with our biology what the cultural and social and personal resources available to us allow. Anybody, given the right resources, can be almost anything at all. But here comes Helena Cronin, and here comes Richard Dawkins saying, well, men fundamentally want to do this, and women fundamentally want to do that, and what we've learned - from the Palaeolithic age! - is that this is the way we will be happy. I mean, it could not be more stupid!\" From another direction, bearing the same conservative message, come those who positively live on gender clich\u00e9s: Greer to shout that girls are much better than boys, Andrea Dworkin to demonise men, Camille Paglia to worship them. By absolute contrast, Segal poses a much better class of question: why begin with difference in the first place? Why be so preoccupied with mapping and defining things that barely exist? \"The truth is, there's not that much difference between men and women. The point about being human is we're so adaptable and adjustable. Trying to tell us that there's some fixed way of being anything is always going to be more foolish than helpful.\" There is another reason, though, why Segal has not become a star of the dreary old \"sex war\". It is that she has had better things to do. A conventional cv would say her 70s were spent teaching psychology - her kind of psychology (\"They all thought I was nuts\") - at what would eventually become Middlesex University but in those days was just plain Enfield Tech. Her greatest energies, though, went into grass roots politics in Islington, in women's centres, alternative newspapers, childcare facilities, socialist societies. \"We tried to create a community, crossing as many lines of class, race and sex as we could. We were on the side of the dispossessed.\" This grass roots socialist feminism achieved its greatest visibility when incorporated by Ken Livingstone into his Greater London Council in the early 80s. The establishment harrumphed, yet the crumbling of the left was already under way. In 1980, at the instigation of friend and ally Sheila Rowbotham, Segal had helped author Beyond the Fragments, a pamphlet arguing for broad alliances among trade unionists, feminists and left political groups. A subsequent conference drew an encouraging attendance, but the sectarian die was already cast, including within feminism. \"From about 1976, if you went to a women's liberation conference, you'd have a pretty lousy time. You'd just become engaged in the fiercest rows, usually with separatist lesbians.\" A desire to challenge the retreat of feminism into identity politics and defensive fundamentalism has informed much of Segal's more recent writing. Slow Motion was followed by Straight Sex (Virago, 1994) which defended the legitimacy of women seeking heterosexual pleasure, skilfully exposing the reactionary heart of the \"radical\" school of feminism, with its bleak insistence that heterosexual intercourse is, and only can be, the enactment of oppression. In these books she maintains the common threads of all her deeds and thinking: a refusal to believe that humankind is fixed by nature and an absolute conviction that we may still be authors of our own histories. Her most recent, Why Feminism? (Polity Press), remakes the case for a dynamic feminism that rejects pessimism and becomes once again a \"movement of transformation\", able to liberate both sexes from the tyrannies of labour, of fear and, of course, gender. She looks at younger women struggling to Have It All, and the fears daily expressed for and about men and boys, and believes she just might have a few suggestions. It's a grim comment on the times that so few powerful people want to know.",

      "bodyText": "Opponents of the current consultants contract argue that it is open to abuse by consultants who wish to manipulate their NHS position to maximise their private earnings. The most serious allegation is that some consultants ensure their NHS waiting list is as long as possible in order to more profitably market their private practice to patients who are prepared to pay for immediate treatment. The House of Commons Health Select Committee investigated these allegations, and found that they were \"not proven\". But it added: \"What is indisputable is that NHS patients wait longer than private patients, and that private earnings are highest in those specialties where NHS waiting times are longest.\" The British Medical Association (BMA) argued that long waiting lists are caused by shortages of staff, theatre capacity and beds, rather than as a result of private practice. A second criticism is that consultants are so tempted by the financial rewards of private practice that they neglect their NHS contractual obligations. A MORI poll carried out by the Doctors and Dentists Review Body in 1998 found that 5% of consultants - equivalent to 1,000 consultants nationally - were working less than 35 hours a week and therefore failing to meet contractual obligations. The BMA questioned the poll and argued that only a small minority of consultants fail to carry out their contracted NHS work. The health committee concluded: \"It is not possible to ascertain the extent to which consultants are failing to meet their NHS obligations because of their private practice, because the information collected on consultants' workload is currently inadequate. \"In addition, we are not convinced that NHS trusts themselves have the information they need to be able to make this judgement about their consultants.\" A third criticism of the consultant contract is that it is inequitable, and creates a two-tier service in which people able to pay for private treatment can jump the queue for treatment. Professor John Yates has illustrated the practice by telling the story of \"Keith\", a patient requiring heart surgery. He wrote: \"Keith discovered that he required heart surgery. The surgeon explained that ideally the operation should be performed soon, but as his condition was not urgent he would have to wait about nine months. \"For a payment of about \u00a310,000 the same surgeon would operate on him within two weeks in the same NHS hospital or in a private hospital in a neighbouring city.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Santiago court of appeals today blocked the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet. Voting 3-0 in favour of the former dictator, the court agreed to drop homicide and kidnapping charges stemming from 189 criminal complaints relating to human rights abuses during his 1973-90 regime \"We won, we won,\" an exultant Pinochet lawyer, Sergio Castro, told reporters as he brandished three fingers to indicate the voting margin. Carmen Hertz, an anti-Pinochet lawyer and the widow of a dissident killed during the dictator's regime, dismissed the court's decision as \"a mere technicality.\" \"The court has only ruled that the indictment of Pinochet was improper because he was not questioned by a judge before it was issued,\" Hertz said. \"But the ruling does not involve the essence of the case against him.\" \"We will now go to the supreme court,\" she added. The arguments for the defense concentrated on their claim that Judge Juan Guzman acted illegally by indicting Pinochet before he had been questioned. Pinochet was accused of responsibility for the \"Caravan of Death,\" a military operation that executed political prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup in which he ousted Marxist president Salvador Allende. Pinochet was charged with homicide for 55 victims whose bodies were recovered and kidnapping for 18 who remain missing. A supreme court verdict, if the plaintiffs lodge their appeal, is expected as early as Thursday.

      "body": "<p>It can't be easy being Zadie Smith. She has become so much more famous than her celebrated first novel because she had the fortune, or misfortune, to be the perfect demographic. Young, attractive, black, female - and very talented. She is everything the media hankers after, the ideal head and shoulders to parade on a newspaper's masthead. Perhaps inevitably, she is also the object of huge envy. Before meeting her, so many people - mainly women - tell me they've heard she's bitchy, supercilious, smug, cold, a fake, you name it. </p> <p>Smith, now 25, has just won the Guardian's first book prize for White Teeth. Earlier this year she hogged the headlines for failing to win the Orange prize. And she also grabbed her share of the news when she didn't make the Booker shortlist - black, bookish babe fails to win prize, accompanied by a swanky picture. </p> <p>I don't recognise Smith when we meet. The big specs and Afro have disappeared. She looked lovely on the cover of White Teeth - not a face you could forget. Today, she's all long straight hair and lip gloss, and looks like any number of drained All Saints waltzing around clubland. </p> <p>She rushes us to the bar at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, orders cranberry juice, no, make that a coffee, and bounds off up staircase after staircase looking for somewhere nice and quiet. She's talking all the time, fast and furious - about life as writer in residence at the ICA, judging an art competition, how all artists today just produce huts and tell you that's art, and how, if she's honest, she doesn't have a clue whether a hut is art, but what an honour, what joy, to be in such a privileged position. </p> <p>Eventually we find an office to squat in. Right at the top. Smith looks down over London - the Eye, the Thames, parliament, Westminster - queen of all she surveys. \"Amazing isn't it? The best possible view of London.\" She burns with zest, with life. </p> <p>Then I turn on the tape recorder. Suddenly the Zadie Smith in front of me is morose, self-conscious, resentful. She stumbles over her words. \"Oh Gawwwwwd! I'm so bad at interviews.\" She picks up a Rizla paper and rolls a fag, says that most writers are useless speakers, and that's why they write. \"I have nothing to say.\" So we talk about her new hair. </p> <p>Smith is worrying away at her momentary incoherence. What she hates about talking, she says, is the way she can't edit herself. She's very precious about words. \"There's this great quote by Nabokov. 'He wrote like a genius, he thought like a man of letters and he spoke like a child' . . . it's a bloody good quote, and I think it's true of some very, very great writers. I'm always a bit suspicious of writers who have the gift of the gab.\" She immediately qualifies herself - not that she's a great writer. </p> <p>Smith has spent much of the past year travelling with her book, being feted. Yes, it's been amazing, she says, but terrifying, and she reaches for another reference. \"In Amis's book, I think this is a quote from McEwan, 'Going on a book tour is like being the blue-collar employee of your former self'.\" When Smith quotes authors, as she often does, it tends to be them talking about the writer as personality rather than the writing; the image rather than the product. </p> <p>Suddenly, the girl who sat alone in her bedroom for two years writing a book was exposed to the glare of the publicity machine. Suddenly, she was expected to be more than a novelist - a spokesperson for race, youth, women. She didn't know what to do, so she talked. \"I was expected to be some expert on multicultural affairs, as if multiculturalism is a genre of fiction or something, whereas it's just a fact of life - like there are people of different races on the planet. I give my opinion, then you get 50 phone calls saying, 'Well, I don't think Ms Smith has the right to give an opinion on something she knows nothing about'.\" She laughs, but it was obviously bewildering, dizzying. </p> <p>She tells me about the time she went to do a photo shoot for a magazine and found herself lost in a sprawl of make-up artists, dressers and little Prada dresses that could never have fitted her. \"I wouldn't mind it if I saw five-hour photo shoots for Martin Amis, but that doesn't happen. If you're a woman it's as if they want to reduce everything to the same denominator.\" Which is? \"That you must present yourself as an attractive woman even if you're a rocket scientist. It's total arse isn't it?\" </p> <p>White Teeth is a rich, sprawling domestic epic, about how families and people come together and fall apart in the most unlikely ways. It's also very much a book about modern London, a city in which 40% of children are born to at least one black parent, a city in which the terms black and white become less and less relevant as we gradually meld into different shades of brown. White Teeth reflects a new generation for whom race is the backdrop to daily life rather than the defining characteristic of existence. Some people have said Smith is depoliticising race, removing it from its historical context, others say she's ahead of her time, representing modern London as it really is for the first time. </p> <p>Smith has been compared with Salman Rushdie. She says it may be well intended, definitely a compliment, but racist nonsense none the less. She yawns. \"I think I have brown people in my book, and so does Salman, and so does Hanif Kureishi. So it's a genre, don't you see that?\" Stereotypes, more bloody nonsense - she's often described as having come from a humble background. What do they mean? \"I went to a comprehensive school, got into Cambridge. I may have been working class once, I think once you live in a nice flat in a nice area and you've had a great education, you're really pushing it, to continue to claim to be salt of the earth. Life changes, my family is a picture of change.\" White Teeth is also a picture of such social fluidity. </p> <p>\"I don't intend to be a spokesman for anything or anybody apart from . . . \" She cuts herself off. \"My work isn't a statement, they're novels and funny novels, and hopefully . . . yeh, brilliant sentence, Zadie, thank you very much !\" And she gives up. </p> <p>\"I was 21 when I wrote White Teeth, what difference does it make what I think?\" She's conscious of her youth, still monitors every event by how old she was at the time. \"I'm not a rentaquote.\" The trouble is that even when she's rebutting the notion of being a spokesperson (\"a white male writer is never asked to be a spokesman for anything; he has complete artistic freedom\"), she ends up giving good quote, and keeps the publicity wheel rolling. </p> <p>It's too easy to reduce Smith to a victim of fame. She seems to have spent much of her life preparing for celebrity. She was five or six when she started writing poems and stories. A few years later she was writing pastiches of Agatha Christie. Her photographer dad and psychotherapist mum sent her to the local comprehensive in Willesden. Was she swotty? \"Was I swotty? Yes, I was very swotty,\" she echoes in her deep singsong voice. At 14, Sadie changed her name to Zadie - it seemed right, exotic, different, while still true to herself. She always knew that there was more to a person than body and soul. There was image. </p> <p>She spent much of her childhood watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and the great old movie musicals and saying to herself, \"One day that's going to be me\". Eventually she realised she was fooling herself. She probably wouldn't make the grade, and anyway she was a child out of time - they had stopped making those movies decades ago. So she decided on Cambridge University. \"I wanted to be an academic, and all the writers I loved went there.\" </p> <p>She seems to have mapped out her future rigorously. At 18, she was reading up about the working methods of her favourite authors. \"The worst thing is to be terrorised by the way other people write, if you hear that so and so wakes up at eight in the morning, walks the dog for two hours, then stands his head, then writes 15,000 words, you think, like, shit, why don't I do that, but I've stopped thinking that way.\" At Cambridge she received a \u00a3250,000 advance for two novels. </p> <p> Smith says she sees naked ambition all around her, and it terrifies her. But she must have been ambitious? \"I have an ambition to write a great book, but that's really a competition with myself. I've noticed that a lot of young writers, people in all media, want to be famous but they don't really want to do anything. I can't think of anything less worth striving for than fame.\" </p> <p>Smith can be coruscating about her work. She wrote a review of White Teeth in which she damned the book as the work of a precocious poser. But there are still moments, reading aloud, when she bursts out laughing. \"There's one sentence somewhere near the beginning, it's something like 'Kelvin smiled, colon or semi colon, a sudden gash across his face that came and went with the violence of a fat man walking through swing doors.'\" Her eyes smile with pleasure. \"I liked that, and I thought no one else could have written that sentence, and it's not true of many sentences in that book.\" </p> <p>She may be ambivalent about what she has written so far, but she seems to have supreme confidence about what she will go on to write. Has she got a great book in her? \"If you didn't believe that you did, at some point, even if it's when I'm 60, then why would you do it?\" </p> <p>I say that people can write for lots of reasons - to make money, to communicate, to express themselves, to unburden themselves. She looks at me with something approaching contempt. \"I express myself with my friends and my family. In my diary if I had one, that's expressing yourself. Novels are not about expressing yourself, they're about something beautiful, funny, clever and organic. Self-expression ? Go and ring a bell in a yard if you want to express yourself.\" She can be wonderfully haughty. But I don't believe that she believes what she's just said. I bet she'll hate it if she reads it. You sense that she's so used to thinking on her feet, always having a sharp answer, that this is the first thing that came into her head. </p> <p>Smith is part way through her second novel, which is about an obsessive autograph hunter, but has written hardly any fiction this year. She's not had time. She says how worried she is about not having written for so long, and suddenly she seems to be talking herself through a therapy session. \"I've been so terrified you know because White Teeth is such a naive book. I didn't have any expectations of it, didn't worry about the critics, I just wrote, and it was happy, lalalalala, and then there was a book, and that's not going to be true anymore. So the question is am I going to write some horrible difficult second novel that everybody hates? I hope not.

I can't show you any proof, but I just kind of feel it.\" </p> <p>As we wind up, she returns to something we talked about earlier, something bothering her.

I think all writers are pretty bloody vain one way or another.\" </p> <p>Does she think she's been too successful? \"By a long way.\" Why? \"If you love a young writer, maybe the best thing you can do is give them a little bit of space.\" </p> <p>Zadie Smith is a precious talent, one that needs nurturing, perhaps even cocooning.

      "bodyText": "It can't be easy being Zadie Smith. She has become so much more famous than her celebrated first novel because she had the fortune, or misfortune, to be the perfect demographic. Young, attractive, black, female - and very talented. She is everything the media hankers after, the ideal head and shoulders to parade on a newspaper's masthead. Perhaps inevitably, she is also the object of huge envy. Before meeting her, so many people - mainly women - tell me they've heard she's bitchy, supercilious, smug, cold, a fake, you name it. Smith, now 25, has just won the Guardian's first book prize for White Teeth. Earlier this year she hogged the headlines for failing to win the Orange prize. And she also grabbed her share of the news when she didn't make the Booker shortlist - black, bookish babe fails to win prize, accompanied by a swanky picture. I don't recognise Smith when we meet. The big specs and Afro have disappeared. She looked lovely on the cover of White Teeth - not a face you could forget. Today, she's all long straight hair and lip gloss, and looks like any number of drained All Saints waltzing around clubland. She rushes us to the bar at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, orders cranberry juice, no, make that a coffee, and bounds off up staircase after staircase looking for somewhere nice and quiet. She's talking all the time, fast and furious - about life as writer in residence at the ICA, judging an art competition, how all artists today just produce huts and tell you that's art, and how, if she's honest, she doesn't have a clue whether a hut is art, but what an honour, what joy, to be in such a privileged position. Eventually we find an office to squat in. Right at the top. Smith looks down over London - the Eye, the Thames, parliament, Westminster - queen of all she surveys. \"Amazing isn't it? The best possible view of London.\" She burns with zest, with life. Then I turn on the tape recorder. Suddenly the Zadie Smith in front of me is morose, self-conscious, resentful. She stumbles over her words. \"Oh Gawwwwwd! I'm so bad at interviews.\" She picks up a Rizla paper and rolls a fag, says that most writers are useless speakers, and that's why they write. \"I have nothing to say.\" So we talk about her new hair. Smith is worrying away at her momentary incoherence. What she hates about talking, she says, is the way she can't edit herself. She's very precious about words. \"There's this great quote by Nabokov. 'He wrote like a genius, he thought like a man of letters and he spoke like a child' . . . it's a bloody good quote, and I think it's true of some very, very great writers. I'm always a bit suspicious of writers who have the gift of the gab.\" She immediately qualifies herself - not that she's a great writer. Smith has spent much of the past year travelling with her book, being feted. Yes, it's been amazing, she says, but terrifying, and she reaches for another reference. \"In Amis's book, I think this is a quote from McEwan, 'Going on a book tour is like being the blue-collar employee of your former self'.\" When Smith quotes authors, as she often does, it tends to be them talking about the writer as personality rather than the writing; the image rather than the product. Suddenly, the girl who sat alone in her bedroom for two years writing a book was exposed to the glare of the publicity machine. Suddenly, she was expected to be more than a novelist - a spokesperson for race, youth, women. She didn't know what to do, so she talked. \"I was expected to be some expert on multicultural affairs, as if multiculturalism is a genre of fiction or something, whereas it's just a fact of life - like there are people of different races on the planet. I give my opinion, then you get 50 phone calls saying, 'Well, I don't think Ms Smith has the right to give an opinion on something she knows nothing about'.\" She laughs, but it was obviously bewildering, dizzying. She tells me about the time she went to do a photo shoot for a magazine and found herself lost in a sprawl of make-up artists, dressers and little Prada dresses that could never have fitted her. \"I wouldn't mind it if I saw five-hour photo shoots for Martin Amis, but that doesn't happen. If you're a woman it's as if they want to reduce everything to the same denominator.\" Which is? \"That you must present yourself as an attractive woman even if you're a rocket scientist. It's total arse isn't it?\" White Teeth is a rich, sprawling domestic epic, about how families and people come together and fall apart in the most unlikely ways. It's also very much a book about modern London, a city in which 40% of children are born to at least one black parent, a city in which the terms black and white become less and less relevant as we gradually meld into different shades of brown. White Teeth reflects a new generation for whom race is the backdrop to daily life rather than the defining characteristic of existence. Some people have said Smith is depoliticising race, removing it from its historical context, others say she's ahead of her time, representing modern London as it really is for the first time. Smith has been compared with Salman Rushdie. She says it may be well intended, definitely a compliment, but racist nonsense none the less. She yawns. \"I think I have brown people in my book, and so does Salman, and so does Hanif Kureishi. So it's a genre, don't you see that?\" Stereotypes, more bloody nonsense - she's often described as having come from a humble background. What do they mean? \"I went to a comprehensive school, got into Cambridge. I may have been working class once, I think once you live in a nice flat in a nice area and you've had a great education, you're really pushing it, to continue to claim to be salt of the earth. Life changes, my family is a picture of change.\" White Teeth is also a picture of such social fluidity. \"I don't intend to be a spokesman for anything or anybody apart from . . . \" She cuts herself off. \"My work isn't a statement, they're novels and funny novels, and hopefully . . . yeh, brilliant sentence, Zadie, thank you very much !\" And she gives up. \"I was 21 when I wrote White Teeth, what difference does it make what I think?\" She's conscious of her youth, still monitors every event by how old she was at the time. \"I'm not a rentaquote.\" The trouble is that even when she's rebutting the notion of being a spokesperson (\"a white male writer is never asked to be a spokesman for anything; he has complete artistic freedom\"), she ends up giving good quote, and keeps the publicity wheel rolling. It's too easy to reduce Smith to a victim of fame. She seems to have spent much of her life preparing for celebrity. She was five or six when she started writing poems and stories. A few years later she was writing pastiches of Agatha Christie. Her photographer dad and psychotherapist mum sent her to the local comprehensive in Willesden. Was she swotty? \"Was I swotty? Yes, I was very swotty,\" she echoes in her deep singsong voice. At 14, Sadie changed her name to Zadie - it seemed right, exotic, different, while still true to herself. She always knew that there was more to a person than body and soul. There was image. She spent much of her childhood watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and the great old movie musicals and saying to herself, \"One day that's going to be me\". Eventually she realised she was fooling herself. She probably wouldn't make the grade, and anyway she was a child out of time - they had stopped making those movies decades ago. So she decided on Cambridge University. \"I wanted to be an academic, and all the writers I loved went there.\" She seems to have mapped out her future rigorously. At 18, she was reading up about the working methods of her favourite authors. \"The worst thing is to be terrorised by the way other people write, if you hear that so and so wakes up at eight in the morning, walks the dog for two hours, then stands his head, then writes 15,000 words, you think, like, shit, why don't I do that, but I've stopped thinking that way.\" At Cambridge she received a \u00a3250,000 advance for two novels. Smith says she sees naked ambition all around her, and it terrifies her. But she must have been ambitious? \"I have an ambition to write a great book, but that's really a competition with myself. I've noticed that a lot of young writers, people in all media, want to be famous but they don't really want to do anything. I can't think of anything less worth striving for than fame.\" Smith can be coruscating about her work. She wrote a review of White Teeth in which she damned the book as the work of a precocious poser. But there are still moments, reading aloud, when she bursts out laughing. \"There's one sentence somewhere near the beginning, it's something like 'Kelvin smiled, colon or semi colon, a sudden gash across his face that came and went with the violence of a fat man walking through swing doors.'\" Her eyes smile with pleasure. \"I liked that, and I thought no one else could have written that sentence, and it's not true of many sentences in that book.\" She may be ambivalent about what she has written so far, but she seems to have supreme confidence about what she will go on to write. Has she got a great book in her? \"If you didn't believe that you did, at some point, even if it's when I'm 60, then why would you do it?\" I say that people can write for lots of reasons - to make money, to communicate, to express themselves, to unburden themselves. She looks at me with something approaching contempt. \"I express myself with my friends and my family. In my diary if I had one, that's expressing yourself. Novels are not about expressing yourself, they're about something beautiful, funny, clever and organic. Self-expression ? Go and ring a bell in a yard if you want to express yourself.\" She can be wonderfully haughty. But I don't believe that she believes what she's just said. I bet she'll hate it if she reads it. You sense that she's so used to thinking on her feet, always having a sharp answer, that this is the first thing that came into her head. Smith is part way through her second novel, which is about an obsessive autograph hunter, but has written hardly any fiction this year. She's not had time. She says how worried she is about not having written for so long, and suddenly she seems to be talking herself through a therapy session. \"I've been so terrified you know because White Teeth is such a naive book.

I think all writers are pretty bloody vain one way or another.\" Does she think she's been too successful? \"By a long way.\" Why? \"If you love a young writer, maybe the best thing you can do is give them a little bit of space.\" Zadie Smith is a precious talent, one that needs nurturing, perhaps even cocooning. In the new year she's going to lock herself away for five months and write. I ask about the new hair. She says it's just hair extensions, that her Afro's expanding underneath, and next week it's back to normal. And the specs? She smashed them, and is waiting for a new pair.

      "bodyText": "A confident Tony Blair used a Commons statement this afternoon to defend his decision to surrender some veto powers in Europe during the recent Nice summit. Arguing that the Nice agreement will produce a \"more rational way of decision making\" within the EU, the prime minister fended off attacks from William Hague. The Tory leader argued that the government had signed up to \"three more major steps to a European superstate\" and pledged that an incoming Conservative government would not ratify the treaty as it stood. He challenged Mr Blair to hold a referendum on the question of ratification. Mr Hague said that Mr Blair had \"signed away\" Britain's veto in 23 areas, giving European institutions an opportunity to impose further integration against Britain's will. Responding, the prime minister mocked the opposition for a stance which would endanger enlargement of the EU, describing Mr Hague's proposal as \"full rounded idiocy\".

      "body": "<p>Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Eddie George, yesterday welcomed signs that the US economy was slowing and warned against exaggerating the risks of a US recession. </p> <p>In an interview on BBC Breakfast with Frost, Sir Eddie pronounced the British economy to be in \"very good shape\", adding that a rise in the value of the euro would be \"helpful\". </p> <p>The governor said that, given the single currency's weakness, it would have been unwise to lock in the pound at recent exchange rates. A strengthening of the euro would allow the five economic tests laid down by the chancellor to be applied, he said, but refused to be drawn on whether Britain would join the single currency. </p> <p>\"That's a political decision and not one for me,\" he said. </p> <p>The governor said the biggest question for the international economy was what was happening in the US. </p> <p>\"If [the US economy] hadn't begun to slow down, I think we would be looking at a bigger problem. As inflationary pressures built up, we would be looking at a bigger problem further down the track, so it's a good thing the US economy is slowing down.\" </p> <p>Echoing comments from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan last week, Sir Eddie said he was not concerned at present that the slowdown was \"excessive\", but accepted that a careful watch would have to be kept on emerging economic data. </p> <p>But he warned against over reaction. \"Central bankers always look at the risks and I think the risk of the economy growing too strongly was greater three, six months ago and now people have seen the change and there's a great tendency you know to exaggerate this thing and to move from the need for slowdown to downturn to recession to meltdown. I mean that happens very quickly, I think.\" </p> <p>Sir Eddie said that Britain had enjoyed a long period of steady growth, with unemployment as low as it had been for a quarter of a century and the expectation that progress would be maintained for the next couple of years. </p> <p>\"The problem has been imbalance with some sectors doing very well and other sectors under pressure,\" he said. </p> <p>The euro's weakness has often added to this pressure and Sir Eddie said there was little that could be done. \"We either continue to direct ourselves at the overall macroeconomic situation or we try to shelter some of the adversely affected sectors by paying more attention to the exchange rate than we already do in which case we could put at risk the stability in the economy as well.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Eddie George, yesterday welcomed signs that the US economy was slowing and warned against exaggerating the risks of a US recession. In an interview on BBC Breakfast with Frost, Sir Eddie pronounced the British economy to be in \"very good shape\", adding that a rise in the value of the euro would be \"helpful\". The governor said that, given the single currency's weakness, it would have been unwise to lock in the pound at recent exchange rates. A strengthening of the euro would allow the five economic tests laid down by the chancellor to be applied, he said, but refused to be drawn on whether Britain would join the single currency. \"That's a political decision and not one for me,\" he said. The governor said the biggest question for the international economy was what was happening in the US. \"If [the US economy] hadn't begun to slow down, I think we would be looking at a bigger problem. As inflationary pressures built up, we would be looking at a bigger problem further down the track, so it's a good thing the US economy is slowing down.\" Echoing comments from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan last week, Sir Eddie said he was not concerned at present that the slowdown was \"excessive\", but accepted that a careful watch would have to be kept on emerging economic data. But he warned against over reaction. \"Central bankers always look at the risks and I think the risk of the economy growing too strongly was greater three, six months ago and now people have seen the change and there's a great tendency you know to exaggerate this thing and to move from the need for slowdown to downturn to recession to meltdown. I mean that happens very quickly, I think.\" Sir Eddie said that Britain had enjoyed a long period of steady growth, with unemployment as low as it had been for a quarter of a century and the expectation that progress would be maintained for the next couple of years. \"The problem has been imbalance with some sectors doing very well and other sectors under pressure,\" he said. The euro's weakness has often added to this pressure and Sir Eddie said there was little that could be done. \"We either continue to direct ourselves at the overall macroeconomic situation or we try to shelter some of the adversely affected sectors by paying more attention to the exchange rate than we already do in which case we could put at risk the stability in the economy as well.\"",

      "bodyText": "Viewers and listeners are becoming increasingly concerned about racist language, a study by TV and advertising watchdogs revealed today. Over the past two years racist abuse has shot up in the league of offensive words. In a disturbing twist, however, some racist words are not even considered offensive by a sizeable section of the public. The report, Delete Expletives?, found that while swearing and offensive language on TV and radio and in print and poster advertising, remains a serious issue with most adults, the use of racist abuse was identified as an area to which respondents were increasingly sensitive. In 1998 \"Nigger\" was ranked as the 11th most offensive word in the English language. Two years on it is considered an extreme term of abuse, moving up to fifth position in the severity rankings. \"Paki\" was similarly deemed a middle-ranking term of abuse, ranking number 17 in 1998. But it is now considered the 10th most offensive word. However, the table, which was published by the BBC and broadcasting and advertising regulators, shows that as many as 40% of respondents consider the word \"paki\" inoffensive, regarding it as either \"quite mild\" or \"not swearing\". And 32% didn't have a problem with the word 'nigger'. This was in stark contrast to the C-word, with only 1% considering it not to be a swear word. And elsewhere in the report, only 50% deemed \"paki\" and \"nigger' unacceptable for TV broadcast at any time. By contrast, there was minimal movement in sentiment towards other words considered \"very severe\" between 1998 and 2000. The use of swear words and terms of abuse in TV shows was considered generally unacceptable before the 9pm watershed by respondents. But swearing was regarded as more acceptable in \"adult\" programming such as drama, film, comedy and documentary dealing with controversial subjects, provided it was scheduled appropriately. The use of swear words was also more likely to be accepted if it was felt to be editorially justified. Respondents expected BBC1, of all terrestrial and pay-TV channels, to show the most responsible attitude to the use of swearing and offensive language, because it was paid for by the licence fee. Stephen Whittle, Broadcasting Standards Commission director, said: \"Although there is an acceptance that swearing and offensive language is used in daily life and may be appropriate if a programme is aimed at adults, they would prefer their homes to remain an expletive deleted zone for children.\" The use of swearing in TV and poster advertising was considered even less acceptable than in TV programmes, with 81% of respondents saying that TV ads should not contain strong language even if transmitted after the watershed. Strong language was said to be less acceptable in poster ads than other media because it could not be avoided, according to 86% of respondents to the survey. Consumers were more willing to accept swearing and offensive language in press advertising. But more than two-thirds of those canvassed in the study felt there should be equivalent rules for both broadcast and non-broadcast advertisements. Christopher Graham, Advertising Standards Authority director general, said: \"This research will help advertisers to distinguish between what might be acceptable in targeted media such as magazines and what causes offence on posters in the high street.\" \u0095 Delete Expletives? was researched by NOP for the Advertising Standards Authority, BBC, Broadcasting Standards Commission and Independent Television Commission.

Unison, the Transport and General Workers union and the GMB made the call as the opening gambit in their latest round of pay negotiations with authorities. Preliminary costing from the local government Employers Organisation suggests the claim would mean wage increases of between 3%-11%. The average increase would be about 6.4%, but councils would have to dig deep to cover the \u00a3800m bill. A spokesman for the Employers Organisation said: \"The unions have admitted this is a big claim, and we'd echo that.\" The unions claim the increase will help councils deal with staffing problems - more than three-quarters have reported recruitment difficulties. The move could also help tackle the gender pay gap and beat low wages by giving staff a minimum rate of \u00a35.11 an hour. GMB national public service secretary Mick Graham said: \"In the 21st century a minimum weekly wage of \u00a3200 is warranted and realistic for local government workers.

They also provided newspapers with a a wholesome pin-up of the royals' best-looking member. Front pages in the national press yesterday and today and tonight's TV specials on both BBC and ITV are the ultimate results of a PR campaign that has been planned with military precision by St James's Palace over the past two months. The impact was instant and returns positive. \"Tall, handsome, sensitive, artistic, and cool\" were the adjectives used by the Sun alone.

Two years after he was unceremoniously dumped from the premiership, Elvis Presley-lookalike Ryutaro Hashimoto made a surprise return to the cabinet last week, and many predict he will regain the top job next year. In a first for Japan, Hashimoto is one of three prime ministers (one current, two former) in a reshuffled administration that has left many observers asking who is really running the country. It certainly does not appear to be the gaffe-prone prime minister, Mr Mori, who only narrowly survived a rebellion within the ruling Liberal Democratic party last month. With a disapproval rating of about 70%, Mr Mori is one of the most unpopular premiers in history and many LDP politicians fear a meltdown in next summer's upper house election if he stays at the helm. Mr Hashimoto, meanwhile, has clearly emerged as the winner from the recent turmoil that has shaken the LDP. His appointment as minister in charge of administrative reform marks a remarkable comeback for a politician whose name was dirt just two years ago. Mr Hashimoto was forced to resign as prime minister in 1998 after the LDP was punished in the polls for a deep recession that was widely blamed on his decision to force through a rise in the consumption tax. After a brief period in the political wilderness, he returned to the limelight last spring when he inherited the leadership of the LDP's largest faction after the death of former prime minister Keizo Obuchi. His enthusiasm for improving the nation's finances is also back in fashion. Successive administrations' attempts to spend their way out of recession have left Japan with one of the biggest public debts in world history. This was the central issue in the revolt last month by Koichi Kato, who demanded that the government rein back spending before the country goes bankrupt. Mr Hashimoto agrees with Mr Kato, who was formerly his right-hand man, but he refused to condone a rebellion within the LDP. Instead, he won kudos within the party for remaining loyal, while his supporters made clear that he was not entirely happy with Mr Mori. \"The prime minister may have won the no-confidence vote, but he should not make the mistake of thinking that this means we have confidence in him,\" said Hiromu Nonaka, a senior member of the Hashimoto faction. Such a comment might sound peculiar in Britain, but in Japan, prime ministers have often been more of a figurehead than a leader, while the real power is traditionally exercised behind the scenes by LDP elders.

      "bodyText": "The \"gross impropriety\" of Mohamed Al Fayed's behaviour at the time of Neil Hamilton's crushing cash for questions libel defeat was enough to invalidate the trial, the court of appeal heard today. The former MP and his wife Christine were in court to hear their lawyer Anthony Boswood QC begin a bid to set aside the jury's verdict, which concluded a vicious five week hearing a year ago. The former MP for Tatton had sued over claims made by Mr Al Fayed in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme in January 1997 that he had corruptly demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods. Mr Hamilton, who dismissed the allegations as a pack of lies, faced an estimated \u00a32m costs bill at the end of the case. Mr Al Fayed was not present today, but is expected to be called to face questioning from Mr Hamilton's lawyers over allegations that he was involved in paying \u00a310,000 for stolen legal documents, taken from rubbish bags outside the chambers of Mr Hamilton's counsel, Desmond Browne QC. Mr Boswood told Lord Phillips, the master of the rolls, Lord Justice Sedley and Lady Justice Hale that the verdict seemed to have brought finality to Mr Hamilton's \"long battle\" with the Harrods boss. \"And, in the wake of that finality, complete disaster and personal ruin for Mr Hamilton but, as you know, facts have now come to light which cast grave and we say very possibly fatal - because unresolveable - doubt on the fairness of the trial and therefore on the validity of the jury's verdict and the judge's order, \" he said. Mr Boswood added: \"We submit that the mere fact of the gross impropriety of their behaviour is sufficient to invalidate the trial.\" Mr Hamilton's QC, who at this stage is seeking permission to bring the appeal, said that the court knew that there was \"cogent and compelling evidence\" that highly confidential privileged documents were taken from Mr Browne's chambers and conveyed in return for a \"handsome cash reward and the promise of more\" to Mr Al Fayed's camp. He said that the documents were originally obtained by Benjamin Pell, who made a business of taking such material from rubbish bags of firms of solicitors and barristers, and given to a freelance journalist, Mark Hollingsworth, who had frequently worked for Mr Al Fayed. Mr Hollingsworth had, in October 1999, been engaged by Mr Al Fayed and his head of security, John Macnamara, to assist in the litigation, the court heard. It was an engagement, said Mr Boswood, which was, it seemed, kept secret from others in the Al Fayed camp - notably his legal team. Mr Hollingsworth took the documents supplied by Mr Pell to Mr Macnamara who accepted them \"gratefully\" and Mr Hollingsworth was paid \u00a310,000 in cash with the promise of a further \u00a310,000 to come, he told the court. Mr Boswood insisted that Mr Al Fayed must have known about the arrangement. \"Even if he had not been, he was manifestly not unaware of it. It's not conceivable that it could have happened without his knowledge - and even if it had, he would clearly have to assume responsibility for it as Macnamara was clearly acting on his behalf. \"That this took place - and there may well have been more than one - is not open to serious doubt,\" Mr Boswood said. Mr Boswood said Mr Al Fayed had deliberately chosen not to have Mr Hollingsworth available for cross-examination and Mr Macnamara, \"who as so often was at the centre of things\", had not denied it. \"In the face of the silence of Mr Hollingsworth and Mr Macnamara, the bare denial of Mr Al Fayed can surely carry little weight.\" He added: \"The book of bad things people have said about Mr Al Fayed is a weighty volume and it's hardly necessary for me to add to its pages.\" Mr Boswood said it should be presumed that Mr Al Fayed did make use of the material. \"It is precisely the kind of case where the law does presume, in the strongest terms, against the wrongdoer.\" He said that it was a major misrepresentation to say that the evidence about the stolen documents - which consisted of drafts of cross-examination material and witness statements - went solely to credit. \"Heavens above! It goes to demonstrate flagrant abuse of process and conduct which should have debarred Mr Al Fayed from defending the case at all.\" He submitted that if the trial judge, Mr Justice Morland, had been told of the evidence, he would in all probability have discharged the jury, investigated the matter, and then struck out Mr Al Fayed's case. Even if the trial had continued, Mr Al Fayed's credibility would have been \"truly destroyed at the very outset\". He disputed the claim that Mr Hamilton would inevitably have lost the action anyway because the outcome did not turn on anything said by Mr Al Fayed - but on the corroborative evidence of others and on the allegation that Mr Hamilton had corruptly demanded a payment from Mobil for tabling an amendment. He said that the evidence of the corroborative witnesses would have been devalued if it was known about the stolen documents and it was \"nonsense\" to suggest that the Mobil allegation was so overwhelmingly strong.

And the corporation stepped up lobbying this week for an early government go-ahead for the controversial plans. A public consultation over its proposals, which would see a pre-school channel for the under-sixes launch in June or July, has found strong public support for the plans. Up to 88% of adults back the concept of advertising-free UK-originated services, say corporation sources. However, the channel proposals are subject to industry consultation, with heavy lobbying from dedicated commercial children's networks being led by the Disney channel's Paul Robinson. This stiffer-than-expected opposition has clearly shaken the BBC. A decision from culture secretary Chris Smith, whose approval is required, is expected in the new year. The BBC's creative leader, Alan Yentob, CBBC controller Nigel Pickard, and editors of key programmes such as Blue Peter and Newsround held a reception at 4 Millbank this week to lobby for MPs' support. The event took place on the evening of the Queen's speech in the presence of inflatable character guests including Bob the Builder, Big Ears, Noddy and Postman Pat, all due to figure prominiently in the new plans. Mr Yentob and Mr Pickard point out that more than 50% of UK children live in multi-channel homes, where the electronic programme guide carries a separate children's category. A BBC statement said: \"They are being offered an endless diet of American programmes and constant repeats of American cartioons and sitcoms on predominantly US-owned channels. \"In this world of greater choice, the BBC believes children and their parents should have the option of choosing advertising-free programmes made in the UK for UK children\". The BBC points out that its investment in UK children's programmes dwarfs that of its rivals. Mr Pickard said the new channels were designed to expand choice and capitalise on domestic production. The pre-school channel is promising to screen at least 90% UK output, while the older channel will show 78%. Teletubbies, Tweenies, Noddy, Postman Pat, Fireman Sam and Angelmouse will be buttressed with new programmes based on storytelling, music, 'make-and-do' craft ideas, puzzles, factual and natural history. The older channel, which will take longer to prepare for launch, will have a twice-daily topical Newsround programme, a daily Blue Peter with spin-off formats such as Here's One I Made Earlier, and a big interactive element. It will also repeat some of the best of the corporation's archive drama, including classics such as The Tales of Narnia,The Box of Delights and The Phoenix and the Carpet. New ideas will be shared between the BBC1 and the new channels. In the longer term, BBC2 is expected to discontinue its successful breakfast time repeats, and the 6-7pm kids' zone will also go.",

It will cover two Ashes series and one World Cup.",

      "bodyText": "Murray Walker cut his teeth as a sports commentator back in 1949, covering the British Grand Prix at Silverstone for BBC Radio. From this point, the ever-growing crescendo of his high-pitched voice has been as central to the sport as the screeching of tyres on tarmac. Mr Walker was born into a family of motor-racing fanatics - his father was also a motor-racing correspondent and they worked together until Walker senior's death in 1962. However, after returning from a distinguished spell driving tanks during the second world war, he worked in advertising, where he was partly responsible for the Mars \"Work, Rest and Play\" campaign, and helped defend the market-leading bird-seed brand Trill against falling foul of the Monopolies Commission. Mr Walker left advertising to follow in his father's footsteps, leading to a career spanning almost 51 years commentating on motor-racing and particularly Formula One. In 1978 he entered the premier league of sports commentators when the BBC began televising every Grand Prix race, and Mr Walker's name and voice became synonymous with the BBC's coverage. Formula One rights owner Bernie Ecclestone once gave Mr Walker a gold tie-pin, proclaiming that he \"was the BBC\". His coverage of racing has been characterised by three things; his knowledge; his high-pitched voice, which becomes more excited as the tension on the track mounts; and his propensity for verbal gaffes. Dubbed Muddly Talker, his more nonsensical remarks knock George W Bush and Danforth Quayle into a cocked hat. These included \"I imagine that the conditions in those cars today are totally unimaginable,\" and \"The atmosphere is so tense you could cut it with a cricket stump\".

      "trailText": "<p>Trinity Mirror is launching a showbiz website that will have no qualms about scooping its own newspapers. But can it succeed where others failed? <strong>Jessica Hodgson</strong> reports. \n</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> OK! magazine's injunction on Hello! in the Douglas/Zeta Jones pictures row could become an anachronism if the hunger for showbiz gossip starts to creep into cyberspace. If your rival has beaten you to the big picture exclusive, all you have to do is publish online. At least that's the hope that Trinity Mirror executives are pinning on their new showbiz website, <a href=\"http://www.icShowbiz.com\">icShowbiz</a>. </p> <p>icShowbiz.com is the second of Trinity Mirror's portals within the ic network, and the first major marketing splash for any of the websites within the network. For Rebecca St Johnston, managing director of content, it's a case of filling a \"gaping hole\" in the UK market. \"Sites such as <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com\">Eonline</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mrshowbiz.com\">Mr Showbiz</a> are immensely popular in the US. Some sites here focus exhaustively on film or music and others take the view that celebrity means the upper-crust celebrity gossip column circuit. But there hasn't been a compelling celebrity gossip site in the UK until now.\"</p> <p>icShowbiz.com apes the successful stateside gossip sites rather than Trinity Mirror's newspaper brands. The 3AM column is there, with a Daily Record gossip section called Off The Record and Charlie Catchpole's TV reviews. There are bespoke columns from Jonathan Ross, therapist to the stars Susan Quilliam, and extra content from Mirror writers such as Jessica Mellor and Ian Hyland, and the People's Sean O'Brien. But, stylistically, icShowbiz.com borrows more from OK! and Hello! than the newspapers.</p> <p>Jane Procter, managing director of gossip website <a href=\"http://www.peoplenews.com\">Peoplenews</a>, and Tatler editor for nine years, has also staked her livelihood on the belief that the desire for celebrity gossip in magazines and newspapers will translate to cyberspace. Procter is something of a celebrity gossip evangelist. \"Research shows that 40% of people between 20 and 30 would postpone their own wedding to go to a celebrity party. They say because we haven't got a cold war on, all people care about is Catherine Zeta-Jones.\"</p> <p>Procter says the \"epiphany\" that brought home the importance of the internet in the showbiz wars was the announcement of Madonna's pregnancy earlier this year. \"I remember thinking 'If the Sun has got it and they're putting it on the web at 2.40 in the afternoon then they've obviously taken a calculated decision that it's not going to damage sales'\".</p> <p>St Johnston and Trinity Mirror Digital's managing director, David Clarke, feel that the ability to update the site 24 hours a day gives them a unique ability to capitalise on readers' interest in the day's breaking celebrity news.</p> <p>\"There's no limit to the amount of space we use,\" says St Johnston. \"So if the Mirror is running a picture exclusive on a 12-page feature, they may only be able to run two pages of pictures - in which case we can run the rest.\" She adds that icShowbiz.com is prepared to fight for the right to break big showbiz exclusives on the site, at the risk of scooping the Trinity Mirror national papers.</p> <p>It's worth noting that in spite of Procter's optimism about the market for celebrity gossip, Peoplenews axed its chief executive, Kelly Moulton, two editorial staff and several technical staff in November. Although she claims the venture is on target to make profit very soon, there is speculation that funding may have dried up.</p> <p>Johnston also believes developments in mobile services will dovetail nicely with the growing appetite for gossip. \"People waiting for the bus want something to fill in the time. Mobile is the ultimate time killer.\" </p> <p>Trinity Mirror's huge regional newspaper network, with access to the archives of papers including the Daily Record and Scottish Mail, the Birmingham Post and Mail, and Liverpool Echo, adds opportunities not just for compelling local content but for e-commerce partnerships. \"If you want to find out where your nearest ATM is, or you want to book a table at a Chinese restaurant, mobile is excellent, and we can provide really compelling local content.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ic24.net\">ic24</a> has excellent mapping and directory facilities, allowing users, for example, to look for cinema listings for their area, then search for an online map and directions for how to get there from their home address.</p> <p>But whether this strategy will translate itself into online audiences, and more importantly, online revenues, remains to be seen. Ben Hedges, former head of sales for what was Trinity Mirror New Media and now managing director for new media training consultancy It Counts, adds that although celebrity is a big audience pull, it doesn't necessarily translate into cash.</p> <p>\"I can see there's a good argument for having 24-hour, constantly updated information about showbiz online. But at the end of the day, if I've got an update on what Posh and Becks are calling their next baby - so what? How are you going to make money from that? OK! and Hello! have built their success on appealing to very aspirational, lifestyle advertisers who aren't interested in online at the moment.\"</p> <p>In the wake of high-profile dot.com failures many newspaper groups have retreated from previously bullish internet strategies, cutting back online operations to the point where many have little more than an online marketing presence.</p> <p>And with the exception of <a href=\"http://www.megastar.co.uk\">Mega Star</a>, now floating in a no-man's land in United Business Media amid speculation that it may be sold off, there's little competition from Trinity Mirror's tabloid rivals.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror was the last of the big newspaper groups to jump into the digital fray. Earlier this year, it trumpeted a \u00a3150m investment into ic24, an ISP which aims to be the \"people's doorway to the internet\", a friendly, handholding service with a one-size-fits-all brand.</p> <p>Last month Trinity Mirror unveiled the first of its long-touted portals, <a href=\"http://www.icscotland.com\">icScotland</a>. The 16 promised when the investment was announced have dwindled to four, with icSports, icChoice and icRegional to follow next year. </p> <p>But after the spectacular rise and fall of Currantbun.com and the ensuing chaos of News International's digital strategy, the logic of launching another \"welcome to the internet\" portal is being questioned. Clarke defends the strategy. \"We have to be able to provide everything we want in one set of sites,\" he says.</p> <p>The silence from Trinity Mirror's key competitors in this space, News International and Express Newspapers, is deafening. No one from News International would speak to the Guardian about the company's online operations. </p> <p>But one anonymous News International executive is sceptical about Trinity Mirror's strategy. \"I'd question the viability of any content-driven website relying on advertising revenue,\" he says. \"News International's online presence is purely a marketing tool - we want to encourage people to buy the papers. The Trinity Mirror strategy is to create a new online brand and generate revenue.\"</p> <p>Given News International's failure to capitalise on its early lead in online plus rumours that auction site <a href=\"http://www.firedup.com\">Fired up</a> and recruitment service <a href=\"http://www.revolver.com\">Revolver</a> are facing the axe, this could be seen as sour grapes. But people who know how advertisers behave online are also dubious about Trinity Mirror's approach.</p> <p>Nick Suckley, managing director of digital media agency Beyond Interactive (formerly Media21) believes Trinity Mirror is missing a trick by failing to use its best asset - its newspaper brands. \"You have to ask 'What does the Daily Mirror stand for?' and everyone will have a view on that. Instead they're saying 'Let's launch into a very competitive market with a product no one's heard of.' There's a lot of consumer goodwill towards the Mirror but they're not capitalising on it.\"</p> <p>Clarke is adamant that Trinity Mirror has to look at the longer haul and invest in a coherent online brand. \"If we went down the road of having newspaper branded sites all the sites would look different to the different sets of users,\" he says. \"The demographics of the Mirror - which is our best-known brand - don't fit the demographics of online users. At the moment most users are ABC1, although that is going to change. The Mirror's audience is largely C2.\"</p> <p>He adds that for Trinity Mirror's business model - split revenues from advertising and e-commerce but with advertising initially accounting for over 90% - it's important to be able to sell across a network of identically-branded sites. \"We have seen from examples in the US that the bigger advertising and e-commerce deals migrate to the people with the biggest volume of traffic. Independent sites tend to struggle if you take them out of the larger mix.\"</p> <p>He concludes that only when the network of sites is up and running will Trinity Mirror be able to make a decision on whether the approach has been successful, although he is adamant that the business will be in profit when the funding runs out at the end of 2002.</p>",

      "bodyText": "OK! magazine's injunction on Hello! in the Douglas/Zeta Jones pictures row could become an anachronism if the hunger for showbiz gossip starts to creep into cyberspace. If your rival has beaten you to the big picture exclusive, all you have to do is publish online. At least that's the hope that Trinity Mirror executives are pinning on their new showbiz website, icShowbiz. icShowbiz.com is the second of Trinity Mirror's portals within the ic network, and the first major marketing splash for any of the websites within the network. For Rebecca St Johnston, managing director of content, it's a case of filling a \"gaping hole\" in the UK market. \"Sites such as Eonline and Mr Showbiz are immensely popular in the US. Some sites here focus exhaustively on film or music and others take the view that celebrity means the upper-crust celebrity gossip column circuit. But there hasn't been a compelling celebrity gossip site in the UK until now.\" icShowbiz.com apes the successful stateside gossip sites rather than Trinity Mirror's newspaper brands. The 3AM column is there, with a Daily Record gossip section called Off The Record and Charlie Catchpole's TV reviews. There are bespoke columns from Jonathan Ross, therapist to the stars Susan Quilliam, and extra content from Mirror writers such as Jessica Mellor and Ian Hyland, and the People's Sean O'Brien. But, stylistically, icShowbiz.com borrows more from OK! and Hello! than the newspapers. Jane Procter, managing director of gossip website Peoplenews, and Tatler editor for nine years, has also staked her livelihood on the belief that the desire for celebrity gossip in magazines and newspapers will translate to cyberspace. Procter is something of a celebrity gossip evangelist. \"Research shows that 40% of people between 20 and 30 would postpone their own wedding to go to a celebrity party. They say because we haven't got a cold war on, all people care about is Catherine Zeta-Jones.\" Procter says the \"epiphany\" that brought home the importance of the internet in the showbiz wars was the announcement of Madonna's pregnancy earlier this year. \"I remember thinking 'If the Sun has got it and they're putting it on the web at 2.40 in the afternoon then they've obviously taken a calculated decision that it's not going to damage sales'\". St Johnston and Trinity Mirror Digital's managing director, David Clarke, feel that the ability to update the site 24 hours a day gives them a unique ability to capitalise on readers' interest in the day's breaking celebrity news. \"There's no limit to the amount of space we use,\" says St Johnston. \"So if the Mirror is running a picture exclusive on a 12-page feature, they may only be able to run two pages of pictures - in which case we can run the rest.\" She adds that icShowbiz.com is prepared to fight for the right to break big showbiz exclusives on the site, at the risk of scooping the Trinity Mirror national papers. It's worth noting that in spite of Procter's optimism about the market for celebrity gossip, Peoplenews axed its chief executive, Kelly Moulton, two editorial staff and several technical staff in November. Although she claims the venture is on target to make profit very soon, there is speculation that funding may have dried up. Johnston also believes developments in mobile services will dovetail nicely with the growing appetite for gossip. \"People waiting for the bus want something to fill in the time. Mobile is the ultimate time killer.\" Trinity Mirror's huge regional newspaper network, with access to the archives of papers including the Daily Record and Scottish Mail, the Birmingham Post and Mail, and Liverpool Echo, adds opportunities not just for compelling local content but for e-commerce partnerships. \"If you want to find out where your nearest ATM is, or you want to book a table at a Chinese restaurant, mobile is excellent, and we can provide really compelling local content.\" ic24 has excellent mapping and directory facilities, allowing users, for example, to look for cinema listings for their area, then search for an online map and directions for how to get there from their home address. But whether this strategy will translate itself into online audiences, and more importantly, online revenues, remains to be seen. Ben Hedges, former head of sales for what was Trinity Mirror New Media and now managing director for new media training consultancy It Counts, adds that although celebrity is a big audience pull, it doesn't necessarily translate into cash. \"I can see there's a good argument for having 24-hour, constantly updated information about showbiz online. But at the end of the day, if I've got an update on what Posh and Becks are calling their next baby - so what? How are you going to make money from that? OK! and Hello! have built their success on appealing to very aspirational, lifestyle advertisers who aren't interested in online at the moment.\" In the wake of high-profile dot.com failures many newspaper groups have retreated from previously bullish internet strategies, cutting back online operations to the point where many have little more than an online marketing presence. And with the exception of Mega Star, now floating in a no-man's land in United Business Media amid speculation that it may be sold off, there's little competition from Trinity Mirror's tabloid rivals. Trinity Mirror was the last of the big newspaper groups to jump into the digital fray. Earlier this year, it trumpeted a \u00a3150m investment into ic24, an ISP which aims to be the \"people's doorway to the internet\", a friendly, handholding service with a one-size-fits-all brand. Last month Trinity Mirror unveiled the first of its long-touted portals, icScotland. The 16 promised when the investment was announced have dwindled to four, with icSports, icChoice and icRegional to follow next year. But after the spectacular rise and fall of Currantbun.com and the ensuing chaos of News International's digital strategy, the logic of launching another \"welcome to the internet\" portal is being questioned. Clarke defends the strategy. \"We have to be able to provide everything we want in one set of sites,\" he says. The silence from Trinity Mirror's key competitors in this space, News International and Express Newspapers, is deafening. No one from News International would speak to the Guardian about the company's online operations. But one anonymous News International executive is sceptical about Trinity Mirror's strategy. \"I'd question the viability of any content-driven website relying on advertising revenue,\" he says. \"News International's online presence is purely a marketing tool - we want to encourage people to buy the papers. The Trinity Mirror strategy is to create a new online brand and generate revenue.\" Given News International's failure to capitalise on its early lead in online plus rumours that auction site Fired up and recruitment service Revolver are facing the axe, this could be seen as sour grapes. But people who know how advertisers behave online are also dubious about Trinity Mirror's approach. Nick Suckley, managing director of digital media agency Beyond Interactive (formerly Media21) believes Trinity Mirror is missing a trick by failing to use its best asset - its newspaper brands. \"You have to ask 'What does the Daily Mirror stand for?' and everyone will have a view on that. Instead they're saying 'Let's launch into a very competitive market with a product no one's heard of.' There's a lot of consumer goodwill towards the Mirror but they're not capitalising on it.\" Clarke is adamant that Trinity Mirror has to look at the longer haul and invest in a coherent online brand. \"If we went down the road of having newspaper branded sites all the sites would look different to the different sets of users,\" he says. \"The demographics of the Mirror - which is our best-known brand - don't fit the demographics of online users. At the moment most users are ABC1, although that is going to change. The Mirror's audience is largely C2.\" He adds that for Trinity Mirror's business model - split revenues from advertising and e-commerce but with advertising initially accounting for over 90% - it's important to be able to sell across a network of identically-branded sites. \"We have seen from examples in the US that the bigger advertising and e-commerce deals migrate to the people with the biggest volume of traffic. Independent sites tend to struggle if you take them out of the larger mix.\" He concludes that only when the network of sites is up and running will Trinity Mirror be able to make a decision on whether the approach has been successful, although he is adamant that the business will be in profit when the funding runs out at the end of 2002.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Preliminary visit</strong><br>My contract in Herat - a Taliban-controlled region of western Afghanistan - is with UK charity Ockenden International and follows my year working as a GP in Islamabad. Herat is suffering its worst drought in living memory and I am one of a team working to ensure that Ockenden's emergency aid reaches the people who need it most.</p> <p>I first went to Herat three weeks ago with Stuart Templeton, who is overseeing Ockenden International's relief programme. The programme is aiming to prevent this drought developing into a major crisis. If it is not successful, so much good work will be undone in a country whose people have already suffered so much.</p> <p>This first visit was filled with frustration. Most of the time was spent trying to find an Afghan woman with whom to work. I failed. I did meet a number of women who would have been great, but the Afghan authorities have very strict rules on women working and it is very difficult to overcome these. The women themselves, of course, are also nervous of breaking the law.</p> <p>Even if one of the women I met did agree to work with me, she would have been unable to come to the office or travel with me in an Ockenden vehicle. And she would have to be accompanied by a male relative aged over 15. The logistics would have been a nightmare, so I soon realised I would have to go it alone, getting help along the way.</p> <p>Indeed, if a woman is from an educated family still living in Herat, there is little chance of her having any unemployed male relatives who would be able to accompany her. Ockenden (and the other agencies working here) all say how difficult it is to recruit skilled personnel in Herat. As well as the shortage of resources such as water, electricity, gas and petrol, skills are also in short supply, hindering the development and rejuvenation of Afghanistan.</p> <p>During my first visit I was able to talk to a number of women in their homes. That's the real privilege of being a foreign woman in Afghanistan - you get to see a little bit of both \"sides\". I also met one young woman at her English class. The English teacher had been suggested as a possible woman to work with, but it came to nothing. However, one of her students expressed an interest so I went to the class to meet her. But I did not expect to hold our rather covert conversation in front of the rest of the class - who thought it would be a good way to practise their English! But then this was Afghanistan, and stranger things happen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Preliminary visit My contract in Herat - a Taliban-controlled region of western Afghanistan - is with UK charity Ockenden International and follows my year working as a GP in Islamabad. Herat is suffering its worst drought in living memory and I am one of a team working to ensure that Ockenden's emergency aid reaches the people who need it most. I first went to Herat three weeks ago with Stuart Templeton, who is overseeing Ockenden International's relief programme. The programme is aiming to prevent this drought developing into a major crisis. If it is not successful, so much good work will be undone in a country whose people have already suffered so much. This first visit was filled with frustration. Most of the time was spent trying to find an Afghan woman with whom to work. I failed. I did meet a number of women who would have been great, but the Afghan authorities have very strict rules on women working and it is very difficult to overcome these. The women themselves, of course, are also nervous of breaking the law. Even if one of the women I met did agree to work with me, she would have been unable to come to the office or travel with me in an Ockenden vehicle. And she would have to be accompanied by a male relative aged over 15. The logistics would have been a nightmare, so I soon realised I would have to go it alone, getting help along the way. Indeed, if a woman is from an educated family still living in Herat, there is little chance of her having any unemployed male relatives who would be able to accompany her. Ockenden (and the other agencies working here) all say how difficult it is to recruit skilled personnel in Herat. As well as the shortage of resources such as water, electricity, gas and petrol, skills are also in short supply, hindering the development and rejuvenation of Afghanistan. During my first visit I was able to talk to a number of women in their homes. That's the real privilege of being a foreign woman in Afghanistan - you get to see a little bit of both \"sides\". I also met one young woman at her English class. The English teacher had been suggested as a possible woman to work with, but it came to nothing. However, one of her students expressed an interest so I went to the class to meet her. But I did not expect to hold our rather covert conversation in front of the rest of the class - who thought it would be a good way to practise their English! But then this was Afghanistan, and stranger things happen.",

In a 505-channel world we're a big, mainstream channel. If you look at what the US networks get in terms of audience share, we'd be a network. Millionaire in America gets a 20% share, Weakest Link gets a 36% share here. So it means rethinking ourselves as a big, important part of broadcasting, rather than being on the edge, which is how we used to think of ourselves. </p> <p> <strong> Which programmes fit the changing BBC2?</strong> </p> <p> We've had an incredibly successful autumn: Horizon, History of Britain, Andes to Amazons, What the Romans Did for Us, Home Front, Jamie Oliver, Gardener's World. The piece are all there. We're not looking at a radically different BBC2, but one that is clear about what it's aiming at. </p> <p> <strong> What about alternative comedy?</strong> </p> <p> BBC2 will continue to run new comedy, with more of an eye on transfers to BBC1. BBC2 has arguably launched more ground-breaking entertainment than any other channel - Monty Python, Not the Nine O'Clock News, Ab Fab, Mrs Merton, The Royle Family - and that will continue to be our job. </p> <p> <strong> But a lot of your top comedy - The League of Gentlemen, Never Mind the Buzzcocks - appeals to the under-35s.</strong> </p> <p> No it doesn't. League of Gentlemen's core audience is in its 30s and older. It's not a youth show by any means. Never Mind the Buzzcocks doesn't work for people in their 20s: the bands they talk about have a nostalgia factor. It's not a youth show. Jamie Oliver is loved by women in their 40s, 50s, 60s, though there's a 20-year-old audience there as well. Alan Partridge stays; Coupling, Gimme Gimme, they're clever, sophisticated. What you won't get is late-night raucous strands, the tits-and-bums programmes that Channel 4 does. Channel 4 and BBC2 are going in different directions. Channel 4's biggest audience gains are among the young - they've made huge leaps in the 16-24 age group. Stuart Murphy [who runs BBC Choice, to be rebranded BBC3] will think youth niche. We don't want programmes that say, \"Go away if you're over 25.\" </p> <p> <strong> Was it galling to be stripped of your most successful show, Have I Got News for You?</strong> </p> <p> Not at all. The biggest problem you have on BBC2 is that you have a lot of very successful long-running programmes which give you little room for manoeuvre.

And what happens to the children's programmes, The Simpsons, Star Trek?</strong> </p> <p> The BBC is still thinking about the long-term future of children's programmes, and is hoping to launch two new channels. Again, it's not about the next three years. It's a transition. We can't suddenly take something like Robot Wars away from terrestrial viewers, there would be a riot. We'll see how fast digital take-up happens. </p> <p><strong> Will you survive the transition as controller of BBC2? You've had a hurtful autumn, awash with rumours about your position.</strong> </p> <p> When you're thinking hard about where you're taking a channel, you have to do a lot of tough talking. There were leaked documents, focus groups, research. Being a television controller is about being decisive, forward-looking, and not about recommissioning every programme people would like to recommission. </p> <p> <strong> What are you doing with factual programmes? It seems history is on almost every night of the week.</strong> </p> <p> We're looking at that. Friday night will be our history zone.

You can see the enthusiasm in the ratings. </p> <p> <strong> So what happens to Saturday night, the old History Zone?</strong> </p> <p> The 70s nights worked really well, they attracted 3.5m. In the New Year, we start on 80s nights. Many of my friends who find themselves at home with small children on Saturdays tell me the 70s nights saved their marriages. </p> <p> <strong> You've won an extra \u00a325m a year in spending. Where is it going?</strong> </p> <p> The lion's share will go on big factual series, for example, How to Build a Human Being, which looks at near- future technology using digital techniques. Also, Land of Plenty is a classic example of the new drama for BBC2. Big, bold, enjoyable drama, 10 parts. Stephen Poliakoff's forthcoming Family Tree, and a new series, The Men Who Changed Football, fit with the new strategy.

BBC2 is a more natural home for arts, too. </p> <p> <strong> What is BBC2 doing to cater for minority groups?</strong> </p> <p> We could, we should and we're trying very hard to do more.

The company, which owns 25% of UK rival Telewest, has sunk into the red owing to an ambitious expansion strategy, which has seen it establish cable networks in 17 countries. Market confidence in the company has been damaged by fears over the company's debt situation and the collapse of a planned merger between its Chello broadband business and internet portal Excite@Home.

      "body": "<b> What was the main issue? </b> <br>How the EU makes its decisions has always been fraught with controversy. Contrary to what the Europhobes say, real power in the Union is vested not in the european commission in Brussels, but in the national capitals. When the old EEC was formed, important decisions were made unanimously by the six founder states. As the community expanded, the national governments grudgingly moved to a system of qualified majority voting (QMV) to prevent logjams of unresolved business. <p><b> How does it work? </b><br>Each member state has a number of votes, based roughly on their populations. Up to now the big four powers, Germany, Britain, France and Italy, each had 10 votes. The others had fewer, but even tiny Luxembourg had the minimum three votes. That meant that the smaller states, if they ganged up on the big ones, could block any new legislation they found offensive. </p> <p><b> Did it work well?</b><br>After a fashion. The big players were generally able to recruit enough of the small fry to push through their favourite projects, while the smaller nations had the diplomatic comfort of knowing they could not be coerced against their will. And in most areas judged vital to national interests, all member states could fall back on their jealously guarded national veto. </p> <p><b> If it wasn't broke, why did they fix it?</b><br>Because the EU is poised for another big expansion, with no fewer than 12 new members wanting to join the existing 15. If all new members were given votes on the current weighting, the system would have ground to a halt. Also, Germany has been growling for years that because it has had more than 80m citizens since reunification, it should have more votes than France, Italy and Britain, which each have around 60m. </p> <p><b> Sounds fair - did they get their way?</b><br>Non. Sorry, no. The French were adamantly opposed. They see the Franco-German axis is the main pillar of Europe, but they insist it must be a partnership of equals. Their sensitivity on the subject is informed, of course, by the collective memory of two 20th century German invasions. </p> <p><b> So what did they come up with? </b><br>A rather ingenious formula which reapportions voting power, eroding some of the influence of the smaller countries but still giving them proportionally more influence than their size merits. The new system gives Germany, France, Italy and Britain 29 votes each. Spain will have 27 votes; the Netherlands, 13; Greece, Belgium and Portugal, 12; Sweden and Austria, 10; Denmark, Finland and Ireland, seven, and Luxembourg, four. The smaller countries are not best pleased. Belgium and Portugal in particular fear their voices could be drowned out in future negotiations. But they have gone along with the new formula in the knowledge that they will soon have new allies with a vested interest in protecting the cause of the smaller member states. </p> <p><b> Ah yes, what of the new members? </b><br>They have already been allocated their voting strengths. Poland, the biggest applicant by far, will have 18 votes. Romania will have 14; the Czech Republic and Hungary, 11; Bulgaria, nine; Slovakia and Lithuania, seven; and Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus and Malta, three each. </p> <p><b> Is the expansion cut and dried?</b><br>Not exactly. The applicant states, which are already deeply miffed about being kept hanging around on the EU doorstep, will have to endure years more detailed negotiations over the terms of entry, and years more after that of what Brussels laughably calls \"convergence\". But the process is now at least firmly under way, setting the stage for a Union stretching from the Atlantic to the borders of Belarus and Ukraine that will eliminate the last vestiges of Europe's Cold War division. </p> <p><b> Surely such a huge enterprise will have to dispense with the national veto? </b><br>You'd think so, but Tony Blair for one sees it differently. He fought tooth and nail during the marathon summit to retain Britain's \"sovereign\" power over taxation and social security. And he won - though he did agree to QMV on a raft of other, mostly piffling, areas of policymaking. </p> <p><b> Where does the European commission stand on all this? </b><br>As usual, on the sidelines. If there is one thing that unites the Council of Ministers, it is that their fixed belief the commission must never get too big for its boots. Obviously, with a putative membership of 27, the Brussels bureaucracy is set to burgeon (the translation and interpretation service, on its own, will be a mega-industry). The bigger four countries, ever wary of any empire-building in Brussels, have agreed to give up their right to appoint two commissioners. From 2005, each will send just one big cat to Brussels. The smaller fry will have to wait their turn to fill the remaining seats, on a rotation basis. </p> <p><b> And the European parliament? </b><br>As ever, it will be collectively puce with rage that it has still been given nothing useful to do. But expansion means lots more MEPs, with Germany, as a sop to its argument that size matters, having the biggest representation. </p> <p><b> Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eu\">Special report: European integration</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eurocommission/\">Special report: the European commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/europarl/\">Special report: the European parliament</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/EMU/\">Special report: economic and monetary union</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">European integration</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,408176,00.html\">The issue explained: Nice summit</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409661,00.html\">11 December: A long, long weekend on the Med</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409489,00.html\">11 December, analysis: Realpolitik rules</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409700,00.html\">11 December, leader: Naughty at Nice</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.europa.eu.int/index-en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Europa (European Union home page)</a><br> <a href=\" http://europa.eu.int/comm/nice_council/index_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Official site: Nice summit</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/index_en.htm\" target=\"-&quot;_new&quot;\">European commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.europarl.eu.int/home/default_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">European parliament</a><br> <a href=\"http://ue.eu.int/en/summ.htm\" target=\"_new\">Council of the European Union</a><br> <a href=\"http://curia.eu.int/en/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">European court of justice</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/en/record/mt/top.html\" target=\"_new\">Maastricht treaty (February 1992)</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/abc/obj/treaties/en/entoc05.htm\" target=\"_new\">Treaty of Rome (establishing the European Community, March 1957)</a></p> <p><b>European newspapers</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr\" target=\"_new\">Le Monde</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.lesoir.be/\" target=\"_new\">Le Soir</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/\" target=\"_new\">S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.elpais.es/\" target=\"_new\">El Pais</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.lastampa.it/\" target=\"_new\">La Stampa</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.aftonbladet.se/\" target=\"_new\">Aftonbladet</a></p>",

The applicant states, which are already deeply miffed about being kept hanging around on the EU doorstep, will have to endure years more detailed negotiations over the terms of entry, and years more after that of what Brussels laughably calls \"convergence\". But the process is now at least firmly under way, setting the stage for a Union stretching from the Atlantic to the borders of Belarus and Ukraine that will eliminate the last vestiges of Europe's Cold War division. Surely such a huge enterprise will have to dispense with the national veto? You'd think so, but Tony Blair for one sees it differently. He fought tooth and nail during the marathon summit to retain Britain's \"sovereign\" power over taxation and social security. And he won - though he did agree to QMV on a raft of other, mostly piffling, areas of policymaking. Where does the European commission stand on all this? As usual, on the sidelines. If there is one thing that unites the Council of Ministers, it is that their fixed belief the commission must never get too big for its boots. Obviously, with a putative membership of 27, the Brussels bureaucracy is set to burgeon (the translation and interpretation service, on its own, will be a mega-industry). The bigger four countries, ever wary of any empire-building in Brussels, have agreed to give up their right to appoint two commissioners. From 2005, each will send just one big cat to Brussels. The smaller fry will have to wait their turn to fill the remaining seats, on a rotation basis. And the European parliament? As ever, it will be collectively puce with rage that it has still been given nothing useful to do. But expansion means lots more MEPs, with Germany, as a sop to its argument that size matters, having the biggest representation.

It puts us in a far stronger position.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair said the UK had willingly agreed to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in 23 key policy areas where it was to Britain's advantage - but had held firm on taxation and social security to protect Britain's \"national interest\".</p> <p>Mr Blair added: \"Ever since I became prime minister, at every single summit I have attended there have been dire warnings of disasters that would befall us.</p> <p>\"When we came to this summit we were told we would lose on defence, lose on social security and come under pressure on tax.</p> <p>\"In fact the whole of this summit has been an exercise in getting the best out of Europe for Britain.\"</p> <p>The final Treaty of Nice, to be signed next year, leaves out all Britain's \"no-go\" areas on surrendering the veto. An agreement earlier at the meeting established plans for a European Rapid Reaction Force in line with the UK's wishes that it should not drive a wedge between the EU and Nato.</p> <p>Mr Blair is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons about the outcome of the summit later today.</p> <p>The talks - the longest ever meeting of EU leaders - had been stalled for one and half days by an increasingly bitter row over the voting strengths of many of the smaller EU countries, including those which will join in the next few years.</p> <p>Mr Blair rejected suggestions that the final outcome amounted to a stitch-up in which the bigger members retain control: \"Some people may fear this is the big countries taking charge of Europe. I don't see it like that at all. I have never seen this as big versus small.\"</p> <p>The summit agreed that future decisions by qualified majority vote would require a 73% share of the total votes, plus a 62% minimum representation of the total EU population. Smaller countries will still struggle to hold their own against the largest.</p> <p>Shadow foreign secretary Francis Maude said that he would not have agreed to sign the Nice Treaty, which he said would delay the enlargement of the EU.</p> <p>Mr Maude told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What's so disappointing about all this is it all goes in one direction.</p> <p>\"It is all more political integration, deepening and tightening the integration of Europe, which is the wrong agenda.</p> <p>\"To have more areas where the majority can impose their will on the minority is divisive [\u0085] It breeds division not unity.</p> <p>\"This has done absolutely nothing to make early enlargement of the EU possible. There is no date set for enlargement and the big thing standing in the way of enlargement - the common agricultural policy - hasn't been tackled at all.</p> <p>\"We wouldn't have signed it. We would have shown some leadership on the agenda in the previous months, which Tony Blair has signally failed to do.\"</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eu\">European integration</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/EMU/\">Economic and monetary union</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/\">European commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/\">European parliament</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">European integration</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,408176,00.html\">The issue explained: Nice summit</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409661,00.html\">11 December: A long, long weekend on the Med</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409669,00.html\">11 December: Focus turns to power split</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409692,00.html\">11 December: Sticking points - the key issues</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409489,00.html\">11 December analysis: Realpolitik rules</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu/story/0,7369,409700,00.html\">11 December leader: Naughty at Nice</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.europa.eu.int/index-en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Europa (European Union home page)</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/index_en.htm\" target=\"-&quot;_new&quot;\">European commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.europarl.eu.int/home/default_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">European parliament</a><br> <a href=\"http://ue.eu.int/en/summ.htm\" target=\"_new\">Council of the European Union</a><br> <a href=\"http://curia.eu.int/en/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">European court of justice</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/en/record/mt/top.html\" target=\"_new\">Maastricht treaty (February 1992)</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/abc/obj/treaties/en/entoc05.htm\" target=\"_new\">Treaty of Rome (establishing the European Community, March 1957)</a></p> <p><b>European newspapers</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr\" target=\"_new\">Le Monde</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.lesoir.be/\" target=\"_new\">Le Soir</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/\" target=\"_new\">S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.elpais.es/\" target=\"_new\">El Pais</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.lastampa.it/\" target=\"_new\">La Stampa</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.aftonbladet.se/\" target=\"_new\">Aftonbladet</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has hailed today's landmark deal on a new EU treaty as a major boost for Britain's interests and a turning point for Europe. Five days of talks in Nice between Mr Blair and his 14 fellow EU leaders produced a deal designed to pave the way for the union's enlargement from 15 to 27 or 28 countries, with agreement on reforms to the union's institutions and voting structures. Mr Blair claimed victory in securing the retention of the UK veto in key decision-making areas such as taxation and social security, while increasing Britain's relative voting strength in the decision-making Council of Europe. The talks, which began on Thursday evening, ended at 3.25am after a night of hectic negotiating in which the smaller countries staged a revolt against the bigger states. The debate centred on the relative weight to be given to each country's vote in the decision-making European Council, and how many nations would need to work together to block any measure they disagreed with. Big players such as the UK, Germany, France and Italy had wanted to keep a stranglehold on voting in the council, but on several occasions during the often heated negotiations the smaller nations threatened to stage a walkout to scupper the summit unless their demands were met. Mr Blair told reporters later: \"It was of course a very difficult and complicated negotiation but I'm pleased it has had an outcome which is satisfactory and paves the way for enlargement. The prime minister agreed to give up one of the UK's two commissioners in future - in exchange for a \"substantial\" reweighting of the UK's voting power. \"Ever since Britain joined the European Community, our relative voting strength has declined,\" the prime minister said. \"The advantage in this statement now is that for us that relative voting strength increases. It puts us in a far stronger position.\" Mr Blair said the UK had willingly agreed to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in 23 key policy areas where it was to Britain's advantage - but had held firm on taxation and social security to protect Britain's \"national interest\". Mr Blair added: \"Ever since I became prime minister, at every single summit I have attended there have been dire warnings of disasters that would befall us. \"When we came to this summit we were told we would lose on defence, lose on social security and come under pressure on tax. \"In fact the whole of this summit has been an exercise in getting the best out of Europe for Britain.\" The final Treaty of Nice, to be signed next year, leaves out all Britain's \"no-go\" areas on surrendering the veto. An agreement earlier at the meeting established plans for a European Rapid Reaction Force in line with the UK's wishes that it should not drive a wedge between the EU and Nato. Mr Blair is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons about the outcome of the summit later today. The talks - the longest ever meeting of EU leaders - had been stalled for one and half days by an increasingly bitter row over the voting strengths of many of the smaller EU countries, including those which will join in the next few years. Mr Blair rejected suggestions that the final outcome amounted to a stitch-up in which the bigger members retain control: \"Some people may fear this is the big countries taking charge of Europe. I don't see it like that at all. I have never seen this as big versus small.\" The summit agreed that future decisions by qualified majority vote would require a 73% share of the total votes, plus a 62% minimum representation of the total EU population. Smaller countries will still struggle to hold their own against the largest. Shadow foreign secretary Francis Maude said that he would not have agreed to sign the Nice Treaty, which he said would delay the enlargement of the EU. Mr Maude told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What's so disappointing about all this is it all goes in one direction. \"It is all more political integration, deepening and tightening the integration of Europe, which is the wrong agenda. \"To have more areas where the majority can impose their will on the minority is divisive [\u0085] It breeds division not unity. \"This has done absolutely nothing to make early enlargement of the EU possible. There is no date set for enlargement and the big thing standing in the way of enlargement - the common agricultural policy - hasn't been tackled at all. \"We wouldn't have signed it. We would have shown some leadership on the agenda in the previous months, which Tony Blair has signally failed to do.\" Related special reports European integration Economic and monetary union European commission European parliament Interactive guide European integration Related stories The issue explained: Nice summit 11 December: A long, long weekend on the Med 11 December: Focus turns to power split 11 December: Sticking points - the key issues 11 December analysis: Realpolitik rules 11 December leader: Naughty at Nice Useful links Europa (European Union home page) European commission European parliament Council of the European Union European court of justice Maastricht treaty (February 1992) Treaty of Rome (establishing the European Community, March 1957) European newspapers Le Monde Le Soir S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung El Pais La Stampa Aftonbladet",

      "bodyText": "The NHS spent between \u00a35m and \u00a38m more than it expected on impotence drugs such as Viagra last year, despite tight prescribing guidelines, the Department of Health has revealed. The government today announced plans to re-open consultation with patients and professional groups on the current prescribing regulations, which were put in place in July 1999. At that time it was estimated that the cost annually to the NHS for treating men with impotence would be between \u00a312m and \u00a314m - but figures to July 2000 show spending was about \u00a320m. Ministers originally imposed tight NHS prescribing rules, including restricting the drugs to men with certain medical conditions, and advising that doctors should limit patients to one treatment a week. But the latest figures suggest that the restrictions have not been as successful in managing the NHS patient demand for impotence treatment that the government had hoped. The consultation, which is open until February 5, 2001, is likely to re-open the controversy over whether so-called \"lifestyle\" drugs such as Viagra should be met by the NHS. The original consultation on impotence drug treatments in 1999 showed that 75 per cent of respondents favoured limits on prescribing, while 10 per cent thought it should be banned. A DoH spokesperson insisted that ministers had no view on whether the rules should be tightened but would wait for the results of the consultation, which had been promised at the time of the original decision last year. But a DoH statement said: \"These figures [the \u00a320m annual expenditure] indicate that the government was correct to have concerns about the potential resource implications of more widespread prescribing of these treatments.\" Drugs available on the NHS to treat impotence are: Viagra, Caberject, Muse and Viridal. Under existing regulations, GPs are allowed to prescribe impotence treatments on the NHS to men who they consider to be clinically impotent and suffer from a list of specific conditions. These are diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, poliomyelitis, prostate cancer, prostatectomy, radical pelvic surgery, renal failure caused by transplant or dialysis, sever pelvic injury, soinal cord injury, spina bifida or single gene neurological disease. The DoH said these limits represented \"a sensible balance between treating men with the distressing condition of impotence and protecting the resources of the NHS to deal with other patients\", for example those with cancer or heart disease. Men who fall outside the regulations have to pay for the drugs by taking out a private prescription from their GP.",

      "body": "<p>Christmas for adults is all about food; either cooking it, or eating it or both. So it's entirely in order that among the presents wrapped up under the Christmas tree in millions of households, there will be a cookery book. </p> <p>We buy millions of cookery books all year round, but especially in the run-up to Christmas. Over the next two weeks, hundreds of thousands of cookery books will be bought. Four out of Amazon's current top 10 fastest-selling titles are cookery books; three out of their seven bestsellers for the year are cookery books - interspersed only with Harry Potter. Most of these books are doorstoppers, beautifully designed and dripping with the most luscious of production values; photos to have you instantly salivating. Close-ups of that dew-crowned rocket, that cheese still bubbling from a hot oven, that chocolate cake, the crumbs so tantalising you feel you could steal one from the page and naughtily nibble. </p> <p>The mystery is who is buying these books and why. Because the evidence is that they are not buying them to cook with. Over much the same period as Delia Smith has become a multimillionaire and Jamie Oliver has been launched on his way to becoming one, the ready-made meals market has boomed, not to mention takeaways and restaurant eating. Between 1993 and 1997, sales of ready-made meals grew by 27% and the market is now worth well over \u00a31.2bn a year. The fastest-selling frozen product was complete meals with chips. </p> <p>Chilled ready-made meals - 35% increase in the past five years - go from strength to strength, reaping huge profits for supermarkets as customers fork out large sums to have someone in a vast production line cook their pasta, stir-fry or curry. We end up with the absurdity of having cookery books on the kitchen shelf as we munch a complete meal with chips in front of a TV cookery programme. </p> <p>It would be a very serious misunderstanding to think cookery books are being bought simply because people like cooking - our mothers might have done that, not so today. No, cookery books have become the favourite bedtime reading of a swath of middle England. It's foreign territory to me, owning only a dog-eared Delia Smith borrowed from my mother a decade ago and a rarely used Nigel Slater; the idea of taking either to bed seems daft. But a trawl through a bookshop, shelves groaning with Nigella Lawson, Nigel Slater, Rowley Leigh, Jamie Oliver, the River Cafe et al, was a revelation. The ambitions of these books are vast. They have gone beyond the addition of literary prowess made by a previous generation of cookery writers such as Elizabeth David and wrap cooking up with philosophy-cum-therapy plus a smattering of confessional biographical detail. Cookery books have an appeal much like The Little Book of Calm: it's the feel-good market with plenty of comforting advice on how to live your life. </p> <p>A potted version of cookery-book wisdom runs as follows. First, it's all about Passion. It seems almost obligatory for authors of cookery books to announce how passionate they are about food. Food is the one area of life in which people happily confess to being passionate; sex is much too complicated. </p> <p>Nigel Slater is evangelical on this point. \"Cooking can be as passionate, creative, life-enhancing, uplifting, satisfying and as exhilarating as anything else you can do with your life,\" he writes in his introduction to Appetite. \"If you go through life without cooking, you are missing out on something very, very special ... you are losing out on one of the greatest pleasures you can have with your clothes on.\" Cooking for others is \"one of the greatest joys known to man\" After making a pie, Lawson declares: \"I felt suffused with heady satisfaction.\" This is akin to how a 17th-century nun described a mystical vision; perhaps this is as close to claims of transcendental experience as our culture gets. </p> <p>The key principle here is to lose yourself in the experience of cooking and eating. Total absorption is the prescription. \"Get floury, sticky, wholly involved,\" writes Lawson. \"Lunch is a suspension of time and an opportunity for pure pleasure,\" advocates Rowley Leigh. Experiencing something intensely is about getting your hands dirty, kneading the dough and making a mess. It is both tactile and playful: the opposite of the computer-dominated office where virtually the only things you touch are smooth plastic, and there's no time to muck about and play because you know your targets and you're being monitored on whether you're achieving them. </p> <p>Corporate gurus claim we are moving into the experience economy and a new generation of consumers are not interested in acquiring possessions, but experiences. Food is central to the experience market and worth billions; the world is being trawled for exotic tastes and cuisines. Status is having kumquats and truffles in your fridge. Jamie Oliver is targeted perfectly at this market: the minimalist warehouse appartment and the fancy cooker. The philosophy is hedonistic: life is for pleasure, rather than purpose. Forget the political idealism and ambition of the 20th century, just snuggle down with that dreamy recipe for cheesecake. </p> <p>But all this passionate experience would be intimidating - can the reader summon up that emotional intensity? - if it wasn't mixed with two things. First, a nostalgic back to basics. This is behind the trend for seasonality; the novelty of strawberries in December has worn off as the cognoscenti turn their back on the global food market. Bad luck on the Kenyan bean farmer, but the farmers' markets are where it's at. Think local, think mud, think small scale. </p> <p>The introduction to the River Cafe Book Green (all recipes are seasonal) captures this perfectly, describing how friends and acquaintances began turning up with wild produce such as mushrooms and sorrel they had gathered from their allotments. Hunter-gatherers in London. Rick Stein has us weeping into our cod at the decline of our fishing communities. </p> <p>Second, these books are intimate. They are full of confidential chitchat. They are full of encouragement and confidence-building. \"Go on, have a try, you can do it ...\" Instead of being made to feel inadequate in a consumer culture of perfect bodies and fast-changing technological gadgetry, we have these nice people like Ainsley Harriott on our side. Lawson knows all about this: in line with her other mystical leanings, she makes it clear that she wants you to feel she is with you. In the introduction to How To Eat, she writes: \"I have tried to talk you through a recipe as much as possible. I have wanted to make you feel that I am there, with you in the kitchen as you cook. The book that follows is a conversation we might be having.\" </p> <p>No wonder such books have become a substitute for bedtime prayers. They lay claim to a kind of innocent experience in an otherwise cynical world, offering uplifting visions of pleasure for the future. The reality is, of course, no such thing. It is BSE, bankrupt farmers, rising incidence of obesity and millions of complete meals with chips. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Food is central to the experience market and worth billions; the world is being trawled for exotic tastes and cuisines. Status is having kumquats and truffles in your fridge. Jamie Oliver is targeted perfectly at this market: the minimalist warehouse appartment and the fancy cooker. The philosophy is hedonistic: life is for pleasure, rather than purpose. Forget the political idealism and ambition of the 20th century, just snuggle down with that dreamy recipe for cheesecake. But all this passionate experience would be intimidating - can the reader summon up that emotional intensity? - if it wasn't mixed with two things. First, a nostalgic back to basics. This is behind the trend for seasonality; the novelty of strawberries in December has worn off as the cognoscenti turn their back on the global food market. Bad luck on the Kenyan bean farmer, but the farmers' markets are where it's at. Think local, think mud, think small scale. The introduction to the River Cafe Book Green (all recipes are seasonal) captures this perfectly, describing how friends and acquaintances began turning up with wild produce such as mushrooms and sorrel they had gathered from their allotments. Hunter-gatherers in London. Rick Stein has us weeping into our cod at the decline of our fishing communities. Second, these books are intimate. They are full of confidential chitchat. They are full of encouragement and confidence-building. \"Go on, have a try, you can do it ...\" Instead of being made to feel inadequate in a consumer culture of perfect bodies and fast-changing technological gadgetry, we have these nice people like Ainsley Harriott on our side. Lawson knows all about this: in line with her other mystical leanings, she makes it clear that she wants you to feel she is with you. In the introduction to How To Eat, she writes: \"I have tried to talk you through a recipe as much as possible. I have wanted to make you feel that I am there, with you in the kitchen as you cook. The book that follows is a conversation we might be having.\" No wonder such books have become a substitute for bedtime prayers. They lay claim to a kind of innocent experience in an otherwise cynical world, offering uplifting visions of pleasure for the future. The reality is, of course, no such thing. It is BSE, bankrupt farmers, rising incidence of obesity and millions of complete meals with chips. madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com",

Legislative guarantees, and a formal apology, are two things Mr Howard's government steadfastly refuses to give. Reconciliation began in 1991 with calls for a treaty between the government and its indigenous citizens, and ended again on Thursday with another call for a treaty, which Mr Howard flatly rejected. Admired by some for his pragmatism and vilified by others for his lack of imagination, the Australian prime minister preaches \"practical\" reconciliation, improving Aborigines' health and employment prospects. He is suspicious of treaties, fearing they are divisive. \"You make treaties with other countries, you don't make treaties with each other,\" he once said.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was the beef stroganoff that made me decide Edward Fitzgerald QC was probably the nicest man at the English Bar. We are sitting in a cavernous hotel dining room which is serving what must be the worst buffet lunch in London. Fitzgerald suggested the place in response to my request for somewhere quiet and then looks mortified when confronted by pans of vegetables treading water. The beef looks like curly bits of old tyre scattered on rice but when the waiter crosses an acre of floor to ask how it is - there were no other customers - Fitzgerald replies, feigning enthusiasm, \"It's delicious\", in case the waiter's feelings might be hurt. </p> <p>It probably helps to be as nice as Fitzgerald if your clients include Myra Hindley and other lifers, Jon Venables (one of the two boys who killed James Bulger) various IRA prisoners - a good cross section of society's demons - if only to disarm a few critics. If you haven't heard of Fitzgerald that is most likely down to his niceness, too. He is clearly embarrassed about being interviewed at all but becomes animated at the end of the interview when he thinks of half a dozen worthier folk I might talk to (and write about instead \"if it all turns out to be rubbish; I won't be offended\") and numerous charitable organisations that \"could use a bit of a plug\". As one of the solicitors who briefs him says: \"He does 20 times more human rights work than [he names another well known barrister] but he doesn't blow his own trumpet.\" </p> <p>Hindley's former solicitor, Andrew McCooey, describes Fitzgerald as \"a legal genius\". The human rights lawyer Parvez Jabbar says: \"Not only has he helped develop to the criminal jurisprudence of the English-speaking Commonwealth, he has saved lives.\" </p> <p> When Fitzgerald won an award two years ago for his contribution to criminal justice, Lord Justice Schiemann said: \"He could have made a fortune had he chosen to devote his talents to other fields of practice.\" </p> <p> His attic room at Doughty Street chambers has the feeling of finely harnessed chaos that very clever, very busy people maintain. Vertiginous stacks of papers and ring binders line the walls. Here and there, a white tongue of A4 paper sticks out with a client's name printed in large letters. This, apparently, is a reform introduced by his personal assistant. I have the feeling Fitzgerald knew where everything was anyway. </p> <p>His path to the bar was slightly meandering, perhaps because he was not initially persuaded that it was the best way to pursue his interests in prisoners' rights and young offenders. After qualifying, he spent six months as a drama master at the approved school once attended by Derek Bentley, later his posthumous client. He returned to the bar for pupillage and then did an MPhil in criminology before being lured back to work on Caribbean death-row cases. He has been working on prisoners' rights ever since. Along the way he married Lady Antonia Fraser's daughter, Rebecca, and had three daughters. His grandfather-in-law, coincidentally, is Lord Longford, the long-term activist for Hindley. </p> <p>Fitzgerald is deeply apologetic about the fact that his duty not to discuss ongoing cases means he can't say anything much about Hindley, who is now challenging at the European Court of Human Rights the decision of successive home secretaries that, in her case, life means life. Or the Bulger case, in which Robert Thompson and Jon Venables await a decision on their application for an injunction to prevent disclosure of their identities after release. </p> <p>He is happy, however, to talk to me about lifers generally and his reasons for challenging the mandatory imposition of a life sentence in murder cases. He sees the lack of discretion over sentencing as a clumsy tool which serves neither those sentenced nor their victims. What he would like to see is a far more highly developed sentencing phase to trials with the prosecution playing an active role in calling evidence, particularly in relation to the likely future dangerousness of the defendant and the impact of the crime on the victim's family. Then judges could make informed findings on such matters which would later help parole boards. And if victims' families were seen to have an input into the sentence, some of the anger generated in high-profile cases might be defused. </p> <p>What is striking about Fitzgerald's proposals, and his views generally, is a sense of balance. He has represented the victims of crime (including Jayne Zito, whose husband was killed a by schizophrenic) as well as criminals, and his emphasis on the role of the prosecution and the rights of victims might surprise the Hindley-hating public. Nor does he deny that there are those for whom a life sentence should mean life: \"The option of indefinite detention is a necessary one because there are people whose future dangerousness is very great.\" </p> <p>What seems to underpin Fitzgerald's work is not a philosophical objection to punishment - \"expiation is OK\" - but a profound faith in the possibility of reform, particularly in the case of child offenders: \"It's a very positive thing to represent a child because they can change and do change. A child that young tends to be a totally different person 10 years down the line.\" </p> <p>It is a faith which sadly the great British public doesn't seem to share, if the hysteria generated by the likely release of Thompson and Venables is anything to go by. Even the likes of Hindley are capable of reform, as Fitzgerald told the House of Lords: \"There is no dispute that her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserving of punishment.

      "bodyText": "It was the beef stroganoff that made me decide Edward Fitzgerald QC was probably the nicest man at the English Bar. We are sitting in a cavernous hotel dining room which is serving what must be the worst buffet lunch in London. Fitzgerald suggested the place in response to my request for somewhere quiet and then looks mortified when confronted by pans of vegetables treading water. The beef looks like curly bits of old tyre scattered on rice but when the waiter crosses an acre of floor to ask how it is - there were no other customers - Fitzgerald replies, feigning enthusiasm, \"It's delicious\", in case the waiter's feelings might be hurt. It probably helps to be as nice as Fitzgerald if your clients include Myra Hindley and other lifers, Jon Venables (one of the two boys who killed James Bulger) various IRA prisoners - a good cross section of society's demons - if only to disarm a few critics. If you haven't heard of Fitzgerald that is most likely down to his niceness, too. He is clearly embarrassed about being interviewed at all but becomes animated at the end of the interview when he thinks of half a dozen worthier folk I might talk to (and write about instead \"if it all turns out to be rubbish; I won't be offended\") and numerous charitable organisations that \"could use a bit of a plug\". As one of the solicitors who briefs him says: \"He does 20 times more human rights work than [he names another well known barrister] but he doesn't blow his own trumpet.\" Hindley's former solicitor, Andrew McCooey, describes Fitzgerald as \"a legal genius\". The human rights lawyer Parvez Jabbar says: \"Not only has he helped develop to the criminal jurisprudence of the English-speaking Commonwealth, he has saved lives.\" When Fitzgerald won an award two years ago for his contribution to criminal justice, Lord Justice Schiemann said: \"He could have made a fortune had he chosen to devote his talents to other fields of practice.\" His attic room at Doughty Street chambers has the feeling of finely harnessed chaos that very clever, very busy people maintain. Vertiginous stacks of papers and ring binders line the walls. Here and there, a white tongue of A4 paper sticks out with a client's name printed in large letters. This, apparently, is a reform introduced by his personal assistant. I have the feeling Fitzgerald knew where everything was anyway. His path to the bar was slightly meandering, perhaps because he was not initially persuaded that it was the best way to pursue his interests in prisoners' rights and young offenders. After qualifying, he spent six months as a drama master at the approved school once attended by Derek Bentley, later his posthumous client. He returned to the bar for pupillage and then did an MPhil in criminology before being lured back to work on Caribbean death-row cases. He has been working on prisoners' rights ever since. Along the way he married Lady Antonia Fraser's daughter, Rebecca, and had three daughters. His grandfather-in-law, coincidentally, is Lord Longford, the long-term activist for Hindley. Fitzgerald is deeply apologetic about the fact that his duty not to discuss ongoing cases means he can't say anything much about Hindley, who is now challenging at the European Court of Human Rights the decision of successive home secretaries that, in her case, life means life. Or the Bulger case, in which Robert Thompson and Jon Venables await a decision on their application for an injunction to prevent disclosure of their identities after release. He is happy, however, to talk to me about lifers generally and his reasons for challenging the mandatory imposition of a life sentence in murder cases. He sees the lack of discretion over sentencing as a clumsy tool which serves neither those sentenced nor their victims. What he would like to see is a far more highly developed sentencing phase to trials with the prosecution playing an active role in calling evidence, particularly in relation to the likely future dangerousness of the defendant and the impact of the crime on the victim's family. Then judges could make informed findings on such matters which would later help parole boards. And if victims' families were seen to have an input into the sentence, some of the anger generated in high-profile cases might be defused. What is striking about Fitzgerald's proposals, and his views generally, is a sense of balance. He has represented the victims of crime (including Jayne Zito, whose husband was killed a by schizophrenic) as well as criminals, and his emphasis on the role of the prosecution and the rights of victims might surprise the Hindley-hating public. Nor does he deny that there are those for whom a life sentence should mean life: \"The option of indefinite detention is a necessary one because there are people whose future dangerousness is very great.\" What seems to underpin Fitzgerald's work is not a philosophical objection to punishment - \"expiation is OK\" - but a profound faith in the possibility of reform, particularly in the case of child offenders: \"It's a very positive thing to represent a child because they can change and do change. A child that young tends to be a totally different person 10 years down the line.\" It is a faith which sadly the great British public doesn't seem to share, if the hysteria generated by the likely release of Thompson and Venables is anything to go by. Even the likes of Hindley are capable of reform, as Fitzgerald told the House of Lords: \"There is no dispute that her crimes were of the utmost gravity and deserving of punishment. But there is uncontradictable evidence that she has reformed and presents no danger to society.\" Fitzgerald also makes what should be the obvious point that the law is failing child defendants when it tries under-14s in adult courts. He would like to see reforms beyond those he has already won in the Bulger case. In particular, he thinks under-14s should be tried in private and possibly without a jury. In the case of child killers there should be, he believes, complete discretion in relation to sentencing: \"There might have to be indefinite detention in some cases but the punitive element should be minimal. The sole issues should be are they reformed and are they safe and society is quite entitled to say we're not going to take any risks.\" The only death row clients Fitzgerald himself has \"lost\" are the nine Trinidadian members of the Dole Chadee drugs gang whose final appeal to the privy council was rejected last year. He is wry about the often surreal logic that informs the argument in death penalty cases. He has argued that hanging is a \"cruel and unusual\" punishment but death by lethal injection would not be, to try to prevent executions in a jurisdiction where only hanging is authorised.

      "body": "<p>Without phoning a friend, try this quiz. What do these stories which appeared in papers on November 30 suggest about education secretary David Blunkett's statements at an Institute for Public Policy Research seminar? </p> <p>1. Daily Express, under a picture of a boy laying flowers at the spot where 10-year-old Damilola Taylor died: \"Cabinet minister David Blunkett yesterday condemned the money-mad culture exemplified by TVs Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?\" 2. Daily Star, under the headline \"Blunkett 'blames quiz show'\", said he was \"at the centre of a storm last night when he appeared to link Damilola's death to TV quiz show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?\" 3. The Independent, in a story which nosed off on the Damilola killing, claimed that Blunkett \"singled out\" the quiz for \"cultivating a popular culture reminiscent of the yuppy era\". 4. The Times, again in its Damilola story, quoted Blunkett as criticising the programme. </p> <p>There is no prize because the answer is obvious. Blunkett clearly made a link between the boy's murder and the TV programme. The papers said so. It must be true. Yet it was far from the truth. Before his prepared speech, Blunkett did indeed refer to Damilola's killing, urging the creation of a society in which people don't walk on by when confronted by trouble. He then delivered his prepared text about the relationship between government and people, before a question-and-answer session. The first question was about the influence of consumer capitalism to which Blunkett replied: \"In the 80s, yuppyism was seen as being the end of civilisation. We are back to Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? now. The people who produce programmes have a pretty low view of the rest of the world.\" This somewhat flip, but quite reasonable, response had nothing whatsoever to do with Blunkett's views on the murder of Damilola. Yet the Press Association report wired to newspapers made just that link. By juxtaposing his remarks on Damilola with those on the TV quiz, it looked as if he was suggesting that the programme was somehow responsible for the killing. </p> <p>Alerted to the error during the afternoon, Blunkett's office contacted PA and urged the agency to amend its report. It later did so, filing a substitute story which deleted references to Damilola. By now, a reporter had also contacted the show's presenter, Chris Tarrant, to obtain his comments. But these, of course, were based on the false assumption of Blunkett's linkage between the death and the show. To make matters worse, PA's substitute was not accompanied by a note ordering the previous story to be killed, so some newspapers didn't realise that Blunkett's remarks were not linked. PA news editor Jonathan Grun says: \"Directly we realised there should be no linkage we issued a new story. Blunkett's office seemed happy with that, which is why we didn't add an advisory note. Our watchwords here are 'accuracy and fairness'. The quotes were accurate. But we are happy to accept that it wasn't Mr Blunkett's intention to have his comments linked.\" </p> <p>But IPPR director Matthew Taylor, who chaired the seminar, thought the PA story \"highly tendentious\". Quite apart from the false link, the millionaire remark was an off-the-cuff reply to a question. Not a single word of Blunkett's thought-provoking speech was reported. If the story had come and gone, perhaps none of this would have mattered. Instead, as is common now in a journalistic world dominated by columnists rather than reporters, Blunkett was subjected to days of ill-informed comment. </p> <p>The Sun's Richard Littlejohn was vicious. The Daily Telegraph's Alice Thomson, the Daily Express's Martin Samuels, the News of the World's Michael Winner and the Sunday People's Sue Crawford all took Blunkett to task for making a link he had not made. Even a special PA note to editors which stated that it \"would like to make clear\" that the remarks were not linked was evidently ignored. Days later, Mick Hume in the Times was still criticising Blunkett. By now, it had featured also in the rest of the media, on BBC TV's Question Time and Radio 4's Today. Regional papers, such as the Scotsman - which accused Blunkett of \"moralistic waffle\" - had also weighed in. </p> <p>Never truer was that maxim about a lie being halfway round the world before the truth is out. Though some papers, such as the Times, later ran apologies and several others carried letters, it is highly likely that most people still believe Blunkett blamed Damilola's murder on a gameshow. </p> <p>Even if the error began at PA, it would be wrong to view the agency as the sole villain. This attitude about what constitutes a story stems from the current journalistic culture. It demeans all of us who work in newspapers. </p> <p>Perhaps it would be carrying things too far to claim that falling journalistic standards are one of the reasons for declining sales. Anyway, whatever the reason, they continued their downward path again last month, as our chart below illustrates. It is noticeable though that broadsheet papers are doing much better than the tabloids. Despite slight losses by the Daily Telegraph and the Times, the overall picture for serious daily papers is bright. </p> <p>It is too early yet to tell whether the new ownership of the Daily Express and Daily Star is having an impact, but the scale of Richard Desmond's task is clear. The Express sold only 823,432 copies at its full cover price in November compared to 2.2m sold by the Daily Mail. Of the Sundays, the figure that stands out is undoubtedly the Observer, up by 7.58% year on year. It needs to curb its quota of bulk sales, but these pale in comparison with the Independent on Sunday's 40,000-plus which account for more than 15% of its total. </p> <p>One final note about the two Sunday sports papers which have done so well. Sport First enjoyed its fifth successive sales increase, up to 85,775 copies. The Non-League Paper also sold a creditable 42,216.</p> <p>\u0095 Source: ABC</p>",

      "body": "<p>At a recent television press junket in the United States the first topic on everyone's lips was, of course, the presidential election. The second was the possibility of a strike by members of the Writers Guild of America, not to mention the possibility that actors might turn tail at the studio gates if their unions, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, are so mandated. </p> <p>If that happens a host of American series might vanish from our screens. We're talking ER, we're talking The Sopranos, Buffy, X Files, The Simpsons - the whole bedrock of cult and essential telly as we know it. </p> <p>On the Warner Brothers' lot in Los Angeles everyone is optimistic that it will all blow over, while simultaneously furrowing their brows and cranking their production schedules into overdrive. The story is much the same over at Fox, where the traditional hiatus periods - breaks of a week or more during the shooting periods - are under threat. </p> <p>The producer of the moment, John Wells (ER, The West Wing, Third Watch) does his best to lighten the mood: \"We're just working the writers into the ground before it happens,\" he jokes. And certainly Aaron Sorkin, the much feted writer of Wells' current hit The West Wing, is nowhere to be seen on the set. </p> <p>The actors' unions tentatively flexed their muscles last week in a first meeting with studio chief executives, and alongside the likes of Holly Hunter, Edward Norton, Tobey Maguire and Ed Asner sat a representative of the small screen, ER's Noah Wyle. If the surface mood at least is still convivial, there's no doubt that a strike could quickly cause chaos. Television production in the US is such a tight ship that a hiccup can fast develop into a major trauma. An American series run typically consists of around 22 episodes, that's six months worth of programmes, each shot in around a week. Then they come to the UK for screening, still well before the entire run has been completed. In British TV production the episodes are screened almost as soon as they are finished, with a lag of only a few weeks. </p> <p>The prospects are sad indeed: you will have no sooner completely reorganised your life around Buffy's spooky shenanigans or Dr Carter's struggle with drugs, than up will pop a voice announcing that due to unforeseen circumstances, they won't be back next week and nobody knows when they will return. </p> <p>But it won't really have been unforeseen, because anyone connected with American programming over here has been keeping a close eye on developments. </p> <p>Penny Harris, controller of acquisitions for Sky One, is frank about the potential disruption: \"If there is a strike, we will be hit, just as all the other channels will.\" She's quick to stress Sky One's increasing move into home-produced programming, but admits that for profile and popularity it is the American shows that count. </p> <p>The possibility of a strike has been a topic of much conversation between Sky One and Fox - its parent company and main supplier: \"We are keeping a close eye on developments, but we have absolute faith that Fox will get us the programmes somehow,\" says Harris. She's hopeful, but has contingency plans just in case: \"We are lucky to have a great deal of shows in stock already and, in the case of a strike, we can fall back on classic repeats.\" </p> <p>Although Harris is taking the threat seriously, Sky One is perhaps in a slightly less difficult position than the terrestrial broadcasters, particularly Channel 4. It isn't unusual, after all, for repeats to turn up mid-run on Sky - subscribers know to watch out for \"all-new episodes\". The schedules are not as flexible at C4 where large audience shares for the likes of ER and Friends are crucial, and have cost the channel a great deal of their programme budget. And the viewers of these flagship shows are not necessarily core C4 viewers who will stick around to watch alter-native scheduling. </p> <p>It's possible, of course, that C4 will follow Sky One's approach and fall back on repeats, but if the strike goes ahead and lasts for any length of time, even that could be a problem. </p> <p>Clearly, in a culture of aggressive scheduling, cards tend to be played close to the chest, and June Dromgoole, the channel's head of programme acquisitions is saying only: \"The impact on C4 will depend on the length of the strike, a relatively short strike of two to three months would have little impact. Anything longer will result in delays to our returning shows. However we have stock and contingency plans to cover this eventuality.\" </p> <p>What of the effect on its new digital channel E4, due to launch early next year? \"E4 will be less impacted by the strike than its competitors in the multi-channel environment due to the level of original programming in the schedule. E4 also has a healthy stock position.\" Harris recognises that any fall-off of US episodes will present a changed competitive scheduling environment: \"I think it will be a challenge and we'll have to look at it as an opportunity to draw in new viewers to our original programming.\" </p> <p>But it isn't only British broadcasters who are concerned about the impact any strike may have: behind closed doors the international arms of the American studios are also worried that prolonged industrial action might see them lose their established prime time slots. Should they be worried? Harris doesn't think so: \"As long as there is good US product, we will want to watch it.\"</p>",

The actors' unions tentatively flexed their muscles last week in a first meeting with studio chief executives, and alongside the likes of Holly Hunter, Edward Norton, Tobey Maguire and Ed Asner sat a representative of the small screen, ER's Noah Wyle. If the surface mood at least is still convivial, there's no doubt that a strike could quickly cause chaos. Television production in the US is such a tight ship that a hiccup can fast develop into a major trauma. An American series run typically consists of around 22 episodes, that's six months worth of programmes, each shot in around a week. Then they come to the UK for screening, still well before the entire run has been completed. In British TV production the episodes are screened almost as soon as they are finished, with a lag of only a few weeks. The prospects are sad indeed: you will have no sooner completely reorganised your life around Buffy's spooky shenanigans or Dr Carter's struggle with drugs, than up will pop a voice announcing that due to unforeseen circumstances, they won't be back next week and nobody knows when they will return. But it won't really have been unforeseen, because anyone connected with American programming over here has been keeping a close eye on developments. Penny Harris, controller of acquisitions for Sky One, is frank about the potential disruption: \"If there is a strike, we will be hit, just as all the other channels will.\" She's quick to stress Sky One's increasing move into home-produced programming, but admits that for profile and popularity it is the American shows that count. The possibility of a strike has been a topic of much conversation between Sky One and Fox - its parent company and main supplier: \"We are keeping a close eye on developments, but we have absolute faith that Fox will get us the programmes somehow,\" says Harris. She's hopeful, but has contingency plans just in case: \"We are lucky to have a great deal of shows in stock already and, in the case of a strike, we can fall back on classic repeats.\" Although Harris is taking the threat seriously, Sky One is perhaps in a slightly less difficult position than the terrestrial broadcasters, particularly Channel 4. It isn't unusual, after all, for repeats to turn up mid-run on Sky - subscribers know to watch out for \"all-new episodes\". The schedules are not as flexible at C4 where large audience shares for the likes of ER and Friends are crucial, and have cost the channel a great deal of their programme budget. And the viewers of these flagship shows are not necessarily core C4 viewers who will stick around to watch alter-native scheduling. It's possible, of course, that C4 will follow Sky One's approach and fall back on repeats, but if the strike goes ahead and lasts for any length of time, even that could be a problem. Clearly, in a culture of aggressive scheduling, cards tend to be played close to the chest, and June Dromgoole, the channel's head of programme acquisitions is saying only: \"The impact on C4 will depend on the length of the strike, a relatively short strike of two to three months would have little impact. Anything longer will result in delays to our returning shows. However we have stock and contingency plans to cover this eventuality.\" What of the effect on its new digital channel E4, due to launch early next year? \"E4 will be less impacted by the strike than its competitors in the multi-channel environment due to the level of original programming in the schedule. E4 also has a healthy stock position.\" Harris recognises that any fall-off of US episodes will present a changed competitive scheduling environment: \"I think it will be a challenge and we'll have to look at it as an opportunity to draw in new viewers to our original programming.\" But it isn't only British broadcasters who are concerned about the impact any strike may have: behind closed doors the international arms of the American studios are also worried that prolonged industrial action might see them lose their established prime time slots. Should they be worried? Harris doesn't think so: \"As long as there is good US product, we will want to watch it.\"",

      "body": "<p>At the end of Friday night's repeat of the first ever episode of Coro-nation Street, Bill Roache did a live link to camera from outside the Rovers Return, trailing the ITV schedule for the rest of the evening, including the live 40th-anniversary special of the venerable soap in which he was also to feature. </p> <p>This may not exactly have seemed like a contender for the top 100 TV moments. But it was an important first for ITV, which, along with the other terrestrial broadcasters, is having to adopt more and more sophisticated trail techniques and strategies to catch and keep the attention of viewers in an ever more competitive multi-channel environment. </p> <p>The practice of trailing upcoming goodies, whether through 30-second promos or continuity announcements between shows, has been around for a long time. But viewers are no longer willing to hang around while a broadcaster sticks its evening schedule on screen and the announcer takes a leisurely verbal stroll through the line-up. A click on the remote, and they're gone. </p> <p>Craig Austin, ITV network presentation manager, says: \"Multi-channel audiences are educated in fast-moving images, and the remote and the EPG are very much part and parcel of the viewing experience.\" </p> <p>In the past couple of years the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 have responded to the growing competition from the upstart Channel 5 and the cable and satellite sector by adopting the interlopers' more sophisticated, marketing-led on-air promotional strategies. </p> <p>In the process, the emphasis has moved towards trailing fewer shows more heavily. In an average week, BBC1 will trail around 15 upcoming shows, while Channel 4 focuses on 10-12 and BBC2 and Channel 5 just 10. In some cases, this has led to the number of programmes trailed each week on a channel dropping by half. </p> <p>ITV is still trailing 20-24 forthcoming shows per week, but Austin says this number is currently under review and is likely to be reduced to 12-15 a week for individual programme campaigns. </p> <p>Marketing folk justify this move as a more efficient use of airtime which, in the case of commercial broadcasters, could otherwise be sold to bring in advertising revenue. The value of Channel 4 airtime given over annu ally to programme promos has been estimated at \u00a360-70m, while the ITV figure is \u00a3700m and the BBC's \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Techniques used in media planning for advertising campaigns are increasingly being imported into on-air programme promotion, with broadcasters also hiring staff from this commercial background into their marketing and presentation departments. People are trained to look at what audience demographic a show needs to attract and then draw up a pattern of promo spots to hit that target audience. </p> <p>Jim Hytner, marketing and commercial director at Channel 5, says each show is treated \"like an FMCG product\" when it comes to on-air promotion. \"You work in terms of coverage and frequency for the trails,\" Hytner adds. \"With returning shows like House Doctor or Night Fever you need coverage and only a little frequency, because you only have to tell people it's coming back once. </p> <p>\"But with a new soap, you need maximum coverage and frequency, because you have to get people interested in something that's new to them over a period of time.\" </p> <p>There are times with big Channel 5 event programmes, such as blockbuster movie premieres or live football, when viewers do not need much persuading to come and watch a show, but Hytner says it will be heavily trailed anyway for channel branding purposes. \"We want to use known product to reinforce the channel's growing status.\" </p> <p>Alan James, head of media planning in BBC Television's presentation department, says the key is to \"prioritise\", because \"there are only so many messages people can take in\". </p> <p>\"We try to work on the basis of effective frequency,\" he adds. \"People need to see a message a certain number of times to decide if they are interested or not. At the end of a trails campaign, they will be able to see the benefits of watching that programme, or reject it.\" </p> <p>BBC on-air campaigns may start up to three weeks before a show's transmission, though two weeks is more usual. For a new costume drama, James says up to four different trails may be produced, aimed at different parts of the target audience. </p> <p>At ITV, the production of programme trails was handled by the individual regional companies in a system widely regarded as antiquated and inefficient, until just over two years ago when the Network Promotions Unit was set up in ITV's Grays Inn Road HQ in London. </p> <p>Austin only came on board six weeks ago, with a remit to look at \"junction management\" - the area of handing over from one programme to the next, including on-air trails and continuity announcements. While he admits ITV has a \"little bit of catching up\" to do on this front, he says the aim now is to \"get ahead of the opposition\", importing techniques from more ferociously competitive TV markets such as the US and Australia. </p> <p>Things, such as Bill Roache's live piece to camera in front of the Rovers Return on Friday night, are already beginning to happen. The previous Saturday, at the end of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and Stars in Their Eyes Live Final, Chris Tarrant and Matthew Kelly had delivered trails for the shows that followed. </p> <p>As part of ITV's recent news scheduling deal with the ITC, the broadcaster was given the freedom to do centre-break trails during shows for the first time. These slots are already being used for what Austin calls \"countdown promos\" - 20- second trails that tell the viewer that there are 45, 25 and 10 minutes to go before the next programme. Another US presentation tactic being adopted by ITV is end-credit promos, where the screen is split vertically, with the end credits to a show running down one side and a trail for an upcoming programme down the other. </p> <p>Austin says ECPs have been tested successfully after Emmerdale and Coronation Street, and will be rolled out to other ITV ratings bankers in the new year. \"We've got to coordinate continuity, presentation and promotion. We're hoping to take the audience through two or three programmes in a row.\" </p> <p>While ITV - and the other mass-audience channel, BBC1 - are to a large extent looking to keep the same viewers watching their programmes through a whole evening, for Channel 4 the trails game is slightly different. As Felix Pearce, Channel 4 media strategy manager, explains, the broadcaster has a lot of \"appointment to view\" programming, with different types of audience dipping in for particular shows. So for Channel 4 the promos effort is more focused on directing viewers watching one show to similar types of programme in different slots across the week. </p> <p> One of Pearce's key concerns is to reduce wastage of airtime on ineffective campaigns. At the moment, Channel 4 relies on software that uses 10-day old Barb statistics to analyse whether promos have been seen by more or less of the target audience than was planned. But the broadcaster is developing a system that will use overnight data, so Pearce and his colleagues will be able to adjust campaigns, adding or taking away trail spots, while they are still running. </p> <p>Looking to the future, James reckons with the growth of digital media platforms offering consumers everything from TV and radio to computer games, on-screen trails and cross-promotion of shows and services is going to become an even more important weapon for the BBC and other broadcasters. </p> <p>\"Cross-promotion is going to be the lifeblood for anyone, like the BBC, with a sizeable portfolio of media outlets,\" says James. \"Otherwise we just won't survive - we haven't got the cash to spend off air.\" </p> <p> <strong>Stay tuned: battle of the breaks</strong></p> <p><strong> ITV</strong> </p> <p>ITV has recently been experimenting with removing the 12 black frames between commercials, as Channel 4 and Sky already do, in order to quicken the pace of ad breaks. In another initiative, the break between a Saturday night Millionaire and the following show, The Knock, was scrapped altogether in a bid to increase audience flow from the blockbuster quiz show to the customs drama. Other initiatives have included a special two- minute promo for returning sitcom Barbara. </p> <p><strong> BBC1</strong> </p> <p>EastEnders during the week and Casualty and the National Lottery on Saturday night are the two most obvious places where the audience profile is constant week in, week out and peak-time shows can be trailed. Other reliable promotional slots include the Monday night comedy hour (other comedy and entertainment), Sunday night dramas, news bulletins (for factual shows) and Changing Rooms (leisure). </p> <p><strong> Channel 4</strong> </p> <p>C4 gives around eight minutes a night over to trails, most of them in peak time. From this month onwards, around 6% of its promotional airtime will be devoted to cross-promoting FilmFour and its new pay-TV channel, E4. </p> <p>Channel 4 has begun cross- promoting between Brookside and Hollyoaks, hoping to attract a younger audience to Brookie and an older one to the teen soap. As part of the drive to raise its age profile, Hollyoaks has also been trailed around adult-oriented shows such as The Sopranos, Ally McBeal and the late-night strand 4Music. </p> <p><strong> Channel 5</strong> </p> <p>The 9pm movie provides Channel 5's biggest regular promotional slot, which is used in particular for trailing male- skewed documentaries such as The Moors Murders. Other slots with a known regular audience and which are therefore useful as trail positions include House Doctor, Night Fever and the Keith Floyd food shows.</p>",

      "byline": "Duncan Campbell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Objection, your honour!\" \"Objection over-ruled!\" So familiar is the language of the American courtroom from countless films, television dramas and news reports that any Briton reporting from an American court feels instantly at home. Here is the pugnacious defence lawyer delivering an uppercut to a floundering witness, there is the robed judge looking down over his bi-focals and asking the duelling attorneys to address the bench. </p> <p>But how much real difference is there in covering the judicial process in the land of the first amendment? The view from the press benches in the courtrooms in Florida and California over the past couple of months suggests that the difference is as great as the distance between the bowels of the Old Bailey where the press are quartered like the below-stairs staff and the foyer of the courtrooms of Tallahassee from where they venture forth to civic receptions laid on in their honour. </p> <p>While in British courts, the staff often take a quiet pleasure in ensuring that only a limited number of journalists can get access in a big trial, here the efforts of the staff were dedicated to trying to squeeze in as many journalists as possible, allowing them to stand at the back of the court, clamber over each other into the jury box - and position camera crews and photographers in such a way that their view was not obstructed. </p> <p>Who was N Sanders Sauls, we all asked when the judge was chosen to hear the case. A court official, apologetic that she did not have a full biography of the judge, provided the names and telephone numbers of eight lawyers who would know his work and background and had agreed to be quoted about it. So we learned that he drank in the 4th Quarter - where the owner confirmed that many other judges drank there and insisted on giving us a free beer - and that he had been voted the most intellectual boy in his school year and the most likely to succeed. Seeking similar instant information about a judge in a British court would lead usually either to a disdainful look or a contempt of court charge. </p> <p>As each session ended, lawyers from both sides would brief journalists on the session. Here again was an acceptance by the lawyers that some of the arcane detail in court might have been lost on the layman. They took questions from the press, they elucidated, they went on the record. There are certainly lawyers like that in British courts but they are very much in the minority. </p> <p>In Britain, the press is regarded by the legal profession as trade, while in America it is considered a profession. This has its good and bad sides. In Britain, the relevation that George W Bush was a convicted drunk driver who had dissembled about his conviction would have been a splash in every newspaper and would possibly have cost him the election. In the US, many newspapers found it almost below their dignity to report it. </p> <p>But it is in the courts that the different attitudes are most striking.

      "bodyText": "'Objection, your honour!\" \"Objection over-ruled!\" So familiar is the language of the American courtroom from countless films, television dramas and news reports that any Briton reporting from an American court feels instantly at home. Here is the pugnacious defence lawyer delivering an uppercut to a floundering witness, there is the robed judge looking down over his bi-focals and asking the duelling attorneys to address the bench. But how much real difference is there in covering the judicial process in the land of the first amendment? The view from the press benches in the courtrooms in Florida and California over the past couple of months suggests that the difference is as great as the distance between the bowels of the Old Bailey where the press are quartered like the below-stairs staff and the foyer of the courtrooms of Tallahassee from where they venture forth to civic receptions laid on in their honour. While in British courts, the staff often take a quiet pleasure in ensuring that only a limited number of journalists can get access in a big trial, here the efforts of the staff were dedicated to trying to squeeze in as many journalists as possible, allowing them to stand at the back of the court, clamber over each other into the jury box - and position camera crews and photographers in such a way that their view was not obstructed. Who was N Sanders Sauls, we all asked when the judge was chosen to hear the case. A court official, apologetic that she did not have a full biography of the judge, provided the names and telephone numbers of eight lawyers who would know his work and background and had agreed to be quoted about it. So we learned that he drank in the 4th Quarter - where the owner confirmed that many other judges drank there and insisted on giving us a free beer - and that he had been voted the most intellectual boy in his school year and the most likely to succeed. Seeking similar instant information about a judge in a British court would lead usually either to a disdainful look or a contempt of court charge. As each session ended, lawyers from both sides would brief journalists on the session. Here again was an acceptance by the lawyers that some of the arcane detail in court might have been lost on the layman. They took questions from the press, they elucidated, they went on the record. There are certainly lawyers like that in British courts but they are very much in the minority. In Britain, the press is regarded by the legal profession as trade, while in America it is considered a profession. This has its good and bad sides. In Britain, the relevation that George W Bush was a convicted drunk driver who had dissembled about his conviction would have been a splash in every newspaper and would possibly have cost him the election. In the US, many newspapers found it almost below their dignity to report it. But it is in the courts that the different attitudes are most striking. Catching up on a trial in San Diego, I rang the court and asked if I could talk to someone who would know what stage it was at. I was put through to a court clerk speaking in such hushed tones that I wondered if she had some voice impediment. In fact, I had been put through to the courtroom itself where the judge was beginning his summing up. Not only did the clerk not tell me to get off the line but she summarised what the judge had said so far, gave me the genders of the jury and asked if there was anything else I needed to know.

At least, that is what the editor of the Today programme would have us believe, since these words conclude his potted biography on the show's website. But if he were being interviewed by his own personal rottweiler, John Humphrys, you can imagine that he would not be allowed to get away with such a mischievous misrepresentation of the truth. </p> <p>In fact, Liddle is one of the programme's most charismatic editors. He is variously described as an iconoclast, a self-publicist, a bit of an oddball, an outsider, an irritant, a genius. He named his son Wat, after Wat Tyler, leader of the peasants' revolt. He has, it is said, played in a rock band; although since Tony Blair admitted to a similar heritage, that's not quite such a cool boast as it once was. He has many interests and hobbies, one of which is his delight in being different. Since he took over on the Today programme two years ago he has certainly stirred things up: that is, after all, what Britain's most influential broadcast news programme is all about. </p> <p>But now, it seems, the knives are out for Today. And that doesn't mean Alistair Campbell has been on the phone again - or indeed the accusations of bias in the eurosceptic press over the past week - this time, it is insiders at the BBC who seem to be having trouble with Today. </p> <p>For a long time, Today has worked outside the usual scheme of things at the BBC. It does its own thing, and stands on toes all over the organisation. But its journalistic brilliance and place at the heart of the nation's political consciousness has been so great that its position has, and always will be, protected. From time to time, however, something comes up that really raises the hackles of Today's detractors, and lands the programme in trouble. And every time Today is in trouble, it is not just a bowl of hot water, but a great swirl of molten lava. </p> <p>This time, the snipers have turned their fire on a recent report about the European Union. The report, by Andrew Gilligan, highlighted a debate about whether discussions to codify the EU's various treaties amounted to a putative constitution for a European super-state. A euro scare-story, said Downing Street (which childishly and perhaps libellously branded its author \"gullible\" Gilligan); yet the programme was \"endemically biased in favour of the euro\", said Lord Pearson of Rannoch, a leading eurosceptic who had an on-air row with James Naughtie. </p> <p>The political spat was hardly surprising. Liddle says it is a typical trick of Today's opponents: Campbell will rubbish the story at the morning briefing to political journalists at Downing Street and the story becomes \"BBC bias\", helpfully obscuring the original scoop and stamping on any sensible debate on whether there is going to be an EU constitution or not. </p> <p>But what has raised eyebrows is the reaction of some within the corporation. One senior member of the editorial staff on another Radio 4 news programme expressed serious reservations about the report. It had gone too far, the source alleged, and threatened to undermine the BBC's treasured reputation for impartiality. \"It was damaging to the BBC brand.\" </p> <p>It was alleged that the report misrepresented the true position: EU spokesmen insist in public that the treaty codification does not amount to a constitution. </p> <p>Liddle and Gilligan stand by the piece, and on the Today programme on Friday, Michel Barnier, the commissioner who is responsible for EU enlargement, said moves towards \"a fundamental and constitutional treaty\" should be welcomed. Gilligan says: \"The BBC management went over it with an electron microscope and nobody has been able to fault a single word.\" </p> <p>Yet what is at issue is not whether the report was a misrepresentation. The far more interesting debate is the internal hand-wringing over Today. There is, says one insider at the programme, a \"battle for the soul of Today\", being waged between the \"Pathe News tendency\" who believe that the programme should be the noticeboard of government, and those who believe it should be something more ambitious. Liddle is most definitely in the second camp. </p> <p>Outside Today, this has not gone unnoticed. \"What makes people annoyed is that Rod thinks his job is to stir things up, and to hell with everyone else,\" says the senior journalist from the rival Radio 4 programme. \"I can't tell you how enraged people are.\" Another member of BBC radio's editorial staff adds: \"I think there is a feeling around the place that some of them push things a bit too far in an effort to make something sound new.\" </p> <p>Some have also raised concerns about the programme's presenters: John Humphrys has expressed Eurosceptic views in a Sunday Times column, while critics accuse James Naughtie of being close to Labour's leadership. However, no one has ever come up with evidence that either has allowed his personal opinions to influence a broadcast. </p> <p>One Liddle admirer, and former Today programme journalist, says he will not be cowed. \"I think there are two very clear dichotomies in BBC news and current affairs. There are those who think that Today is superb, and there are those who think it has got too big for its boots. And there is another dichotomy between those who think that Rod is a wild self-publicist, and those who regard him as a genius.\" </p> <p>Certainly, Liddle encourages his reporters to \"push things\". In this sense, he works in the same way as any Fleet Street editor. His reporters are encouraged to originate stories rather than follow the daily agenda, and are given the time and space to do so. Under his direction, Today has built up its own network of corre spondents - Gilligan is one of them - who work outside the grinding mill of the BBC's newsgathering division. Inevitably, those who are not given such a privileged position are irritated. The BBC Brussels office was furious that it was not consulted over the EU report, and made its views clear to managers at BBC news. Such was the ferocity of the complaints, from within and outside the BBC, that the issue made its way right up the line to the director of news, Tony Hall. It is understood that, even after a fine tooth-comb examination, Today was exonerated. </p> <p>There was also concern about a recent story about the NHS, which claimed that health trusts were worried about their ability to cope this winter. Again, some of the BBC's specialist health journalists were concerned; the trusts denied the report, although Today appeared to be vindicated last week when ministers warned of impending problems in the health service. </p> <p>Today is in an unenviable position, in that it can't answer internal critics in public. Yet there are some at Today who are equally scathing. \"Can you name me one story that is broken by BBC newsgathering? Our lot are breaking stories all the time,\" says a Today source, pointing out that a report by a Brussels correspondent - not a Today reporter - attracted one of the programme's few reprimands from the corporation's programme complaints unit. </p> <p>Today insists that its success is built on journalistic rigour, not hype. Those who work on the programme point out that it secured the only interview with the struck-off gynaecologist Rodney Ledwood; made the law courts with an interview with Bobby Kelly, the teenager who ran away with a cult; revealed that only 5% of the targets of Nato bombs dropped on Kosovo could be verified; and was first with the damning Deloitte Touche report on the Dome. \"I think there is some jealousy at our journalistic success. We don't need to try to get into the papers because we do that anyway,\" says one. </p> <p>Gilligan says: \"21 of my stories have been followed up by newspapers. We do not overspin stories - the papers wouldn't follow up over spun stories.\" Stephen Mitchell, the BBC's head of radio news and a staunch supporter of Liddle, says the internal debate is nothing new. \"It's not a new story, and it's normal. There is always healthy journalistic discussion between reporters about the merits or otherwise of a story. A lot of that goes on within the BBC, just as I'm sure it goes on in the Guardian. Today's brief is to be very ambitious journalistically, and in being journalistically ambitious, you are going to make waves within and outside the BBC.\" </p> <p>Mitchell concedes that there are tensions between BBC's newsgathering division - whose job is to supply all the BBC's news outlets - and the special requirements of Today and Radio 4's other main news programmes.

      "bodyText": "Rod Liddle has no hobbies, interests, hinterland or, indeed, personality. At least, that is what the editor of the Today programme would have us believe, since these words conclude his potted biography on the show's website. But if he were being interviewed by his own personal rottweiler, John Humphrys, you can imagine that he would not be allowed to get away with such a mischievous misrepresentation of the truth. In fact, Liddle is one of the programme's most charismatic editors. He is variously described as an iconoclast, a self-publicist, a bit of an oddball, an outsider, an irritant, a genius. He named his son Wat, after Wat Tyler, leader of the peasants' revolt. He has, it is said, played in a rock band; although since Tony Blair admitted to a similar heritage, that's not quite such a cool boast as it once was. He has many interests and hobbies, one of which is his delight in being different. Since he took over on the Today programme two years ago he has certainly stirred things up: that is, after all, what Britain's most influential broadcast news programme is all about. But now, it seems, the knives are out for Today. And that doesn't mean Alistair Campbell has been on the phone again - or indeed the accusations of bias in the eurosceptic press over the past week - this time, it is insiders at the BBC who seem to be having trouble with Today. For a long time, Today has worked outside the usual scheme of things at the BBC. It does its own thing, and stands on toes all over the organisation. But its journalistic brilliance and place at the heart of the nation's political consciousness has been so great that its position has, and always will be, protected. From time to time, however, something comes up that really raises the hackles of Today's detractors, and lands the programme in trouble.

      "bodyText": "Two of America's most senior judges, both nominated to the US supreme court by the Republican president Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, hold the future of the 2000 election dispute between George W Bush and Al Gore in their hands in Washington today. Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the court, and Anthony Kennedy, a judge with a reputation as a consensus builder, are the prime targets of Mr Gore's lawyers as they seek to swing just one vote their way in the deeply divided nine-member court today. If the Gore lawyers can persuade either of the two traditionally pivotal judges to join the four liberals who opposed Saturday's halting of the Florida recount then the counts will begin again, perhaps as early as this evening, and Mr Gore will still be in with a chance of snatching the White House. If they fail, as many American observers again expect them to do, Mr Gore will have nowhere else to go in his five-week effort to get all the disputed votes counted in Florida, his lead lawyer, David Boies, said yesterday. \"If no votes are counted, then I think that's the end of the road,\" Mr Boies said in a television interview. The nine justices of the supreme court \"have the power to decide this\", he added. Mr Boies refused to say if he thought Mr Gore would concede the election in the event of losing the supreme court, but Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, said: \"I believe he will.\" Both sides were scheduled to file their written arguments, limited to 50 pages each, by 4pm yesterday in advance of today's 90 minutes of argument in the case which could, in effect, decide the outcome of the November 7 election. Appropriately, the case set down for hearing today is called simply but tellingly \"George W Bush v Albert Gore\" on the court list. No timetable has been announced for the court to issue its ruling, which could come at any time once the arguments are completed. After the dramas of Friday, when the Florida supreme court reignited Mr Gore's hopes by ordering a count of 40,000 or more disputed ballots, and Saturday, when the US supreme court intervened 5-4 to stop the count in its tracks, yesterday was an eerily quiet day in America's constitutional drama. Both Mr Bush and Mr Gore remained out of the public eye. There was brief flurry of excitement in Tallahassee when reports suggested that the ballot papers from Miami-Dade county that are at the heart of the argument had been moved to Washington to be entered as evidence. The Florida supreme court later announced that the ballots remained in Tallahassee and were thus available for officials to resume counting if the US supreme court so ruled. Expectations that Mr Bush will win centred on the fact that the court had issued Saturday's stay, which requires a high legal test to be satisfied before such a move is made. \"It suffices to say that the issuance of the stay suggests that a majority of the court, while not deciding the issues presented, believe that the petitioner [Mr Bush] has a substantial probability of success,\" the conservative justice Antonin Scalia wrote in an opinion issued with the order.

      "bodyText": "Channel 4 has been forced to reschedule supernatural drama Angel to a post-watershed slot amid concerns about the show's \"dark tone\". The Independent Television Commission received complaints from 86 viewers. Many were concerned about the violence and adult tone of Angel, which had been going out at 6pm. But some fans of the show were dismayed about the amount of editing required to make the show suitable for the early evening slot. After being made aware of the ITC's concerns, Channel 4 moved the show to a post-9pm slot in late November. Angel is a spin-off from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and centres around a reformed vampire fighting evil supernatural forces in modern-day Los Angeles. Initially Channel 4 defended its scheduling of the show, saying that \"through appropriate editing, younger as well as older viewers could watch it in an early evening slot\". But the ITC said that after viewing the series, it was concerned \"about the dark tone of Angel's world which often involved adult situations that many children could find disturbing\". Even with editing, the regulator considered three episodes \"were unsuitable for this early evening slot\". These episodes featured, respectively, \"scenes of torture and paedophile references\", a stalker and \"images more reminiscent of a late-night horror film\", and a \"harrowing storyline with a mother bricking up her son alive\". The ruling is included in the ITC's Programme Complaints and Findings report for November 2000.",

Some youths even poured lighter fuel into their diggings and tried to set them on fire.

      "bodyText": "He had not done himself many favours before it started, and by the time the longest summit in EU history was finally over, French President Jacques Chirac, its host, had managed to infuriate just about every non-French politician, diplomat and journalist with whom he came into contact. France, of course, went into the Nice marathon with one main objective in mind: to prevent Germany, its historic partner in postwar European integration, from gaining more votes than itself, even though the Germans have 20m more citizens since reunification. Secondary concerns were to protect French culture from the ravages of invading Anglo-Saxon influences, and (almost as an afterthought) to arrive at a sound treaty that would make European Union decision-making more efficient and transparent in the runup to enlargement. In the event, Mr Chirac, variously dubbed mercurial, arrogant, inconsiderate, self-interested, insensitive, a bully and a bull in a chinashop during the four-day meeting, made sure Paris got more or less what it wanted - at least on the surface - on the first two points. On the third, the general opinion seems to be that the much enfeebled text that finally emerged at Nice came about despite, rather than thanks to, the admittedly strenuous efforts of the French president. He aroused the ire of just about everyone by wasting much of the first two days of the summit by going over positions that had already been well rehearsed during his tour of EU capitals over the previous weeks. \"This guy, he talks, he talks, he talks,\" Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, said to his Danish colleague Poul Nyrup Rasmussen at one stage, before he realised the TV cameras were still rolling. \"And do you think he's understood a single word of what we've said around this table? He just doesn't listen.\" Wim Kok, the Dutch prime minister, was equally outspoken. \"It's really getting serious,\" he said. \"I'm very worried by this bad atmosphere. If it continues, we're really going to be in crisis.\" Nor was Mr Chirac's approach greatly appreciated during the so-called bilateral \"confessionals\" of Friday night, when each member state was expected to lay out their hopes, fears and bottom-line negotiating positions in a tete-a-tete with the French leader. \"It was horrible,\" said Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, only half joking. \"You heard the swish of the whips and the screams of the tortured. But seriously: if you're Catholic, you know very well that nothing happens in a confessional beyond an exchange of words, and then at the end there's absolution.\" The first French text to emerge from the confessionals exasperated smaller states by its clear assumption that their voices really did not count for very much. \"This,\" complained Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime minister, \"is an institutional coup d'etat.\" The Belgians, again, were infuriated: \"So France gets to keep the same number of votes as Germany, while we lose out to Holland,\" said Brussels' foreign affairs minister, Louis Michel. \"There is no logic in this, and what's more we're being presented with a compromise solution that we have already rejected countless times.\" But Mr Chirac also succeeded in exasperating the British with his continued attempts to force them to drop their tax veto demands, and in winding up his German counterpart, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, doing further damage to already faltering Franco-German relations. \"Good relations? What good relations?\" asked Mr Schr\u00f6der at one point. A German diplomat, who wished to remain nameless, went further: \"This whole thing, this summit, is being run according to the rules of a Middle-Eastern bazaar,\" he said. \"There is no guiding light, no overriding principle, no effective chairmanship.\" Leaving no stone unturned, Mr Chirac also deeply offended the president of the European commission, Romano Prodi, by shutting him out of key bilateral meetings and berating him in front of fellow leaders for alleged mismanagement of the mad cow crisis. The French leader may yet suffer on the domestic stage once the French public realises that the compromise rule that was finally agreed with Germany leaves Berlin able to block all EU decisions by allying itself with any two of the other big states - able, in other words, to play Italy and Britain off against France. But an agreement, of sorts, has been achieved and for that the French president can, and no doubt will, claim plaudits. The solutions contained in the treaty of Nice are not, however, long term. Nothing has been sorted out for good. The problems have merely been postponed and the EU decision-making process has become, if anything, even more complex and obscure. The Nice summit, in fact, was pretty much in the image of the man who chaired it: illogical and irrational, given to outbursts of temper, bereft of any grand vision of Europe, keen to score political points wherever possible, and excessively preoccupied with national concerns.

      "bodyText": "Britain is breaking ranks with other rich industrialised countries by ending the decades-old practice of tying third world aid to the purchase of goods and services from British companies, in an effort to speed up progress towards an international deal. The move will be announced today by Clare Short, the international development secretary, when she publishes her department's second white paper. Britain's decision to cut the strings attached to aid will mean the loss of guaranteed contracts for UK business, worth around \u00a3270m last year. However, Ms Short believes that untying aid will lead to more effective poverty reduction and to markets functioning better. \"The goal is to ensure aid is well spent and [to] help developing countries to build successful economies, not waste money on goods and services which are overpriced, unsuitable and supplied with national contracts in mind rather than the needs of the poor,\" Ms Short told the Guardian. \"We want aid donations to be seen as investment in the future of developing countries, not charity,\" she said. Since the election, the government has reduced the amount of financial aid tied to the purchase of British goods and services from 30% to 8.5%, equivalent to just under \u00a370m last year. However, Britain also provides a lot of technical assistance which is tied, although strenuous efforts are made to employ local consultants where possible. In 1999, the value of tied consultancy work was \u00a3200m. Ms Short will announce that from April all financial aid and technical assistance will be fully untied, giving Britain significant leverage in efforts to reach an agreement in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a grouping of the world's richest 29 industrialised countries. The OECD discussions, which have been rumbling on since the late 60s, are now limited to the provision of unilateral financial aid to the least developed countries, but France and Japan, which tie a high proportion of their aid, have been blocking a deal. The US provides very little financial aid to the poorest countries and the French and Japanese fear a popular backlash if their domestic industries are forced to shoulder the burden of untying aid. Britain's move will also give it extra clout in the EU, where Action Aid and 900 other development organisations have launched a legal challenge on the grounds that tied aid contravenes competition policy. A Whitehall source said: \"If a court case was taken against us today we would clearly be in a difficult situation.\" Tied aid is a relic of the 50s and 60s when exchange controls made it difficult to spend taxpayers' money on anything other than British goods and services, but in a global economy it is hard to define a British product or, increasingly, a British company.

      "body": "<p>Germany, Britain, France and Italy were last night poised to seal their dominance of the European Union by winning a hefty reweighting of votes that ensures they cannot be beaten by any combination of smaller countries.</p> <p>In the most bitterly contested of the power-plays at the Nice summit the vote reweighting deal was edging painfully towards agreement after hours of furious haggling. Crucially, leaders fixed on 30 votes each for the big four, even though Germany, with a population of 82m, has over 20m more people than either Britain, France or Italy.</p> <p>Spain looked set to win its hard-fought demand for recognition as a medium-sized country, with 28 votes in the decision-making council of ministers, still the union's most powerful institution.</p> <p>Poland, with a similar population of about 40m, and expected to be the first former communist country to join the EU in a few years, was heading for parity with Spain.</p> <p>But the difficulty was underlined when France's first proposal gave Poland only 26 votes out of a total of 339.</p> <p>Last night's emerging compromise would mean that a minority of 91 votes or 61% of the total EU population - equal to three big states and perhaps one small one - could block any council decision.</p> <p>\"Four will make up a blocking minority,\" confirmed the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, \"and that is faithful to the history of the union.\"</p> <p>A senior British official said: \"This would be a way of ensuring that the three biggest member states couldn't be outvoted, and given their weight in the union that's only right and proper.\"</p> <p>But smaller countries, led by Portugal, had sought to raise that threshold to 104, giving themselves more influence and making it harder for the large states to block decisions.</p> <p>As the EU expands to take in up to 12 new members in the coming years, the bigger countries, under-represented in relation to their population under the current system, fear they could be outvoted by a coalition of smaller nations.</p> <p>And there was angry criticism last night that the big four were becoming a bullying \"directory\" whose combined voting power would strengtheninter-governmentalism at the expense of the community spirit and slow down integration.</p> <p>Big states offered to surrender one of their two members of the 20-strong European commission in a bargain that would appease smaller members who are anxious to keep their own single place on it rather than face a rotation system.</p> <p>\"The big four have stood back and watched the small states shed blood all over the carpet,\" one diplomat said. \"The smalls have been led up the garden path over the commission. They've taken the bait and expended an enormous amount of political capital so there is moral pressure on them to accept a substantial reweighting.\"</p> <p>However, problems lingered. Portugal, with 11 votes was unhappy at Spain's 28. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, calling for consistency, said he had no problem with the Netherlands getting more votes than Belgium since its 15.8m population was 50% more than Belgium's.</p> <p>But using the logic of the population yardstick, he argued, Germany should then get more votes than France. \"Between Germany and France, the population difference is more than 20m. In one case we say they are the same. In the other case, we make a difference,\" he complained.</p> <p>Ireland, with seven votes, was resisting linkage with Lithuania which was offered just five votes despite having an almost identical population.</p> <p>Pierre Moscovici, France's minister for Europe, said that a deal was \"on the table\". But he added: \"It's a very careful construction, like a house of cards. Twitch one element and you bring it crashing down.\"</p> <p>Germany won compensation on voting weights by getting 99 seats in the European parliament, serving as a sort of consolation prize, while Britain, France and Italy were each slated to get 74. But leaders were forced to abandon their previous threshold of 700 seats for the parliament, raising it to 740 to accommodate last-minute bargains. <br><b>Related special reports</b> <br><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/IMF\">IMF and World Bank summit in Prague 2000</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/\">World Trade Organisation summit 1999</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/m2k\">May2K demonstrations</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/debt/0,2759,178197,00.html\">Debt relief</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/emu\">Economic and monetary union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/0,2759,180395,00.html\">European commission</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/0,2759,180401,00.html\">European parliament</a> <br><br><b>Interactive guide</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">How the European nations relate to each other</a> <br><br><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_new\">Updates from protesters - Indymedia</a> <br><a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/nice_council/index_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Press release: Nice summit - EU</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Germany, Britain, France and Italy were last night poised to seal their dominance of the European Union by winning a hefty reweighting of votes that ensures they cannot be beaten by any combination of smaller countries. In the most bitterly contested of the power-plays at the Nice summit the vote reweighting deal was edging painfully towards agreement after hours of furious haggling. Crucially, leaders fixed on 30 votes each for the big four, even though Germany, with a population of 82m, has over 20m more people than either Britain, France or Italy. Spain looked set to win its hard-fought demand for recognition as a medium-sized country, with 28 votes in the decision-making council of ministers, still the union's most powerful institution. Poland, with a similar population of about 40m, and expected to be the first former communist country to join the EU in a few years, was heading for parity with Spain. But the difficulty was underlined when France's first proposal gave Poland only 26 votes out of a total of 339. Last night's emerging compromise would mean that a minority of 91 votes or 61% of the total EU population - equal to three big states and perhaps one small one - could block any council decision. \"Four will make up a blocking minority,\" confirmed the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, \"and that is faithful to the history of the union.\" A senior British official said: \"This would be a way of ensuring that the three biggest member states couldn't be outvoted, and given their weight in the union that's only right and proper.\" But smaller countries, led by Portugal, had sought to raise that threshold to 104, giving themselves more influence and making it harder for the large states to block decisions. As the EU expands to take in up to 12 new members in the coming years, the bigger countries, under-represented in relation to their population under the current system, fear they could be outvoted by a coalition of smaller nations. And there was angry criticism last night that the big four were becoming a bullying \"directory\" whose combined voting power would strengtheninter-governmentalism at the expense of the community spirit and slow down integration. Big states offered to surrender one of their two members of the 20-strong European commission in a bargain that would appease smaller members who are anxious to keep their own single place on it rather than face a rotation system. \"The big four have stood back and watched the small states shed blood all over the carpet,\" one diplomat said. \"The smalls have been led up the garden path over the commission. They've taken the bait and expended an enormous amount of political capital so there is moral pressure on them to accept a substantial reweighting.\" However, problems lingered. Portugal, with 11 votes was unhappy at Spain's 28. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, calling for consistency, said he had no problem with the Netherlands getting more votes than Belgium since its 15.8m population was 50% more than Belgium's. But using the logic of the population yardstick, he argued, Germany should then get more votes than France. \"Between Germany and France, the population difference is more than 20m. In one case we say they are the same. In the other case, we make a difference,\" he complained. Ireland, with seven votes, was resisting linkage with Lithuania which was offered just five votes despite having an almost identical population. Pierre Moscovici, France's minister for Europe, said that a deal was \"on the table\". But he added: \"It's a very careful construction, like a house of cards. Twitch one element and you bring it crashing down.\" Germany won compensation on voting weights by getting 99 seats in the European parliament, serving as a sort of consolation prize, while Britain, France and Italy were each slated to get 74. But leaders were forced to abandon their previous threshold of 700 seats for the parliament, raising it to 740 to accommodate last-minute bargains.

They were the true heirs of George III who, according to the historian Linda Colley, gave to his successors a simple mantra: be domestic but be seen and, above all, be seen to be spectacular. David Carradine's theory of the \"invention of tradition\" explained the monarchy's remarkable ingenuity in surviving democracy: as its powers waned the monarchy mobilised everything, from theatre to technology, to improvise sovereignty-as-spectacle. Republicans were bored. They evacuated the territory taken by the royalists. So, neither the Windsors' cheek in expecting us to pay for the repair of their castle, nor the all-party deal giving them immunity from financial scrutiny, nor their personal belief in their supremacy and our subordination touched the national nerve. The Charles-Diana scandal affronted popular feeling but found no echo in parliament - unlike the crisis caused by an earlier Prince of Wales, whose abuse of his wife Caroline invigorated a popular culture and brought the way men treat women into 19th-century political discourse. Then, as now, we witnessed both the potential alchemy of gender, finance and power for republicanism, and at the same time republicanism's failure to recognise its resonance. The difficulty is compounded by the failure of misogynists to feel the zeitgeist. They misread the runes, traduce feminist republicans such as me as feminist royalists and mock sexual politics as mere \"soap opera\". However, all is not lost. Everyone wonders why Charles's son should be doomed to a life spent in the service of this horrible dynasty. He can be rescued only by republicanism. Meanwhile we have our own queens. We've got Julie Burchill and Tracey Emin who entertain and enlighten us in their salons and bedchambers. We've got real princes - that nice Naseem; David Beckham, a great footballer and by all accounts a diligent dad who enjoys sharing his wife's stardom in the kingdom of OK! And finally, the Royles' Nana: she's got the handbag, the hat and - unlike that other Queen - we know exactly what she does on the toilet. \u0095 Beatrix Campbell is author of Diana: How Sexual Politics Shook the Monarchy (Women's Press) comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "As delegates battled to bring the summit to a close last night, discussion had already turned to a new round of talks likely in four years' time, focusing on some of the most sensitive questions facing Europe. The favourite bugbear of British Eurosceptics - supranationalism and integration - as well as relations between nation states within the European Union are all expected to be on the table at an inter-governmental conference (IGC) in 2004. Leaders in Nice agreed that this later meeting should draw them into a \"deeper and wider\" debate on the future of the EU, though they stressed it would not block enlargement to the east, due to begin in earnest at around that time. According to a declaration on the future of the union agreed by the summit, the remit of the new IGC will be drawn up at Gothenburg at the end of the Swedish presidency next June and at Laeken when Belgium is in the rotating hot seat the following December. Since the Netherlands is running the presidency in January 2004 the next EU treaty is likely to be signed there. British officials said Tony Blair was content to sign up to a project which would ask \"how to establish and monitor a more precise delimitation of competences between the EU and the member states, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity\". The prime minister was said to be relaxed too about looking at the Charter of Fundamental Rights, proclaimed last Thursday, but which he fought tooth and nail to keep out of the new treaty. Britain's position would not change, officials insisted. The planned review includes the role of national parliaments, a response to the widespread desire to boost the EU's perceived \"democratic deficit,\" given the lack of interest across the 15 in the European parliament. It will also look at simplification of the notoriously unreadable EU treaties, \"with a view to making them clearer\". Agreement on the future IGC is an important victory for Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who has come under pressure from Germany's 16 regions or l\u00e4nder, which want a clarification of how responsibilities are carved up at European, national and regional levels. Reflecting the views of Britain and other more sceptical countries, the summit declaration did not include the word \"constitution\" and suggested that Brussels was seen as distant by many citizens. \"Having opened the way to enlargement, the conference calls for a deeper and wider debate about the future devel opment of the European Union,\" said the declaration, drafted by Germany, Italy and Belgium. \"The conference recognises the need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the union and its institutions, to bring them closer to the citizens of the member states.\" Crucially, the 12 candidate countries are to be associated with a debate which will mould institutional and political arrangements for a union set to change almost beyond recognition as it expands.

The summit would run until Sunday - but no later.</p> <p>Having made his position abundantly plain on giving up Britain's tax and social security veto (\"No\") during Friday night's \"confessionals\" with Mr Chirac, Mr Blair learned at breakfast time at the West End that his points had not been taken.</p> <p>When the summiteers reconvened a mile away at the menacing Acropolis conference centre, the prime minister made it plain again. So did Robin Cook when he backed modestly into the media spotlight.</p> <p>\"We are not bluffing,\" Mr Cook insisted. Only around 7pm last night was his public optimism finally vindicated when Mr Chirac told the summiteers they would make no progress on that score.</p> <p>They had spent most of yesterday thrashing out the \"bigs\" versus \"smalls\" voting issue in which the bigs - notably Britain and Germany - weighed in to play a helpful role having already got what they wanted.</p> <p>Mr Blair's diplomatic efforts to remain \"at the heart of Europe\" - despite his domestic troubles on Europe - had paid off. Sweden's Goran Persson paid him a personal tribute on Saturday night.</p> <p>Back at the West End, after seeing Mr Chirac and Mr Schr\u00f6der for post-dinner bilaterals, Mr Blair hit the telephones. But the one meeting he did leave his suite for was across the street at the legendary Negrisco where Jose Maria Aznar, his centre-right best friend from Madrid, needed help with the big/small issue.</p> <p>By the time the summiteers reconvened at 9.30 yesterday morning Mr Blair had also seen Mr Schr\u00f6der and Mr Chirac (again), having briskly led his less-fit staff along the seafront on a one mile walk.</p> <p>It was a cheerful walk. He had held the line on defence, would hold it on the vetoes and - provided the summit could reach agreement to allow enlargement to the east - he could go into the election claiming to have defended the national interest while remaining a good European.</p> <p>Once inside, he also saw his Dutch, Danish and Italian counterparts. The UK delegation was busy enough and throughout the day would weather pressure to cave in on tax - from the commission, from Belgium and Italy. But the heat was being generated elsewhere.</p> <p><b>Relaxed Schr\u00f6der</b><br></p> <p>Even the foreign secretary's sidekick, Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, was emboldened to peddle the optimistic line as he toured the cavernous press centre.</p> <p>But Mr Blair was not alone. Small and medium-size countries had been offended by the way the French plan reallocated voting strengths around the ministerial council table to reinstate the dominant position of the \"big four\" - Germany, Britain, France and Italy, 30 votes each.</p> <p>It might have been an occasion for Germany to throw its summit weight around - as Helmut Kohl sometimes did on a Saturday afternoon when he wanted to get home to Bonn and a properly baked strudel. But Mr Schr\u00f6der was relaxed.</p> <p>He and his foreign minister, the Green, Joschka Fischer, were working to their own agenda which included extra German seats in the Strasbourg parliament and another inter-governmental conference (IGC) after 2004 to define the powers of Brussels and get them off the back of his own regional parliaments.</p> <p>Quietly they racked up victories as Mr Chirac and his hyper-sophisticated team retreated in the face of hostility, tactically at least. There was a vague awareness inside the Euro-bubble that, since their arrival, both Al Gore and George Bush had been elected president by assorted US judges, and that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel had resigned.</p> <p>Only at 3pm yesterday did the summit get off the vote weighting issue and address QMV - Mr Blair's bugbear. And it was only at around 7pm that Mr Chirac threw in the tax towel, allowing British officials to proclaim a satisfactory outcome. No one used the \"game, set and match\" language that a junior press spokesman used after Maastricht, \"against my express instructions\", John Major revealed last week.</p> <p>That was uncommunitaire language, frowned upon in polite EU circles. Last night Mr Chirac was still nursing a bad back and (rumour had it) tummy trouble as they headed into the final straight. But they were still talking - politely. <br><b>Related special reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/IMF\">IMF and World Bank summit in Prague 2000</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/\">World Trade Organisation summit 1999</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/m2k\">May2K demonstrations</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/debt/0,2759,178197,00.html\">Debt relief</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/emu\">Economic and monetary union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/0,2759,180395,00.html\">European commission</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/0,2759,180401,00.html\">European parliament</a> <br><br><b>Interactive guide</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">How the European nations relate to each other</a> <br><br><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_new\">Updates from protesters - Indymedia</a> <br><a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/nice_council/index_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Press release: Nice summit - EU</a></p>",

The pace is too slow, the rituals time-consuming and he wishes he could be doing something pressing at home. In this he has an ally in the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. A double-ally in Nice yesterday as they devoted much of the day to sorting out the injured feelings of smaller EU states angry at the reweighting of voting strength. Double because Mr Schr\u00f6der and Jacques Chirac, the mercurial president of France, do not hit it off in the way that Kohl and Mitterrand did and - long years back - in the way that de Gaulle and Adenauer worked so closely to forge the postwar Bonn-Paris axis. As head of the EU member state that currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, Mr Chirac has been the man to make or muddle the Nice summit. Mr Schr\u00f6der and Mr Blair had been puzzled as to why, after touring all the EU capitals in the past month, their 68-year-old colleague wasted much of Thursday and Friday recapping known positions. Cunning plan Crunch time came on Saturday morning when the French presidency circulated a new draft of the treaty's trickier bits, a Gallic equivalent of Baldrick's cunning plan which managed to infuriate everyone. It reflected many of France's own priorities and concerns - to protect French cultural products from US trade penetration and (more puzzling to Mr Schr\u00f6der) to maintain - at any cost - the same number of votes in the council of ministers as Germany, despite those extra 20m Germans acquired after the Berlin Wall fell. Faced with widespread anger, from Britain over the tax issue by trying to kick it into the long grass (\"it doesn't matter how long the grass is,\" said one official) and from smaller states dismayed at their dwindling power, the long summit haul suddenly loomed. Flights were duly cancelled and hotel rooms rebooked. \"We don't think four days is a long time to reach this kind of complicated and important deal,\" British officials told impatient reporters - and probably Mr Blair who had been housed on the Promenade des Anglais overlooking the Mediterranean, appropriately enough in the West End hotel. The official \"sherpas\", who carry the heavy preparatory burdens of summitry, also reassured each other that Mr Chirac had an engagement in Paris this morning to meet Nelson Mandela, the one man in the world even a president of France would hesitate to keep waiting. The summit would run until Sunday - but no later.

When the summiteers reconvened a mile away at the menacing Acropolis conference centre, the prime minister made it plain again. So did Robin Cook when he backed modestly into the media spotlight. \"We are not bluffing,\" Mr Cook insisted. Only around 7pm last night was his public optimism finally vindicated when Mr Chirac told the summiteers they would make no progress on that score. They had spent most of yesterday thrashing out the \"bigs\" versus \"smalls\" voting issue in which the bigs - notably Britain and Germany - weighed in to play a helpful role having already got what they wanted. Mr Blair's diplomatic efforts to remain \"at the heart of Europe\" - despite his domestic troubles on Europe - had paid off. Sweden's Goran Persson paid him a personal tribute on Saturday night. Back at the West End, after seeing Mr Chirac and Mr Schr\u00f6der for post-dinner bilaterals, Mr Blair hit the telephones. But the one meeting he did leave his suite for was across the street at the legendary Negrisco where Jose Maria Aznar, his centre-right best friend from Madrid, needed help with the big/small issue. By the time the summiteers reconvened at 9.30 yesterday morning Mr Blair had also seen Mr Schr\u00f6der and Mr Chirac (again), having briskly led his less-fit staff along the seafront on a one mile walk. It was a cheerful walk. He had held the line on defence, would hold it on the vetoes and - provided the summit could reach agreement to allow enlargement to the east - he could go into the election claiming to have defended the national interest while remaining a good European. Once inside, he also saw his Dutch, Danish and Italian counterparts. The UK delegation was busy enough and throughout the day would weather pressure to cave in on tax - from the commission, from Belgium and Italy. But the heat was being generated elsewhere. Relaxed Schr\u00f6der Even the foreign secretary's sidekick, Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, was emboldened to peddle the optimistic line as he toured the cavernous press centre. But Mr Blair was not alone. Small and medium-size countries had been offended by the way the French plan reallocated voting strengths around the ministerial council table to reinstate the dominant position of the \"big four\" - Germany, Britain, France and Italy, 30 votes each. It might have been an occasion for Germany to throw its summit weight around - as Helmut Kohl sometimes did on a Saturday afternoon when he wanted to get home to Bonn and a properly baked strudel. But Mr Schr\u00f6der was relaxed. He and his foreign minister, the Green, Joschka Fischer, were working to their own agenda which included extra German seats in the Strasbourg parliament and another inter-governmental conference (IGC) after 2004 to define the powers of Brussels and get them off the back of his own regional parliaments. Quietly they racked up victories as Mr Chirac and his hyper-sophisticated team retreated in the face of hostility, tactically at least. There was a vague awareness inside the Euro-bubble that, since their arrival, both Al Gore and George Bush had been elected president by assorted US judges, and that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel had resigned. Only at 3pm yesterday did the summit get off the vote weighting issue and address QMV - Mr Blair's bugbear. And it was only at around 7pm that Mr Chirac threw in the tax towel, allowing British officials to proclaim a satisfactory outcome. No one used the \"game, set and match\" language that a junior press spokesman used after Maastricht, \"against my express instructions\", John Major revealed last week. That was uncommunitaire language, frowned upon in polite EU circles. Last night Mr Chirac was still nursing a bad back and (rumour had it) tummy trouble as they headed into the final straight. But they were still talking - politely.

But Jenny Tong, the Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, said the announcement was excellent news which was long overdue. \"As a family planning doctor for over 20 years before I came in to parliament I have campaigned long and hard for women to be able to control their fertility in this safe and effective way. \"It is not an abortion. It is very safe, and I hope it will prevent many unplanned pregnancies in the future.\"",

      "bodyText": "The leader of Scotland's Catholics, Cardinal Thomas Winning, has called on the government to deal with the Act of Settlement \"sooner rather than later\". The cardinal has long been an outspoken critic of the act, which bans Catholics from ascending to the throne or marrying the heirs to the crown. He has branded it an insult to Catholics, and has supported moves to have it repealed. In an article in the Sunday Herald newspaper yesterday, the cardinal used the words of former Conservative Scottish secretary, Michael Forsyth, to describe the act as a \"grubby little secret\" that shames the nation. The cardinal's comments come after a call by the Guardian for the act to be abolished on the grounds that it breaks the European Convention of Human Rights. Cardinal Winning said the time for addressing the discrimination inherent in the act was now. \"The act, passed by the narrowest of margins 300 years ago and absorbed into Scots law under the Act of Union, contains words of bigotry directed against those of a 'Popish' persuasion which, if they were included in a TV programme, would force the schedulers to broadcast it after the watershed,\" he wrote. \"Yet three centuries on, the act remains on the statute book - untouched and almost forgotten were it not for the determination of a group of parliamentarians from all parties to push for change on this issue.\" Almost exactly a year ago, the Scottish parliament unanimously backed a motion to repeal the act after a debate initiated by the Scottish National Party. Last week, the SNP tabled a fresh motion for abolition in the Scottish parliament and a similar Commons motion, following the launch of the Guardian's campaign. Cardinal Winning said repeal of the act had never been the most pressing issue for Catholics, but there was widespread consensus in the church that it had to be done. \"It is quite ludicrous to suggest that if a dashing young princess from Spain or Belgium or Luxembourg were to sweep Prince William off his feet and the young couple wished to marry, that somehow the British state would be brought to its knees.\" Cardinal Winning said he did not want to see the church drawn into a wider debate on the future of the monarchy or the disestablishment of the Church of England, and added: \"Such issues are for the people, not the church, to decide.\"",

Reform would be of immediate benefit to almost everyone because the existence of the monarchy either directly enables, or indirectly encourages, all sorts of organisations to treat us with contempt as subjects rather than with respect as citizens. Those organisations are the civil service, the government, local councils, utilities operators, the railway companies and many others. Because we lack fundamental rights they are able to act as \"little monarchies\" and brush our concerns aside, sheltering, consciously or not, behind the knock-on effect of big monarchy as they do so. If we owned those rights as citizens, they would have stronger compulsion to treat us with greater respect, to listen and to act. Brian Basham London \u0095 Every child in Britain should be able to aspire to be head of state as well as head of government. It is quite undemocratic that the supreme office of state, with all the power and privilege it confers, should be automatically decided by an accident of birth and reserved for one over-indulged family. The government should offer a referendum on the issue. I could happily accept the outcome, so long as I've had the opportunity to vote. Dominic Shelmerdine London",

      "body": "<p><strong> Saturday</strong> (Channel 4, Saturday) was a clever, incisive and touching documentary which took a simple premise and ordinary people and produced something really rather wonderful. A detailed portrait of a day in the life of Manchester, it was a vivid illustration of the UK's rich and diverse social fabric, the vibrancy of city life and the still-hallowed nature of the weekend. </p> <p>Focusing on individual stories teased from, among others, Manchester's 11,000 Jews, 9,000 Muslims and 4,500 gym-goers, Saturday was a delight, uncovering as it did the uniqueness of ordinary people, and making those its cameras alighted upon emblems of their communities without resorting to clich\u00e9. In doing so, it suggested that to call these people \"ordinary\" would be a gross understatement. It was also easy to imagine these people as little Plasticine animals made by Nick Park. </p> <p>While following aerobics instructors to their meditation class, observing a Jewish family on their Sabbath, or simply letting a Muslim man opine on the state of the world, Saturday was both uplifting and saddening. </p> <p>Although it was a joy to see people revelling in their faith - even if it was devotion to Man City - it was difficult not to be a tiny bit envious. </p> <p>Something to believe in is a precious commodity indeed. But the documentary also sparked the thought that one day, the last person to believe in God will die and no one else will remember. Hardly a recruitment drive for old-time religion, Saturday, surprisingly, was a reminder that spirituality may not be a bad thing to think about once in a while. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday</strong> (Channel 4, Sunday), meanwhile, was far from thought-provoking, lacking the narrative drive, the personalities and discipline of its predecessor. All standing stones and car boot sales (15,000 of them, don't you know), it was at least faithful to its subject. Like Sundays, it was awfully boring. </p> <p>As apt names for a space ambassador go, Peggy is pretty low on the list, just above Thora and Melvin. Smelling of old ladies' face powder, freshly buttered toast and lavender, Peggy is not a name one would readily associate with the building of an international space station. Yet, as <strong> The Space Game</strong> (Discovery, Sunday) revealed, Peggy was indeed the American space ambassador who toured the world encouraging nation states to become involved in turning science fiction into science fact. She had her work cut out for her. </p> <p>Charting the history - and politics - of the space race, it was two parts schools programme to one part grown-up documentary. There were arguments over the names of modules, disputes over whose technology was better, and then there was the treaty for which each of the 16 nations defined \"peaceful\" differently. This was essentially to satisfy the US Department of Defense - which, as we know from The X-Files, is run by rabid militarist, right-wing megalomaniacs - who wanted the opportunity to test spooky weapons on the station the American government had paid for. And all this before people actually started living on the darn thing. Can you imagine the ding-dongs then? (\"I want to paint this room mauve.\" \"Well, I want it barley white.\") Bickering children on a multi-billion-dollar installation orbiting the earth. Doomed, we're all doomed. </p> <p>Part of the Madonna Night, <strong> Naked Ambition</strong> (Channel 4, Saturday) profiled pre-fame Madonna with some vintage footage, photographs and contributions from \"friends,\" \"ex-boyfriends\" (there were a lot of them) and people who once boogied beside her in New York's Danceteria. </p> <p>Aside from the clumsy structure, Naked Ambition was interesting in that - like the Freddie Mercury biography shown on Friday - it revealed what happens to the people who brush by a rising star. They hang out in funny hats (one of Madge's exes had a hat with what looked like sliced tomatoes on) and wait for documentary crews to make them semi-famous by association. It comes of having nothing to believe in, of course. Being touched - or more accurately clambered over - by an angel is the closest some people get to having meaning in their lives. </p> <p>The difference between people like that and someone like Madonna is that she would never be happy being a hanger-on, preferring instead to be the one on whom people want to be hung. Still surprising everyone, Madonna's faith is to be admired. Her faith in herself. Not a lot of people have that, not even in Manchester.</p>",

She had her work cut out for her. Charting the history - and politics - of the space race, it was two parts schools programme to one part grown-up documentary. There were arguments over the names of modules, disputes over whose technology was better, and then there was the treaty for which each of the 16 nations defined \"peaceful\" differently. This was essentially to satisfy the US Department of Defense - which, as we know from The X-Files, is run by rabid militarist, right-wing megalomaniacs - who wanted the opportunity to test spooky weapons on the station the American government had paid for. And all this before people actually started living on the darn thing. Can you imagine the ding-dongs then? (\"I want to paint this room mauve.\" \"Well, I want it barley white.\") Bickering children on a multi-billion-dollar installation orbiting the earth. Doomed, we're all doomed. Part of the Madonna Night, Naked Ambition (Channel 4, Saturday) profiled pre-fame Madonna with some vintage footage, photographs and contributions from \"friends,\" \"ex-boyfriends\" (there were a lot of them) and people who once boogied beside her in New York's Danceteria. Aside from the clumsy structure, Naked Ambition was interesting in that - like the Freddie Mercury biography shown on Friday - it revealed what happens to the people who brush by a rising star. They hang out in funny hats (one of Madge's exes had a hat with what looked like sliced tomatoes on) and wait for documentary crews to make them semi-famous by association. It comes of having nothing to believe in, of course. Being touched - or more accurately clambered over - by an angel is the closest some people get to having meaning in their lives. The difference between people like that and someone like Madonna is that she would never be happy being a hanger-on, preferring instead to be the one on whom people want to be hung. Still surprising everyone, Madonna's faith is to be admired. Her faith in herself. Not a lot of people have that, not even in Manchester.",

      "body": "<p>You will have to wait until mid-January to see Nigel Rolfe's superb Life Without Life installation at the Royal Pump Rooms, Leamington Spa. In the meantime, I advise a trip to the equally fine Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, West Sussex. The two projects are related. In the first, Rolfe will be showing his collection of 162 delicate monotone images of dead and desiccated flowers, last seen in Dublin. Projected onto the Pump Room walls, these will slowly dissolve one into the other, as if fading away, petals to dust. The point of this sadly exquisite project is that all Rolfe's flowers are dead. His title, Life Without Life, is, he says, a reference to \"life unworthy of life\" - the Nazi phrase for those with physical deformities or mental handicaps whose lives were crushed into the mire of Hitler's Germany. </p> <p>As with flowers, so with humankind. Destroy one and you destroy the other. So why are we wiping out as many plants as possible? You know the answers as well as I do. As to what we can do, well, the botanists and conservationists of Kew Gardens have been doing it for us: they have been collecting and storing seeds in the grounds of Wakehurst Place, a handsome Tudor mansion, since 1974. </p> <p>The Millennium Seed Bank is a gentle, very fine new building designed by those cool, precise, measured architects Stanton Williams for the Royal Botanic Gardens. It houses an underground bunker that promises to contain samples of 10% of the world's seed-bearing flora by 2010, and is already home to examples of all 1,400 British seed-bearing species, of which 357 are currently endangered. Above, in a flowering of subtle, uncompromised modern design that reminds me more than a little of the great Louis Kahn's peerless Kimbell Art Gallery at Fort Worth, Texas (one of the greatest buildings of the 20th century), is an exhibition that tells us why it is now imperative that we collect and nurture this extraordinary biodiversity of vegetable life. This venture by the Kew Gardens team is utterly compelling. I could have taken root here. </p> <p>Lottery money made the new project and the Stanton Williams building that houses it possible. The Millennium Commission provided \u00a330m, with the rest of the \u00a380m needed coming from the Wellcome Trust, Orange plc (as in mobile phones) and private individuals. Most of that money has been spent on what you don't see, except with special permission or through virtual tours by visitor-operated computers. Or big windows looking into laboratories. Why? Because the cash has been invested in a vast underground bunker in which seeds from all over the world rest their weary pods, safe from every pesticidal attempt to exterminate them above ground. Like Americans who pay a fortune to have their bodies frozen in the hope of being revived again, these thousands of seeds are waiting to replenish the fields, forests and flowerbeds of the future. The vault they rest in is kept at a constant temperature of -20C. </p> <p>The seeds are also here to enhance our understanding of the effects of pollution, pesticides and global warming and to assist the medical industry in developing safe new drugs. They represent the fruit of a collaboration between Kew Gardens and an increasing number of countries from around the world. To date, Burkina-Faso, Kenya, Madagascar, Lebanon, South Africa and the United States have joined hands with Britain. </p> <p>Yet such thoughts are probably far from most visitors' minds as they pilot their lead-free Metros, Clios and Espaces into the gates of Wakehurst Place. Here, among the birches and beeches, the rhododendrons and choruses of hypericums and skimmias, landed gently between lovingly preserved woodland, wetland and grassland, is the new Stanton Williams building. It comprises a fan of five bright, airy, barrel-vaulted concrete and glass sheds and, to one side, a matching greenhouse. This cluster of buildings is as gentle as it is clear-sighted, and the interiors are deft and subtle. The public exhibition spaces are a delight to walk through, the wintry sunlight feeling its way through the low-lying clouds and reaching into corners, none of which are prey to unsympathetic artificial lighting. </p> <p>A cross between temple, art gallery, aircraft hangar, greenhouse and laboratory - you can see the boffins at work behind big glass windows - the Seed Bank is a compelling architectural flowering and the kind of place where you learn so very much and so quickly. The actual exhibition part of the project - the bit you see - has been shaped by Land Design Studio. The first thing the designers have chosen to show us is a giant, floor-to-ceiling seed wall. It looks great, while the individual seeds prove to be very beautiful as you get up close. </p> <p>The interactive bit - there has to be one, doesn't there? - is actually very good, offering a virtual reality tour of the cold storage. You can open the seed jars and learn about the plants you are unearthing. What I would like to see is a speeded-up film of every single one of these seeds bursting into life; maybe this can come in time, and with another grant. To date, though, there is more than enough to keep all but the most jaded, computer-crazy visitor enchanted and engrossed. </p> <p>I promised myself not to write about that wretched Millennium Experience but, compared with the Millennium Seed Bank, it has taught us nothing at all, except how to waste money in a vain attempt to make a new government look \"with it\". Here, in Sussex, all is calm, all is bright, and though there is little birdsong (we may soon need a Millennium Nest Bank to store the eggs of our quickly vanishing songbirds), there is a sense of something truly worthwhile being done on our behalf as we cover what's left of our countryside with natty executive housing and distribution depots full of pesticide-sprayed food. </p> <p>Stanton Williams are masters of restrained modern architecture. Theirs is a chaste aesthetic, yet here the curved roofs, twisting metal stairs, big glass screens and vaults modulated to allow different plays of daylight at different times of day and year produce a building that is more than the sum of its parts. It shows, too, how well contemporary design can be implanted in mature rural settings. As do the giant seed sculptures here by Peter Randall-Page. Most of all, it should leave visitors with a sense of the sheer magic of the natural world, of how what we build and what we devour as the self-appointed master species can yet be balanced with other forms of life, so easily stepped on, brushed aside or sprayed into premature extinction. This is one of the very best of the millennium projects - architecturally, morally, intellectually, naturally - and one that will be flowering for all our sakes in hundreds of years to come. </p> <p>\u0095 The Millennium Seed Bank is at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, West Sussex (01444 894066). Life Without Life is at the Royal Pump Rooms, Royal Leamington Spa (01926 742700), from January 20 to February 25.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You will have to wait until mid-January to see Nigel Rolfe's superb Life Without Life installation at the Royal Pump Rooms, Leamington Spa. In the meantime, I advise a trip to the equally fine Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, West Sussex. The two projects are related. In the first, Rolfe will be showing his collection of 162 delicate monotone images of dead and desiccated flowers, last seen in Dublin. Projected onto the Pump Room walls, these will slowly dissolve one into the other, as if fading away, petals to dust. The point of this sadly exquisite project is that all Rolfe's flowers are dead. His title, Life Without Life, is, he says, a reference to \"life unworthy of life\" - the Nazi phrase for those with physical deformities or mental handicaps whose lives were crushed into the mire of Hitler's Germany. As with flowers, so with humankind. Destroy one and you destroy the other. So why are we wiping out as many plants as possible? You know the answers as well as I do. As to what we can do, well, the botanists and conservationists of Kew Gardens have been doing it for us: they have been collecting and storing seeds in the grounds of Wakehurst Place, a handsome Tudor mansion, since 1974. The Millennium Seed Bank is a gentle, very fine new building designed by those cool, precise, measured architects Stanton Williams for the Royal Botanic Gardens. It houses an underground bunker that promises to contain samples of 10% of the world's seed-bearing flora by 2010, and is already home to examples of all 1,400 British seed-bearing species, of which 357 are currently endangered. Above, in a flowering of subtle, uncompromised modern design that reminds me more than a little of the great Louis Kahn's peerless Kimbell Art Gallery at Fort Worth, Texas (one of the greatest buildings of the 20th century), is an exhibition that tells us why it is now imperative that we collect and nurture this extraordinary biodiversity of vegetable life. This venture by the Kew Gardens team is utterly compelling. I could have taken root here. Lottery money made the new project and the Stanton Williams building that houses it possible. The Millennium Commission provided \u00a330m, with the rest of the \u00a380m needed coming from the Wellcome Trust, Orange plc (as in mobile phones) and private individuals. Most of that money has been spent on what you don't see, except with special permission or through virtual tours by visitor-operated computers. Or big windows looking into laboratories. Why? Because the cash has been invested in a vast underground bunker in which seeds from all over the world rest their weary pods, safe from every pesticidal attempt to exterminate them above ground. Like Americans who pay a fortune to have their bodies frozen in the hope of being revived again, these thousands of seeds are waiting to replenish the fields, forests and flowerbeds of the future. The vault they rest in is kept at a constant temperature of -20C. The seeds are also here to enhance our understanding of the effects of pollution, pesticides and global warming and to assist the medical industry in developing safe new drugs. They represent the fruit of a collaboration between Kew Gardens and an increasing number of countries from around the world. To date, Burkina-Faso, Kenya, Madagascar, Lebanon, South Africa and the United States have joined hands with Britain. Yet such thoughts are probably far from most visitors' minds as they pilot their lead-free Metros, Clios and Espaces into the gates of Wakehurst Place. Here, among the birches and beeches, the rhododendrons and choruses of hypericums and skimmias, landed gently between lovingly preserved woodland, wetland and grassland, is the new Stanton Williams building. It comprises a fan of five bright, airy, barrel-vaulted concrete and glass sheds and, to one side, a matching greenhouse. This cluster of buildings is as gentle as it is clear-sighted, and the interiors are deft and subtle. The public exhibition spaces are a delight to walk through, the wintry sunlight feeling its way through the low-lying clouds and reaching into corners, none of which are prey to unsympathetic artificial lighting. A cross between temple, art gallery, aircraft hangar, greenhouse and laboratory - you can see the boffins at work behind big glass windows - the Seed Bank is a compelling architectural flowering and the kind of place where you learn so very much and so quickly. The actual exhibition part of the project - the bit you see - has been shaped by Land Design Studio. The first thing the designers have chosen to show us is a giant, floor-to-ceiling seed wall. It looks great, while the individual seeds prove to be very beautiful as you get up close. The interactive bit - there has to be one, doesn't there? - is actually very good, offering a virtual reality tour of the cold storage. You can open the seed jars and learn about the plants you are unearthing. What I would like to see is a speeded-up film of every single one of these seeds bursting into life; maybe this can come in time, and with another grant. To date, though, there is more than enough to keep all but the most jaded, computer-crazy visitor enchanted and engrossed. I promised myself not to write about that wretched Millennium Experience but, compared with the Millennium Seed Bank, it has taught us nothing at all, except how to waste money in a vain attempt to make a new government look \"with it\". Here, in Sussex, all is calm, all is bright, and though there is little birdsong (we may soon need a Millennium Nest Bank to store the eggs of our quickly vanishing songbirds), there is a sense of something truly worthwhile being done on our behalf as we cover what's left of our countryside with natty executive housing and distribution depots full of pesticide-sprayed food. Stanton Williams are masters of restrained modern architecture. Theirs is a chaste aesthetic, yet here the curved roofs, twisting metal stairs, big glass screens and vaults modulated to allow different plays of daylight at different times of day and year produce a building that is more than the sum of its parts. It shows, too, how well contemporary design can be implanted in mature rural settings. As do the giant seed sculptures here by Peter Randall-Page. Most of all, it should leave visitors with a sense of the sheer magic of the natural world, of how what we build and what we devour as the self-appointed master species can yet be balanced with other forms of life, so easily stepped on, brushed aside or sprayed into premature extinction. This is one of the very best of the millennium projects - architecturally, morally, intellectually, naturally - and one that will be flowering for all our sakes in hundreds of years to come. \u0095 The Millennium Seed Bank is at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, West Sussex (01444 894066). Life Without Life is at the Royal Pump Rooms, Royal Leamington Spa (01926 742700), from January 20 to February 25.",

      "body": "<p>Nice was always odd. It's odder than ever since the European Conference came to town. I got in one wet night before the summit. Only the Ni\u00e7oise did not seem to be sharing the air of general excitement. Appalled perhaps by the tens of thousands of protesters who arrived at the same time as the presidents and prime ministers, the Ni\u00e7oise had gone to ground. The town was in the hands of police and protesters.</p> <p>The result was a curiously hemmed-in feeling. In a new Europe, that was tearing down national borders, Nice had turned into a town filled with checkpoints and border guards. An unaccompanied visitor without the right papers, and the right badges, was very exposed.</p> <p>I got caught in a fracas near the station where a lot of people in Venetian carnival masks were lying on the tracks to prevent trains leaving. I had to make a diversion to get out and that took me up the road to the border with Monaco, where several anarchists told me that they planned to build a big white cardboard wall with office box-files because, they said: \"The rich live in a ghetto there.\"</p> <p>I hate walls, even cardboard walls, and building them seems an odd occupation for libertarians. I passed the LiberT'ea cafe and headed for the beach. How different a city looks when it's ringed by police. The beachfront was swept free of life though lights burned at the Westminster Hotel. The huge sweep of the Promenade des Anglais, along the Bay of Angels, was bare of tourists. The Nice seafront needs tourists. Without them, the neon palm trees and the illuminated Father Christmasses climbing the lampposts, and even the monstrous carbuncle of the Negresco Hotel, seemed forlorn.</p> <p>This great stretch of the city had been changed into something called the Red Zone, and cordoned off. Presidents, prime ministers and their delegations from the 15 member states of the EU were staying there with their teams of bag-carrying lackeys. In the Red Zone, too, were the dozen heads of state of the applicant countries. A curious brooding hung over the Bay of Angels.</p> <p>Odd, because this is the Cte d'Azure, the French Riviera, and it is supposed to be where you have fun. But if the delegates to the European Conference, as this EU summit is known, were enjoying the Cte d'Azure, it was a chilly, damp, Swedish fun they were having. I had to get my very own cort\u00e8ge to my hotel. Two outriders with blue lights. It was the only way through. At the hotel, I was given a badge and papers that would allow me past the riot police and to the summit itself, which was being held at the Acropolis across town.</p> <p>Papers were not enough. What I hadn't got, I realised next morning, was a delegation. The delegates in the Red Zone travelled to the Acropolis the way they used to do in the old Soviet states of eastern Europe - in convoy, along tightly policed special corridors linking their hotels to the summit meeting rooms. Since many of the countries applying for EU membership were once Soviet satellites, this way of travelling must have brought on a flush of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu .</p> <p>No taxis were allowed in the Red Zone. The best thing was to walk to the Acropolis. I was joined by a man from La Stampa, the Italian newspaper, who also lacked a delegation. He was not pleased, not with Nice or Europe. I said that was the way it was, in the Midi, sometimes one had to improvise. He said no, it wasn't simply bad, it was insupportable. There was no transport, no cigarettes. It began to rain. That's when we saw the bus. The city had become a nightmare, said the driver, but we were heading more or less in the right direction. \"I've been in Brussels for 20 years, covering European affairs, and this is the first time I ever went to a conference by bus,\" said the man from La Stampa.</p> <p>I lost my Italian companion in the centre of town, when I got off to walk to the Acropolis. Riot police and demonstrators were thick around the beautiful arcades of the Gallery Lafayette. The cops wore protective armour and carried batons and teargas launchers. The demonstrators wore protective armour and carried face masks - and tools. Builders tools, sappers tools. Spades and chisels.</p> <p>The last time I saw tools like that was in Berlin, in November 1989; the Wall was being taken down, stone by stone, by people with little hammers and chisels. Woodpeckers, they were called, and all night long the chink of steel on stone rang through the dark ness. In Nice, hooded protesters were using their tools to tear up cobbles and throw them through the windows of boutiques. One young man broke the glass of a bank and lit a fire in the entrance. He had the hood of his duffel coat pulled down over his face, which made it difficult to get the flames going well, but he managed. The police began firing tear gas. I walked on.</p> <p>The mood inside the conference halls was striking. A sense of something unstoppable. A feeling that this summit was going to work, because too many people had too much at stake to see it fail. Europe may be a stumbling, uncertain creature, but it was going ahead.</p> <p>The Nice summit looked backwards to the future. It was a kind of valedictory. The Yalta accords that carved up Europe into western and eastern fiefdoms were finished. The Berlin Wall was dead and buried. The divisions between western and eastern Europe were over. The 15 countries of the EU knew this. So did the aspiring joiners. A dozen countries wanted in and they wanted it soon. Thirteen, if you counted Turkey. Even Switzerland, that notorious non-joiner, was there.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the German question has been in many ways at the heart of matter in Nice. Years ago, in the old Soviet Union, someone asked me: \"If we were free to come, would you have us?\" It was in Germany that this question was answered when the old line between east and west was erased. Germany chose reunification and the cost was great. But the cost of keeping out the old DDR was much greater.</p> <p>Nice turns a lot of assumptions on their heads. Europe needs more Europeans; put another way, Europe needs more immigrants. There is the new scramble for Europe and members are going to squabble over the takings. That is only natural. And the auguries are muddled.</p> <p>In the halls of the Acropolis, one thing seemed commonly held: it is better to fudge than fight. But no amount of fudging hid the different natures of different countries. Anyone watching the various heads of states and their retinues, effortlessly reflecting what might be called their defining tribal tics, saw that no one was going to mash them up into some sort of Euro-stew. In fact, if there was a paradox inherent in European expansion it was this: the more the union grows together, the more distinct become the national traits of its members.</p> <p>Some have likened the Nice summit to a long, late-night poker game. It isn't really. Poker is sedentary. Watching Jospin and Blair and Schroder pulling up to the Acropolis in their home-grown limousines, flying their national flags, followed by their national teams of negotiators, carrying briefcases hewn from the hides of patriotic and, one supposes, entirely sane French, British and German cows, what you really see are teams of athletes fit and smiling, and ready to knock hell out of the opposing teams. Summitry is a bruising contact sport played by consenting adults. It is ice hockey for politicians.</p> <p>Blair looks good on ice, he stays calm at high speeds. Maybe it helps that after years of coming to Europe and complaining, he leads a goverment that wants to amount to something in Europe instead of railing against it. Because what Nice makes clear, all over again, is that Europe, however you define it, is the only game in town.</p> <p>For the rest there are vexed questions of detail. How do you adjust the machinery to open the club and still allow each country to punch at more or less its fighting weight? How to assign Germany greater clout, to reflect its central position, its numbers and its muscle, without seeing it throw that weight around? How do you stop big states ganging up, or smaller countries using their veto to block any move they don't like. What about defence? What is the point of a European Union that needs to call on the US every time a fire breaks out in its own backyard?</p> <p>But these are, in a sense, minor matters. Something was happening in Nice that has not happened in Europe since, perhaps, the Middle Ages. A Europe where borders increasingly disappear. Where citizens of two dozen countries move and work where they choose. Where to make room means giving ground.</p> <p>For the moment Europe is 15 strong and family photos are restricted to members only. Estonian television had been excluded from even attending the ceremony because, an official explained apologetically, \"you're not in yet\". \"I think that's discrimination,\" said the Estonians. It was. And it was what this Nice summit was meant to fix. Declarations of love were all very well, but when would Europe name the day?</p> <p>What was not touched upon in Nice, except by the people in the streets, were the people in the streets of the countries that make Europe. Though they made their presence felt. As the heads of government arrived for the photo shoot, as Jacques Chirac smiled (a brave move for a man whose former chief of staff had just been flung into jail on charges of siphoning off public money), the unmistakable acrid touch of tear gas wafted down the air conditioning system, and I had the rare pleasure of seeing politicians biting back tears.</p> <p>One might say about tear gas what Trotsky once said about foreign policy. You may not care about it, but it cares about you.</p> <p>This is the great unanswered question of summits such as Nice - where are the people in all this? Unconsulted, unpersuaded, and uncertain. Perhaps that was the good service the cagouled ones with their trenching tools did us. They reminded everyone that Europe was not made of delegations and motorcades. The politicians and the European commissioners were in their redoubt behind massed ranks of riot police, and the only people on the streets were tearing them up.</p> <p>The people on the streets may not like the Europe we have but even they, to judge from their slogans and banners, want more rather than less of it. Their banners were eloquent and very European: \"Free Catalonia\", \"Basques Forever\", \"Free Occitania\" . . . Occitania? That's a new one. I live there and we don't, as yet, have a liberation army.</p> <p>What Nice exposes is that the two-tier Europe some people talk about is here already though not in predictable form. One is governed by politicians and guarded by the police, and the other contains the people who are nowhere to be seen and whose views on these enormous events are hard to elicit.</p> <p>For an instant, as I was leaving, the two Europes seemed to collide on the giant television screens in the press centre. The screens showed footage of the leaders' deliberations, beamed live from the Acropolis. On the screen, a spokesman for one of the 27 countries present was talking without sound about matters European, maybe it was the charter of human rights, the veto, the banana wars with the US, the rapid reaction force, or qualified majority voting . It did not matter, the sound was off. His suit was blue, his manner grave.</p> <p>Below him, a second monitor that had been showing, for reasons unknown, old episodes of Dallas, suddenly changed the picture and we got for several glorious minutes a ripe piece of erotica. Two well-fleshed people on a rumpled bed made vigorous love; their bed trembled, the sheets fluttered, while all the time above their embrace, the blue-suited spokesman opened and closed his lips. A knot of journalists gathered around the monitor. This was more like it. Then a cameraman, entering in the spirit of things, did what came naturally, he lifted his camera and began filming the film.</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/IMF\">IMF and World Bank summit in Prague 2000</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/\">World Trade Organisation summit 1999</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/m2k\">May2K demonstrations</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/debt/0,2759,178197,00.html\">Debt relief</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/emu\">Economic and monetary union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/0,2759,180395,00.html\">European commission</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/0,2759,180401,00.html\">European parliament</a> <br><br><b>Interactive guide</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">How the European nations relate to each other</a> <br><br><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_new\">Updates from protesters - Indymedia</a> <br><a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/nice_council/index_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Press release: Nice summit - EU</a></p>",

On the screen, a spokesman for one of the 27 countries present was talking without sound about matters European, maybe it was the charter of human rights, the veto, the banana wars with the US, the rapid reaction force, or qualified majority voting . It did not matter, the sound was off. His suit was blue, his manner grave. Below him, a second monitor that had been showing, for reasons unknown, old episodes of Dallas, suddenly changed the picture and we got for several glorious minutes a ripe piece of erotica. Two well-fleshed people on a rumpled bed made vigorous love; their bed trembled, the sheets fluttered, while all the time above their embrace, the blue-suited spokesman opened and closed his lips. A knot of journalists gathered around the monitor. This was more like it. Then a cameraman, entering in the spirit of things, did what came naturally, he lifted his camera and began filming the film.

Gen Musharraf had launched a high-profile drive to punish those guilty of corruption. \"What does this say about our judicial system, that Nawaz Sharif, who was sentenced and in judicial custody, can be allowed to leave?\" Farhatullah Babar, spokesman for Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party, said. Pakistani intelligence sources said Mr Sharif, whose two terms in office were marked by corruption, had handed over at least two factories to the government. His family assets are estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars. By the time of the coup Mr Sharif had become Pakistan's most powerful prime minister since independence in 1947, using his huge parliamentary majority to amend the constitution and increase his powers.",

It highlights the automotive, information technology and chemical sectors as being particularly weak. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, said: \"Too many companies fail to recognise that research and development, capital investment and innovation are key drivers for business growth and competitiveness.

      "bodyText": "British companies are at risk of losing out because they are not investing as much in their businesses as their international rivals, the government warned today. A new Department of Trade and Industry survey shows that the bulk of Britain's leading manufacturing companies are outlaying proportionately less in capital expenditure than are their foreign competitors. It concludes that Britain's manufacturing sector in general invests two thirds less, in terms of pounds per employee, than its international counterparts, reducing their ability to maintain sales. It highlights the automotive, information technology and chemical sectors as being particularly weak. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, said: \"Too many companies fail to recognise that research and development, capital investment and innovation are key drivers for business growth and competitiveness. Those that fail to invest will be left behind.\" He said that Britain's pharmaceutical, aerospace and defence sectors showed what could be achieved. They exceed the international benchmarks for spending on capital investment (capex) and R&amp;D and were \"world leaders\". Lord Sainsbury, the science and innovation minister, said: \"Our people cannot compete using yesterday's tools.\" The DTI's capital expenditure scoreboard shows that greatest disparity is in the physics-based sectors - IT, electronics, hardware and engineering. Internationally these sectors accounted for 25% of all capex but only 12% in the UK. British subsidiaries of foreign companies tend to invest more in capex terms than the average UK company. The DTI says there was a strong link R&amp;D and capex, with companies that invest heavily in ideas also investing heavily in production. Norman Price, one of the industrialists seconded to the DTI's future and innovation unit, which carried out the survey, said there was a danger that companies invested in their established businesses at the expense of new activities. Increased capital investment in mature business might bring productivity improvements, but such investment was subject to the law of diminishing returns. He said the City should pay more attention to \"transition companies\" which were moving out of low growth, low risk areas into new high growth areas with higher risk. He said such companies should be valued for what they had in the pipeline, as pharmaceutical companies are. He pointed to the success of companies such as mobile phone operator Vodafone which had grown from a medium-sized business into an international company by concentrating investment on a particular sector.",

      "body": "<p>Norman Swallow, who has died aged 79, was the pioneer television producer and documentary film-maker who came within an ace of revolutionising the latter role by abolishing the word \"film\" from it. Wouldn't it make sense, he argued, to record real life straight on to videotape, using television's more light-sensitive electronic cameras?</p> <p>In 1963, the BBC had just tried out the principle in drama, with a production of TS Eliot's Murder In The Cathedral recorded in its actual location at Canterbury Cathedral. Now, for Granada, Swallow was going to put documentary to the test with a homelier subject also centred on a church, A Wedding On Saturday, featuring a young couple picked at random - colliery fitter Don Forshaw and his bride Pam, both of South Elmsall, Yorkshire.</p> <p>With the help of his friend and colleague Denis Mitchell, Swallow opened up the occasion to yield what I described at the time as television's most robust, least condescending, bit of sociology ever. The production went on to win the prestigious Italia Prize, and Swallow forecast that the use of film on television would die out.</p> <p>Sadly, this was not to happen. Though lightweight cameras and recording equipment were being developed, Swallow still had to use the massive apparatus of the conventional outside broadcast unit, with mobile control room, recording van and generator parked alongside the location, all needing an hour's warm-up time. It was not easy to be spontaneous.</p> <p>Furthermore, editing the raw material - in A Wedding's case, 19 hours of it - was complicated and time-consuming. Swallow and Mitchell shot three more subjects in the same manner, but when, in 1966, Ken Loach used a hand-held 16mm film camera to catch his drama-documentaries Up The Junction and Cathy Come Home on the wing, the battle was lost.</p> <p>Swallow was born in Eccles, Lancashire, the son of the headmaster of a Church of England-endowed school. He went to Manchester grammar school, from where he won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, to read history and moral philosophy. Called up for war service, he found himself in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, defending Brighton power station.</p> <p>He and his girlfriend, Madeline, were married in 1945, whereupon he was sent to Palestine and saw plenty of action against the Irgun Zvei Leumi terrorists. In 1947, as his demob date was approaching, he spotted a job vacancy advertisement by the BBC in Manchester. He applied immediately, but could he possibly get back in time for the interview? Despite a bomb attack on the train taking him to Haifa, he made it with 24 hours to spare, and landed the job.</p> <p>At the time, BBC north region was highly influential and innovative. It was here that Swallow first met Mitchell, who had pioneered the use of the new-fangled tape recorder to capture the voices and sentiments of ordinary folk, and was about to venture into television.

      "bodyText": "Norman Swallow, who has died aged 79, was the pioneer television producer and documentary film-maker who came within an ace of revolutionising the latter role by abolishing the word \"film\" from it. Wouldn't it make sense, he argued, to record real life straight on to videotape, using television's more light-sensitive electronic cameras? In 1963, the BBC had just tried out the principle in drama, with a production of TS Eliot's Murder In The Cathedral recorded in its actual location at Canterbury Cathedral. Now, for Granada, Swallow was going to put documentary to the test with a homelier subject also centred on a church, A Wedding On Saturday, featuring a young couple picked at random - colliery fitter Don Forshaw and his bride Pam, both of South Elmsall, Yorkshire. With the help of his friend and colleague Denis Mitchell, Swallow opened up the occasion to yield what I described at the time as television's most robust, least condescending, bit of sociology ever. The production went on to win the prestigious Italia Prize, and Swallow forecast that the use of film on television would die out. Sadly, this was not to happen. Though lightweight cameras and recording equipment were being developed, Swallow still had to use the massive apparatus of the conventional outside broadcast unit, with mobile control room, recording van and generator parked alongside the location, all needing an hour's warm-up time. It was not easy to be spontaneous. Furthermore, editing the raw material - in A Wedding's case, 19 hours of it - was complicated and time-consuming. Swallow and Mitchell shot three more subjects in the same manner, but when, in 1966, Ken Loach used a hand-held 16mm film camera to catch his drama-documentaries Up The Junction and Cathy Come Home on the wing, the battle was lost. Swallow was born in Eccles, Lancashire, the son of the headmaster of a Church of England-endowed school. He went to Manchester grammar school, from where he won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, to read history and moral philosophy. Called up for war service, he found himself in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, defending Brighton power station. He and his girlfriend, Madeline, were married in 1945, whereupon he was sent to Palestine and saw plenty of action against the Irgun Zvei Leumi terrorists. In 1947, as his demob date was approaching, he spotted a job vacancy advertisement by the BBC in Manchester. He applied immediately, but could he possibly get back in time for the interview? Despite a bomb attack on the train taking him to Haifa, he made it with 24 hours to spare, and landed the job. At the time, BBC north region was highly influential and innovative. It was here that Swallow first met Mitchell, who had pioneered the use of the new-fangled tape recorder to capture the voices and sentiments of ordinary folk, and was about to venture into television. Swallow was, meanwhile, transferred to the Television Service in London on his own merits, starting at Alexandra Palace on the same day as David Attenborough. By the early 1960s, he was on the then all-important current affairs show Panorama, edited by Paul Fox. He made his mark with a series of reports from India and the Far East, using Ludovic Kennedy as reporter. His move to Granada, in 1963, set the pattern of his future career, shuttling between the two organisations he held in most esteem. For Granada, the failure of his video-documentary dream put aside, he marked the 50th anniversary of the Russian revolution with Ten Days That Shook The World, made with the cooperation of Soviet TV, and, 10 years later, pondered another long drawn-out revolution in the 13-part series, The Christians, in which Bamber Gascoigne toured historic sites. For the BBC, he successfully edited the arts programme Omnibus, and then, in 1978, produced Clouds Of Glory, two wild and wonderful films about the lakeland poets, directed by Ken Russell, whose talent Swallow had spotted years before, when he referred him to Huw Wheldon, who set him to work on Monitor. Swallow's last great project, in 1985, was a 13-part Granada series on television itself, called simply Television.

      "body": "<b>Dave Hill:</b> Tell me about the theme of your inaugural lecture. What lies behind the title: Back To The Boys?: Temptations of the Good Gender Theorist? <p><b>Lynne Segal:</b> Well, although this is a rather august occasion, there's obviously a tease in the title. Should we be going back to the boys? Why is the gender theorist, who of course came out of women's studies, talking about men and masculinity at all? That's a serious issue for some feminist scholars, who fought hard to set up women's studies programmes in the 1970s, usually only found a home in the academy in the1980s, and didn't appear in the old universities \u00ad if at all - until quite recently. </p> <p>Moreover, that move has accompanied a switch of designation from women's studies to gender studies, incorporating the immense interest in men and masculinity, burgeoning since, and only since, the 1990s. Some feminists see gender studies as a way of sidelining women and the problems they still face, while allowing men into the spaces which women fought to open up. But I don't see this, in itself, as such a serious issue, because as I see that feminist scholarship now has emerged within all the disciplines. Or at least, that's what we're fighting for, and that's the important thing.</p> <p><b>DH:</b> Your most recent book asks the question, \"why feminism?\" But what is feminism these days? And why is it relevant to today's society?</p> <p><b>LS:</b> Lots of people like to see feminism as part of the problem of the present overloaded working day. Both the workplace and the home are now such demanding and divided terrain to occupy. If we want rewarding jobs, we're all expected to be able to sacrifice our home lives for them. </p> <p>And feminism is blamed for this, as if all we wanted was to exchange our primary concern for the home for career success. In fact, of course, what feminists fought for was the negation of this: to make the demands of the job better suited to the demands of the home and participation in wider community life. </p> <p>And we wanted the joys and burdens of caring for ourselves and other people, of raising our children and building communal lives to involve men. This meant shorter working time, shorter working days; men as well as women helping to create richer lives for all. And in that sense, feminism failed. </p> <p>Nothing upsets me and those feminists I was closest to more than to see how we are nowadays portrayed. We hardly have been more concerned, or emphasised more often, that in trying to create a new world for women we were creating a new world for men. If you read what people like Sheila Rowbotham wrote, there's no mistaking it. Nobody's saying, \"Right! All women into the workforce! We can all work longer hours!\"</p> <p><b>DH:</b> What do you make of the recent appearance of some prominent women in public life, as in the House of Commons or the House of Lords?</p> <p><b>LS:</b> It's a question of how one looks at it. Another way in which 70s feminism has been caricatured is by naming it \"equality feminism\". It is an odd move, when its goal was to transform the world, not just see women in powerful jobs. </p> <p>But, of course, I'm I want to see women on top, women having it all, if they can, and want to. But at the same time I think any formal equality agenda misses out on much of the feminist project. </p> <p>But the first thing to notice, of course, is that prominent women MPS have come and gone rather fast. And when they go there's usually a lot of sneering following them - whether it's Harriet Harman or Mo Mowlam. You almost hear the top boys' sighs of relief. Blunkett or Brown never seem to be in the same sort of jeapody, and when Mandelson went he popped up again pretty fast. The women don't.</p> <p><b>DH:</b> Well he's gay so that's all right, isn't it? [Laughter]</p> <p><b>LS:</b> Except that gay men, too, may yearn for all the symbolic trappings of manhood. Women in power come in for more stick. It's the contradictions which women so obviously represent once they are in positions of power. It's very easy to attack the powerful woman, who should carry the burden of representing the softer, gentler values - wherever they are!</p> <p><b>DH:</b> How do you evaluate the current anxieties about boys and their performance in schools?</p> <p><b> LS:</b> Just a few months ago Blunkett was fulminating about the fact that equality had gone too far in the schools, and there was going to be a serious backlash. A backlash? This was all because 0.6% of boys - less than 1% of boys \u00ad for the first time ever, had done worse at A-levels than girls! </p> <p>Nothing could be less enlightening here than to make a gender comparison, blaming the girls and the attention they receive, rather than make the more relevant comparison between boys, to see which boys were failing and why. That, of course, would bring out factors about class, about neighbourhoods, about state schools - all the things that Blunkett himnself is responsible for. He's simply refusing to tackle the problem.</p> <p><b>DH:</b> Blair seems to vacillate over the kind of man he wants to be seen as. It's partly just trying to be all things to all people - as politicians must. But you know, he's the man who takes a bit of paternity leave but not too much in case it looks bad. There's this anxiety about giving it up isn't there?</p> <p><b>LS:</b> That's right. Again it comes back to the question of \"what is masculinity?\" Well, it is primarily about what it a man is not: not feminine; not passive; not gay; not subordinate. </p> <p>Showing you are not anything which could be seen as inferior. And this goes very deep. </p> <p>There's also nothing new about it - it's always been there. Nowadays there's more and more work being done on the history of manhood. You\u00b9ll find it was the same a hundred years ago: this fear of effeminacy; fear that you had to take the boys away from their mothers or else they wouldn't be manly enough to out and defend the British empire. </p> <p>Indeed, it's thought to be why the empire was lost. There's always been this horror and fear that men won't stay on top. It's also just as traditional to blame all social problems on women, and women usurping men's place.</p> <p><b>DH:</b> I'm fascinated by the David Beckham phenomenon, the whole public performance. I think the hatred he inspires in some men is about more than jealously over the fact that he's rich, talented, married to a pop star and got sent off in the World Cup. </p> <p>I think it goes much deeper. It's to do with the fact that he is a tough, competitive, aggressive athlete and at the same time a devoted partner and father, vain, beautiful - all those \"feminine\" things. People just can't stand him being both those of qualities simultaneously. It's breaking all the rules. It literally horrifies them.</p> <p><b>LS:</b> Yes, he's in women's space as well isn't he? He exemplifies the problem all men face on a smaller stage. Because in a sense the more tough and manly you are, the more danger you face, as figure of fun, object of desire, or some other negative. </p> <p>Just look at Sylvester Stallone, grunting, suffering, flexing his muscles and preening like a beauty queen. You're absurd, and displaying masculinity itself as a joke, as not something to be taken seriously. </p> <p>But also, the only way we can know things are securely masculine is if they occur in a space that women, or anyone else who can be seen as inferior (whether black men or other subordinated groups of men) are excluded from. </p> <p>And that's why football, in its media versions, can be a place that substitutes for masculinity. You have to have this space that excludes women, and then what men do there can be solidly masculine! </p> <p>But no place ever eternally excludes women, or gay men and their desire, or the desire of straight men for narcissistic mirroring. That is the basis of homosocial. bonding. For men to identify with other men, they must not fancy them. But, of course, they do. And so homophobia also has to be written into the script of what it is to be a man.</p> <p><b>DH:</b> But boys and young men have got to find new ways of being men, haven't they? They're not all going to be footballers? They're not even going to be coalminers either, are they? Or website millionaires?</p> <p><b>LS:</b> That's the problem. What are they going to be? Well, the first thing they've got to see is it's certainly not going to be very different from what the women in their groups are going to be. </p> <p>They hopefully want to have meaningful jobs. They want to have good relationships, and more equal relationships, if they are to happy relationships - unlike the unhappy homes I and so many of us came from. And they are hopefully going to find ways of raising children not in poverty. </p> <p>There you are. I think that covers the lot, doesn't it?</p>",

That's a serious issue for some feminist scholars, who fought hard to set up women's studies programmes in the 1970s, usually only found a home in the academy in the1980s, and didn't appear in the old universities if at all - until quite recently. Moreover, that move has accompanied a switch of designation from women's studies to gender studies, incorporating the immense interest in men and masculinity, burgeoning since, and only since, the 1990s. Some feminists see gender studies as a way of sidelining women and the problems they still face, while allowing men into the spaces which women fought to open up. But I don't see this, in itself, as such a serious issue, because as I see that feminist scholarship now has emerged within all the disciplines. Or at least, that's what we're fighting for, and that's the important thing. DH: Your most recent book asks the question, \"why feminism?\" But what is feminism these days? And why is it relevant to today's society? LS: Lots of people like to see feminism as part of the problem of the present overloaded working day. Both the workplace and the home are now such demanding and divided terrain to occupy. If we want rewarding jobs, we're all expected to be able to sacrifice our home lives for them. And feminism is blamed for this, as if all we wanted was to exchange our primary concern for the home for career success. In fact, of course, what feminists fought for was the negation of this: to make the demands of the job better suited to the demands of the home and participation in wider community life. And we wanted the joys and burdens of caring for ourselves and other people, of raising our children and building communal lives to involve men. This meant shorter working time, shorter working days; men as well as women helping to create richer lives for all. And in that sense, feminism failed. Nothing upsets me and those feminists I was closest to more than to see how we are nowadays portrayed. We hardly have been more concerned, or emphasised more often, that in trying to create a new world for women we were creating a new world for men. If you read what people like Sheila Rowbotham wrote, there's no mistaking it. Nobody's saying, \"Right! All women into the workforce! We can all work longer hours!\" DH: What do you make of the recent appearance of some prominent women in public life, as in the House of Commons or the House of Lords? LS: It's a question of how one looks at it. Another way in which 70s feminism has been caricatured is by naming it \"equality feminism\". It is an odd move, when its goal was to transform the world, not just see women in powerful jobs. But, of course, I'm I want to see women on top, women having it all, if they can, and want to. But at the same time I think any formal equality agenda misses out on much of the feminist project. But the first thing to notice, of course, is that prominent women MPS have come and gone rather fast. And when they go there's usually a lot of sneering following them - whether it's Harriet Harman or Mo Mowlam. You almost hear the top boys' sighs of relief. Blunkett or Brown never seem to be in the same sort of jeapody, and when Mandelson went he popped up again pretty fast. The women don't. DH: Well he's gay so that's all right, isn't it? [Laughter] LS: Except that gay men, too, may yearn for all the symbolic trappings of manhood. Women in power come in for more stick. It's the contradictions which women so obviously represent once they are in positions of power. It's very easy to attack the powerful woman, who should carry the burden of representing the softer, gentler values - wherever they are! DH: How do you evaluate the current anxieties about boys and their performance in schools? LS: Just a few months ago Blunkett was fulminating about the fact that equality had gone too far in the schools, and there was going to be a serious backlash. A backlash? This was all because 0.6% of boys - less than 1% of boys for the first time ever, had done worse at A-levels than girls! Nothing could be less enlightening here than to make a gender comparison, blaming the girls and the attention they receive, rather than make the more relevant comparison between boys, to see which boys were failing and why. That, of course, would bring out factors about class, about neighbourhoods, about state schools - all the things that Blunkett himnself is responsible for. He's simply refusing to tackle the problem. DH: Blair seems to vacillate over the kind of man he wants to be seen as. It's partly just trying to be all things to all people - as politicians must. But you know, he's the man who takes a bit of paternity leave but not too much in case it looks bad. There's this anxiety about giving it up isn't there? LS: That's right. Again it comes back to the question of \"what is masculinity?\" Well, it is primarily about what it a man is not: not feminine; not passive; not gay; not subordinate. Showing you are not anything which could be seen as inferior. And this goes very deep. There's also nothing new about it - it's always been there. Nowadays there's more and more work being done on the history of manhood. You\u00b9ll find it was the same a hundred years ago: this fear of effeminacy; fear that you had to take the boys away from their mothers or else they wouldn't be manly enough to out and defend the British empire. Indeed, it's thought to be why the empire was lost. There's always been this horror and fear that men won't stay on top. It's also just as traditional to blame all social problems on women, and women usurping men's place. DH: I'm fascinated by the David Beckham phenomenon, the whole public performance. I think the hatred he inspires in some men is about more than jealously over the fact that he's rich, talented, married to a pop star and got sent off in the World Cup. I think it goes much deeper. It's to do with the fact that he is a tough, competitive, aggressive athlete and at the same time a devoted partner and father, vain, beautiful - all those \"feminine\" things. People just can't stand him being both those of qualities simultaneously. It's breaking all the rules. It literally horrifies them. LS: Yes, he's in women's space as well isn't he? He exemplifies the problem all men face on a smaller stage. Because in a sense the more tough and manly you are, the more danger you face, as figure of fun, object of desire, or some other negative. Just look at Sylvester Stallone, grunting, suffering, flexing his muscles and preening like a beauty queen. You're absurd, and displaying masculinity itself as a joke, as not something to be taken seriously. But also, the only way we can know things are securely masculine is if they occur in a space that women, or anyone else who can be seen as inferior (whether black men or other subordinated groups of men) are excluded from. And that's why football, in its media versions, can be a place that substitutes for masculinity. You have to have this space that excludes women, and then what men do there can be solidly masculine! But no place ever eternally excludes women, or gay men and their desire, or the desire of straight men for narcissistic mirroring. That is the basis of homosocial. bonding. For men to identify with other men, they must not fancy them. But, of course, they do. And so homophobia also has to be written into the script of what it is to be a man. DH: But boys and young men have got to find new ways of being men, haven't they? They're not all going to be footballers? They're not even going to be coalminers either, are they? Or website millionaires? LS: That's the problem. What are they going to be? Well, the first thing they've got to see is it's certainly not going to be very different from what the women in their groups are going to be. They hopefully want to have meaningful jobs. They want to have good relationships, and more equal relationships, if they are to happy relationships - unlike the unhappy homes I and so many of us came from. And they are hopefully going to find ways of raising children not in poverty. There you are. I think that covers the lot, doesn't it?",

      "body": "<p>For the 40 employees still trooping in each day to work for Express Digital Media's remaining four websites, the future is bleak. Following last month's \u00a3125m takeover of the newspaper group by Richard Desmond, publisher of OK! and various adult magazines, staff have been put on 30 day's notice. </p> <p> In letters delivered to them last week the closure of the sites was described as \"likely\", and although there are still three weeks of the \"consultation period\" left, some staff expect the axe to fall before then. Ian Monk, a spokesman for Desmond, says the sites are \"desperately unprofitable\", heading for a loss this year of \u00a38m. Refusing to say whether there had been approaches to buy any of the sites, he says: \"There are options which have been put forward, which include redevelopment or closure as we seek ways of making them more profitable. Should the sites be closed, every attempt will be made to find staff new roles within the group.\" </p> <p> The new owners, Northern and Shell, publisher of porn magazines including Asian Babes, has its own \"major internet strategy\" under new media director Matthew Bugden, says Monk, and the OK! site will be \"considerably redeveloped\". \"Newspapers in general are examining again what the internet can do for them. The Guardian and Associated Newspapers are very keen, but if you look at the Sun and News International, you will see they are scaling down their interest,\" Monk says. </p> <p>Tony Cuthbertson, director of Express Digital Media, rejects the claim that high costs and advertising revenues of only around \u00a3240,000 a year meant the websites - except for lads' site MegaStar, which Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media has retained - were already dead ducks. \"All the sites had business plans in place, and all the funding had been agreed,\" he says, stressing that advertising revenue would increase. </p> <p>Of Express Digital Media's four sites, the Express website, SportLive, Allaboutparents.co.uk and Company-Leader.com, the last two have been up and running for less than four months. Reflecting relative optimism before the takeover, SportLive was in the process of hiring a new journalist as the surprise arrival of Desmond was being played out. \"They offered me the job knowing the Express was going to be sold, but they thought they were all going to stay with United,\" says the journalist. \"They were completely shocked - they had been given budgets and were looking to expand. They were planning for the future, and aiming to do more of their own content.\" </p> <p>Similarly, Neil Harley-Rudd, of design consultancy UK Media, had been invited to redesign the Express websites just before the takeover speculation reached its zenith late last month. \"I had a message from the internet editor asking me to do it, but then, from emails I received, it seemed to get less of a sure thing and I've not heard anything since,\" he says. While Cuthbertson stresses that \"all the sites are still up and running, with all their features, and they are being updated as normal\", one former Express employee is less positive. \"There is a lot of fear and morale has gone through the floor,\" he says. \"The root cause is that United got online very late into a crowded market and didn't invest enough. \"There is also the theory that the Express was not a big enough brand for the internet market. It had a low internet conversion of its readers. The main site has not been going two years and the two which are less than four months old have never had a chance. But the foundations of the whole operation were wrong, and always seemed muddled. The Express site began under LineOne, the internet service provider that United owned with BT, and now has up for sale.\" </p> <p> A former employee of Express Digital Media says: \"At first, the Express site was within LineOne and really just provided it with news content until this spring. Only later did it start to become a proper site in its own right, although it looks like those plans will not come to fruition. \"It was only quite late this year that SportLive and MegaStar were given any significant funding. They were a tremendous team doing a very good job, but with no resources. Allaboutparents and Company-Leader were vertical sites, modelled on Guardian Unlimited, with the idea being to put the various strengths of the paper onto the net, but they have just not had a chance. You can't justifiably shut them down on the question of profitability. </p> <p> \"I can't believe the Express is going to be the only newspaper without an internet site, which is now such an important part of the brand development of a paper.\" Hugo Drayton, the Telegraph's new media managing director, agrees that the muddle of the framework behind the sites did not help. \"They had too many disparate things going on,\" he says. \"Other, more successful sites had better strategies. Websites are an easy target because they are usually nobody's fiefdom. They do not offer any short-term return. The owners are doing what anyone new does - looking at where they can trim and cut down duplication. That said, from what I have read and heard they were not operating as viable propositions anyway. </p> <p>\"But I will be very surprised if they did not reopen something in the next six months, an online and newspaper strategy which complement one another.\" That Desmond is taking a cost- minimising approach to the internet is perhaps reflected in his response to a request to find a replacement for the outgoing health editor. \"Why do we need a health reporter? Get it off the internet, it's free,\" he is reported to have said. </p> <p>Within the newspaper stable, it is the Star which is more profitable than the Express, and on the internet, MegaStar emerged as the strongest Express site. Some may argue that glamour and the lower end of the market are what Desmond knows best, but Lord Hollick kept MegaStar, which has just benefited from a \u00a33m advertising campaign. Since the start of that campaign, the number of individual users has grown by 40,000 to 330,000 and monthly page impressions now average 18.7m. Drayton says he would not be surprised if the group's internet future was more downmarket. \"Pornography and gambling are two things which often lead new technology, and did so with audio text phoneline services and then the internet as forerunners for more acceptable sites,\" he says. \"Desmond will no doubt have learnt from the experience of the adult sites\". </p> <p> A recent survey claims that 36% of home internet users are more interested in porn than sports or news - something that will not be news to Richard Desmond.</p>",

Tony Cuthbertson, director of Express Digital Media, rejects the claim that high costs and advertising revenues of only around \u00a3240,000 a year meant the websites - except for lads' site MegaStar, which Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media has retained - were already dead ducks. \"All the sites had business plans in place, and all the funding had been agreed,\" he says, stressing that advertising revenue would increase. Of Express Digital Media's four sites, the Express website, SportLive, Allaboutparents.co.uk and Company-Leader.com, the last two have been up and running for less than four months. Reflecting relative optimism before the takeover, SportLive was in the process of hiring a new journalist as the surprise arrival of Desmond was being played out. \"They offered me the job knowing the Express was going to be sold, but they thought they were all going to stay with United,\" says the journalist. \"They were completely shocked - they had been given budgets and were looking to expand. They were planning for the future, and aiming to do more of their own content.\" Similarly, Neil Harley-Rudd, of design consultancy UK Media, had been invited to redesign the Express websites just before the takeover speculation reached its zenith late last month. \"I had a message from the internet editor asking me to do it, but then, from emails I received, it seemed to get less of a sure thing and I've not heard anything since,\" he says. While Cuthbertson stresses that \"all the sites are still up and running, with all their features, and they are being updated as normal\", one former Express employee is less positive. \"There is a lot of fear and morale has gone through the floor,\" he says. \"The root cause is that United got online very late into a crowded market and didn't invest enough. \"There is also the theory that the Express was not a big enough brand for the internet market. It had a low internet conversion of its readers. The main site has not been going two years and the two which are less than four months old have never had a chance. But the foundations of the whole operation were wrong, and always seemed muddled. The Express site began under LineOne, the internet service provider that United owned with BT, and now has up for sale.\" A former employee of Express Digital Media says: \"At first, the Express site was within LineOne and really just provided it with news content until this spring. Only later did it start to become a proper site in its own right, although it looks like those plans will not come to fruition. \"It was only quite late this year that SportLive and MegaStar were given any significant funding. They were a tremendous team doing a very good job, but with no resources. Allaboutparents and Company-Leader were vertical sites, modelled on Guardian Unlimited, with the idea being to put the various strengths of the paper onto the net, but they have just not had a chance. You can't justifiably shut them down on the question of profitability. \"I can't believe the Express is going to be the only newspaper without an internet site, which is now such an important part of the brand development of a paper.\" Hugo Drayton, the Telegraph's new media managing director, agrees that the muddle of the framework behind the sites did not help. \"They had too many disparate things going on,\" he says. \"Other, more successful sites had better strategies. Websites are an easy target because they are usually nobody's fiefdom. They do not offer any short-term return. The owners are doing what anyone new does - looking at where they can trim and cut down duplication. That said, from what I have read and heard they were not operating as viable propositions anyway. \"But I will be very surprised if they did not reopen something in the next six months, an online and newspaper strategy which complement one another.\" That Desmond is taking a cost- minimising approach to the internet is perhaps reflected in his response to a request to find a replacement for the outgoing health editor. \"Why do we need a health reporter? Get it off the internet, it's free,\" he is reported to have said. Within the newspaper stable, it is the Star which is more profitable than the Express, and on the internet, MegaStar emerged as the strongest Express site. Some may argue that glamour and the lower end of the market are what Desmond knows best, but Lord Hollick kept MegaStar, which has just benefited from a \u00a33m advertising campaign. Since the start of that campaign, the number of individual users has grown by 40,000 to 330,000 and monthly page impressions now average 18.7m. Drayton says he would not be surprised if the group's internet future was more downmarket. \"Pornography and gambling are two things which often lead new technology, and did so with audio text phoneline services and then the internet as forerunners for more acceptable sites,\" he says. \"Desmond will no doubt have learnt from the experience of the adult sites\". A recent survey claims that 36% of home internet users are more interested in porn than sports or news - something that will not be news to Richard Desmond.",

      "bodyText": "First came the narrowly divided presidential and congressional elections. Then there was the desperately close run poll in Florida. Last week the Florida supreme court split 4-3 in favour of counting the votes, as Al Gore wanted. At the weekend the US supreme court split 5-4 in favour of stopping the count, thus supporting George W Bush. Every twist in the five-week drama that has consumed America since November 7 has been marked by sharp divides and intense partisanship. Today, in perhaps the final act of the drama, the supreme court in Washington faces a decision which puts its authority as America's national arbiter on the line as few in history have done. The question before the nine justices is whether the court can take any decision on the presidential election which will not be seen as a partisan ruling. For much of its lifetime, the over which the conservative chief justice William Rehnquist has presided for the past 14 years has tried to avoid divisions. As recently as last week it issued a unanimous ruling after its first deliberation on the Florida election. Its decision to pass the legal issues back to the Florida supreme court in Tallahassee embodied the doctrine of \"judicial restraint\" which has often been a hallmark of the Rehnquist court. But Saturday's decision transformed all that. The 5-4 ruling to \"stay\" the count authorised by a 4-3 majority on the Florida supreme court only 24 hours earlier catapulted the US supreme court's role from cautious supervision to direct engagement. If nothing else, it almost certainly inaugurated a new period in which the court, and its members, are certain to become much more controversial. Three main groups of justices have been decisive in the events of the past 48 hours. The conservatives are led by Mr Rehnquist,and include Antonin Scalia and court's only black member, Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation hearings in 1991 produced one of the most bitter fights in the history of the appointment process. All three voted in favour of the stay, and Mr Scalia wrote an accompanying opinion in which he said the majority believed that Mr Bush had \"a substantial probability of success\". Opposed to them are the four liberals, headed by the oldest member of the court, John Paul Stevens, 80. Ranged alongside him are the two members nominated during Bill Clinton's eight-year period of office - Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, and Stephen Breyer, a former Watergate prosecutor - and David Souter, who was nominated by President George Bush in 1990 but who, in the view of conservatives, has defected to the liberals on litmus-test issues. These four made up the minority which opposed the stay on Saturday and on whose behalf Mr Stevens wrote a note of dissent warning that approving it would \"inevitably cast a cloud over the legitimacy of the election\". That leaves the two justices in the centre, who tend to vote with the conservatives, as they did on Saturday, but sometimes side with the liberals, as Mr Gore's lawyers hope they will after today's hearing. Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy were both nominated during the Ronald Reagan era, but both have revealed an independence in their voting which makes them the court's key swing members. Mr Kennedy, in particular, will be the focus of the Gore lawyers' arguments. If either of the centrists swings to the liberal side today, Mr Gore will win. The key legal question the court has to decide is largely the the one which confronted it 10 days ago, when it heard Bush's previous appeal against the Florida supreme court's November 21 ruling permitting recounts in three of the state's counties. The issue is whether the Florida court has overstepped its authority to interpret Florida law into areas governed by the US constitution and federal law, of which the US supreme court is the ultimate guardian. Today's arguments will therefore focus on jurisdiction, not on whether it is right or wrong to hold recounts, and not on the rules which the recounts should follow. The crucial documents in the case are article two of the constitution, which governs the calling of the electoral college by each state \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\", and section five of the 1877 United States Code, which says that states must resolve questions concerning their electoral college members according to procedures that were in effect on election day. Mr Bush is now arguing that the Florida supreme court has exceeded its once powers again. His lawyers say the Florida court's action on Friday \"imperilled\" his chances of taking Florida's 25 electoral college votes by raising \"a reasonable possibility that the votes will be called into doubt\", and did so too close to the electoral college deadline for him to get relief from the courts. In granting the stay and agreeing to hear the case today, however, some of the justices seem to have been willing to broaden the issue from a basic \"who does what\" argument between the different courts. Mr Scalia's opinion is that \"the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm [to Mr Bush]\". By raising the whole issue of the recounts and the procedures, Mr Scalia has certainly widened the legal argument and has increased the political stakes for the court as it hears today's case.",

Had a reputation in Washington as a highly conservative federal judge before his appointment to the supreme court. A brilliant and aggressive legal mind, given to intervening during oral arguments. Wrote a powerful opinion in support of Saturday's decision by the court to intervene and stop the Florida count. John Paul Stevens, 80 Appointed by Gerald Ford in 1976. The oldest member of the court and its senior liberal, although he was once considered a centrist. Formerly a federal appeals court judge and a lawyer in private practice. Always supports abortion rights and affirmative action but is against fixed-term limits for office holders, on which he wrote the court's ground-breaking opinion in 1995. Supports suspects' rights in the criminal justice system. The author of the minority opinion on Saturday's ruling. Likely to step down during the next presidential term. Sandra Day O'Connor, 70 Appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1981. The first woman to serve on the supreme court, though subsequently joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Once active in Republican politics in her native Arizona. Once a staunch conservative but has become more liberal on some social issues. Often the key swing member, especially today, with Anthony Kennedy. Has been pivotal in earlier cases on voting rights, voting against redrawing of electoral districts on racial lines. Pro abortion, anti-affirmative action. May step down in the next four to eight years.",

      "byline": "Peter Preston",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Now we can glimpse the end of this American endgame, and pretty damned dismal it looks, too. Everything, top to bottom, side to side, is politics. Everybody has a spin. There is no higher authority - only low, calculating authority - so there can be no respect for authority, or the decisions it proclaims. That is the curse the US supreme court has brought upon itself.</p> <p>Some time in the next 24 hours, the ultimate keepers of the constitution have chosen to decide who will be the next president of the United States. If they let the hand recounts in Florida go on, then we'll get Albert Gore Junior. If, as they seem so minded, they stop those recounts, then it will be George W Bush. Either way, the stench of politics infects their court room.</p> <p>The moment this court of last resort split five votes to four was the moment these emperors of the law lost their clothes. They became not lordly beings commanding respect, but individual human beings with a history and an angle. They became mere players in an infernal, corroding drama.</p> <p>Do you hear the four horsemen of the apocalypse galloping round the Washington beltway? Keep calm. This isn't the end of the world. There will be a new president and a new administration soon and American democracy won't shatter. Doom deferred. But, equally, cynicism - prime begetter of apathy - is the only big winner here; and there is a genuine feel of tragedy to the way that every twist along the road makes things worse.</p> <p>An outsider from a foreign country called Britain has one advantage surveying such shambles. I am not, and cannot be, a partisan Democrat or a partisan Republican. I come from elsewhere. I may personally prefer some - not all - of Gore's policies, but the man himself is an uninspiring, wooden hulk. (Edna O'Brien calls him \"The Wardrobe\".) Bush, by contrast, may be intellectually punier, but he tells good jokes, clearly connects with middle America and has gathered some shrewd operators around him. This is a decent democratic choice, as usual: it is not the edge of some grand canyon.</p> <p>The question - from night one, four anguished weeks ago - is: who chooses? The voters, by their ballots. But what if the machinery of this vast election, ludicrously rickety and fallible, isn't up to the job? What if, instead of resolution, there is no solution? Then, in democracy, we have \"the rule of law\". Then the legal eagles fly in.</p> <p>Ah! democracy, the American way. So thorough, so zealous, so much to admire. It means that the canvassing boards who supervise the elections and the counts are political nominees. It means that the state officials who certify those returns are elected politicians. It means the same for the judges on up through the chain to the Florida supreme court (with an election in waiting, even for them, after a first term on that bench). It means that the battalions of lawyers making their cases come from Republican or Democratic firms and translate their masters' political imperatives into legal language. It means that the administration of justice itself is politically accountable.</p> <p>Good thing? Often, when the will of the people, expressed at the ballot box, needs to be turned into verdicts - on racism, say - that make the law part of the evolving fabric of society. But a bad, bad thing when the decisions to be made reach to the heart of the legal process itself, when there is, in perception, no such thing as an independent judiciary.</p> <p>Because ordinary Americans understand their system of governance, they are not, most of the time, either surprised or dismayed by the politicisation of their legal machinery. They find the checks and balances of different elections, working their way out over years, broadly satisfactory. They are utterly used to politicians running for office threatening, if elected, \"to throw out the liberal judges who are dragging our country down\". They clearly registered the Gore warning that Bush would appoint three or four anti-abortion judges to the supreme court who could unpick Roe v Wade and a woman's right to choose.</p> <p>In that way, even the US supreme court is an accepted part of the political landscape. But tomorrow's crucial vote is different. Here, essentially, the nine judges are deciding who will follow them and thus define the political lean of their court for decades to come. When they pick the president, they pick the man who will nominate their own successors. When they do that - especially as they divide along party lines - they put their authority in pawn. They signal that everything in American life is politics, which means that everything is manipulable and fixable.</p> <p>There have - in retrospect - been many better outcomes along the way of the past four weeks.

      "bodyText": "Now we can glimpse the end of this American endgame, and pretty damned dismal it looks, too. Everything, top to bottom, side to side, is politics. Everybody has a spin. There is no higher authority - only low, calculating authority - so there can be no respect for authority, or the decisions it proclaims. That is the curse the US supreme court has brought upon itself. Some time in the next 24 hours, the ultimate keepers of the constitution have chosen to decide who will be the next president of the United States. If they let the hand recounts in Florida go on, then we'll get Albert Gore Junior. If, as they seem so minded, they stop those recounts, then it will be George W Bush. Either way, the stench of politics infects their court room. The moment this court of last resort split five votes to four was the moment these emperors of the law lost their clothes. They became not lordly beings commanding respect, but individual human beings with a history and an angle. They became mere players in an infernal, corroding drama. Do you hear the four horsemen of the apocalypse galloping round the Washington beltway? Keep calm. This isn't the end of the world. There will be a new president and a new administration soon and American democracy won't shatter. Doom deferred. But, equally, cynicism - prime begetter of apathy - is the only big winner here; and there is a genuine feel of tragedy to the way that every twist along the road makes things worse. An outsider from a foreign country called Britain has one advantage surveying such shambles. I am not, and cannot be, a partisan Democrat or a partisan Republican. I come from elsewhere. I may personally prefer some - not all - of Gore's policies, but the man himself is an uninspiring, wooden hulk. (Edna O'Brien calls him \"The Wardrobe\".) Bush, by contrast, may be intellectually punier, but he tells good jokes, clearly connects with middle America and has gathered some shrewd operators around him. This is a decent democratic choice, as usual: it is not the edge of some grand canyon. The question - from night one, four anguished weeks ago - is: who chooses? The voters, by their ballots. But what if the machinery of this vast election, ludicrously rickety and fallible, isn't up to the job? What if, instead of resolution, there is no solution? Then, in democracy, we have \"the rule of law\". Then the legal eagles fly in. Ah! democracy, the American way. So thorough, so zealous, so much to admire. It means that the canvassing boards who supervise the elections and the counts are political nominees. It means that the state officials who certify those returns are elected politicians. It means the same for the judges on up through the chain to the Florida supreme court (with an election in waiting, even for them, after a first term on that bench). It means that the battalions of lawyers making their cases come from Republican or Democratic firms and translate their masters' political imperatives into legal language. It means that the administration of justice itself is politically accountable. Good thing? Often, when the will of the people, expressed at the ballot box, needs to be turned into verdicts - on racism, say - that make the law part of the evolving fabric of society. But a bad, bad thing when the decisions to be made reach to the heart of the legal process itself, when there is, in perception, no such thing as an independent judiciary. Because ordinary Americans understand their system of governance, they are not, most of the time, either surprised or dismayed by the politicisation of their legal machinery. They find the checks and balances of different elections, working their way out over years, broadly satisfactory. They are utterly used to politicians running for office threatening, if elected, \"to throw out the liberal judges who are dragging our country down\". They clearly registered the Gore warning that Bush would appoint three or four anti-abortion judges to the supreme court who could unpick Roe v Wade and a woman's right to choose. In that way, even the US supreme court is an accepted part of the political landscape. But tomorrow's crucial vote is different. Here, essentially, the nine judges are deciding who will follow them and thus define the political lean of their court for decades to come. When they pick the president, they pick the man who will nominate their own successors. When they do that - especially as they divide along party lines - they put their authority in pawn. They signal that everything in American life is politics, which means that everything is manipulable and fixable. There have - in retrospect - been many better outcomes along the way of the past four weeks. It would have been better if the Florida votes had been re-recounted across the state when Gore made that offer. It would have been better - first time round - if the Florida supreme court had been more flexible on time frames and more specific on hanging chads. It would have been better if the first intervention from the US supreme court had been more decisive and, perhaps, if the Florida court's final throw hadn't happened. Then, at least, a grimacing Gore would have found his support on Capitol Hill fading away and a country ready - after a fashion - to see what President Bush could achieve. Not an an end to argument or bitterness, to be sure: but an end that could, for a while, have been accepted. There's no such end in sight now.

(When Justice Scalia says he wants the hand counts stopped because continuing them might undermine the validity of the election, he inevitably puts Bush's validity and his own validity above a voter intent that favours Gore.)

I attribute the smooth transition from carnivore to almost herbivore to the long gestation period of my conversion - and to the total absence of morality from my motivation. </p> <p>Although bass, sole, cod and, above all, haddock are still at risk, it was seafood that first convinced me of the need for a discriminatory diet.

Similarly, pheasant was easily abandoned when I discovered that the eggs are carefully hatched and the young birds reared by hand in order that they can be shot when they learn to fly. The thought of eating what had once been living shotgun targets put me off game forever. Veal, however, was different. </p> <p>I have loved veal ever since, at university, my closest friend's fiance (Austrian by both birth and inclination) cooked me Wiener schnitzel. At the time I believed it to be an exotic version of deep-fried plaice. But even when I realised that it was what the Oxford dictionary calls \"flesh of the calf\", I still thought of it as food of the gods. Then, 30 years later, I read about how we bred calves and my appetite shrank. </p> <p>Earlier Endpiece complaints about intensive farming have prompted Guardian readers to send me a subtle suggestion. If I was really concerned about calves' welfare, I should stuff myself with veal for three meals a day - thus keeping as many animals as possible in Britain rather than risking their live export to countries in which they still spend their anaemic lives in dark packing cases. I ignored the advice. Perhaps I could have single-handedly saved a calf a year. But I wanted no part of the veal business. </p> <p>I turned my back on beef, mutton and pork for the same sorts of reasons. Watching television news - not an invariable source of either inspiration or education - I saw film of cattle trucks being stopped at the border between France and Italy. The pictures were supposed to illustrate the spread of BSE across Europe. But the sight of the cattle looking out of the lorries stimulated quite a different image in my mind. I thought of slaughterhouses. Suddenly, I did not want beef to be butchered on my behalf. </p> <p>My decision was not built on sentiment. I was not concerned with whether the cattle in question were likely to meet a \"humane\" end. Nor was I influenced by the discovery that the opera festival with which I am associated is to produce Shostakovich's The Nose, in which the eponymous organ is reunited with its owner via a sandwich. I became a vegetarian because cutting up animals and eating the pieces suddenly seemed a bizarre way to live. I make no complaint against people who take a different view. And I certainly do not suggest that my position is more moral than theirs. </p> <p>Were I not afraid of the word, I would claim that it was aesthetic considerations that changed my mind - the thought of blood on abattoirs' floors, skinned carcasses moving along conveyor belts, torn-off pelts lying in heaps and red-raw joints of meat being prepared for the butchers' shops. My feelings were not so much \"shame!\" as \"ugh!\" </p> <p>So giving up meat was not a sacrifice. The thought of cutting up the carcasses was an aversion therapy in itself. But I remained apprehensive about being regarded as a \"veggie\" - a body of men and women whom I still associated with rope-soled sandals and folk dancing. I feared that I had sacrificed the reputation of being, at heart, a soccer hooligan. My identity crisis came a week ago in Derbyshire. </p> <p>I was presenting awards at a dinner which, although described as \"literary\", was addressed by Richard Whiteley. Inevitably a waitress, plate in hand, wandered the dining room crying: \"Who's the vegetarian?\" Feebly, I held my hand in the air.

But that did not prevent him attacking the incumbent, Ehud Barak, for mishandling the 10-week Palestinian uprising and the peace process, or announcing that he was a contender anyway.</p> <p>Last night he urged the knesset (parliament) to change the election law to allow him to stand, or to vote for dissolution, which would also smooth the way for his candidacy by letting him stand as an MP as well - parliament and prime minister are separately elected.</p> <p>\"In order to restore security for Israeli citizens, every home, mother and child in Israel and to establish a stable and strong government that will unite the nation ... I hereby declare my candidacy,\" he said.</p> <p>Israel's complicated election law bars Mr Netanyahu from standing in the special electionbecause he is not an MP. He has also given up the leadership of his rightwing Likud party, presently under the stewardship of the former general Ariel Sharon.</p> <p>That was precisely Mr Barak's calculation when he submitted his resignation to President Moshe Katzav to stand for re-election. In effect, his shock announcement cut the former prime minister out of the picture - \"the most cynical trick in the history of the nation,\" Mr Netanyahu called it last night.</p> <p>If Mr Netanyahu is allowed to stand, opinion polls predict a walkover. During the insurrection in the West Bank and Gaza, Mr Barak's support has fallen away with dizzying speed.</p> <p>The right, which has gained ground during the crisis, accuses him of being too soft on the Palestinians - a charge made with increasing frequency as Israeli casualties mount. Nearly 40 of the 310 dead during the last 10 weeks are Jews or Israeli soldiers.</p> <p>If Mr Netanyahu's supporters in his party can remove the obstacles to his candidacy, the February election will be a replay of Israel's last polls less than two years ago. Mr Barak emerged from the May 1999 election with 56% of the popular vote, a relative landslide by Israeli standards. Mr Netanyahu went into political hibernation, the humiliation of his defeat compounded by his investigation on corruption charges.</p> <p>But by the weekend, opinion polls were giving Mr Netanyahu roughly a 20-point advantage over Mr Barak, prompting his surprise announcement on Saturday night.</p> <p>The prime minister stands a far better chance against Mr Sharon.</p> <p>\"An hour doesn't pass when a citizen doesn't come up to me and say, 'Come back and make the country what it used to be - a place where we could live',\" Mr Netanyahu said.</p> <p>The claim says much about Israelis' short-term memory. Mr Netanyahu's three-year tenure was notable for its acrimony, both in Israel and with the Palestinians, who watched in frustration and dismay as the peace process ground to a halt.</p> <p>Mr Netanyahu and his wife Sara were haunted by a corruption scandal. Although the attorney general decided in September not to charge the couple, his report on the affair said that Mr Netanyahu's conduct was not suitable for a man in public office.</p> <p>Many analysts now blame the three-year freeze in the peace process under Mr Netanyahu for the eruption of Palestinian rage in late September. Yesterday Mr Barak told his first election rally that his rightwing opponents had yet to come up with a realistic vision for the Middle East.</p> <p>At his press conference last night Mr Netanyahu spoke only of a \"cold peace\", without much elaboration.</p> <p>\"The problem of the Likud is not who will be its leader, but that it doesn't have an alternative way or position that can change reality,\" Mr Barak said.</p> <p>However, after 10 weeks of bloodshed, the Palestinians have lost all faith in Mr Barak's ability to bring about change. Even if he does return to power, without an overhaul of the fractured parliament he would find it just as difficult to govern as before.</p> <p>Yesterday the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, said Mr Barak's resignation meant yet another setback to the efforts for peace.</p> <p>\"[There is] no doubt that the resignation will mean peace negotiations will be put on hold until the end of the election,\" Mr Arafat said.</p> <p>He said he was very disappointed in Mr Barak's efforts to date.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nineteen months after his drubbing at the polls, Binyamin Netanyahu returned to Israel's political stage as its self-proclaimed saviour yesterday, declaring his candidacy in a prime ministerial election. Legally he cannot enter the contest to be Israel's next prime minister because he is not an MP. But that did not prevent him attacking the incumbent, Ehud Barak, for mishandling the 10-week Palestinian uprising and the peace process, or announcing that he was a contender anyway. Last night he urged the knesset (parliament) to change the election law to allow him to stand, or to vote for dissolution, which would also smooth the way for his candidacy by letting him stand as an MP as well - parliament and prime minister are separately elected. \"In order to restore security for Israeli citizens, every home, mother and child in Israel and to establish a stable and strong government that will unite the nation ... I hereby declare my candidacy,\" he said. Israel's complicated election law bars Mr Netanyahu from standing in the special electionbecause he is not an MP. He has also given up the leadership of his rightwing Likud party, presently under the stewardship of the former general Ariel Sharon. That was precisely Mr Barak's calculation when he submitted his resignation to President Moshe Katzav to stand for re-election. In effect, his shock announcement cut the former prime minister out of the picture - \"the most cynical trick in the history of the nation,\" Mr Netanyahu called it last night. If Mr Netanyahu is allowed to stand, opinion polls predict a walkover. During the insurrection in the West Bank and Gaza, Mr Barak's support has fallen away with dizzying speed. The right, which has gained ground during the crisis, accuses him of being too soft on the Palestinians - a charge made with increasing frequency as Israeli casualties mount. Nearly 40 of the 310 dead during the last 10 weeks are Jews or Israeli soldiers. If Mr Netanyahu's supporters in his party can remove the obstacles to his candidacy, the February election will be a replay of Israel's last polls less than two years ago. Mr Barak emerged from the May 1999 election with 56% of the popular vote, a relative landslide by Israeli standards. Mr Netanyahu went into political hibernation, the humiliation of his defeat compounded by his investigation on corruption charges. But by the weekend, opinion polls were giving Mr Netanyahu roughly a 20-point advantage over Mr Barak, prompting his surprise announcement on Saturday night. The prime minister stands a far better chance against Mr Sharon. \"An hour doesn't pass when a citizen doesn't come up to me and say, 'Come back and make the country what it used to be - a place where we could live',\" Mr Netanyahu said. The claim says much about Israelis' short-term memory. Mr Netanyahu's three-year tenure was notable for its acrimony, both in Israel and with the Palestinians, who watched in frustration and dismay as the peace process ground to a halt. Mr Netanyahu and his wife Sara were haunted by a corruption scandal. Although the attorney general decided in September not to charge the couple, his report on the affair said that Mr Netanyahu's conduct was not suitable for a man in public office. Many analysts now blame the three-year freeze in the peace process under Mr Netanyahu for the eruption of Palestinian rage in late September. Yesterday Mr Barak told his first election rally that his rightwing opponents had yet to come up with a realistic vision for the Middle East. At his press conference last night Mr Netanyahu spoke only of a \"cold peace\", without much elaboration. \"The problem of the Likud is not who will be its leader, but that it doesn't have an alternative way or position that can change reality,\" Mr Barak said. However, after 10 weeks of bloodshed, the Palestinians have lost all faith in Mr Barak's ability to bring about change. Even if he does return to power, without an overhaul of the fractured parliament he would find it just as difficult to govern as before. Yesterday the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, said Mr Barak's resignation meant yet another setback to the efforts for peace. \"[There is] no doubt that the resignation will mean peace negotiations will be put on hold until the end of the election,\" Mr Arafat said. He said he was very disappointed in Mr Barak's efforts to date.",

      "body": "<p>A subtle shift has occurred in the lexicon of globalisation over the past 12 months. Prior to Seattle, it was assumed that there was an inexorable logic to the process and that, despite the objections, the market supremacist model would benefit rich and poor alike. </p> <p>This line of argument was, of course, particularly attractive to those doing rather well out of globalisation, which - surprise, surprise - just happened to be the wealthy and the powerful. In other words, the same people who had done rather well out of the policies favoured by right wing governments in the 80s and 90s and could not see why people were making such a big fuss about mass unemployment and rising inequality. </p> <p>Since Seattle, the mood has changed. Globalisation is no longer viewed as a force of nature, rather like the weather, but something that can and must be shaped by human endeavour and ingenuity. It has been recognised that there are inherent problems in a system where capital calls all the shots and has total freedom of movement, while labour is voiceless and has to stay where it is. </p> <p>The release of the government's white paper on globalisation today is a step in the right direction, as is its title - eliminating world poverty: making globalisation work for the poor. Clare Short, the international development secretary, rightly says in the foreword: \"Cynicism and negativism are the enemies of progress. It is when people see that progress is possible that the demand for reform and advance is energised.\" </p> <p>Making globalisation people friendly requires two things - a closing of the yawning democratic deficit and a re-balancing of the lop-sided relationship between labour and capital. One proposal is that any future trade deals should contain a commitment to abiding by core labour standards, with sanctions against those countries that breached the global code. Unsurprisingly, poor countries are extremely hostile to this idea, seeing it as a back door form of protectionism, which it is. As Ajit and Ann Zammit argue in a paper written for the South Centre - an intergovernmental organisation of developing countries - there is a better way. </p> <p>The paper's argument is fairly straightforward. Labour standards improved in the west as countries became richer not because draconian conditions were imposed on them from outside. The main factor preventing labour standards from improving in the developing world is poverty and economic hardship, not the wickedness of governments. </p> <p>Moreover, it says that \"adopting measures which are tantamount to forcing compliance with ILO core labour standards will not achieve the declared objective of raising labour standards in the south. Indeed, this would be quite the wrong way to go about achieving improved labour standards, both core and otherwise, in developing countries.\" </p> <p>Even so, there may be some in the north who would say that workers in developed countries deserve to be protected, whether labour standards improve in the developing world or not. </p> <p>In fact, there is not much evidence that this would happen even if goods from developing countries were priced out of western markets. Why? Because the most severe competition for advanced countries comes from the small number of newly industrialising countries whose productivity growth rate is much faster than that of advanced countries, not from those countries that would become the targets of trade sanctions. </p> <p>Singh and Zammit say that in recent years there has actually been greater slippage in labour standards in the north than in the south. But they argue that the main cause of this malaise \"lies in the current processes of economic globalisation, which emphasise free trade, free movement of capital, and labour market flexibility within national economies. Most analysts will agree that the last two characteristics disadvantage labour, north and south, and favour capital\". </p> <p>This is not the perception in the north, particularly in those industries, such as textiles, which are threatened with extinction by cheap imports. The lack of western-style labour standards is seen as leading to greater import penetration, undermining efforts by northern trade unions to improve the terms and conditions of work and providing incentives to shift production to the south. </p> <p>But while exports from developing countries have been growing rapidly, most manufacturing trade of the advanced countries takes place between these countries themselves and only a small fraction - 1.5% excluding China - is with developing countries. </p> <p>In the circumstances, Singh and Zammit say it is difficult to argue that this has been the cause of huge shifts in income inequality and mass unemployment in the west, particularly since the rapid growth of Japanese exports to the developed world in the 50s and 60s (when Japan was essentially a developing country) was accompanied by full employment and rising real wages in the US and Europe.

      "bodyText": "A subtle shift has occurred in the lexicon of globalisation over the past 12 months. Prior to Seattle, it was assumed that there was an inexorable logic to the process and that, despite the objections, the market supremacist model would benefit rich and poor alike. This line of argument was, of course, particularly attractive to those doing rather well out of globalisation, which - surprise, surprise - just happened to be the wealthy and the powerful. In other words, the same people who had done rather well out of the policies favoured by right wing governments in the 80s and 90s and could not see why people were making such a big fuss about mass unemployment and rising inequality. Since Seattle, the mood has changed. Globalisation is no longer viewed as a force of nature, rather like the weather, but something that can and must be shaped by human endeavour and ingenuity. It has been recognised that there are inherent problems in a system where capital calls all the shots and has total freedom of movement, while labour is voiceless and has to stay where it is. The release of the government's white paper on globalisation today is a step in the right direction, as is its title - eliminating world poverty: making globalisation work for the poor. Clare Short, the international development secretary, rightly says in the foreword: \"Cynicism and negativism are the enemies of progress. It is when people see that progress is possible that the demand for reform and advance is energised.\" Making globalisation people friendly requires two things - a closing of the yawning democratic deficit and a re-balancing of the lop-sided relationship between labour and capital. One proposal is that any future trade deals should contain a commitment to abiding by core labour standards, with sanctions against those countries that breached the global code. Unsurprisingly, poor countries are extremely hostile to this idea, seeing it as a back door form of protectionism, which it is. As Ajit and Ann Zammit argue in a paper written for the South Centre - an intergovernmental organisation of developing countries - there is a better way. The paper's argument is fairly straightforward. Labour standards improved in the west as countries became richer not because draconian conditions were imposed on them from outside. The main factor preventing labour standards from improving in the developing world is poverty and economic hardship, not the wickedness of governments. Moreover, it says that \"adopting measures which are tantamount to forcing compliance with ILO core labour standards will not achieve the declared objective of raising labour standards in the south. Indeed, this would be quite the wrong way to go about achieving improved labour standards, both core and otherwise, in developing countries.\" Even so, there may be some in the north who would say that workers in developed countries deserve to be protected, whether labour standards improve in the developing world or not. In fact, there is not much evidence that this would happen even if goods from developing countries were priced out of western markets. Why? Because the most severe competition for advanced countries comes from the small number of newly industrialising countries whose productivity growth rate is much faster than that of advanced countries, not from those countries that would become the targets of trade sanctions. Singh and Zammit say that in recent years there has actually been greater slippage in labour standards in the north than in the south. But they argue that the main cause of this malaise \"lies in the current processes of economic globalisation, which emphasise free trade, free movement of capital, and labour market flexibility within national economies. Most analysts will agree that the last two characteristics disadvantage labour, north and south, and favour capital\". This is not the perception in the north, particularly in those industries, such as textiles, which are threatened with extinction by cheap imports. The lack of western-style labour standards is seen as leading to greater import penetration, undermining efforts by northern trade unions to improve the terms and conditions of work and providing incentives to shift production to the south. But while exports from developing countries have been growing rapidly, most manufacturing trade of the advanced countries takes place between these countries themselves and only a small fraction - 1.5% excluding China - is with developing countries. In the circumstances, Singh and Zammit say it is difficult to argue that this has been the cause of huge shifts in income inequality and mass unemployment in the west, particularly since the rapid growth of Japanese exports to the developed world in the 50s and 60s (when Japan was essentially a developing country) was accompanied by full employment and rising real wages in the US and Europe. The main difference between then and the more recent period is the fact that in the earlier period advanced economies were growing at about 5% a year compared with half that long-term rate since 1973. As such, imposing labour standards on developing countries would at best be an irrelevance and at worst positively harmful. For the really poor nations, a code backed by sanctions would choke off export growth, worsening the balance of payments, and force growth rates to be lower to keep the current account in equilibrium. Asian tigers The experience of the Asian tigers is that this would slow up the pace of structural change and hinder the improvement in working conditions. Real wages grew 5% a year between early 80s and mid-90s in east Asia and south-east Asia, countries that were repressive of trade unions in their early stages of development. But the pace of growth led to the expansion the formal economy at the expense of the informal sector, leading not only to better labour standards but a very considerable expansion of unionisation.

Specifically, this entails among other things close cooperation between leading economies, so that international demand expansion is not thwarted by co-ordination failures and balance of payments disequilibria.\" Their solution, in short, is one where the burden of economic adjustment falls on creditor as well as debtor nations, where developing countries are given special and preferential treatment in trade agreements, where a floor is put under commodity prices and where controls on the free movement of capital permit more rapid economic expansion.

He quoted me as follows: \"On Monday Glen Smythe of the Police Federation described facing an armed suspect as 'exciting'.\" I did use that word, however the context in which I used it was: \"I can remember not so many years ago I myself was faced with an armed robber on the railway lines in the dark in Acton. That was a pretty exciting episode, he was armed, I wasn't. We chased him, it was only by the grace of God nobody was killed but he surprised me and there was no cover for me. In those circumstances it is reasonable for one to have been 'stirred into action', 'be agitated' and be 'stimulated' by the situation - dictionary definition of 'excited'.\" Glen Smythe Chairman, Metropolitan Police Federation",

Last night the Equitable Life Members' Action group, which has been coordinating complaints, was meeting to discuss the feasibility of legal action on behalf of policyholders who are not protected by guaranteed annuity products. They are expected to make a further statement regarding their decision this week. Equitable put itself up for sale in July after House of Lords judges ruled its attempt to cut bonus rates on with-profits pension plans, to offset rising liabilities from guaranteed annuity products, put it in breach of its contract with customers. Last Friday's decision to close the doors to new business followed the failure of negotiations with the Prudential, the last potential buyer. Today the company publishes a notice assuring policyholders the society remains intact and all benefits will continue to be paid out in line with the contractual obligations of their policies. It has also given those who have taken a policy out within the last 14 days the option of cancelling up until December 22.

Engineering companies clustered around the Longbridge plant in Birmingham have traditionally focused production on the giant plant, funding their operations through overdrafts with high street banks. But banks have made it clear that they consider this strategy too risky and will continue funding only companies which diversify away from Rover.

      "body": "<p>With its Tibetan bakeries and congenial muesli breakfast parlours, Dharamsala is arguably the most pleasant place in the world to be an exile. The former Raj hill resort, in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India, has long attracted refugees - most famously, of course, the Dalai Lama, who came here in 1959 after fleeing Tibet.</p> <p>He lives in a green-roofed bungalow, opposite the Tibetan temple, just down the road from the Om Hotel. These days getting an audience with His Holiness is a tricky business, such is his popularity, but if you are persistent it can still be arranged.</p> <p>Since escaping from Chinese oppression, the Dalai Lama has been joined by thousands of other Tibetans, many of whom have moved to Dharamsala merely to get a glimpse of him. The town is now an important centre of Buddhist learning.</p> <p>It is also one of the most popular tourist destinations in north India, where backpackers can be heard mumbling to each other over waffles: \"I'm not a tourist really, it's more of a spiritual thing.\" Some of them end up wearing red and maroon robes, shaving their heads, and embracing Buddhism. In the evenings, they gravitate to Dharamsala's many internet cafes.</p> <p>Dharamsala is not really one town but two. The upper part, McLeod Ganj, is named after a former British governor of the Punjab, David McLeod. Most travellers end up here. During the monsoon, the dirt track which connects McLeod Ganj with Dharamsala lower down the valley turns into sludge. In winter it is a pleasant 20-minute walk past good-natured beggars and old Tibetan women whirling prayer wheels.</p> <p>Next to the Dalai Lama's temple, I bumped into Ani Tshampa Drimay - a twice-divorced, 59-year-old German former actress who decided to become a Buddhist nun two years ago. \"In my previous incarnation I was a Tibetan,\" she explained. \"My daughters are very happy for me. I never felt at home in Germany.\"</p> <p>Nearby, a group of young Tibetan monks were waiting for His Holiness to appear. \"I walked for 35 days across the Himalayas. There were 25 of us. I wanted to meet the Dalai Lama,\" said Dogon Rimpoche, from Tibet's Amdo province. \"I left after the death of my father. He was Chinese,\" he added.</p> <p>It is not just backpackers who feel Dharamsala's spiritual allure. Hollywood, too, has its celebrity devotees. Richard Gere visits every March, when the Dalai Lama gives a week-long open seminar. Last March he brought Goldie Hawn with him. Pierce Brosnan also dropped in recently.</p> <p>Inside the temple, elderly yellow-robed lamas from all four of Tibet's schools of Buddhism were banging cymbals and tingling bells. Halfway through the ceremony a living oracle - an old monk wearing an enormous headdress - was brought staggering before His Holiness. The oracle whispered some predictions in the Dalai Lama's ear before being dragged away. A succession of objects was then paraded for blessing: holy texts in orange boxes, dozens of small Buddha statues (one of whose arms fell off) and what looked suspiciously like a carpet. Despite China's best efforts, Tibet lives on.</p> <p>On the outskirts of town another group of exiles can be found - the dead colonial British. Next to the church of St John in the Wilderness, the Earl of Elgin, a viceroy who died in 1863, is buried. His Victorian tomb looks out through a vista of pine trees on to the shimmering plains below. It is appropriate that Lord Elgin should have ended up here - he ordered the sack of Beijing in his previous job and tried to teach the rebellious Chinese a lesson by burning down their summer palace.</p> <p>Inside the Victorian church, a plaque records how another British adventurer \"was eaten by a bear in the woods around Dharamsala\" in 1883.</p>",

Next to the Dalai Lama's temple, I bumped into Ani Tshampa Drimay - a twice-divorced, 59-year-old German former actress who decided to become a Buddhist nun two years ago. \"In my previous incarnation I was a Tibetan,\" she explained. \"My daughters are very happy for me. I never felt at home in Germany.\" Nearby, a group of young Tibetan monks were waiting for His Holiness to appear. \"I walked for 35 days across the Himalayas. There were 25 of us. I wanted to meet the Dalai Lama,\" said Dogon Rimpoche, from Tibet's Amdo province. \"I left after the death of my father. He was Chinese,\" he added. It is not just backpackers who feel Dharamsala's spiritual allure. Hollywood, too, has its celebrity devotees. Richard Gere visits every March, when the Dalai Lama gives a week-long open seminar. Last March he brought Goldie Hawn with him. Pierce Brosnan also dropped in recently. Inside the temple, elderly yellow-robed lamas from all four of Tibet's schools of Buddhism were banging cymbals and tingling bells. Halfway through the ceremony a living oracle - an old monk wearing an enormous headdress - was brought staggering before His Holiness. The oracle whispered some predictions in the Dalai Lama's ear before being dragged away. A succession of objects was then paraded for blessing: holy texts in orange boxes, dozens of small Buddha statues (one of whose arms fell off) and what looked suspiciously like a carpet. Despite China's best efforts, Tibet lives on. On the outskirts of town another group of exiles can be found - the dead colonial British. Next to the church of St John in the Wilderness, the Earl of Elgin, a viceroy who died in 1863, is buried. His Victorian tomb looks out through a vista of pine trees on to the shimmering plains below. It is appropriate that Lord Elgin should have ended up here - he ordered the sack of Beijing in his previous job and tried to teach the rebellious Chinese a lesson by burning down their summer palace. Inside the Victorian church, a plaque records how another British adventurer \"was eaten by a bear in the woods around Dharamsala\" in 1883.",

Punter in receipt of most abuse was Tim Lowes from Associated New Media who picked up the award for sexiest man in new media. The crowd waited with baited breath, only to see an Ian Beale lookalike step up to collect the award. Other recipients of audience heckling were Tara Lloyd-Jones of Engage, who picked up the award for best dressed person to cries of \"she could have made more of an effort\". Theft of the night went to Matt Teeman from beeb.com who beat the lovely Stevey 'Dubya' Wing from Guardian Unlimited to the grand prix of media owner of the year.

      "body": "<p>Without phoning a friend, try this quiz. What do these stories which appeared in papers on November 30 suggest about education secretary David Blunkett's statements at an Institute for Public Policy Research seminar? </p> <p>1. Daily Express, under a picture of a boy laying flowers at the spot where 10-year-old Damilola Taylor died: \"Cabinet minister David Blunkett yesterday condemned the money-mad culture exemplified by TVs Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?\" </p> <p>2. Daily Star, under the headline \"Blunkett 'blames quiz show'\", said he was \"at the centre of a storm last night when he appeared to link Damilola's death to TV quiz show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?\" </p> <p>3. The Independent, in a story which nosed off on the Damilola killing, claimed that Blunkett \"singled out\" the quiz for \"cultivating a popular culture reminiscent of the yuppy era\". </p> <p>4. The Times, again in its Damilola story, quoted Blunkett as criticising the programme. </p> <p>There is no prize because the answer is obvious. Blunkett clearly made a link between the boy's murder and the TV programme. The papers said so. It must be true. Yet it was far from the truth. </p> <p>Before his prepared speech, Blunkett did indeed refer to Damilola's killing, urging the creation of a society in which people don't walk on by when confronted by trouble. He then delivered his prepared text about the relationship between government and people, before a question-and-answer session. </p> <p>The first question was about the influence of consumer capitalism to which Blunkett replied: \"In the 80s, yuppyism was seen as being the end of civilisation. We are back to Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? now. The people who produce programmes have a pretty low view of the rest of the world.\" This somewhat flip, but quite reasonable, response had nothing whatsoever to do with Blunkett's views on the murder of Damilola. </p> <p>Yet the Press Association report wired to newspapers made just that link. By juxtaposing his remarks on Damilola with those on the TV quiz, it looked as if he was suggesting that the programme was somehow responsible for the killing.</p> <p>Alerted to the error during the afternoon, Blunkett's office contacted PA and urged the agency to amend its report. It later did so, filing a substitute story which deleted references to Damilola. </p> <p>By now, a reporter had also contacted the show's presenter, Chris Tarrant, to obtain his comments. But these, of course, were based on the false assumption of Blunkett's linkage between the death and the show. To make matters worse, PA's substitute was not accompanied by a note ordering the previous story to be killed, so some newspapers didn't realise that Blunkett's remarks were not linked. </p> <p>PA news editor Jonathan Grun says: \"Directly we realised there should be no linkage we issued a new story. Blunkett's office seemed happy with that, which is why we didn't add an advisory note. Our watchwords here are 'accuracy and fairness'. The quotes were accurate. But we are happy to accept that it wasn't Mr Blunkett's intention to have his comments linked.\"</p> <p>But IPPR director Matthew Taylor, who chaired the seminar, thought the PA story \"highly tendentious\". Quite apart from the false link, the millionaire remark was an off-the-cuff reply to a question. Not a single word of Blunkett's thought-provoking speech was reported. If the story had come and gone, perhaps none of this would have mattered. Instead, as is common now in a journalistic world dominated by columnists rather than reporters, Blunkett was subjected to days of ill-informed comment.</p> <p>The Sun's Richard Littlejohn was vicious. The Daily Telegraph's Alice Thomson, the Daily Express's Martin Samuels, the News of the World's Michael Winner and the Sunday People's Sue Crawford all took Blunkett to task for making a link he had not made. Even a special PA note to editors which stated that it \"would like to make clear\" that the remarks were not linked was evidently ignored. </p> <p>Days later, Mick Hume in the Times was still criticising Blunkett. By now, it had featured also in the rest of the media, on BBC TV's Question Time and Radio 4's Today. Regional papers, such as the Scotsman - which accused Blunkett of \"moralistic waffle\" - had also weighed in.</p> <p>Never truer was that maxim about a lie being halfway round the world before the truth is out. Though some papers, such as the Times, later ran apologies and several others carried letters, it is highly likely that most people still believe Blunkett blamed Damilola's murder on a gameshow.</p> <p>Even if the error began at PA, it would be wrong to view the agency as the sole villain. This attitude about what constitutes a story stems from the current journalistic culture. It demeans all of us who work in newspapers.</p> <p>Perhaps it would be carrying things too far to claim that falling journalistic standards are one of the reasons for declining sales. Anyway, whatever the reason, they continued their downward path again last month, as our chart below illustrates. It is noticeable though that broadsheet papers are doing much better than the tabloids. Despite slight losses by the Daily Telegraph and the Times, the overall picture for serious daily papers is bright.</p> <p>It is too early yet to tell whether the new ownership of the Daily Express and Daily Star is having an impact, but the scale of Richard Desmond's task is clear. The Express sold only 823,432 copies at its full cover price in November compared to 2.2m sold by the Daily Mail. Of the Sundays, the figure that stands out is undoubtedly the Observer, up by 7.58% year on year. It needs to curb its quota of bulk sales, but these pale in comparison with the Independent on Sunday's 40,000-plus which account for more than 15% of its total.</p> <p>One final note about the two Sunday sports papers which have done so well. Sport First enjoyed its fifth successive sales increase, up to 85,775 copies. The Non-League Paper also sold a creditable 42,216. </p> <p><strong>National Newspaper Circulation</strong></p> <p>November 2000 <strong>November 1999</strong> % change <br><strong>Jun 00-Nov 00</strong> Jun 99-Nov 99 <strong>% change</strong> </p> <p><strong>Dailies</strong></p> <p><strong>The Sun</strong><br> 3,508,319 <strong>3,549,470</strong> -1.16 <strong>3,628,926</strong> 3,637,158 <strong>-0.23</strong></p> <p><strong>The Mirror</strong><br> 2,175,647 <strong>2,276,783</strong> -4.44 <strong>2,263,135</strong> 2,335,733 <strong>-3.11</strong></p> <p><strong>Daily Record</strong><br> 601,854 <strong>640,251</strong> -6.00 <strong>616,335</strong> 638,095 <strong>-3.41</strong></p> <p><strong>Daily Star</strong> <br>631,559 <strong>610,531</strong> 3.44 <strong>638,875</strong> 616,851 <strong>3.57</strong></p> <p><strong>The Daily Mail</strong><br> 2,345,099 <strong>2,370,534</strong> -1.07 <strong>2,385,269</strong> 2,376,555 <strong>0.37</strong></p> <p><strong>Daily Express</strong><br> 1,033,858 <strong>1,043,681</strong> -0.94 <strong>1,045,787</strong> 1,073,154 <strong> -2.55</strong></p> <p><strong>London Evening Standard</strong><br> 446,344 <strong>454,872</strong> -1.87 <strong>436,267</strong> 441,671 <strong>-1.22</strong></p> <p><strong>The Daily Telegraph</strong> <br>1,014,011 <strong>1,030,777</strong> -1.63 <strong>1,023,325</strong> 1,038,677 <strong>-1.48</strong></p> <p><strong>The Times</strong> <br>712,592 <strong>720,049</strong> -1.04 <strong>719,789</strong> 722,988 <strong>-0.36</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial Times</strong> <br>483,379 <strong>436,771</strong> 10.67 <strong>465,140</strong> 406,007 <strong>14.29</strong></p> <p><strong>The Guardian</strong> <br>398,332 <strong>397,991</strong> 0.09 <strong>395,880</strong> 391,994 <strong>0.99</strong></p> <p><strong>The Independent</strong><br> 240,714 <strong>227,480</strong> 5.82 <strong>229,897</strong> 224,921 <strong>2.21</strong></p> <p><strong>The Scotsman</strong> <br>100,071 <strong>74,811</strong> 33.77 <strong>102,598</strong> 76,784 <strong>33.62</strong></p> <p><strong>Sundays</strong></p> <p><strong>News of the World</strong><br> 3,949,078 <strong>4,062,194</strong> -2.78 <strong>4,040,007</strong> 4,097,148 <strong>-1.39</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sunday Mirror</strong><br> 1,863,266 <strong>1,980,723</strong> -5.93 <strong>1,917,945</strong> 1,987,319 <strong>-3.49</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sunday People</strong><br> 1,471,675 <strong>1,554,688</strong> -5.34 <strong>1,506,776</strong> 1,589,985 <strong>-5.23</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sunday Mail</strong><br> 709,178 <strong>751,805</strong> -5.67 <strong>727,980</strong> 760,231 <strong>-4.24</strong> </p> <p><strong>The Mail on Sunday</strong> <br>2,259,822 <strong>2,309,886</strong> -2.17 <strong>2,285,997</strong> 2,308,187 <strong>-0.96</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sunday Express</strong> <br>950,802 <strong>959,902</strong> -0.95 <strong>965,032</strong> 988,034 <strong>-2.33</strong></p> <p><strong>The Sunday Times</strong><br> 1,409,507 <strong>1,374,641</strong> 2.54 <strong>1,364,635</strong> 1,339,589 <strong>1.87</strong></p> <p><strong>The Sunday Telegraph</strong><br> 805,181 <strong>816,612</strong> -1.40 <strong>804,467</strong> 822,424 <strong>-2.18</strong> </p> <p><strong>The Observer</strong> <br>440,864 <strong>409,794</strong> 7.58 <strong>440,793</strong> 401,815 <strong>9.70</strong> </p> <p><strong>Independent on Sunday</strong> <br>257,491 <strong>255,899</strong> 0.63 <strong>248,191</strong> 246,782 <strong>0.57</strong> </p> <p><strong>Scotland on Sunday</strong> <br>100,940 <strong>105,456</strong> -4.28 <strong>105,765</strong> 112,313 <strong>-5.83</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sunday Business</strong><br> 55,069 <strong>62,062</strong> -11.27 <strong>58,172</strong> 57,689 <strong>0.84</strong></p>",

The Express sold only 823,432 copies at its full cover price in November compared to 2.2m sold by the Daily Mail. Of the Sundays, the figure that stands out is undoubtedly the Observer, up by 7.58% year on year. It needs to curb its quota of bulk sales, but these pale in comparison with the Independent on Sunday's 40,000-plus which account for more than 15% of its total. One final note about the two Sunday sports papers which have done so well. Sport First enjoyed its fifth successive sales increase, up to 85,775 copies. The Non-League Paper also sold a creditable 42,216.

      "body": "<p>Wigmore Hall, London <br>**** </p> <p>The Wigmore Hall won't reach its 100th birthday until May, but with so much to celebrate it has decided to start early. The launch of its centenary festival was entrusted to one of its best-loved regulars, the Swedish mezzo soprano Anne Sofie von Otter, sharing the platform with her accompanist Bengt Forsberg and violinist Nils-Erik Sparf. </p> <p>Although half of the programme was given over to pieces for violin and piano, it was effectively von Otter's recital. Her choice to give an entire concert of Sibelius, marking the Finnish composer's own 135th birthday, was intriguing - and rewarding. The revival of interest in Sibelius's orchestral music has not spread to his songs yet and the fact that he was a prolific composer of vocal music, with more than 100 songs to his credit, is still a well-kept secret. </p> <p>Listening to these often vivid settings, it seemed incredible that Sibelius should need the kind of boost that von Otter has given to several Scandinavian composers in the past - presumably it's the language barrier that prevents more singers from including them in their repertoire. They are interesting because they link two distinct periods; the earlier songs especially are grounded in the Germanic Romantic tradition of Schumann, while later compositions look towards the more modern expanses of Sibelius's symphonic writing. </p> <p>The same can be said for his pieces for violin and piano, and the innocence of works such as the 1888 B minor Romance threw the edginess of some of his later works, performed by Sparf with freshness and vigour, into sharp relief. </p> <p>Von Otter's appeal in lieder is not just down to her warm, unaffected tone but to her ability to make the most thoughtful and considered performance seem flowing and spontaneous. As ever, she and Forsberg were utterly tuned in to each other. The Jewish Girl's Song, with von Otter singing a wistful, folk-like melody over the sparsest of piano accompaniments, was particularly spellbinding.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wigmore Hall, London **** The Wigmore Hall won't reach its 100th birthday until May, but with so much to celebrate it has decided to start early. The launch of its centenary festival was entrusted to one of its best-loved regulars, the Swedish mezzo soprano Anne Sofie von Otter, sharing the platform with her accompanist Bengt Forsberg and violinist Nils-Erik Sparf. Although half of the programme was given over to pieces for violin and piano, it was effectively von Otter's recital. Her choice to give an entire concert of Sibelius, marking the Finnish composer's own 135th birthday, was intriguing - and rewarding. The revival of interest in Sibelius's orchestral music has not spread to his songs yet and the fact that he was a prolific composer of vocal music, with more than 100 songs to his credit, is still a well-kept secret. Listening to these often vivid settings, it seemed incredible that Sibelius should need the kind of boost that von Otter has given to several Scandinavian composers in the past - presumably it's the language barrier that prevents more singers from including them in their repertoire. They are interesting because they link two distinct periods; the earlier songs especially are grounded in the Germanic Romantic tradition of Schumann, while later compositions look towards the more modern expanses of Sibelius's symphonic writing. The same can be said for his pieces for violin and piano, and the innocence of works such as the 1888 B minor Romance threw the edginess of some of his later works, performed by Sparf with freshness and vigour, into sharp relief. Von Otter's appeal in lieder is not just down to her warm, unaffected tone but to her ability to make the most thoughtful and considered performance seem flowing and spontaneous. As ever, she and Forsberg were utterly tuned in to each other. The Jewish Girl's Song, with von Otter singing a wistful, folk-like melody over the sparsest of piano accompaniments, was particularly spellbinding.",

However, far from showing her pile in the easy cash, the programme highlights the struggle of a project which for a long time lacked financial backers and true believers. </p> <p>Throughout, though, she was never abandoned by her own secretarial skills which have been handy not only in developing the content of the website, but also \"in moving into the domain of dot.coms in the first place\". Today's secretaries are often three or four times as skilled as those of previous generations, she explains. \"The top ones are highly proficient in research, organisation, IT and communication - the four key skills needed to start up an internet-based company.\" </p> <p>Susan Saloom, who as manager of the Shell Live Wire Enterprise Unit has in the past two years helped more than 200,000 people start up their own business ventures, knows this all too well. Like all internet experts she will tell you that, while a good idea is the crucial first step, organising content, networking with contacts and discovering how it will all work on screen comes a close second. For many modern support staff, at least the basic skills needed to carry out these tasks have already been learned. </p> <p>\"The internet has advanced to such a point that the technological skills of secretaries is enough to get a sophisticated website up and running,\" agrees Mike Roberts, senior lecturer in entrepreneurial studies at Harvard Business School. But as a few dot.com casualties have already told us, the world wide web is a risky place to head with these skills alone - a lesson which Michelle Williams, a 29-year-old PA, learned all too quickly. Having attempted - and failed - to set up a website selling top-quality stationery, she cautions internet wannabes against hasty decisions. \"I gave up a wonderful three-year secretarial job because I thought my skills were enough to become the next Martha Lane Fox. But in addition, you need masses of guts, determination, money and most of all, patience. If you don't have anything to live off while you're waiting, the months - and sometimes years - that it takes for your website to kick off, life can become very grim.\" </p> <p>For 26-year-old Andrea Stock, and many other secretaries like her, the solution has been, \"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em\". Having been unsuccessful in getting her internet idea off the ground, she decided to jump on the bandwagon of someone else's. \"As soon as I got a peep into the world of dot.com, I realised the informal, young and anti-hierarchical way of working would suit me perfectly, and that I didn't mind the instability and highly competitive environment. If I couldn't run my own business, I decided, it didn't mean I had to get out altogether and that's why I continued being a PA, but moved to working solely for web-site companies.\" </p> <p>Because many internet start-ups are too small and young to invest in full-time secretaries, Stock temps. \"I belong to a number of recruitment agencies, all of which know my preference towards internet companies,\" she says. \"I'm happy because I get to work in companies where my level of responsibility is far higher than ever before. And the dot.com companies are happy because my knowledge of the internet world is already high, and growing all the time. These are businesses where, for the first time in my career, I get to use my skills to their full potential, and where I know they're appreciated.\" </p> <p>Back at secretaryworld.com, Julie Samuels is only too aware that temps like Stock are becoming a fast increasing phenomenon. \"Many PAs want to get involved in dot.coms because they realise they don't have to be at the start-up end, like me, to use it to their advantage. They realise that the lines between the roles in internet companies are more blurred than in traditional companies, and that as a result, they can enjoy higher status jobs.\" </p> <p>Indeed, it is the changing role of secretaries within internet companies that is the reason Samuels refused to give up on her website even when every venture capitalist she approached for funding turned her down. \"We're moving into a world in which a fast-growing number of managers are expecting more from their support staff every day, and so these secretaries need more help every day. That's what secretaryworld.com is all about.\" </p> <p>Eventually realising she'd have to fund the project herself, Julie brought in a \"technical expert\" and a \"contacts expert\" and, together with her husband, they started the website aimed at all modern administrative workers. It includes information on relevant products, details on courses, advice on interview skills, summaries of news, suggestions on setting up better conferences, material on how to improve your financial skills, and more. </p> <p>\"I so often hear about modern secretaries who take instructions from the boss, only to leave their office thinking, 'How the hell can I do that? I don't know what he's talking about.' The expectations are out there, but the help hasn't been,\" says Samuels. </p> <p>Together with the discussion forum, she hopes her website will become \"a worldwide network for secretaries. If they can't find the information they need on our website, they'll be able to post a question and undoubtedly, a user somewhere will have the answers.\" </p> <p>Dot.coms, she concludes, are changing the face of the millennial secretary in almost every way possible. \"The net is causing the secretary's job to become more challenging.

      "body": "<p>If Jo Dimitri finds herself briefing walking pineapples and hot-chocolate pots, or putting the finishing touches to table decorations in the form of aliens' brains, it's all part of her job. She's a senior project manager with Theme Traders, an event design and production company that masterminds bespoke parties. British Airways, EMI and Pricewaterhouse-Coopers feature on a client list for whom Dimitri and co \"come up with party ideas and bring them to life. Our aim is to get that 'wow' factor.\" </p> <p>There's certainly the chance to let the imagination go. She's helped to create Caribbean islands and Dickensian marketplaces, Austin Powers parties and James Bond bashes, as well as moonscapes and winter wonderlands. She devises this sort of fun all year round. \"St Patrick's day, midsummer, Halloween - nobody needs an excuse for a party. Not that I'm complaining, I hasten to add.\" </p> <p>Naturally enough, it's seasonal revellery that's occupying Dimitri now - an example of which will take place outside Versailles in the week before Christmas. Travelling within Europe for Theme Traders is nothing new to her - she's already been to Istanbul and Strasbourg and, when we meet, she is planning to go to France for a day or so to combine work and a short break. </p> <p>Dimitri, 22, is one of 14 project managers, and her involvement begins at the preliminary discussion stage with a client. \"We talk through what they would like to do,\" she explains. \"The style or format envisaged is important, but equally so is who's going to be invited - will it be solely management, or the entire staff? Are they looking for something low-key, or the best bash ever?\" From this brainstorming session, Dimitri will deliver a proposal within 24 hours. </p> <p>Once she has been given the go-ahead, Dimitri places orders with colleagues whose job descriptions (\"set designers, lighting technicians, costumiers and prop-makers\") sound more like backstage theatre hands than party organisers. \"We also have our own caterers and installation teams,\" she adds. </p> <p>The policy of using in-house personnel is deliberate, although an exception is the roster of more than 500 speciality performers she uses. \"Even the most shy and retiring of guests discover that coming face to face with escapologists, drag queens and snake charmers is a great ice-breaker,\" she says with a broad grin. </p> <p>Throughout the big day itself, Dimitri is in overseeing mode at the venue while \"all the different strands are woven together. A very finely coordinated process, rather than a mad panic,\" she insists. She sees lending a hand here as pure pleasure. \"I really enjoy arranging the displays. That's the best part of it for me.\" </p> <p>On the night, her presence ensures a point of contact for the hosts should they have any questions, or need any help. Effectively, she's on duty, which requires a suitably professional approach. \"I'll chat with people,\" she says, \"but having a good time myself is not the reason I'm there.\" It's also conditional that she doesn't bear a grudge for the long hours, late-night finishes and weekend shifts that are all part of the job. </p> <p>It was at university, when she worked on a May Ball for Clare College, Cambridge, that Dimitri first gained experience in organising entertainment.

      "bodyText": "If Jo Dimitri finds herself briefing walking pineapples and hot-chocolate pots, or putting the finishing touches to table decorations in the form of aliens' brains, it's all part of her job. She's a senior project manager with Theme Traders, an event design and production company that masterminds bespoke parties. British Airways, EMI and Pricewaterhouse-Coopers feature on a client list for whom Dimitri and co \"come up with party ideas and bring them to life. Our aim is to get that 'wow' factor.\" There's certainly the chance to let the imagination go. She's helped to create Caribbean islands and Dickensian marketplaces, Austin Powers parties and James Bond bashes, as well as moonscapes and winter wonderlands. She devises this sort of fun all year round. \"St Patrick's day, midsummer, Halloween - nobody needs an excuse for a party. Not that I'm complaining, I hasten to add.\" Naturally enough, it's seasonal revellery that's occupying Dimitri now - an example of which will take place outside Versailles in the week before Christmas. Travelling within Europe for Theme Traders is nothing new to her - she's already been to Istanbul and Strasbourg and, when we meet, she is planning to go to France for a day or so to combine work and a short break. Dimitri, 22, is one of 14 project managers, and her involvement begins at the preliminary discussion stage with a client. \"We talk through what they would like to do,\" she explains. \"The style or format envisaged is important, but equally so is who's going to be invited - will it be solely management, or the entire staff? Are they looking for something low-key, or the best bash ever?\" From this brainstorming session, Dimitri will deliver a proposal within 24 hours. Once she has been given the go-ahead, Dimitri places orders with colleagues whose job descriptions (\"set designers, lighting technicians, costumiers and prop-makers\") sound more like backstage theatre hands than party organisers. \"We also have our own caterers and installation teams,\" she adds. The policy of using in-house personnel is deliberate, although an exception is the roster of more than 500 speciality performers she uses. \"Even the most shy and retiring of guests discover that coming face to face with escapologists, drag queens and snake charmers is a great ice-breaker,\" she says with a broad grin. Throughout the big day itself, Dimitri is in overseeing mode at the venue while \"all the different strands are woven together. A very finely coordinated process, rather than a mad panic,\" she insists. She sees lending a hand here as pure pleasure. \"I really enjoy arranging the displays. That's the best part of it for me.\" On the night, her presence ensures a point of contact for the hosts should they have any questions, or need any help. Effectively, she's on duty, which requires a suitably professional approach. \"I'll chat with people,\" she says, \"but having a good time myself is not the reason I'm there.\" It's also conditional that she doesn't bear a grudge for the long hours, late-night finishes and weekend shifts that are all part of the job. It was at university, when she worked on a May Ball for Clare College, Cambridge, that Dimitri first gained experience in organising entertainment.

Northern Ballet Theatre flew into Beijing yesterday to tour Massimo Moricone's other smash hit dance drama, A Christmas Carol, in Guangzhou, Taiyuan and Tianjin.

A fluid, elegant dancer, de Andrade combines strength and sensitivity as he cleverly supports and manoeuvres Talbot, making her debut in the role. His Romeo is not so much a lad about town as a caring dreamer. Yet he shows he can slug it out like the rest of his clan when he noisily despatches his enemy in a frenzy of syncopated stabbing. </p> <p>Talbot makes a promising start, her Juliet leggy and coquettish, swiftly switching from spoiled child to a woman overwhelmed by desire, body arcing in waves of pleasure. Dark and alluring, she is a Juliet to cry for: the girl who has met the wrong boy but has the guts to die for him. Moricone punctuates \"the fearful passage of their death mark'd love\" with a series of inventive pas de deux, the teenagers undulating in waves of lust, hands hungrily exploring faces, bodies interlocking and soaring to the Prokofiev score. </p> <p>De Andrade enfolds his bride like a cherished possession. Their little gestures, new wedding rings glinting, are tragically repeated in the crypt when he mouths a silent scream as he tries to dance with her lifeless body, her limp arms round his neck. Her dying moment, as she curls his corpse round her in a final embrace, is one of the most moving in the ballet repertoire - this was electric. </p> <p>Minus an artistic director since the death of Christopher Gable and the brief sojourn of Italian Stefano Giannetti, the NBT is obviously no rudderless ship. The company is in full sail dramatically, thanks to coach Patricia Doyle, who has encouraged the dancers to make the drama as relevant as possible for today's audiences. </p> <p>While action centre stage enthrals, it's the little vignettes around the edges that make this production so memorable, every performer totally absorbed. The adulterous Lady Capulet, a lethal mix of ice and fire from Noi Tolmer, paddles palms with lover Tybalt amid the gold, black and scarlet panoply of the Capulet ball. Lord Capulet (Luc Jacobs) shoots frantic apologies to Paris as Juliet rejects his suit while in the crowd scenes the Montagues and Capulets insult each other with convincingly ribald gestures. </p> <p>Hironao Takahashi's Mercutio is the dazzling joker in the pack, his swaggering turned staggering death a brilliant physical soliloquy, while Fiona Wallis gives the nurse far more emotional depth than the usual bawdy old minder.</p>",
