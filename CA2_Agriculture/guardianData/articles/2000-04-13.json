He sticks his tongue out at the corrective John of Gaunt, seizes his lands with arbitrary zeal and skips off to the Irish wars as if going to a fashion parade. </p> <p>Within the parameters of Jonathan Kent's production, it is a fine performance.

He is at his best in the deposition scene where he exaggeratedly cocks an ear as he cries: \"God Save The King\" and hugs the crown to his chest as if it were a favourite toy. Stripped of monarchy's protective divinity, this Richard becomes poignantly aware of his own wastefulness and other people's cunning. </p> <p>What I miss in Kent's production is much sense of the play's politics. We are magnetised by Richard. But Linus Roache's stolidly impassive Bolingbroke gives us no hint of a man who turns injustice into opportunity.

Though he now appears as a guest with most of London's orchestras there is a still a special rapport between him and the LPO players, though in Wednesday's concert it took a little while for that to manifest. A few smudged chords in Schumann's Manfred Overture suggested that Haitink's unfussy beat wasn't transmitting as cleanly as it should have done, though much else about the performance was perfectly lucid, especially in the air that he gave to the orchestral textures and the unmistakable dramatic pointing of the whole work, which is as much a miniature symphonic poem as it is a concert overture. </p> <p>Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder, though, had no uncertainties. With Haitink due to conduct a new production of Tristan und Isolde next season at Covent Garden, the songs provided a foretaste of his approach - a bit cool but emphasising the seamless lyricism of each number. Perhaps his lack of outright passion in the music was intended to match the delivery of his soloist, for though Petra Lang (who will sing Brangaene in the ROH Tristan) has a cast-iron technique, admirable diction and smooth, potentially sumptuous tone, there was something too forthright, rather take-it-or-leave-it, about the way in which she presented these sometimes ecstatic texts. </p> <p>The symphony was Shostakovich's 10th, which Haitink has always conducted with the right degree of theatricality. The LPO acquitted themselves well in the scherzo, and provided the first movement with a good depth of tone, even if the string sound didn't always glisten. In Haitink's performances the symphonic lines through Tchaikovsky and through Mahler that come together in Shostakovich are remarkably fused, and his care with details, like the piccolo snapping out the DSCH motto at the end of the Allegretto, or the eloquent phrasing of the oboe solo that begins the finale, is a constant fascination. There are more tumultuous interpreters, those who emphasise the work's tragic dimension more insistently, but few who bring all elements together into a more satisfying shape. </p>",

However Martyn's efforts proved in vain and in the end it was Australia who looked as if their minds were on other things as South Africa won by six wickets with two overs to spare with a thoroughly professional performance. A third-wicket stand of 129 between Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis set the platform and when Kallis fell for 61, Jonty Rhodes produced a perfect cameo knock of 46 not out from 40 balls to seal the match. Kirsten was out just before the end for 97, made from 126 balls with eight boundaries. It was left to Lance Klusener to hit the winning boundary from the last ball of the 48th over and the full house went into raptures, proclaiming that there is life and cricket after Cronje. The next match is in Cape Town tomorrow.",

The UN can find its leader from a black, African commonwealth country but apologists for the Queen suggest she has been unable to find anyone suitable for her court from a similar source. \u0095 Phillip Hall is the author of Royal Fortune: tax money and the monarchy (Bloomsbury).

They also reveal that BNFL has buried important safety information - with the knowledge of the Department of Trade and Industry - on the running of nuclear waste trains.</p> <p><b> Case one</b><br></p> <p>An official reply to an Irish MP who had written to Tony Blair calling for Sellafield to be closed down was secretly scripted from documents prepared by British Nuclear Fuels.</p> <p>The MP, Mildred Fox, who represents Wicklow, was not told that the government response telling her that her fears were \"unfounded\" had lifted a paragraph from BNFL's publicity, the very people she was criticising. She thought she was getting a considered reply from John Battle, then junior energy minister at the Department of Trade and Industry.</p> <p>Nor did she know that BNFL had advised Whitehall that, as \"one of a handful of independent MPs\", she did not merit a reply from the prime minister or a secretary of state.</p> <p>Ms Fox has been vocal in the campaign against Sellafield, which has discharged radioactive waste into the Irish Sea for many years.</p> <p>The Irish government and campaigners have been pressing for Sellafield to be shut, as they object to the radioactive contamination of their shores and the possibility of a nuclear accident spreading fallout over their country.</p> <p>In the same month Mr Blair became prime minister, Ms Fox wrote to him congratulating him on his landslide victory. She went on \"to express my concern with the nuclear facility at Sellafield and would respectfully request that steps be taken to close this plant, as I feel it is a threat to public safety and quality of life\".</p> <p>Her letter was passed to the trade department for a reply - and then on to BNFL.</p> <p>In a memo obtained by the Channel 4 programme Dispatches, a BNFL manager wrote to department officials on June 11 1997, saying: \"In reply to an Irish [MP], we believe that it is important to be assertive and not to be appearing to justify or apologise for the UK nuclear industry.\"</p> <p>BNFL suggested that, since Ms Fox was an independent MP, \"the reply should come from a more junior minister\" than the trade and industry secretary, then Margaret Beckett.</p> <p>BNFL sent to the department a draft reply, which was included almost verbatim in the letter eventually sent to Ms Fox in the name of Mr Battle.</p> <p>An entire paragraph in the letter on the operation of BNFL was written by BNFL.</p> <p>In addition, Mr Battle's letter included a paragraph taken wholesale from a BNFL brochure. Ms Fox told Dispatches: \"I find it very offensive and condescending. You can get technical information [from BNFL] but you don't advise a minister on how to reply to a particular race of people ... it just shows the lack of regard they have for the concerns of Irish people.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the DTI said: \"Though Mr Battle's reply drew on material provided by BNFL, it had been amended to omit references to safety standards acheived at Sellafield.\"</p> <p><b> Case two</b><br></p> <p>An extraordinary proposal to \"stuff Michael Meacher\" is revealed in a leaked memo from the company, whereby Labour backbench MPs worried about job losses at a BNFL subsidiary were to be urged to lobby against the environment minister's plans for a public inquiry into discharges into the sea at Sellafield</p> <p>The memo is one of a series written by BNFL's public relations department, deal ing with handling \"old Labour\" backbench MPs complaining about the company's activities.</p> <p>Another involved persuading influential Jewish community leaders to try and modify a stance taken by Labour backbencher Rudi Vis, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, against plans to store spent waste trains in sidings outside homes in Cricklewood, north London.</p> <p>The memo on Mr Meacher, written on August 14 1997, came as the then BNFL chairman, Sir John Guinness, was under pressure from Cheshire MPs over plans to hive off work at the Capenhurst nuclear facility in advance of the part-privatisation of the company. The plan was to cut jobs by allowing a management buyout - which subsequently went ahead - of a subsidary called Deva, which makes nuclear flasks.</p> <p>The memo, written by Rupert Wilcox-Baker, the company's public relations director, says: \"Christine Russell [MP for Chester] has asked for a meeting with Guinness and all the local MPs which has been accepted but no date fixed ... my radical suggestion is that we meet Russell and the other MPs and say we made a mistake on Deva and announce we con tinue to support it. Then we ask them, as a body with the other constituency MPs, to stuff Meacher and the public inquiry. Cheap trade off?\"</p> <p>Ms Russell confirmed yesterday that a meeting did go ahead but she had no recollection of such a proposal being put to her and the other MPs. Instead BNFL went ahead with the management buy-out, and Mr Meacher won his case for an inquiry by the environment agency into the discharges. \"I am absolutely shocked that they should ever think of such a thing,\" she told the Guardian.</p> <p>On Mr Vis, who has successfully campaigned to keep spent waste trains from being stored at Cricklewood, a memo to Sir John Guinness proposed a way of undermining his campaign.</p> <p>Written in March last year, it read: \"We have had a number of meetings with Rudi Vis and he has made it very clear that he is determined to get us out of Cricklewood and to stop us transporting spent fuel. Andrew Miller's [Labour MP for Ellesmere Port] insight into Vis's rationale is interesting but I suspect what he is seeing is a hangover from Vis's old Labour background. He is a long-standing member of CND and has stated privately to us his ab horrence of all things nuclear ...\" It goes on: \"Regarding the suggestion that we try and get a senior Jewish figure on side, I have some doubts ... whilst Rudi Vis is not himself Jewish, his father helped Jewish families during the last war in Alkmaar, Holland, where Vis was born in 1941.</p> <p>\"With that in mind and the make-up of his constituency, the Jewish influence will be strong. I would propose that we ensure that this section of the local community is fully represented in the dialogue process.\"</p> <p><b> Case three</b><br></p> <p>BNFL staff deliberately \"buried\" vital information about the dangers of trains which carry highly radioactive waste hundreds of miles across Britain, the internal papers revealed.</p> <p>Officials at the Department of Trade and Industry were told by BNFL that the information was being hidden from the public.</p> <p>Nuclear waste was regularly transported each week by rail to Sellafield from various different power stations.

      "bodyText": "A large number of internal documents have been leaked from British Nuclear Fuels Ltd revealing that the public relations department was involved in a series of \"dirty tricks\" in dealing with hostile ministers and MPs in Ireland and the UK. They also reveal that BNFL has buried important safety information - with the knowledge of the Department of Trade and Industry - on the running of nuclear waste trains. Case one An official reply to an Irish MP who had written to Tony Blair calling for Sellafield to be closed down was secretly scripted from documents prepared by British Nuclear Fuels. The MP, Mildred Fox, who represents Wicklow, was not told that the government response telling her that her fears were \"unfounded\" had lifted a paragraph from BNFL's publicity, the very people she was criticising. She thought she was getting a considered reply from John Battle, then junior energy minister at the Department of Trade and Industry. Nor did she know that BNFL had advised Whitehall that, as \"one of a handful of independent MPs\", she did not merit a reply from the prime minister or a secretary of state. Ms Fox has been vocal in the campaign against Sellafield, which has discharged radioactive waste into the Irish Sea for many years. The Irish government and campaigners have been pressing for Sellafield to be shut, as they object to the radioactive contamination of their shores and the possibility of a nuclear accident spreading fallout over their country. In the same month Mr Blair became prime minister, Ms Fox wrote to him congratulating him on his landslide victory. She went on \"to express my concern with the nuclear facility at Sellafield and would respectfully request that steps be taken to close this plant, as I feel it is a threat to public safety and quality of life\". Her letter was passed to the trade department for a reply - and then on to BNFL. In a memo obtained by the Channel 4 programme Dispatches, a BNFL manager wrote to department officials on June 11 1997, saying: \"In reply to an Irish [MP], we believe that it is important to be assertive and not to be appearing to justify or apologise for the UK nuclear industry.\" BNFL suggested that, since Ms Fox was an independent MP, \"the reply should come from a more junior minister\" than the trade and industry secretary, then Margaret Beckett. BNFL sent to the department a draft reply, which was included almost verbatim in the letter eventually sent to Ms Fox in the name of Mr Battle. An entire paragraph in the letter on the operation of BNFL was written by BNFL. In addition, Mr Battle's letter included a paragraph taken wholesale from a BNFL brochure. Ms Fox told Dispatches: \"I find it very offensive and condescending. You can get technical information [from BNFL] but you don't advise a minister on how to reply to a particular race of people ... it just shows the lack of regard they have for the concerns of Irish people.\" A spokesman for the DTI said: \"Though Mr Battle's reply drew on material provided by BNFL, it had been amended to omit references to safety standards acheived at Sellafield.\" Case two An extraordinary proposal to \"stuff Michael Meacher\" is revealed in a leaked memo from the company, whereby Labour backbench MPs worried about job losses at a BNFL subsidiary were to be urged to lobby against the environment minister's plans for a public inquiry into discharges into the sea at Sellafield The memo is one of a series written by BNFL's public relations department, deal ing with handling \"old Labour\" backbench MPs complaining about the company's activities. Another involved persuading influential Jewish community leaders to try and modify a stance taken by Labour backbencher Rudi Vis, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, against plans to store spent waste trains in sidings outside homes in Cricklewood, north London. The memo on Mr Meacher, written on August 14 1997, came as the then BNFL chairman, Sir John Guinness, was under pressure from Cheshire MPs over plans to hive off work at the Capenhurst nuclear facility in advance of the part-privatisation of the company. The plan was to cut jobs by allowing a management buyout - which subsequently went ahead - of a subsidary called Deva, which makes nuclear flasks. The memo, written by Rupert Wilcox-Baker, the company's public relations director, says: \"Christine Russell [MP for Chester] has asked for a meeting with Guinness and all the local MPs which has been accepted but no date fixed ... my radical suggestion is that we meet Russell and the other MPs and say we made a mistake on Deva and announce we con tinue to support it. Then we ask them, as a body with the other constituency MPs, to stuff Meacher and the public inquiry. Cheap trade off?\" Ms Russell confirmed yesterday that a meeting did go ahead but she had no recollection of such a proposal being put to her and the other MPs. Instead BNFL went ahead with the management buy-out, and Mr Meacher won his case for an inquiry by the environment agency into the discharges. \"I am absolutely shocked that they should ever think of such a thing,\" she told the Guardian. On Mr Vis, who has successfully campaigned to keep spent waste trains from being stored at Cricklewood, a memo to Sir John Guinness proposed a way of undermining his campaign. Written in March last year, it read: \"We have had a number of meetings with Rudi Vis and he has made it very clear that he is determined to get us out of Cricklewood and to stop us transporting spent fuel. Andrew Miller's [Labour MP for Ellesmere Port] insight into Vis's rationale is interesting but I suspect what he is seeing is a hangover from Vis's old Labour background. He is a long-standing member of CND and has stated privately to us his ab horrence of all things nuclear ...\" It goes on: \"Regarding the suggestion that we try and get a senior Jewish figure on side, I have some doubts ... whilst Rudi Vis is not himself Jewish, his father helped Jewish families during the last war in Alkmaar, Holland, where Vis was born in 1941. \"With that in mind and the make-up of his constituency, the Jewish influence will be strong. I would propose that we ensure that this section of the local community is fully represented in the dialogue process.\" Case three BNFL staff deliberately \"buried\" vital information about the dangers of trains which carry highly radioactive waste hundreds of miles across Britain, the internal papers revealed. Officials at the Department of Trade and Industry were told by BNFL that the information was being hidden from the public. Nuclear waste was regularly transported each week by rail to Sellafield from various different power stations. The cargo travelled through densely populated areas, on the same lines as passenger trains. Last year BNFL proposed that the speed of the trains should be increased from 45 mph to 60 mph. BNFL, in consultation with the DTI, drew up a public statement in case the media and campaigners started to ask questions about the speeds of the trains. In a secret memo to the DTI in April last year a BNFL manager wrote that the original draft statement had been reworked to \"reflect your comments\". The only hint of the faster speed appeared in the middle of the public statement in a sentence which stated that \"over time there will be some operational differences\" to the trains. A spokesman for BNFL told the Guardian: \"BNFL did propose last year to increase the speed of the trains to 60mph and do have the power under current regulations for carrying hazardous waste to do so. But we have decided at the moment to keep the trains running at 45mph.\" A DTI spokesman said: \"The wording in the BNFL memo and the use of the word \"buried\" is clearly poor and unfortunate but obviously was BNFL's responsibility. Any change [in the speed of the trains] would only be made in the light of regulatory and ministerial agreement and would be made public.\" Another secret memo shows that the DTI encouraged BNFL to keep quiet about its failure to comply with reporting requirements on accidents and other hazardous incidents. In June 1997 BNFL and the DTI were concerned about pressure from the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency to improve the existing agreement. Useful link BNFL",

Fifteen million telephone users will be affected by next week's sweeping numbering changes, but according to The Big Number, the telecommunications industry-backed campaign charged with drumming the switch into the British psyche, few have any idea what they mean. </p> <p>Even according to its own recent survey, only 7% of people questioned in the affected areas - London, Cardiff, Coventry, Northern Ireland, Portsmouth and Southampton - could correctly describe how their area codes and local numbers would change on April 22. In outer London, the figure was 5%; in Northern Ireland - where the changes are nightmarishly complex - it was a dismal 3%. </p> <p>As a result, the people at The Big Number have been indulging in some comically desperate attempts to ram home the message. In February, the campaign website warned \"would-be Romeos\" of devastating consequences if they didn't get the hang of their new three-digit (02x) area codes and eight-digit local numbers: \"You may be chatting up the best-looking woman in the whole club - but blow it all by giving out your old number.\" (Actually, she'll get an error message and soon figure out your new one, but who can begrudge the beleaguered awareness-raiser a little poetic licence?) </p> <p>By last week things were getting serious. Computer software, fax machines, auto-dialling security alarms and phone memory banks would need reprogramming, we were warned; even more importantly, \"dog and cat owners should check pet collars carry the right telephone number.\" </p> <p>\"Because this is a change to people's numbers as well as their code, it's been more difficult for them to get their minds around it,\" explains Howard Sandom, campaign manager at The Big Number. \"We know people only internalise the information at the last minute, but what they have to understand is that on April 22, their existing local number stops working and\" - this is the nub - \"they have to start using the eight-digit local numbers.\" </p> <p>If domestic customers are confused, business users have been hassled by the switch for months. Stories abound of companies - even telephone companies - which spent thousands redesigning stationery and vehicle liveries on the assumption that London's new codes are 0207 and 0208. In fact, the single new London code is 020; the 7 and 8 are part of the numbers, and need to be dialled even when calling locally. </p> <p>In a heartwarming display of corporate unity, the Big Number's \u00a320m advertising campaign is funded by the industry under the name All The Phone Companies Together; its centrepiece is a \"number change machine\" allowing users to enter their old number and discover the new one. This is accessible via the campaign's website (<a href=\"http://www.numberchange.org\">www.numberchange.org</a>) and a free helpline (0808 2242000), which is far easier to get through to, and certainly far more helpful, than telephoning any of the companies individually. </p> <p>But even as they seek to draw attention to the switchover, the telephone operators are making furious efforts to distance themselves from responsibility for it: BT's mailshots point the finger at Oftel, the regulator which initiated the move. This should not come as much of a surprise: next Saturday's change represents the latest instalment in a sequence of adjustments that arguably ought never to have been required in the first place. </p> <p>There have been only seven major changes to numbering in Britain since the telephone was introduced in 1879, but three of them have happened in the past decade. Critics accuse Oftel of having caved in too readily to requests for more capacity, and of monumental lack of foresight in 1995, when area codes gained a 1. The obvious excuse - that it had only just taken over responsibility for numbering from BT, and had to act fast to create new capacity - looks a little flimsy in the light of its claim then that no more changes would be required in the foreseeable future. </p> <p>But this is the unforeseen future, a world of proliferating mobile numbers, data lines and domestic faxes, and it's making some people uncomfortable. \"There's nothing worse than a funny-sounding noise on the line and the impression given to the customer that a business has gone bust,\" says Stephen Alambritis, of the Federation of Small Businesses. The FSB estimates most small businesses will incur costs of anything from \u00a3100 to \u00a32,000 in redesigning letterheads, shopfronts and vans, assuming that they even know about the change. </p> <p>Then there are foreign suppliers and customers to be alerted, software to be reconfigured and directory entries to be amended, and Microsoft Office's nasty habit of interpreting \"02\" as the international dialling code for Egypt (a \"patch\" is available at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.co.uk\">www.microsoft.co.uk</a>). And, as Alambritis points out, it hardly helps that directory enquiries has made no apparent effort to give out the new numbers or warn of their imminent arrival. \"In 1995, the impression was given that that was it, the industry had got its act together,\" he says. \"The problem is all the chopping and changing at a time when issues like this need to be sorted out on a once and for all basis.\" </p> <p>Sandom is phlegmatic. \"We have to be mature enough to take this on the chin. The explosive growth of telecom in the past three to five years has caught everyone by surprise: even the most optimistic forecasters couldn't have seen how much the data and mobile networks would grow. We're introducing a system we believe will be robust for a long time to come, with a system of order we think people will welcome.\" </p> <p>The simultaneous introduction of other uniform prefixes - 07 for mobiles and pagers, 08 for free and local rate calls, 09 for premium services - will, he says, create a \"family of numbers\" and imbue the numbering system with the perfect logic it's lacked since three-letter exchange names were abolished in the 1960s. </p> <p>None of this will matter, of course, when the day finally dawns that numbers aren't needed at all. Some mobile phones can already make calls on the basis of spoken names; there's no theoretical reason why we shouldn't abandon strings of digits altogether, just as few people learn the complex sequence of numbers by which a website is technically identified. \"There'll come a time when we'll generally be talking to our computers and telephones,\" Peter Cochrane, BT's pathologically optimistic chief technologist, has predicted. </p> <p>And not everyone is dreading the change. \"With all the stationery that will need redesigning, printers should be in for a boom time,\" says Alambritis. </p> <p>\u0095 The new local numbers come into operation on Saturday April 22.

In February, the campaign website warned \"would-be Romeos\" of devastating consequences if they didn't get the hang of their new three-digit (02x) area codes and eight-digit local numbers: \"You may be chatting up the best-looking woman in the whole club - but blow it all by giving out your old number.\" (Actually, she'll get an error message and soon figure out your new one, but who can begrudge the beleaguered awareness-raiser a little poetic licence?) By last week things were getting serious. Computer software, fax machines, auto-dialling security alarms and phone memory banks would need reprogramming, we were warned; even more importantly, \"dog and cat owners should check pet collars carry the right telephone number.\" \"Because this is a change to people's numbers as well as their code, it's been more difficult for them to get their minds around it,\" explains Howard Sandom, campaign manager at The Big Number. \"We know people only internalise the information at the last minute, but what they have to understand is that on April 22, their existing local number stops working and\" - this is the nub - \"they have to start using the eight-digit local numbers.\" If domestic customers are confused, business users have been hassled by the switch for months. Stories abound of companies - even telephone companies - which spent thousands redesigning stationery and vehicle liveries on the assumption that London's new codes are 0207 and 0208. In fact, the single new London code is 020; the 7 and 8 are part of the numbers, and need to be dialled even when calling locally. In a heartwarming display of corporate unity, the Big Number's \u00a320m advertising campaign is funded by the industry under the name All The Phone Companies Together; its centrepiece is a \"number change machine\" allowing users to enter their old number and discover the new one. This is accessible via the campaign's website (www.numberchange.org) and a free helpline (0808 2242000), which is far easier to get through to, and certainly far more helpful, than telephoning any of the companies individually. But even as they seek to draw attention to the switchover, the telephone operators are making furious efforts to distance themselves from responsibility for it: BT's mailshots point the finger at Oftel, the regulator which initiated the move. This should not come as much of a surprise: next Saturday's change represents the latest instalment in a sequence of adjustments that arguably ought never to have been required in the first place. There have been only seven major changes to numbering in Britain since the telephone was introduced in 1879, but three of them have happened in the past decade. Critics accuse Oftel of having caved in too readily to requests for more capacity, and of monumental lack of foresight in 1995, when area codes gained a 1. The obvious excuse - that it had only just taken over responsibility for numbering from BT, and had to act fast to create new capacity - looks a little flimsy in the light of its claim then that no more changes would be required in the foreseeable future. But this is the unforeseen future, a world of proliferating mobile numbers, data lines and domestic faxes, and it's making some people uncomfortable. \"There's nothing worse than a funny-sounding noise on the line and the impression given to the customer that a business has gone bust,\" says Stephen Alambritis, of the Federation of Small Businesses. The FSB estimates most small businesses will incur costs of anything from \u00a3100 to \u00a32,000 in redesigning letterheads, shopfronts and vans, assuming that they even know about the change. Then there are foreign suppliers and customers to be alerted, software to be reconfigured and directory entries to be amended, and Microsoft Office's nasty habit of interpreting \"02\" as the international dialling code for Egypt (a \"patch\" is available at www.microsoft.co.uk). And, as Alambritis points out, it hardly helps that directory enquiries has made no apparent effort to give out the new numbers or warn of their imminent arrival. \"In 1995, the impression was given that that was it, the industry had got its act together,\" he says. \"The problem is all the chopping and changing at a time when issues like this need to be sorted out on a once and for all basis.\" Sandom is phlegmatic. \"We have to be mature enough to take this on the chin. The explosive growth of telecom in the past three to five years has caught everyone by surprise: even the most optimistic forecasters couldn't have seen how much the data and mobile networks would grow. We're introducing a system we believe will be robust for a long time to come, with a system of order we think people will welcome.\" The simultaneous introduction of other uniform prefixes - 07 for mobiles and pagers, 08 for free and local rate calls, 09 for premium services - will, he says, create a \"family of numbers\" and imbue the numbering system with the perfect logic it's lacked since three-letter exchange names were abolished in the 1960s. None of this will matter, of course, when the day finally dawns that numbers aren't needed at all. Some mobile phones can already make calls on the basis of spoken names; there's no theoretical reason why we shouldn't abandon strings of digits altogether, just as few people learn the complex sequence of numbers by which a website is technically identified. \"There'll come a time when we'll generally be talking to our computers and telephones,\" Peter Cochrane, BT's pathologically optimistic chief technologist, has predicted. And not everyone is dreading the change. \"With all the stationery that will need redesigning, printers should be in for a boom time,\" says Alambritis. \u0095 The new local numbers come into operation on Saturday April 22.

      "bodyText": "MPs today accused BMW of \"excessive secrecy and incompetence\" in its attempted sale of Rover, and criticised the government for its failure to anticipate the \"chaotic and incomplete\" break-up of the car manufacturer. A new report by the Commons trade and industry select committee found BMW had lacked \"any coherent disengagement strategy, or any plan for communicating the decisions\". \"BMW should be criticised for the manner of its disposal of Rover on grounds of incompetence and excessive secrecy,\" the report said. The committee's report also defended trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers' handling of the crisis, finding that allegations from Tory leader William Hague that Mr Byers doctored a BMW statement on March 30 \"have not been substantiated\". \"Given the assurances from the most senior managers of BMW in the UK and in Munich, it is hard to see how the secretary of state could have anticipated the decisions of March 16,\" said the Labour-dominated committee.\" Chairman Martin O'Neill MP told a Commons press conference that the committee did not believe Mr Byers was guilty \"of anything\" and Conservative committee members John Butterfill and Tony Baldry said there was more of a \"cock-up than a conspiracy\" over the statements. But the report questioned whether Mr Byers could have better anticipated BMW's decision, saying that Mr Byers was given \"some advance indication\" of BMW's plans when he met Rover boss Walter Samann on March 10, and that his officials had allegedly been similarly warned on 23 February. \"We do however detect some failure in the government's intelligence-gathering mechanism in recent weeks,\" they concluded.

Downing Street said the report provided strong backing for Mr Byers.

Should he continue to play a role in cricket?</p> <p>A sense of justice says he should not. Though he himself never made claim to be especially honourable, he was universally seen as such.

The damage the Cronje affair has done is so great that it seems wrong that the perpetrator should ever profit again from the game. </p> <p>And yet it is another Cronje - Cronje the good guy - that is desperately needed if the game is to be built up again. He had a golden touch with people, young and old.

But it is a sequence in the middle of the poem that is particularly telling: \"If you can... watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools...\" Should Cronje, who has arguably done more to break the game than any other individual, be allowed to build it up? Should he continue to play a role in cricket? A sense of justice says he should not. Though he himself never made claim to be especially honourable, he was universally seen as such. And when such people fall, they fall further, causing greater harm to those around them. The damage the Cronje affair has done is so great that it seems wrong that the perpetrator should ever profit again from the game. And yet it is another Cronje - Cronje the good guy - that is desperately needed if the game is to be built up again. He had a golden touch with people, young and old. As Wisden reported in 1996, after Cronje's season at Leicestershire: \"even an old hand like [James] Whitaker found inspiration in him.\" Cricket has lost twice over.

Brenda Laurel specialises in the cultural contexts in which websites are used, and helped Purple Moon produce a range of computer games for girls. </p> <p> <strong> Online: </strong> Usability matters? </p> <p> <strong> Ben:</strong> I'm banging on the desk saying it's time to get angry about the quality of user interfaces. As people become more dependent on this technology, their expectations have risen and I do not think the manufacturers have met that challenge. </p> <p> <strong> Jakob: </strong> Our field is now attracting so much attention. But there is still a need to communicate to people that it is not their fault when things are difficult. </p> <p> <strong> Ben: </strong> In practical environments, it is still a struggle to get companies to address this respectfully. </p> <p> <strong> Brenda: </strong> When you work with web design companies in San Francisco, you end up with a bunch of twenty-somethings who have their own cultural peculiarities, including obscurity for its own sake. You give those guys a website for a banking institution and they screw it up, because they are designing for themselves. </p> <p> <strong> Ben: </strong> You'll find the same thing anywhere: Silicon Valley, London. </p> <p> <strong> Jakob: </strong> It is their job to create interesting websites and they get all too enthusiastic about that, as opposed to just the plain and simple thing that the customer wants to do. Customers only want to be in this website for one minute, not 20. </p> <p> <strong> Brenda: </strong> I often get calls from people saying: \"I need to be first to market, I launch in three weeks, is this site usable?\" That is the rule, not the exception. And what do I say to them? I say: \"Write me a cheque; I won't be taking stock.\" </p> <p> <strong> Don: </strong> I agree. If I'm frustrated [on a website], I go to a competitor. Then it's much easier to make the usability argument because companies really are sensitive to it. United Airlines, Schwab, a whole bunch of companies, you can see them improve week by week. </p> <p> <strong> Ben: </strong> United was my \"bad guy\" example for years. They had this globe of the world with eight obscure buttons that went nowhere. Now there are 65 or 70 links on that front page. </p> <p> <strong> Brenda: </strong> Except you still can't get refunds online. </p> <p> <strong> Don: </strong> Well, that's a different issue. But it's a very important one, because to get a website to work, you also have to get the backend of the company to work right. That is where we have to work hard, because what we're really arguing for is the end experience the user has. But people often think what we're doing is merely making the screen easy to read. </p> <p> <strong> Online: </strong> But it's not the only factor? </p> <p> <strong> Don: </strong> Jakob strongly criticises websites that are not lean and mean. That's very laudable but not necessarily appropriate for all websites. I say usability is always secondary. You go to get something done; you want the usability simply not to get in the way. </p> <p> <strong> Brenda: </strong> Audiences are diverse and we need to understand their lives and their cultural context. So if I were doing a site around personal finance, for example, for women I might want to organise it around life issues like aging parents or children, whereas it is more likely that a man is going to be an aficionado of investment as a mastery issue, as a game. </p> <p> <strong> Ben: </strong> Men are more risktaking and women risk-averse in those kinds of situations? </p> <p> <strong> Brenda: </strong> Sure. That doesn't mean the whole site is going to be that way, because it could have exactly the same functionality, but coming at it through a different set of concerns and processes. </p> <p> <strong> Don: </strong> I suspect I might often prefer the female website. The point is that I don't appreciate it being labelled male or female. </p> <p> <strong> Ben: </strong> Let me give you an example of how subtle these differences are. The [US] National Cancer Institute has a site where at the top you choose doctor or patient and learn about all these various cancers. </p> <p>The patient descriptions are very thorough, they're serious stuff; and the doctor side has reference to the literature, particular medications, dosages and so on. That sounds like a good differentiation, but what happens is that after the more knowledgeable patients have read their page, they want to see what's on the doctor's page. And the doctor wants to see what their patients are getting. </p> <p>So the new redesign starts with the cancer descriptions. Then you choose patient or health professional, but you can easily go and see both. Let the user choose. Make it easy for the users to get what they want. Don't make images and mystical machines that magically figure out how users are going to behave and what they should have. Give users control. Controllable, predictable, comprehensible, that's my mantra. </p> <p> <strong> Online: </strong> Are talking webpages and voice recognition the answer? </p> <p> <strong> Jakob: </strong> It's the Star Trek fallacy. Voice is a great user interface to show on a TV show. However, in the real world, voice has a lot of downsides as a user interface because it is, by definition, not visible. </p> <p> <strong> Ben: </strong> Exactly. Why use something that is slower and more error-prone than a visual interface? Let's not undermine the great efforts that have gone into this technology. It works remarkably well. It's just not very useful. </p> <p>The airforce has spent 30 years and several billion dollars trying to make voice interaction work so why doesn't it work? Because when you're pulling 6Gs and you say \"Fire\" and it says \"please repeat\", you're not gonna use this thing ever again. Literally. </p> <p> <strong> Jakob: </strong> That is the cute answer. What is the real answer? </p> <p> <strong> Ben: </strong> The deep answer is that the cognitive load of voice interfaces is greater than hand/eye co-ordination.

      "body": "<p>Brooding on the state of world cricket in the dismal light of the Cronje affair, and contemplating where the greatest of all games can go now, a memory of my long-dead father came unexpectedly to mind. Once a professional revolutionary as well as a Marxist scholar, he was also a very Scottish Scot, so he hardly fitted the traditional image of a flannelled fool. </p> <p>Yet he loved the game with no less passion than any of the straw-hatted chumps who parade their MCC ties in the pavilion at Lord's. Thanks to a war wound which removed two fingers from his right hand, he had to abandon a promising career as a fast-medium bowler. But his enthusiasm was such that he managed to develop a weird spinning action with the stumps of his missing fingers. The jagged bits of bone which stuck out seemed to give him extra purchase on the ball, so that he could turn it like an early version of Shane Warne.

      "bodyText": "Brooding on the state of world cricket in the dismal light of the Cronje affair, and contemplating where the greatest of all games can go now, a memory of my long-dead father came unexpectedly to mind. Once a professional revolutionary as well as a Marxist scholar, he was also a very Scottish Scot, so he hardly fitted the traditional image of a flannelled fool. Yet he loved the game with no less passion than any of the straw-hatted chumps who parade their MCC ties in the pavilion at Lord's. Thanks to a war wound which removed two fingers from his right hand, he had to abandon a promising career as a fast-medium bowler. But his enthusiasm was such that he managed to develop a weird spinning action with the stumps of his missing fingers. The jagged bits of bone which stuck out seemed to give him extra purchase on the ball, so that he could turn it like an early version of Shane Warne. Or so my memory fondly tells me. Such was his belief in cricket as a civilising influence that he - with me in faithful tow - set out towards the end of the second world war to teach the complexities of the game to Italian PoWs lodging in an open camp on Royston Heath, Hertfordshire.

      "body": "<p><strong>Who won the gold and silver medals for cricket at the 1900 Olympic Games? </strong> asks Mark from Harrogate </p> <p>Great Britain, represented by a team called the Devon and Somerset County Wanderers, beat \"France\" (a combined XI from the Albion and Standard Athletic clubs, and mostly English expatriates) in the one and only Olympic final, played in Vincennes, near Paris, in August 1900. That means that Britain are the reigning Olympic cricket champions! The British team batted first and made 117 (FW Cuming 38) and 145 (A Bowerman 59, CBK Beachcroft 54): France only managed 78 and 26 (Montague Toller 7-10). The International Olympic Committee has only skimpy details of most of the players in the match, and would appreciate any biographical details of those involved.</p> <p> <strong>If the batsman hooks the ball for four (or six) but loses his balance and falls on his wicket, what would the result be? </strong>asks Imran Farooq from Lahore</p> <p> The result would be that the batsman would be out, hit wicket. It happened to Roy Fredericks, the West Indian opener, in the first World Cup final at Lord's in 1975. He played a magnificent hook shot to Dennis Lillee, but his foot slipped and he broke the stumps. Fredericks was out, even though the ball sailed out of the ground.</p> <p> <strong>Can you give me any stats for Billy Ibadulla of Pakistan? </strong>asks Pete Ingham</p> <p>Khalid \"Billy\" Ibadulla was a useful allrounder who played for Warwickshire from 1954 to 1972. He also played and coached in Lahore (Pakistan), Tasmania (Australia) and Otago (New Zealand), and later became a first-class umpire. He made a dramatic Test debut, scoring 166 for Pakistan v Australia at Karachi in 1964-65 and putting on 249 for the first wicket with another debutant, Abdul Kadir (a wicketkeeper, not the legspinner with a similar name). He also played in the Tests in England in 1967, but probably because he was based here that was the extent of his Test career: four matches, 253 runs at 31.62, and one wicket. In 4216 first-class matches he scored 17,039 runs at 27.30, with 22 centuries, and took 462 wickets at 30.87. </p> <p> <strong>Who returned the best bowling figures for England in one-day internationals during the recent tour of South Africa? </strong>asks Phil Lawrence</p> <p>It was Mark Ealham, who took 5 for 15 against Zimbabwe at Kimberley in the fifth match of the recent one-day tournament. All his victims were lbw, which is an overall ODI record.</p> <p> <strong>My partner has been given a small bat commemorating MCC's tour of East Africa in 1959. I can't make out all the names, but I can recognise Freddie Brown, Jack Bailey, Charles Robins and Billy Griffith. Who were the other players, and what happened on the tour? </strong>asks Mike Taylor</p> <p>It is an MCC tour of East Africa, but it was in the winter of 1957-58, not 1959 (MCC did make a tour in 1959, but it was to North America, not East Africa - and of the players you mention only Bailey went on that trip). The full team was FR Brown (captain), SC Griffith (player/manager), JA Bailey, GW Cook, GHG Doggart, ACD Ingleby-Mackenzie, CJM Kenny, PE Richardson, RVC Robins, DRW Silk, MJK Smith, JJ Warr and WR Watkins. They played five two-day matches and four one-day games. In all they won three, lost one and drew five. Two centuries were scored - by Peter Richardson and Hubert Doggart, both Test players. </p> <p><strong>How do the flipper and the zooter work?</strong> asks Chulaka Perera</p> <p>We've been asked this before, but it was a long time ago, so here goes again. The flipper is a difficult-to-bowl delivery which is squeezed out under the wrist, with an action rather like that used to click the fingers. When it's bowled properly, the ball hurries on to the batsman, who can be beaten by the unexpected pace. Shane Warne has often dismissed Daryll Cullinan with this ball. Warne claims to have invented the 'zooter', so we asked Mark Ray, the Australian journalist who helped write Warne's autobiography, how you bowl it. He said: \"It's difficult to explain without drawings ... but basically the zooter comes out of the front of the hand, with the fingers running across it sideways, like a legbreak - but the ball is propelled more by the palm. It's not unlike a knuckle ball, but not as slow. The zooter does very little in the air or off the pitch - which is part of the point. It's not flatter like the flipper, which is under-spun - the zooter sort of wobbles down.\" So now we know!</p> <p> <strong>Who was Sonny Ramadhin's famous bowling partner in cricket and a calypso?</strong> asks Jane Herford </p> <p>The calypso, which celebrated West Indies' first Test win in England (at Lord's in 1950) spoke of \"Those two little pals of mine, Ramadhin and Valentine.\" Alf Valentine was a left-arm spinner who, like Ramadhin, had played only two first-class matches before the tour started. Both were surprise selections - but they dominated the tour. In the four Tests Valentine took 33 wickets and Ramadhin 26, and in the tour overall Valentine claimed 123 first-class wickets and Ramadhin 135. In the new (May) edition of \"Wisden Cricket Monthly\" there is a long article by Frank Keating looking back on that 1950 tour, containing a fabulous photograph of Valentine which I had never seen before.</p> <p> <strong>Where can you find cricket stats on the net? </strong>asks Alan</p> <p>You can find updated records elsewhere on this site (www.wisden.com).

He suffered instead from an unusual neurological disease that left his mind intact while slowly destroying his ability to write, walk, and eventually talk. </p> <p>The truth about O'Neill's decline has been revealed nearly half a century after his death, in 1953, by two doctors who conducted an autopsy at the request of the writer's wife. Carlotta O'Neill asked them to do it, she said afterwards, \"because I wanted to know what in the name of God was the matter with this man I had nursed so long\". </p> <p>At the time, the family asked for confidentiality. Recently, O'Neill's grandchildren gave permission to the doctors to reveal what they found, which they have done in the New England Journal of Medicine. </p> <p>When O'Neill, author of Long Day's Journey Into Night, was 15, he and his older brother Jamie began drinking, smoking and frequenting brothels in New York, where Eugene contracted syphilis, although he was treated and did not relapse. </p> <p>But he did not throw off alcohol so easily. From 1910-12, when he was in his early 20s, he became a \"tormented, drunken drop-out from his first year at Princeton\", who drank heavily and socialised only with sailors and down and outs, say Bruce Price and EP Richardson, the Massachusetts-based doctors who did the autopsy and researched the writer's medical history. </p> <p>He pulled himself out of his despair and set himself to become a playwright. He suffered \"numerous depressive episodes\", often in conjunction with completion of a play or its production, which might have coexisted with binge drinking leading to blackouts. </p> <p>But in the last 25 years of his life he did not drink to excess and in the last eight he did not touch alcohol. </p> <p>In May 1941, he first noted in his diary that he was having trouble controlling a pencil while writing. He was soon diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. From 1942, he mentioned Parkinson's increasingly in his diaries. By May 1943, he had been forced to stop writing diaries because of the uncontrollable shaking of his hands. </p> <p>Many forms of treatment were tried without benefit. \"The combination of bromide and chloral hydrate at times induced delirium, with disorientation, hallucinations and agitation,\" the authors write. O'Neill was given daily barbiturates for anxiety. </p> <p>The immediate cause of death was pneumonia, but the autopsy revealed no evidence of Parkinson's disease. </p> <p>Although chronic alcoholism can cause such changes in the brain, say the doctors, they do not think O'Neill's drinking was to blame.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eugene O'Neill, the Nobel prize-winning American dramatist, did not have Parkinson's disease brought on by heavy drinking in the final years of his life as many have assumed. He suffered instead from an unusual neurological disease that left his mind intact while slowly destroying his ability to write, walk, and eventually talk. The truth about O'Neill's decline has been revealed nearly half a century after his death, in 1953, by two doctors who conducted an autopsy at the request of the writer's wife. Carlotta O'Neill asked them to do it, she said afterwards, \"because I wanted to know what in the name of God was the matter with this man I had nursed so long\". At the time, the family asked for confidentiality. Recently, O'Neill's grandchildren gave permission to the doctors to reveal what they found, which they have done in the New England Journal of Medicine. When O'Neill, author of Long Day's Journey Into Night, was 15, he and his older brother Jamie began drinking, smoking and frequenting brothels in New York, where Eugene contracted syphilis, although he was treated and did not relapse. But he did not throw off alcohol so easily. From 1910-12, when he was in his early 20s, he became a \"tormented, drunken drop-out from his first year at Princeton\", who drank heavily and socialised only with sailors and down and outs, say Bruce Price and EP Richardson, the Massachusetts-based doctors who did the autopsy and researched the writer's medical history. He pulled himself out of his despair and set himself to become a playwright. He suffered \"numerous depressive episodes\", often in conjunction with completion of a play or its production, which might have coexisted with binge drinking leading to blackouts. But in the last 25 years of his life he did not drink to excess and in the last eight he did not touch alcohol. In May 1941, he first noted in his diary that he was having trouble controlling a pencil while writing. He was soon diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. From 1942, he mentioned Parkinson's increasingly in his diaries. By May 1943, he had been forced to stop writing diaries because of the uncontrollable shaking of his hands. Many forms of treatment were tried without benefit. \"The combination of bromide and chloral hydrate at times induced delirium, with disorientation, hallucinations and agitation,\" the authors write. O'Neill was given daily barbiturates for anxiety. The immediate cause of death was pneumonia, but the autopsy revealed no evidence of Parkinson's disease. Although chronic alcoholism can cause such changes in the brain, say the doctors, they do not think O'Neill's drinking was to blame.",

I dismiss the application with costs,\" Judge Moses Chinhengo told a packed Harare courtroom. The judge did not explain his ruling, saying he had not had enough time to deal with all the issues raised during a police application on Monday to overturn the order for the eviction of farm squatters. The Commercial Farmers Union won the eviction order last month, but police chiefs refused to enforce it. Zimbabwe's attorney general, Patrick Chinamasa, asking for the ruling to be overturned, claimed that police did not have the resources to evict 60,000 veterans of the 1970s liberation war from an estimated 1,000 mainly white-owned farms - and that trying to do so could trigger a civil war. Meanwhile, Zimbabwean farmers reported that attacks on white-owned farms had intensified overnight as President Robert Mugabe urged the world to keep \"cool\" and insisted the land occupations were not an \"anti-white\" campaign. Farm support groups reported a sharp increase in acts of intimidation and land invasions by squatters overnight in the Karoi area, about 95 miles west of the capital Harare. Mr Mugabe, in Havana for the Group of 77 summit, laid the blame for Zimbabwe's current troubles on Britain's Labour government. He insisted that without aid from London, there would not be full compensation for affected farmers. \"I say people must be cool,\" Mr Mugabe said. \"It is not a fight against whites as such; it is a fight against a particular section of the whites who have land.\" \"What they [the squatters] have done is merely stage a demonstration - a peaceful demonstration in most cases, because they have not been guilty of any acts of violence,\" Mr Mugabe said, although he acknowledged that some farmers had been assaulted after resisting occupation. The veterans of the war against white minority rule in the former Rhodesia invaded the farms immediately after voters rejected in a referendum a new constitution that would have allowed the government to take over the land without paying compensation. The defeat was the biggest blow to Mr Mugabe in 20 years in power, and indicated a drop in support for his ruling Zanu-PF party, which faces elections within three months. The black war-veterans are demanding land that they say was stolen from their ancestors and have vowed to continue their campaign. Political observers see the re-emergence of the issue of land redistribution as a crude way for Mr Mugabe to drum up popular support, diverting attention from an economy hit by fuel shortages, mounting debts and unemployment of close to 50%.",

Earlier they said the relatives were prepared to have a meeting with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but not on the condition that they had to hand Elian over at that meeting.</p> <p>They said if the justice department sent a letter ordering Elian's surrender they would seek a court injunction to stop it.

The department said the order would not be issued unless Ms Reno failed to persuade the relatives to hand the child over voluntarily. Myron Marlin, a department spokesman, said Ms Reno - a former Miami prosecutor- hoped to use her personal contacts in the city to act as an intermediary. \"She's planning to work out a resolution, trying to meet with the parties concerned to seek a cooperative settlement,\" he said. \"She wants to do anything possible to resolve this. She realises it's a tall order but believes she may be the one who can do it.\" Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, called her trip \"a good sign\". Ms Reno's visit at least temporarily postponed a letter the government had planned to send to the Miami relatives yesterday telling them where and when to relinquish custody of Elian. \"The timing of the letter is now in Reno's hands,\" Mr Marlin said. It was learned that the latest draft of the letter called for the transfer to occur at 9am today at Opa-locka airport outside Miami. The transfer could also be moved back to tomorrow. Government officials said that if no voluntary agreement could be reached, the Miami relatives who have been looking after the boy since he was shipwrecked off Florida in November would be instructed to hand him over to Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Meanwhile rumours spread in Miami that government agents would try to storm the house where the boy has been staying and return him to his father. The boy's great uncle whisked him to the home of a sympathetic Roman Catholic nun, Jeanne O'Laughlin. Sister O'Laughlin, who is president of Barry Catholic University, said she had offered her house as a refuge from the tensions swirling around the Miami relatives' home in Little Havana. She said they were beginning to accept that they would have hand Elian over. \"I think that the family is becoming more reconciled and facing what perhaps could be pain,\" she said. \"It is my hope and prayer that as the child becomes reacquainted with his father, that there will be peace in the family.\" A meeting in Washington between the father and the relatives was cancelled on Tuesday night when Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, declared that it was \"a trap\" and said that Elian had refused to go. He claimed that the boy had even torn up a picture of his father. Cuban exile leaders who negotiated the meeting on behalf of the relatives denied that they had agreed to Elian being handed over, as his father and the justice department have requested. Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has been waiting in the Washington suburbs for the past week to be reunited with his son, broke off talks yesterday and asked Ms Reno to order the relatives to surrender Elian today. Yesterday lawyers representing Lazaro Gonzalez arrived at Sister McLaughlin's Miami home to discuss their next steps. Earlier they said the relatives were prepared to have a meeting with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but not on the condition that they had to hand Elian over at that meeting. They said if the justice department sent a letter ordering Elian's surrender they would seek a court injunction to stop it. In that case, justice department officials said, they might seek a court order to enforce their ruling.

      "bodyText": "Official results from Sunday's election showed President Alberto Fujimori fell just shy of the majority needed to avoid a run-off for an unprecedented third term, setting the stage for a showdown with international economist Alejandro Toledo. Officials said Wednesday that after counting 97.68% of Sunday's ballots, Fujimori had 49.84% compared to 40.31% for Toledo. Jose Portillo, head of the office in charge of the count, said the most the vote could change at this point was 0.05%. That means the most Fujimori could end up with is 49.89%. Thousands of Toledo's followers who were gathered in the Plaza de San Martin in downtown Lima broke into wild cheers when they heard the news. A runoff election will be scheduled for late May or early June. Throughout the campaign and Sunday's vote, international election monitors had sharply criticised Fujimori's government for using dirty tricks and intimidation to ensure another five years in power. On Sunday, exit polls and unofficial tallies by independent monitors had indicated he would not reach the 50% plus one vote needed to avoid a runoff. In Washington, the Clinton administration and Congress warned the 61-year-old leader that it would question the legitimacy of the ballot if he won in a first round and that Peru could face political and economic sanctions. Fujimori is seeking a third five-year term, something that no other Peruvian president has accomplished. During the campaign, opposition candidates accused Fujimori's military intelligence service of using rock-throwing thugs to disrupt political rallies, sponsoring lurid tabloid newspaper attacks and blocking access to state-controlled television and radio. Since Sunday's election, there have been increasing reports of voting irregularities. \"There have been innumerable accusations ... the most general being the distribution of copies of pre-marked ballots,\" the National Ombudsman Office said in a statement on Tuesday. European governments also put pressure on Fujimori to hold a run-off. \"We don't have a lot of confidence in the voting process either. It is clear that there has been a lot of irregularities during the campaign and during the day of the vote,\" British Ambassador Roger Hart said Wednesday. Chanting \"Down with the dictatorship,\" about 30,000 Peruvians rallied Tuesday night outside the downtown hotel where Toledo said social upheaval would result unless there was a runoff. \"We will not accept the results if it does not go to a second round, and if in this second round there are no substantial changes to the rules of the game,\" Toledo, 54, said while thousands of supporters rallied outside. A gigantic red and white Peruvian flag was unfurled, blanketing a mass of protesters, who passed it over their heads from one end of the plaza to the other. \"The dictator will fall,\" they chanted, referring to Fujimori's autocratic style of leadership. Large street protests also took place in a dozen cities in the interior, including Arequipa, Peru's second largest city, where anti-Fujimori feeling is particularly strong. Although popular among Peru's poor for his social programs, Fujimori's heavy-handed tactics have placed him at odds with many voters. Beginning in 1992, Fujimori staged a \"self-coup\" in which he shut down Congress and the courts, charging that they were interfering with his efforts to fight leftist insurgencies and implement free-market reforms. More recently, the Fujimori-dominated Congress that was later elected passed a law that tried to circumvent the constitution's prohibition against a president seeking a third straight term. When three members of a constitutional tribunal ruled the law was unconstitutional, Fujimori had Congress fire them. On Wednesday Toledo said he had been in touch with individual military officers who were unhappy with Fujimori's attempt to hang onto power through illegal methods. He said he was urging the armed forces to be impartial in the election. Late last year Fujimori's intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos restructured the military hierarchy, placing his cronies in all the top posts in the Defense Ministry and regional commands. But many junior officers, encouraged by retired generals, are believed to be upset with the way the election was handled and the way promotions now depend on Montesinos' recommendations.",

Numbers in oversized classes fell from 485,000 in January 1998 to 177,000 at the start of this year, and are set to fall below 50,000 in September.

They think heads and governors should have discretion as to whether extra funding over the next few years should be channelled into smaller classes or other measures to raise standards.

But they were welcomed as such by David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. </p> <p>\"We are not calling for junior pupils or secondary students to be subject to an infant-style class reduction programme. But we are urging the government to give heads additional cash so they are free to spend it on teachers and reduce their class sizes,\" he said. </p> <p>The government is spending \u00a3620m over five years to implement the manifesto pledge for five to seven-year-olds. It estimates the cost of cutting all classes to a maximum of 25 for all ages in primary and secondary schools would be \u00a33bn. </p> <p>Ministers said yesterday's figures disproved the allegations that infant class sizes were being cut at the expense of eight-11-year-old pupils. Over the past year numbers in this age group in classes over 30 fell from 835,000 (39%) to 814,000 (38%). </p> <p>The appointment of more classroom assistants helped to reduce the average adult-pupil ratio in classes of eight-11-year-olds from 22.5 to 21.7. But the number of secondary pupils in classes of more than 30 increased from 313,000 (10.8%) to 334,000 (11.3%). </p> <p>Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said that average secondary classes were now larger than at any time since 1979. </p> <p>John Dunford, of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"These children did not benefit from smaller classes in primary schools and now they are again disadvantaged in secondary schools.

The auction is being held for spectrum to be used by the so-called third generation (3G) phones - and other mobile devices - that will have the capacity to transmit good quality moving pictures and be permanently connected to the internet. This market is expected to be worth $200bn within a few years and could become the biggest consumer market ever.</p> <p>That's why the biggest players - like Vodafone and BT - are betting their shirts and more. They may not be able to afford to bid such crazy prices, but they also can't afford not to - that would leave the crown jewels with the companies' deadly competitors. The biggest and most expensive of the five licences on offer reached over \u00a34.5bn yesterday when Vodafone posted its latest bid. The auction will carry on, through a sequence of faxed bids to the Radiocommunications Agency's HQ in London's Docklands, until no further bids are received.</p> <p>This is serious money. Gordon Brown's budget made a provision of less than \u00a33bn for the proceeds. So \u00a315bn of the revenue so far accrued - 50% of which has to be paid over immediately - is pure windfall profit for the taxpayer. This compares with the peak yield from North Sea oil of \u00a311.5bn in 1985/86. The extra earnings are equivalent to a 7p reduction in income tax for a year or a huge infrastructural refurbishment, including new hospitals all over the country and a spanking refurbishment for London's creaking underground system.</p> <p>It could all end in tears, as a similar auction in the US did last year when winners defaulted on their payments, forcing a rerun which only pulled in 10% of the $4bn bid the first time round. Even if bidders in the UK's auction don't default, the huge amount spent on bids could undermine the government's long-term aim of having mass, affordable access to the internet. Mobile devices are vying with interactive television to be the main deliverer of the internet to virtually everyone - but the prices Vodafone and BT will have to charge to recoup their investment may put mobile telephony out of reach of the ordinary citizen. This is the same government, remember, that is so keen on mass access to the web that it is pressurising the telephone companies to provide free, unmetered access (apart from a monthly charge). It is not easy to see how successful bidders, having paid \u00a34bn to \u00a35bn for a licence and another \u00a32bn to \u00a33bn in construction costs, will be able to offer cheap access to consumers and good profits to shareholders.</p> <p>Except that this is all about game theory. The people who dreamed up the mechanism of the auction and the participants are all up to their eyes in it. The outcome of the auction depends not only on what you as a bidder might do, but also on the actions of other players who will be making their own calculations about what you are planning.</p> <p>BT could, for instance, be deliberately bidding up licence B in order to make Vodafone pay an unreasonably high amount, before switching to one of the cheaper licences in the hope that it will be more competitive as a result. Vodafone may think it has a vested interest in having expensive licences, in the hope that some of the the other companies a few years hence will overstretch themselves. This would leave Vodafone, already the word's biggest mobile operator, to clean up as others drop out of the market.</p> <p>At last night's prices Vodafone was paying the equivalent of around \u00a3200 for every adult in the country. If 25% of them sign up to Vodafone this works out at \u00a3800 per customer, even before the company builds the infrastructure and the phones.</p> <p>Yet even this looks cheap against the $12,400 (\u00a37,850) that Vodafone paid to capture each new customer when it bid $183bn for the German telephony company Mannesman in February. That was a paper bid in the sense that it was using the very high value of its own shares to make the bid rather than paying cash, as it will have to in this bid.</p> <p>B T and Vodafone are in any case almost compelled to go right to the line in this auction because of the consequences they will face if they don't. If Britain's biggest wireless operator (Vodafone) or the country's biggest fixed-line operator fail to get a third generation licence in their domestic markets, the effect on their share prices could be so catastrophic as to make the prices they are paying for the licences seem very small beer.</p> <p>The $65,000 question - or rather the \u00a318bn one - is what to do with the boodle. Unfortunately, Gordon Brown's hands are glued into his pockets. He is already sitting on a budget surplus of up to $15bn, which he can't easily spend without igniting City fears about economic overheating and forcing the Bank of England to put Britain's already high interest rates up to even higher levels.</p> <p>Spending on hospitals and railways doesn't have as big an inflationary impact as cutting taxes (which would be spent on consumer items rather than capital goods) but it would still upset the City, even if it spent in areas of high unemployment where the inflationary risks were lowest.</p> <p>But we can dream. The money involved is so huge - and the timescale of decisionmaking so long - that it would be worth the slight inflationary risk in order to breathe life into Britain's crumbling railways, schools, hospitals and sports facilities.

Labour MPs and union leaders demanding government intervention to save manufacturing jobs had earlier extracted a promise from the prime minister that a decision on \u00a3240m worth of military ferry orders, which could go to Germany, would be made \"not just on the best commercial grounds\".</p> <p>Mr Byers's immediate future will be bolstered when a Commons select committee clears him of knowing in advance about BMW's intentions or doctoring key minutes of talks with the company to save his skin, while accepting mistakes were made in the department of trade and industry.</p> <p>The select committee, chaired by Labour's Martin O'Neill, will acquit Mr Byers of altering documents in his running row with BMW to defend himself from charges of inactivity as the German car maker panicked in February over mounting losses at Rover - up to \u00a31bn more than expected this year - which threatened to destroy the parent company's own independence.</p> <p>Mr Byers, who meets shipyard leaders today, will be relieved the trade and industry committee found that BMW's strategy changed fundamentally at the end of February once it realised, two weeks before its agm, that it faced \u00a3250m losses for each quarter of this year, instead of the budgeted \u00a3150m loss.</p> <p>The BMW board had always been divided over buying Rover. MPs on the committee will criticise BMW's failure to consult Rover employees and call for workers to be given the right to more information.</p> <p>\"BMW made a cock-up of how they handled it. No one thinks they played fair with the workforce,\" said a leading member of the select committee.</p> <p>\"But we don't think there were proper signals given to anyone that they were heading for a terminal position.\"</p> <p>Rover is not represented on BMW's supervisory board and union officials had to rely on their German counterparts for details of the company's plans.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, will be cleared today of keeping Rover workers in the dark about BMW's plan to sell its Longbridge plant when a report by MPs is published against a backdrop of mounting problems in Britain's ailing manufacturing industries. Supporters of car makers and the shipbuilding and coal industries yesterday demanded Whitehall intervention to help them survive. Labour MPs and union leaders demanding government intervention to save manufacturing jobs had earlier extracted a promise from the prime minister that a decision on \u00a3240m worth of military ferry orders, which could go to Germany, would be made \"not just on the best commercial grounds\". Mr Byers's immediate future will be bolstered when a Commons select committee clears him of knowing in advance about BMW's intentions or doctoring key minutes of talks with the company to save his skin, while accepting mistakes were made in the department of trade and industry. The select committee, chaired by Labour's Martin O'Neill, will acquit Mr Byers of altering documents in his running row with BMW to defend himself from charges of inactivity as the German car maker panicked in February over mounting losses at Rover - up to \u00a31bn more than expected this year - which threatened to destroy the parent company's own independence. Mr Byers, who meets shipyard leaders today, will be relieved the trade and industry committee found that BMW's strategy changed fundamentally at the end of February once it realised, two weeks before its agm, that it faced \u00a3250m losses for each quarter of this year, instead of the budgeted \u00a3150m loss. The BMW board had always been divided over buying Rover. MPs on the committee will criticise BMW's failure to consult Rover employees and call for workers to be given the right to more information. \"BMW made a cock-up of how they handled it. No one thinks they played fair with the workforce,\" said a leading member of the select committee. \"But we don't think there were proper signals given to anyone that they were heading for a terminal position.\" Rover is not represented on BMW's supervisory board and union officials had to rely on their German counterparts for details of the company's plans. Mr Blair has consistently opposed European Commission proposals to extend consultation rights. Unions' concern that the rough ride manufacturing is suffering could develop into a full blown crisis is growing. In the shipbuilding industry, John Reid, the Scottish secretary, is in dispute with Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, over a Ministry of Defence order for roll-on, roll-off ferries desperately needed by yards on the Clyde and Tyne, as well as in Belfast. British shipbuilders risk being undercut - allegedly with cheap East European labour and supplies - from yards in northern Germany, MPs told Mr Blair at question time. Their anger was fuelled by a remark attributed to Mr Hoon that \"metal-bashing is no longer a vital national asset\". Mr Blair, Gordon Brown and their cabinet colleagues are sensitive to charges that their championing of the new information age economies has made them insensitive to manufacturing, which still employs around 4m people, including large chunks of the Labour core vote vital to the government's electoral prospects. But last night senior ministers refused to back calls for more \"industry friendly\" policies on interest rates and the pound. Repeating the line used by Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, in Bradford this week, they warned that those policies - or joining the euro - would provide only short-term relief. Ministers are also wrestling with a fresh crisis in the coal industry as private owner RJB Mining threatens to shut pits in Northumberland and Nottinghamshire unless it gets \u00a373m in state aid. The emotional as well as employment fallout from closing the collieries in Labour's heartlands would trigger infighting. Mr Byers, who must also decide whether to lift or keep a two-year-old moratorium on building new gas-fired power stations, is believed to be doubtful about the value of pumping millions of pounds into the coal industry. But if the aid plea is rejected, MPs in mining areas plan to contrast the government's willingness to hand BMW \u00a3152m to invest in Rover with its treatment of coal. Car industry union leaders fly to Munich today to ask their European counterparts to put pressure on BMW not to sign a deal with the venture capitalists, Alchemy, before considering ex-Rover excutive John Towers's alternative plan.",

Within 10 years there was also the war of independence to contend with. \"There were a lot of attacks and killings in this area. All the farmers were in the army and were suspicious of blacks. They said we were working with the liberation fighters. The fighters said we were working with the farmers. It was always bad when there was a killing in the area, especially if it was a white child.\" One of Gladman's four sons went to fight with Robert Mugabe's guerrillas and never returned. After independence in 1980, many of the white farmers who stayed in Zimbabwe were forced to temper their treatment of workers. But not all. \"The farmer here is not a good man. When he gets angry he throws things at us or lets the dogs on us. He got very angry one day when the machinery broke and he cut the electricity off to all our houses,\" Gladman said. \"He is like many whites. They only want to deal with blacks as workers. His attitude creates a bitterness among us. If there were to be trouble here with the war veterans I don't think any of his workers would help him.\" There is little doubt that some of the beatings administered to farmers in recent days are punishment for years of maltreatment. Neighbours of one farmer who has had a particularly difficult time at the hands of the squatters said he was notorious for forcing one of his workers in to a plastic rubbish bag and dumping him by the roadside as a punishment. But farmers insist that that is the exception in modern Zimbabwe, and some command considerable loyalty from workers who have tried to resist the land occupations. Many of the workers are doubly vulnerable because they are descended from migrant labourers who came from other countries in colonial times. In consequence, they fall outside the local traditional structures and have almost no political clout. \"I cannot say I want to work on this farm, but I have to,\" said Gladman. \"I cannot say I think this farmer should keep this farm, but if he doesn't then I will not have a job. I have claimed a bit of the land but I do not think my family can survive on that. Anyway, if they can take the land from the whites they can take it from me.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Post Office is within weeks of a signing a \u00a3200m deal with high street banks in a desperate attempt to prevent a stampede of closures in rural villages and inner cities, according to directors. If the Post Office fails to strike the deal, as many as 8,000 post offices - including 900 in Yorkshire and 250 on Merseyside - face closure, according to internal figures placed in the Commons library. As many as 877 post offices face threat of closure in Wales and 875 in Scotland. The closures stem directly from the government's decision to automate pension and benefit payments direct to claimants, so depriving the 8,000 independently run post offices of more than 40% of their income. Automation, due to save the government a minimum of \u00a3400m, is due to start in 2003 and end in 2005. But local post office managers are already voting with their feet by closing, adding to the sense that rural communities are losing their commercial lifeblood. Tony Blair yesterday came under severe pressure in the Commons over the threat of mass post office closures as Tory leader William Hague accused him of meaningless reassurances. The Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy called for the \u00a3400m-plus savings to be ploughed back. But Stuart Sweetman, group managing director of retail banking services, told the all party community banking group on Monday that the Post Office was within weeks of signing a deal with 12 high street banks under which local post offices would provide banking for those without bank accounts. There are thought to be more than 3m people without bank accounts. Mr Sweetman, according to Labour MP Desmond Browne, who attended the meeting, said that the service would provide the post offices with \u00a3200m of extra income, replacing nearly half the revenue likely to be lost as a result of introduction of automated benefit. In the Commons, the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, said he would be tabling a much trailed amendment next Monday at the report stage of the post offices services bill, which would allow the government to subsidise the network. He said that this amendment would set up a financial scheme to ensure that essential services could still be delivered through a nationwide network of local post offices. The Commons exchanges came on the day sub-postmasters submitted a 3m-strong petition protesting at the rise of closures. However, the shadow industry secretary, Angela Browning, said the sub-postmasters will lose a significant chunk of their income without the slightest idea of how the loss would be made up. \"It's past five to midnight as far as the post offices are concerned,\" she said. The Post Office figures show that in northern England, 494 post offices depend for more than 40% of their income on benefit payments. On Merseyside, 210 of the 304 post offices were likely to close, the figures suggest. And in Peter Mandelson's constituency of Hartlepool, 14 out of 19 post offices depend on benefits for more than 40% of their income, the figures show.",

      "body": "<p>ICL, the Fujitsu-owned information technology company, is to spin-off a number of units and shift focus towards e-business services ahead of its planned \u00a35bn flotation later this year. </p> <p>The e-learning business Knowledge Pool is to be listed in London and on Nasdaq in June or July, with Finnish unit ICL Data Oy aiming for a Helsinki listing around the same time. </p> <p>The moves, combined with the closure of ICL's trade distribution business and a 3i-backed management buyout of its Spares Logistics division, are expected to raise several hundred million pounds which will be ploughed back into e-business services and an internet incubator fund. </p> <p>\"A line has been drawn in the sand,\" said Keith Todd, the chief executive. \"We have had to clear our past in some areas and will now live in an e-future. These moves will unlock value in the group and allow significant reinvestment opportunities.\" </p> <p>In November, ICL said it would invest \u00a3100m in e-business expansion. The latest strategic shift will place ICL in direct competition with IBM, Unisys and Cap Gemini, heavy investors in e-business services.. </p> <p>The company will be divided into three new areas - innovation, applications and infrastructure - and its 22,000 workers based in 40 countries retrained in e-business skills at the rate of around 3,000 a year. </p> <p>In 1999 ICL's e-business revenues were \u00a3160m, double the previous year. Total group revenues in the year to March 1999 were \u00a32.74bn with pre-tax profits of \u00a364.5m. </p> <p>Mr Todd refused to give firm details on ICL's flotation plans but expected around 25% of the shares to be offered to the public before the end of the year. </p> <p>He insisted that the flotation plans would proceed regardless of the current market volatility for hi-tech stocks. </p> <p>Asked how much the sale might raise, when turbulent market conditions have seen some hi-tech initial public offerings founder, he said only: \"That is a very interesting question.\" </p> <p>Knowledge Pool has a turnover of some \u00a355m and makes a profit of \u00a35m, Mr Todd said, while ICL Data Oy is valued at around \u00a3840m. </p> <p>The incubator will focus on creating companies that can support e-commerce customers and then floating them. \"I would not expect to spin out the entire incubator unit, but over the years ahead there will be a number of spin-outs,\" Mr Todd added. </p> <p>ICL e-business's customers include Thomas Cook, First Direct, BBC Worldwide and the Lord Chancellor's department. Yesterday it announced further contracts with mySAP in Britain, Affinity Internet Holdings and night clubs group Ministry of Sound. </p> <p>ICL's e-business service spans new media design, consultancy and systems implementation. It also manages e-infrastructure services on behalf of clients. </p> <p>ICL was listed on the stock market until 1985 when it was taken over by STC. Fujitsu of Japan bought the company in the early 1990s.</p>",

      "bodyText": "ICL, the Fujitsu-owned information technology company, is to spin-off a number of units and shift focus towards e-business services ahead of its planned \u00a35bn flotation later this year. The e-learning business Knowledge Pool is to be listed in London and on Nasdaq in June or July, with Finnish unit ICL Data Oy aiming for a Helsinki listing around the same time. The moves, combined with the closure of ICL's trade distribution business and a 3i-backed management buyout of its Spares Logistics division, are expected to raise several hundred million pounds which will be ploughed back into e-business services and an internet incubator fund. \"A line has been drawn in the sand,\" said Keith Todd, the chief executive. \"We have had to clear our past in some areas and will now live in an e-future. These moves will unlock value in the group and allow significant reinvestment opportunities.\" In November, ICL said it would invest \u00a3100m in e-business expansion. The latest strategic shift will place ICL in direct competition with IBM, Unisys and Cap Gemini, heavy investors in e-business services.. The company will be divided into three new areas - innovation, applications and infrastructure - and its 22,000 workers based in 40 countries retrained in e-business skills at the rate of around 3,000 a year. In 1999 ICL's e-business revenues were \u00a3160m, double the previous year. Total group revenues in the year to March 1999 were \u00a32.74bn with pre-tax profits of \u00a364.5m. Mr Todd refused to give firm details on ICL's flotation plans but expected around 25% of the shares to be offered to the public before the end of the year. He insisted that the flotation plans would proceed regardless of the current market volatility for hi-tech stocks. Asked how much the sale might raise, when turbulent market conditions have seen some hi-tech initial public offerings founder, he said only: \"That is a very interesting question.\" Knowledge Pool has a turnover of some \u00a355m and makes a profit of \u00a35m, Mr Todd said, while ICL Data Oy is valued at around \u00a3840m. The incubator will focus on creating companies that can support e-commerce customers and then floating them. \"I would not expect to spin out the entire incubator unit, but over the years ahead there will be a number of spin-outs,\" Mr Todd added. ICL e-business's customers include Thomas Cook, First Direct, BBC Worldwide and the Lord Chancellor's department. Yesterday it announced further contracts with mySAP in Britain, Affinity Internet Holdings and night clubs group Ministry of Sound. ICL's e-business service spans new media design, consultancy and systems implementation. It also manages e-infrastructure services on behalf of clients. ICL was listed on the stock market until 1985 when it was taken over by STC. Fujitsu of Japan bought the company in the early 1990s.",

      "body": "<p>The railway's most feisty champion is rail regulator Tom Winsor, but yesterday he appeared to run into trouble with a government watchdog when he was criticised for not being tough enough on Railtrack.</p> <p>The snapping hound was the illustrious National Audit Office. But surely it was making some mistake in attacking him. After all, Tom Winsor is the man who, since he took charge of the Office of Rail Regulation last July, has at last taken on the track and station maintenance company. He has reduced Railtrack's double figure share price to around \u00a37 and earnt the opprobrium of its chief executive, Gerald Corbett.</p> <p>In fact the NAO report reaches back to 1994, reflecting the conduct of the regulator's office over the past six years. These were lost years, it might be said, when Railtrack enjoyed a far cosier relationship with the regulator than it does today.</p> <p>The NAO report reflects what Mr Winsor discovered when he took over the reins - the worst infrastructure since before privatisation, an increasing number of broken rails, and poor performance at Railtrack. (A relatively mild winter has helped Railtrack to start turning this around.)</p> <p>Within the next year, Mr Winsor will almost certainly be forcing Railtrack to remedy the NAO criticisms, for example, giving a more realistic explanation of the supposed \u00a35.8bn cost of upgrading the west coast main line, the most expensive rail project in Europe.</p> <p>But in a speech last night, Mr Winsor highlighted an equally thorny issue, the relationship between his office and the Strategic Rail Authority, a politically accountable body bringing in more than \u00a31.5bn of government funding into the rail industry to buy services. The graphic shows the architecture of the industry. The absence of an arrow between the authority and the regulator is telling.</p> <p>Chaired by the architect of the Channel tunnel, Sir Alastair Morton, the SRA and Mr Winsor have enjoyed an uneasy partnership. Sir Alastair has objected to what he regards as Mr Winsor's over-exuberant approach to his job, while the regulator believes that the SRA should put a new strategy for the industry at the top of its list.</p> <p>When the government's transport legislation is enacted in the summer, Mr Winsor's consumer portfolio will disappear. It will be down to the SRA to report on complaints from passengers and whether the industry's telephone booking number is working efficiently. Can the SRA do it as well as an independent regulator?</p> <p>The restructured and privatised rail industry is very much a partnership between public and private sectors. The SRA is the public partner in this relationship, buying services, negotiating contracts and injecting funds. In that role it has to be politically accountable.

      "bodyText": "The railway's most feisty champion is rail regulator Tom Winsor, but yesterday he appeared to run into trouble with a government watchdog when he was criticised for not being tough enough on Railtrack. The snapping hound was the illustrious National Audit Office. But surely it was making some mistake in attacking him. After all, Tom Winsor is the man who, since he took charge of the Office of Rail Regulation last July, has at last taken on the track and station maintenance company. He has reduced Railtrack's double figure share price to around \u00a37 and earnt the opprobrium of its chief executive, Gerald Corbett. In fact the NAO report reaches back to 1994, reflecting the conduct of the regulator's office over the past six years. These were lost years, it might be said, when Railtrack enjoyed a far cosier relationship with the regulator than it does today. The NAO report reflects what Mr Winsor discovered when he took over the reins - the worst infrastructure since before privatisation, an increasing number of broken rails, and poor performance at Railtrack. (A relatively mild winter has helped Railtrack to start turning this around.) Within the next year, Mr Winsor will almost certainly be forcing Railtrack to remedy the NAO criticisms, for example, giving a more realistic explanation of the supposed \u00a35.8bn cost of upgrading the west coast main line, the most expensive rail project in Europe. But in a speech last night, Mr Winsor highlighted an equally thorny issue, the relationship between his office and the Strategic Rail Authority, a politically accountable body bringing in more than \u00a31.5bn of government funding into the rail industry to buy services. The graphic shows the architecture of the industry. The absence of an arrow between the authority and the regulator is telling. Chaired by the architect of the Channel tunnel, Sir Alastair Morton, the SRA and Mr Winsor have enjoyed an uneasy partnership. Sir Alastair has objected to what he regards as Mr Winsor's over-exuberant approach to his job, while the regulator believes that the SRA should put a new strategy for the industry at the top of its list. When the government's transport legislation is enacted in the summer, Mr Winsor's consumer portfolio will disappear. It will be down to the SRA to report on complaints from passengers and whether the industry's telephone booking number is working efficiently. Can the SRA do it as well as an independent regulator? The restructured and privatised rail industry is very much a partnership between public and private sectors. The SRA is the public partner in this relationship, buying services, negotiating contracts and injecting funds. In that role it has to be politically accountable. The rail regulator is very different, checked and balanced, akin to the regimes established in telecommunications, gas, electricity and water. Regulation, Mr Winsor says, is an important part of a model of industrial reorganisation which has been exported by Britain to many other countries, and it works. Investors and lenders not only want it, they need it. While remaining committed to working with the SRA, he is clearly worried that the handover of his responsibility for promoting the interests of passengers may be affected. Some of Mr Winsor's critics in the industry - and there are some who resent the interference of the legally precise Scotsman - say this is just the regulator protecting a diminishing empire. But the industry needs someone as tough and dedicated to rail as Mr Winsor has been in his nine months in the job. On the other hand, the SRA is a johnny come lately. Pushed into a siding by John Prescott after he lost a battle with Downing Street over the introduction of his big transport bill in 1998, the SRA will only be officially launched in the summer. Until then it remains a \"shadow\". Chairman Sir Alastair Morton is an impressive man who was handpicked by John Prescott after giving much needed advice to the government on how to handle the debacle of the Channel tunnel rail link project two years ago. He is alert and wants to get things done quickly. Indeed, there is the political imperative of the next election for him to demonstrate that the SRA has began to grapple with the industry and is turning it round, with new franchises and new money. Mr Prescott is bearing this out with a huge cash injection into the industry, but Sir Alastair cannot promise quick results. How can he transform the railway overnight and turn it into a model for the rest of the world? Sir Alastair's other problem is that he is in a part-time, two-and-a-half day a week job, even though his hours are much longer. At a time of so much change, and with an increase of 25% in passenger usage, the industry requires a full-time leader. Unfortunately, Sir Alastair is not well.

He is getting desperate to win a few seats. He needs an issue. And he thinks he may have found it.</p> <p>Asylum, moreover, is not something he has dredged up from the gutter. It's a problem amenable to the most solemn grandiloquence. Mr Hague has decided he has \"an absolute duty\" to talk about it. This is the sonorous defiance he holds out against those who criticise some of the things his people have said. The numbers of asylum seekers, more than 70,000 in 1999, create, he claims, a national crisis, which demands his dutiful attention. So he won't be silenced by the namby-pambies, brave fellow. The definitive speech is being worked on, for delivery next week.</p> <p>Mr Hague is right about some of this. Requests for asylum have multiplied in recent years, stirred by the turmoil in the Balkans and the overflow from it across central Europe. A lot of human crises have landed on our soil, together with a fair number of people whose way of addressing these crises is to exploit them as cover for their own trickery and deceit, and thereby make their own claim to a right to be here. An exceedingly messy situation has developed. It imposes big burdens on certain counties, like Kent, and creates administrative challenges to the government which the Home Office, starting with its defective computers, has been incompetent at meeting.</p> <p>All this is meat for legitimate criticism. Though the numbers are less than 0.1 per cent of the population of one of the half-dozen richest countries in the world, there's an oppositionist job to be done against Jack Straw's Home Office, just as there is against David Blunkett's DfEE or any other department. Except that asylum raises more delicate matters than primary school class-sizes. Argument about it easily touches a racist nerve. It is sensitive stuff. Xenophobia is waiting to be aroused, alongside mundane disputes about who will make good the budget of Kent social services.</p> <p>Stirring up hatred of people, as a people or group or class or generally blocked-out enemy, is the risk. Words need to be used with care, and always accompanied by constructive proposals about how the social problem, if it is a problem, might practically be diminished. But rising portentously to the very toes of his absolute duty, Mr Hague has respected none of these sensitivities. There is a terrible recklessness, to put it no lower, about the words his party bandies about. Its manifesto for the local elections touches every button. \"Labour has made this country a soft touch for the organised asylum racketeers who are flooding the country with bogus asylum seekers,\" it says. That translates: asylum is ipso facto a racket, aliens are taking over Britain, every one of them is a fraudster until proved otherwise. All that's missing is the Tiber flowing with blood.</p> <p>For we've been here before. The only difference between Enoch Powell's philippic in 1968 against the migrant masses whose numbers were destroying the British nation, and Mr Hague's demagogic caricature of asylum in 2000, is that whereas Powell was expelled from the shadow cabinet for saying what he said, today's shadow cabinet has made his political strategy their own. Ann Widdecombe, Hague's blustering ally in this matter, finds it perfectly respectable to list each of the mild pro-immigrant measures Labour has taken since 1997 as part of her anti-asylum indictment, without ever referring to the causes of the increased demand. As far as the Tory party is concerned, the Kosovo war never happened and Balkan, let alone Somali or Rwandan or Nigerian or Colombian, tragedies do not exist - though Rhodesia looks like being an exception.</p> <p>A screen of respectability sometimes covers Mr Hague's own words. There are references to the need to protect \"genuine\" asylum-seekers from the rest. But here is authentic bogusness, the genuine bogus article, addressed to a party which in its present incarnation shows no interest in asylum-seekers of any kind, the genuine any more than the deceiving. Any such refinement would complicate the political message, now delivered into the local elections, that the Tories alone can be relied on to take a harsh line against the flooding influx of racketeering aliens.</p> <p>The Home Secretary's own line has not always been sympathetic, or straight. On Monday he traded insults with Ms Widdecombe as to which party could proudly claim to spend less money on asylum-seekers, which one had scandalously dabbled in amnesties, whether Labour or the Tories could be reliably the tougher. But his department is doing practical things, especially by recruiting and training more adjudicators to speed up the testing of each asylum case, the only way Britain can meet its obligations in international law and human decency. The government has slowly improved the system, with results that do not reinforce the stereotypes of the Tories and their press. Last year nearly half the asylum seekers whose cases reached a judge were allowed, after due process, to remain.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives are all mouth, foaming mouth. It is a repugnant spectacle. The high-flown way to look at it might be as an expression of the party's existential crisis. After all, its ground as a party of the centre-right has been purloined. Many of the issues that made it centrist belong to the other side. It now experiences an intractable conflict between globalisation and nationalism. It is supposed to be a free market party, but free markets these days destroy national borders. People as well as capital are on the move. The high-ground analysis of Mr Hague's attitude to asylum could offer him some sympathy. Perhaps he's a man in pain, searching for a new rightist identity and driven towards a kind of nationalist protectionism that sits uncomfortably with the economic philosophy he is supposed to believe in.</p> <p>But let's not be too kind. The only pain he's aware of is the probability of being routed. Something more basic is at work. The absolute duty to speak must, of course, have its day. With numbers swelling, and the department emerging from a period of chaos, a veneer of earnestness is available to the Tories. Behind it, though, there's a fluttering of uncontrollable excitement. At last an issue to make British blood run fast and cold. Never mind delicacy. Never mind truth. William has found something that will be pleasing to his own masses, and perhaps appealing to the outer edge of people who didn't vote Conservative in 1997. For the months are moving forward, and the polls are not. Let the prophet Enoch come in from the wilderness. It has come, I'm afraid, to that dismal epitaph.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

Mr Straw also attacked the Tories for refusing to support his measure to fine lorry drivers who were found guilty of wilfully bringing in illegal immigrants. The previous Tory government had failed to negotiate a proper flexible deal on the return of illegal immigrants within the EU, he added. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said it was \"absolutely ridiculous\" to suggest that the growth in the number of people seeking asylum in this country was anything to do with the actions of host countries. Mr Hughes said the leadership of the Tory party had behaved \"disgracefully\" and \"deserved to be condemned\" because they \"don't just seek to pander to prejudice, they positively misrepresent facts in order to be able to do that\" The Labour former minister Gerald Kaufman launched stinging attacks on both the Tory party and recent comments of independent London mayoral candidate Ken Livingstone. Mr Kaufman said his parents were provided with sanctuary in Britain after fleeing eastern Europe before most of their families were \"slaughtered\" in the Holocaust. \"Therefore I want to say how bitterly I resent the cheap remarks of Ken Livingstone in likening capitalism to what the Gestapo and Hitler did to the Jews, the homosexuals and all the other people who were murdered by the Nazis,\" he said. \"Such a person is not fit to stand for public office let alone to be elected to public office.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government is braced for further confrontation in the Lords tonight as Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition join forces to tighten controls over the new post of financial services watchdog. Though opposition peers echo widespread praise in the City for Howard Davies, the man who will become both chairman and chief executive of the financial services authority (FSA), they believe the two roles should be split - if not now, then later. The proposed structure has been moulded too much in Mr Davies's image, they suggest. If crossbench peers back them, as seems likely, and ministers do not back down on key points they face their 11th Lords defeat this year. The row came as Tories warned that the government is in danger of facing a \"legislative bottleneck\" in the Lords, with major bills piling up for scrutiny. Their leader in the upper house, Lord Strathclyde, forecast that ministers would be hard pushed in the months ahead to meet their deadlines. Tory peers have fallen in behind the Lib Dems to back a raft of amendments to the financial services and markets bill, which will bring the powers of the present assortment of nine financial regulators under a single authority. They believe the FSA will not be sufficiently accountable to consumers, parliament or to City institutions. But the row over the FSA bill - already much amended in the Commons - is now bound up with the growing assertiveness of the half-reformed Lords and their impatience with the mounting backlog of bills, many of them in constant need of amendment. Yesterday senior Tories called for a month's delay on the financial services bill, claiming that City leaders want more time to consider late government amendments of which there have already been 500. The treasury minister in charge, Melanie Johnson, is warning them not to play \"political games\". However, even she is signalling concessions to strengthen consumer protection. Lib Dem peer Lord Newby, who is leading moves to reform the legislation during its Lords report stage, warned last night: \"At the moment the FSA has huge powers which are not sufficiently moderated, either by its own structures or by the extent to which it has to be accountable to parliament or consumers.\" Because of concerns over Mr Davies's role, opponents argue that his job should be split into two to improve accountability. They want a new consumer panel within the FSA to have more power to force the authority to take notice of its recommendations, as well as an annual report to parliament. Opposition front bench treasury spokesman, Lord Saatchi, said leading City figures were concerned over the financial services bill. \"They feel as we do, that it's impossible to judge this bill properly in the round when you are dealing with so many individual amendments at such a late stage and they have asked for a month's pause,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>As a non-Jew I find David Irving's remarks (Irving: consigned to history as a racist liar, April 12) deeply offensive. His assertion that \"if the British soldiers on the beaches of Normandy in 1944 could look forward to see what England has become, they would not have bothered\", is breathtakingly obscene. My late father fought in the war to rid Europe of fascism. He witnessed the results of the extermination of Jews in concentration camps. Such was the profound effect of what he saw, he never talked about it. It was only after his death that I learnt from my mother the full horror of what he had seen. What a waste of such an intelligent mind that Irving should feel it necessary to recast history in such a twisted way. <br><b>Robert Minton-Taylor</b><br> Cononley, N Yorks</p> <p>\u0095 The outcome of David Irving's abortive libel action is not merely a victory for Deborah Lipstadt. It is also a victory for the victims of the Holocaust, against such insidious attempts to trivialise and marginalise the 20th century's greatest crime. <br><b> Nigel Baldwin </b><br> Portsmouth <a href=\"mailto:N.Baldwin@btinternet.com\">N.Baldwin@btinternet.com </a></p> <p>\u0095 Presumably Irving will now deny that he lost the case. <br><b> Tom Freeman</b><br> Sheffield</p> <p>\u0095 The particular vileness of Irving's offence was to increase the suffering of the survivors of the Holocaust by denying that suffering existed. Unfortunately, one kind of Holocaust denial will continue. It continues every time the totemic number of 6m is used. That figure excludes socialists, communists, homosexuals, the disabled and Gypsies - all denied, as Irving tried to deny for the Jews, the final dignity of a clearly recorded place in history. How large is the final figure? Does any one know?</p> <p>The overarching evil idea behind Nazism was the belief they had the right to cleanse the world of any group they hated. As a life-long socialist of the kind the Nazis would have called communist, my fate in Nazi Germany would have been no different from my Jewish friends. When are \"my people\" going to get their memorial - in recorded history, if nowhere else? <br> <b> Jeff Wells,</b><br> London <br><a href=\"mailto:Jeff.Wells@mencap.org.uk\">Jeff.Wells@mencap.org.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 You claim Mr Justice Gray's decision means \"Irving can no longer call himself a historian\" (History's verdict on Holocaust upheld, April 11). This sentiment makes a nonsense of the historian's craft, a craft where theoretical relativism has had some success in challenging old-fashioned positivist assumptions. Undoubtedly, many of Irving's conclusions are opportunistic and consciously biased, but there is the theoretical point that, with no recorded source showing Hitler's authorisation of the Holocaust, a certain degree of caution must be made. People angered by Irving should counter-argue rather than dogmatically condemn and financially cripple him, which just enforces this stubborn English mentality of a true and narrative history from above that is protected by the courts. <br><b> N Robinson </b><br>Loughton, Essex<br> NickTheSticks@hotmail.com</p> <p>\u0095 So \"Irving was motivated by a desire to present events in a manner consistent with his own ideological beliefs\". Such a lack of objectivity is,of course, unheard of in sociology. <br><b>Prof Keith Dixon</b><br>Simon Fraser University, Canada</p> <p>\u0095 Your condemnation of Irving seems excessive. Is he not entitled to ask for proof? May he not ask why Jews are hated? Did Hitler do nothing right? There is an unfortunate similarity between press headlines and Nazi propaganda in the common intent to silence. If it is wrong to attend assemblies of \"right-wing\" humans, then I plead guilty to attending Tory activist gatherings to hear shocking views comparable to Irving's.</p> <p>Anti-semitism, xenophobia, sexism, etc are all evils to be fought, but making a living or a lifestyle out of attacking a selected prejudice leads directly to McCarthy-style scenes, which Irving can reasonably claim to have endured. Waving arms in triumph outside the high court is no longer, if it ever was, proof of fair play or justice. Scapegoating never solved anything. Constant action to correct injustice across the board is the one and only solution. <b><br> Bill Abbotts </b><br> Foxton, Cambs <br><a href=\"mailto:mail@cambridgeiq.com\">mail@cambridgeiq.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 The judgment has revealed the historian to be a cynical manipulator of historical information. His views are distasteful, extreme and offensive to the vast majority. But this does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of those outside the court who threw eggs at Mr Irving.The crimes of the Nazis were far from unique.

      "bodyText": "As a non-Jew I find David Irving's remarks (Irving: consigned to history as a racist liar, April 12) deeply offensive. His assertion that \"if the British soldiers on the beaches of Normandy in 1944 could look forward to see what England has become, they would not have bothered\", is breathtakingly obscene. My late father fought in the war to rid Europe of fascism. He witnessed the results of the extermination of Jews in concentration camps. Such was the profound effect of what he saw, he never talked about it. It was only after his death that I learnt from my mother the full horror of what he had seen. What a waste of such an intelligent mind that Irving should feel it necessary to recast history in such a twisted way. Robert Minton-Taylor Cononley, N Yorks \u0095 The outcome of David Irving's abortive libel action is not merely a victory for Deborah Lipstadt. It is also a victory for the victims of the Holocaust, against such insidious attempts to trivialise and marginalise the 20th century's greatest crime. Nigel Baldwin Portsmouth N.Baldwin@btinternet.com \u0095 Presumably Irving will now deny that he lost the case. Tom Freeman Sheffield \u0095 The particular vileness of Irving's offence was to increase the suffering of the survivors of the Holocaust by denying that suffering existed. Unfortunately, one kind of Holocaust denial will continue. It continues every time the totemic number of 6m is used. That figure excludes socialists, communists, homosexuals, the disabled and Gypsies - all denied, as Irving tried to deny for the Jews, the final dignity of a clearly recorded place in history. How large is the final figure? Does any one know? The overarching evil idea behind Nazism was the belief they had the right to cleanse the world of any group they hated. As a life-long socialist of the kind the Nazis would have called communist, my fate in Nazi Germany would have been no different from my Jewish friends. When are \"my people\" going to get their memorial - in recorded history, if nowhere else? Jeff Wells, London Jeff.Wells@mencap.org.uk \u0095 You claim Mr Justice Gray's decision means \"Irving can no longer call himself a historian\" (History's verdict on Holocaust upheld, April 11). This sentiment makes a nonsense of the historian's craft, a craft where theoretical relativism has had some success in challenging old-fashioned positivist assumptions. Undoubtedly, many of Irving's conclusions are opportunistic and consciously biased, but there is the theoretical point that, with no recorded source showing Hitler's authorisation of the Holocaust, a certain degree of caution must be made. People angered by Irving should counter-argue rather than dogmatically condemn and financially cripple him, which just enforces this stubborn English mentality of a true and narrative history from above that is protected by the courts. N Robinson Loughton, Essex NickTheSticks@hotmail.com \u0095 So \"Irving was motivated by a desire to present events in a manner consistent with his own ideological beliefs\". Such a lack of objectivity is,of course, unheard of in sociology. Prof Keith Dixon Simon Fraser University, Canada \u0095 Your condemnation of Irving seems excessive. Is he not entitled to ask for proof? May he not ask why Jews are hated? Did Hitler do nothing right? There is an unfortunate similarity between press headlines and Nazi propaganda in the common intent to silence. If it is wrong to attend assemblies of \"right-wing\" humans, then I plead guilty to attending Tory activist gatherings to hear shocking views comparable to Irving's. Anti-semitism, xenophobia, sexism, etc are all evils to be fought, but making a living or a lifestyle out of attacking a selected prejudice leads directly to McCarthy-style scenes, which Irving can reasonably claim to have endured. Waving arms in triumph outside the high court is no longer, if it ever was, proof of fair play or justice. Scapegoating never solved anything. Constant action to correct injustice across the board is the one and only solution. Bill Abbotts Foxton, Cambs mail@cambridgeiq.com \u0095 The judgment has revealed the historian to be a cynical manipulator of historical information. His views are distasteful, extreme and offensive to the vast majority. But this does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of those outside the court who threw eggs at Mr Irving.The crimes of the Nazis were far from unique. The mass murder carried out in the name of international communism surpassed even the evil of Hitler. We must not allow communist sympathisers and apologists to brand their form of extremism as purely anti-Nazi. Hard-line extremists, whether of the right or left, are cynical manipulators of the truth. Chris Kelly Wolverhampton chrisdkelly@hotmail.com \u0095 Goethe stated that \"I do not know myself, and God forbid that I should\". Unfortunately this will never be a tangible concern for Irving.

The 6-3 ruling by an extended panel of the court in a closed session overturns a 1997 decision that the detention was lawful. Mr Rish said yesterday that he owed his victory to the remorse of the chief of the supreme court, Aharon Barak, for that decision. \"Chief Justice Barak has changed his mind and in the verdict he is saying bravely that since that verdict three years ago he could not stop thinking about it. Over and over, he thought about that mistake, and now he has the courage to admit he was wrong.\" But the verdict was condemned by Mr Arad's mother as a \"betrayal\" of her son, and by a senior army officer, who said the kidnappings were seen at the time as an effective way of security the officer's release.",

He is your proud, black, urban man with all those subversive traits that are irresistible to many women and deeply threatening to white men. Last winter he brought another baby father, Victor, to talk to me about his children for a book I am writing.</p> <p>There was, said a weary Victor, the problem of the new black woman who no longer indulges men like him: \"They're changing, man. Three strikes and you're out. They want their BMW man who will come home bringing flowers, a happy-ever-after life. Most black men can't provide this.\"</p> <p>Patrick, a local hero among south London lads, believes that men who womanise are victims of circumstance and of wily women who know exactly how to exert power using their sexuality: \"There is a lot of animosity between black men and black women today. Black men reject intelligent black women and go with young girls who look up to them. You know, give them comfort because it is hard being a black man. Sad to say, what starts as a dance or a flirtation, ends up as a baby. And let me tell you, there are a number of men who never agreed to be fathers.

Just like Darcus [Howe] once said. We are black men, that means we make babies all the time. I try to buy them nice things and I would break anyone who tried to harm my kids. But try to go inside our heads. We are kept out of everything. The one place we know we can win, where the white man is no good, is in bed. This is where we can be kings. That is what I thought when I was young. All my children were born before I was 21.\"</p> <p>It is essential not to see this only as a \"black\" problem. Young white men have as many partners and children. All around us there are black fathers and partners - Sir Herman Ouseley, Paul Boateng and a host of others - who are role models for all of society. Writing in Black British Feminism, the academic Tracey Reynolds rightly criticises the dangerously simplistic way this subject has been dealt with in the media, but you only have to read the Voice to see that it is now perceived as a major area of concern.</p> <p>The 1991 census recorded that 49% of Afro-Caribbean families are headed by a lone mother compared with 14% in the general population. Some are high achievers who have made the decision to go it alone, partly because they cannot find the man and relationship they want. These are self-determining baby mothers rather than gullible victims of baby fathers.</p> <p>Others are lone mothers as a result of death, divorce and other \"normal\" events. But a substantial number are young, poor and emotionally vulnerable. But even these women do seem to be getting more sussed.</p> <p>Sadie, 19, has two children by two men who are friends: \"I am stupid. I thought they were the coolest guys, and I was so lucky. They were great dancers and they look at you and you melt. But now I just want to look after my boys. I don't want them to grow up like their dads - all talk and nothing else.\"</p> <p>Donna, finally decided to throw out Wayne, the father of her child and another by her arch rival in school, Aimee: \"I think Aimee and I both had babies as a competition for a man who was never worth it. Then he started beating me up and said he would go off to her if I complained. And just to keep face I said nothing. Now some third woman is expecting his child. I will not let him near my child.\"</p> <p>A number of other women have multiple partners themselves so that they are not dependent on the good will of one baby father. Patrick despises such women: \"They want one man to fix the house, another for sex, one to take them partying. They use children as weapons and I have seen men crying over the way they are treated.\"</p> <p>He has started a pressure group for men struggling against women who are becoming a little too much like baby fathers themselves. White baby mothers are, I think, less trouble. I spent an evening with a group of them recently and they were indeed desperate to be understanding. They talked about the effects of slavery on black men, and explained how it was possible to live with betrayal and double-standards.

He told a radio interviewer that he thought openly gay people would not share his conservative views. Nor has he promised to maintain the federal non-discrimination policy on the employment of gays.</p> <p>Asked last year whether he would emulate his party rival for the nomination, John McCain, and meet representatives of the Log Cabin Republicans, an 11,000-strong gay rights pressure group, Mr Bush replied: \"Probably not\".</p> <p>Leaders of the Log Cabin group have been excluded from today's meeting, organised by a gay PR executive in Washington whose brother is a Bush fundraiser. About a dozen gay and lesbian people are expected to attend, including a Bush campaign official.</p> <p>In 1992 Bill Clinton took 87% of gay votes when he defeated President George Bush.

But after this year's primary contest, in which he concentrated on winning traditional conservative support to capture his party's nomination, the meeting marks a cautious attempt to reach out to more liberal voters. His campaign team is treading carefully in advance of the meeting, anxious not to offer the anti-gay Reform party candidate, Pat Buchanan, a chance to make this a campaign issue. The get-together is being billed as a discussion of common ground on issues such as education, health care and tax. \"I welcome all people to my team,\" Mr Bush said. \"I'm looking forward to the meeting.\" In the past he has refused to meet Republican gay activists and has been evasive about whether he would appoint openly gay men and women to positions in his administration. He told a radio interviewer that he thought openly gay people would not share his conservative views. Nor has he promised to maintain the federal non-discrimination policy on the employment of gays. Asked last year whether he would emulate his party rival for the nomination, John McCain, and meet representatives of the Log Cabin Republicans, an 11,000-strong gay rights pressure group, Mr Bush replied: \"Probably not\". Leaders of the Log Cabin group have been excluded from today's meeting, organised by a gay PR executive in Washington whose brother is a Bush fundraiser. About a dozen gay and lesbian people are expected to attend, including a Bush campaign official. In 1992 Bill Clinton took 87% of gay votes when he defeated President George Bush. Recent surveys have shown a steady Democrat lead of two-to-one among gays. Liberal Republicans such as the New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman - a possible Bush vice-presidential nominee - are among the few party members who are prominent supporters of gay rights.",

At one point party strategists even considered a further move of headquarters and leaving Millbank, which is something of a symbol of control freakery.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour has started to build links with the Al Gore presidential campaign, hoping at the general election to mirror his plan to paint George Bush as a rightwinger with tax figures that fail to add up. Labour has settled on winning a historic second term in government by pushing the public perception of William Hague to the right, by seeking to cost ruthlessly his spending pledges and then counter them with his promise to cut taxes as a proportion of GDP. Members of the Downing Street policy unit this week met with leading members of the Gore campaign staff. Tony Blair's office is also said to be in regular contact with Bob Shrum, one of the vice president's most senior advisors. Mr Shrum has told Labour that Mr Gore was starting to pull ahead of Mr Bush by using campaign techniques to pain him as a rightwing extremist, and that the Gore briefing room was repeatedly portraying the Bush tax-and-spend promises as being incredible. The Gore campaign cited a Wall Street Journal report that Bush \"is carrying an extra burden: he must find the money to pay for health initiatives while also pushing for a big tax cut\". The briefing continued by saying that Bush was pushing a $2.1 trillion tax giveaway that exceeded the projected available budget surplus by nearly $1 trillion, according to an independent study by the Citizens for Tax Justice. Labour believes that the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, will be unable to pull out of the Conservatives' tax guarantee made by Mr Hague, when he promised to reduce the overall burden of tax as a proportion of GDP. The Treasury is already costing some of the Conservative pledges, including those on health, welfare, education, asylum and defence. It is not clear whether Labour will use civil servants to make the costings, although such a practice was used in the past by the Conservatives. Amongst the Labour figures who have travelled to the US in recent months are Philip Gould, the party's pollster and strategist, who was one of the architects of the 1997 victory and is also a long term ally of the Clinton Democrats. He is already drawing up the dividing lines on which Labour would prefer to fight the election, expected to be next spring. Douglas Alexander, the Paisley South MP and a close ally of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, has also been to the US. Mr Brown is leading the team forming Labour's campaign strategy, while Peter Mandelson is to be responsbile for its detailed implementation. Mr Mandelson, despite his duties as Northern Ireland secretary, has already found time to make his presence felt at Millbank, the party headquarters. Millbank's official chief, the party's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, is also expected to go to the Democrat party's convention in the summer. Shaun Woodward, the Witney MP who defected from the Tories last summer and masterminded the Tories' 1992 general election campaign, also visited the Gore campaign in February and is due to make another visit next month. Mr Woodward is being asked to advise Mr Brown and Mr Mandelson on how to fight rightwing populist tax campaigns. At a day long Cabinet meeting recently, Labour agreed that it should not make the mistake of retreating to its heartlands vote, insisting that the middle class/working class coalition that won the 1997 election needs to be retained. However, the party has agreed to alter some of the rhetoric and try to shed its so called \"control freak\" image. At one point party strategists even considered a further move of headquarters and leaving Millbank, which is something of a symbol of control freakery.",

However, most British national collections are prohibited, by law, from disposing of any works for any reason. Lord Janner, the Labour peer, and the commission on looted art, are among those who have been demanding a promise from the government that there will be restitution of the objects themselves.

      "bodyText": "A man who faked celebrity autographs was yesterday sentenced to six months of weekend curfews. Paul Wilson, 35, of Bridgham, Norfolk, offered forged signatures of Diana, Princess of Wales, John Lennon and Steve McQueen. Wilson admitted 12 sample charges of obtaining property by deception by selling forged signatures to mail order customers at Norwich crown court in November. Judge Paul Downes yesterday ordered him to remain indoors on Saturdays and Sundays between noon and 11pm. The court heard that he had repaid all complainants and that he had debts of more than \u00a315,000. Karim Khalil, defending, said Wilson and his wife were working to clear their debts and that jailing him would be a catastrophe. Police and trading standards officers began investigating when customers complained that Wilson's firm, Paul Wilson Autographs, had taken their money but sent nothing in return. Trading standards officers then bought autographed pictures of footballers David Beckham and Michael Owen from Wilson and checked with the players, who said the signatures were forgeries.",

      "bodyText": "One of the most senior women in the prison service claimed yesterday that she was humiliated, ignored and nicknamed \"the baglady\" after upsetting her superiors by campaigning for reforms. Katie Dawson, former head of the women's jail at Risley, Cheshire, told an employment tribunal that she had been sidelined and passed over in favour of less experienced male colleagues when the prison was closed last year. Mrs Dawson, 56, who had won praise for reaching the top of an often macho profession, said that she was the only member of staff at the women's prison to be left without consultation or advice on what job to do next. She told the tribunal in Manchester that her role was so marginalised that she was left without an office and was derided as the Risley baglady - or rough sleeper - by junior colleagues. Mrs Dawson said that her problems had begun on her appointment to head the jail in 1994, after a successful period as a senior governor at Strangeways prison, Manchester. Her zeal for reform in a complex where 96 women shared one bath, and the lavatories still had urinals from the previous men's prison, had upset the system, she said. \"It was soon evident to me that the conditions afforded to the women were not up to the standards that male prisoners had. It was further obvious there was a lack of HQ strategy to deal with the problems of women's units,\" she said. She also raised concerns about bullying and violence among women prisoners, partly triggered by the miserable conditions. Mrs Dawson said that she sensed that the waves she made were worsened by her spare-time novel writing, especially when a publisher accepted a romance based in jail. The book, published under the pseudonym Maggie Marshall but based on Mrs Dawson's 25 years' experience in the prison service, described a love affair between a priest and a woman prisoner officer. The latter is subsequently taken hostage by a body-building lesbian inmate. The tribunal heard that Risley's shortcomings were denounced in 1996 by the then chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, who paid a surprise visit to the women's jail. He commended Mrs Dawson's efforts at reform, but she was moved sideways shortly afterwards to a newly-created position. When she asked what it involved, she said, she was told: \"You will just be there.\" She was then passed over for a position as head of custody at the Risley complex, which also includes a men's prison and remand centre, and a younger and less qualified male colleague got the job. She was persuaded not to go to an industrial tribunal at that stage because of the further embarrassment it would bring to the prison. \"Reforms were also begun,\" she said. \"Most importantly, staffing was made up to levels where at long last inmates could have exercise, which was supposed to have been their statutory right.\" But she decided to bring the case when the long-drawn-out death of the prison left her without a proper budget and \"working with very demoralised colleagues\". Mrs Dawson, who now works at the Risley complex as head of inmate activities, said: \"I am not a troublemaker, a feminist or any type of eccentric. There is discrimination and retaliation within the prison service, both towards inmates and staff. \"There are more male staff than woman, and challenging procedures and equality results in the position I have found myself in.\" The hearing continues today.",

      "bodyText": "High doses of vitamins, which some people take in the belief that they will improve their health or ward off disease, can be harmful, a distinguished American scientific body said yesterday. For the first time, upper limits have been recommended by the dietary experts for the intake of vitamin C and the mineral selenium. Their guidance will be controversial in Britain where a powerful campaign mounted by health food companies and consumers in 1998 led to the government shelving proposals to put limits on vitamin B6 consumption. Vitamins are antioxidants, which are believed by many to reduce the chances of suffering cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's and other illnesses by mopping up damaging molecules called free radicals. The US national academy of sciences panel looked at the evidence for the effectiveness of four of the most popular antioxidants, vitamins C and E, selenium, and beta carotene, which is turned into vitamin A in the body. It concluded there was nothing in the scientific literature to suggest that high doses of these supplements could protect against illness. Excess beta carotene, in particular, was known to increase the risk of cancer in some people, especially smokers. The panel set no limits for beta carotene, holding the view that it should not be taken at all other than by people with a vitamin A deficiency. Many people take high doses of vitamin C to ward off colds. But the experts said the scientific evidence was \"not consistent or specific enough\" to warrant a recommended intake for this purpose. On the other hand, there have been suggestions that excessive vitamin C could be damaging. A study published two years ago by Leicester University, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, suggested that high doses of vitamin C could lead to cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. \"A fine balance exists that may be disrupted in favour of oxidants (oxidative stress), giving rise to an accumulation of biomolecular damage, which in turn may play a role in major diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis,\" said the study, published in Nature magazine. A British advisory group reviewing vitamin dose levels in the wake of the B6 controversy is expected to take account of the American recommendations. The group, set up by Maff last year, is due to report to the new food standards agency in April 2001 with its own upper limit guidelines. The food standards agency, which has now taken over responsibility for food supplements from Maff, played down the suggestion that vitamins could have harmful effects. A spokesman said: \"There's a lot of information around that suggests some supplements may be harmful if used to excess, but it remains to be seen whether that is actually proven. The jury is still out in many cases. \"Generally the advice is that if you eat a balanced diet you don't need supplements unless you are deficient in some way.\" The American experts said eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day would provide the recommended vitamin C levels, while the chief source of vitamin E should be food such as nuts, seeds, liver and leafy green vegetables. Good sources of selenium included seafood, liver, meat and grains; pre-formed vitamin A was found in liver, fish oil, egg yolk, milk and butter; and beta carotene in dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, carrots, tomatoes and apricots. The panel's recommended daily intakes were: vitamin C, men 90 milligrams, women 75 milligrams; vitamin E, 15 milligrams; selenium, 55 micrograms.",

      "bodyText": "A gang which included a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl was yesterday convicted of murdering a student who was beaten unconscious and thrown off a central London footbridge into the Thames. The older members of the gang, which included three homeless men, face life in prison for the attack on Timothy Baxter, 24, who drowned after he was manhandled into the river 40ft below. His friend Gabriel Cornish, 25, was also beaten and thrown into the river but was rescued from the fast-moving waters by passers-by. Mr Baxter, a law student from London, and Mr Cornish, a music student, were attacked in June last year as they returned home from a night out in central London. The court heard that their six attackers - who were all either homeless or mixed with rough sleepers around Leicester Square - had attempted to rob the two students and had punched, kicked and stamped on their heads until they became unconscious. After throwing them into the river the gang laughed and joked about whether their bodies would float before two of the gang went on to attack and rob a third victim. Sonni Reid, 20, John Riches, 22, Cameron Cyrus, 18, all of no fixed abode, and a 16-year-old girl and two teenage boys now aged 15 and 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were all convicted of murdering Mr Baxter and attempting to murder Mr Cornish. The 17-year-old youth burst into tears while the other defendants held their heads in their hands as the jury forewoman returned the verdicts. The jury of six men and six women had taken eight hours to complete their deliberations after the 10-week trial. Judge Anne Goddard QC adjourned sentencing until next month, but the adult defendants all face mandatory life sentences, while the juveniles face indefinite youth custody. Reid and Riches were also found guilty of attempting to rob both men of a silver bracelet, a rucksack and a skateboard. Riches and the 17-year-old were convicted of causing actual bodily harm in the attack on the third victim. The two students were returning home at 4am on June 18 last year when three of the defendants - Reid, Riches, and the 17-year-old, then 16 - approached and tried to rob them. As the youngest boy repeatedly threatened to throw Mr Cornish into the river, the two victims spotted three other people coming towards them from the north bank. The men begged for help only to realise that the three were members of the same gang, who then joined in the attack. The two-month trial, attended every day by Mr Baxter's parents, heard how both the victims were savagely beaten and hurled over the 4ft railings of Hungerford footbridge. Mr Cornish regained consciousness as he drifted in the fast-flowing current. He was rescued after passers-by heard his cries for help. But an intensive police search failed to find Mr Baxter and his body was washed up the next day near his home in the Oxo Tower. Mr Cornish, who spent two weeks in hospital, broke down in court as he gave a moving account of his ordeal.

One mother, Hayley Harvey, who received a letter about her four-week-old son, Layton, said: \"I have a five-year-old daughter who has been kissing him. From what I understand TB is spread like a cold. What about her and all the kids at her school?\" Recent reports have said that every year around 400 people in Britain die of TB, which was known as the White Plague during Victorian times.",

At the climax of a brief yet masterly speech, the Queen told them: \"Due in no small measure to the bravery and dedication over the years of the men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland is now a much more peaceful and stable place in which to live.

Mr Livingstone and Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer both support a bond-financed public sector option, while Mr Dobson backs the part-privatisation scheme favoured by the government.

Mr Blair attacked Mr Livingstone's bonds and congestion charge policy as \"irresponsible on grounds of cost\", and implied that the government's part-privatisation scheme - already part of an act of parliament - would go ahead regardless of whether most Londoners voted for him as mayor. However, he added: \"Of course it matters if a candidate is violently against the private sector and it would make it much more difficult to get the work done in the way we want it\". Mr Blair's spokesman later added: \"The government's intention is to proceed with the public-private partnership - we'll see what happens\".

The programme has launched generations of sketch writers, and Hudd has fronted every show, except on the occasion he was fog-bound in France.",

Outside the wild mushroom shop, he pukka-ed up and kissed the glass. With lips as bee-stung as Jamie's, this was perhaps inadvisable.

And bring a palette knife!\" - but as quickly as the calamity arose, it dissipated. There was a loud pop and Jamie was free again, free to make his salad and have a larf. Personally, I don't find salad very funny but Jamie assured us that if we ripped up our peaches and tore our mozzarella, it'd be a hoot. He did have a serious point to make however. \"It is tempting to buy those bags of salad.

To smoke like Carrie smokes, her stunning features Sabatier-sharp as she sucks hard on the wet tip of a Marlboro Light. It makes you wish they'd hurry up and clone spare body parts so you can get yours replaced when they're all blackened with cancer. Beautiful misery. </p> <p>Misery that was only too real was the subject of <strong> Inside Story </strong> (BBC1). Every week in England and Wales, two women are murdered by their partners or ex-partners. In 1995, Loraine Whiting was one of those women, but thanks to this thoughtful documentary, she was transformed from easy-to-ignore statistic into a rounded, vital woman whose life and death was charted by her daughter, mother and family friends. </p> <p>After suffering 20 years of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her partner then husband, Len Carter, she packed her belongings into her beloved 2CV and left him.

Some commentators allege that it is a conspiracy between the military and the nuclear industry to dispose of dangerous waste in hostile countries. The real reasons are more complex. </p> <p>Metallic uranium occurs naturally in tiny quantities. In its native state it is a mixture of highly radioactive uranium-235 and less active U-238. U-235 is used in reactors and atomic weapons; once it is extracted, the remainder is depleted uranium. It is a poisonous heavy metal like lead or mercury but only slightly radioactive. You could hold a piece of DU for days without serious exposure to radiation, but swallowing or inhaling it is more dangerous. Experts are still arguing about how long uranium stays in the body; the longer it remains, the greater the chance that the radioactivity will cause cancer. </p> <p>To understand why DU makes a good anti-tank weapon you have to enter the Alice-In-Wonderland world of high energy collisions. When metal meets metal at five times the speed of sound strange things happen. Hard ened steel shatters like glass. Metal flows like putty, or simply vaporises. A faster shell does not necessarily go through more armour, but, like a pebble thrown into the water, it makes a bigger splash. </p> <p>Armour penetration is increased by concentrating the force of a shell into as small an area as possible, so the projectiles tend to resemble giant darts. The denser the projectile, the harder the impact for any given size. DU is almost twice as dense as lead, making it highly suitable. The other metal used for anti-tank rounds is tungsten, which is also very hard and dense. When a tungsten rod strikes armour, it deforms and mushrooms, making it progressively blunter. Uranium is \"pyrophoric\": at the point of impact it burns away into vapour so that the projectile stays sharp. This results in what the military describes as \"behind armour effect\". When it breaks through, the burning DU turns the inside of a vehicle into an inferno of white-hot gas and sparks. </p> <p>Normal uranium is not as hard as tungsten. But a classified technique allows it to be hardened. This is believed to involve alloying it with titanium and cooling so that it forms a single large metallic crystal rather than the usual chaotic mass of tiny crystals. This monocrystalline structure is very strong and produces an improvement like the difference between a brittle pencil lead and a carbon-fibre tennis racket. The final advantage of uranium is cost. Machined tungsten is expensive, but governments supply DU more or less for free. </p> <p>As with most weapons, depleted uranium is not as deadly as its proponents - or its critics - claim. One tank was hit four times with no causalities. Twenty US vehicles took penetrating hits from DU weapons during the Gulf conflict. Thirteen crew members were killed, but 113 others - almost 90% - survived. The survivors are being monitored for long-term adverse effects, and the arguments continue over the dust produced when a DU weapon strikes a target. Estimates of the risk range from \"negligible\" to a 7% chance of developing cancer for anyone living in an area contaminated by DU. There is also the question of whether uranium dust plays a part in Gulf War Syndrome. </p> <p>These arguments are likely to continue indefinitely. But it is likely that DU will be phased out, not for health reasons but for military ones. It was introduced as an engineering solution to the problem of breaking through heavy armour. As with other areas, heavy machinery is being superseded by computer technology. Tank armour is concentrated mainly at the front, facing the main threat; it is thinner on the sides and thinner still on top. If the entire vehicle was clad in thick armour it would be too heavy to move.

It is fired like a normal artillery shell into the target area, where it ejects two submunitions which descend by parachute. As they fall, Sadarm scans the ground with radar and infra-red sensors. Targets are identified and the most important selected - a Scud launcher in preference to a tank, a tank rather than a truck. Sadarm attacks by firing a slug of molten metal at the selected target. The slug takes on an aerodynamic shape as it travels through the air, ideal for piercing armour. Though less powerful than a DU shell, the explosively formed projectile can break through the top armour of any tank. </p> <p> Engagements between tanks are fought face-to-face, at a maximum distance of about four kilometres. Munitions like Sadarm can be lobbed at an enemy 20 kilometres away. Missiles carrying brilliant munitions can range out to 100 kilometres or more; the only limitation is the ability to locate enemy tank formations. Depleted uranium weapons will be used as long as they are useful; indications are that this will not be for many years more. </p> <p>Sadarm and other brilliant weapons do not use radioactive uranium.

      "body": "<p>Stephen Burbidge is the kind of man betting companies adore. He loves gambling and spends up to \u00a350 a week spicing up his enjoyment of horse racing and football. He's also a solicitor with an income much higher than many of his fellow punters. </p> <p>Ironically, the main reason betting companies are so fond of Stephen is that he hasn't been near a betting shop in ages. He places all his bets online. </p> <p>Over the next 10 years the betting companies believe that people like Stephen will revolutionise the way the industry is perceived in this country. They predict that a combination of the internet, mobile phones and interactive TV will deliver a golden age where placing a bet will seem as harmless and every day as doing the Lottery. </p> <p>The main vehicle for this revolution - the internet - is perfect for betting. Just like the hugely successful online share transactions, it relies solely on the delivery of time-critical information thereby avoiding the dreaded \"white van man syndrome\" of hanging about waiting for goods to be delivered. </p> <p>It is also quick and easy and, most important, bypasses the betting shop - a place where many online punters wouldn't be seen dead . </p> <p>Today there is a host of sites all eagerly pitching for punters' money. They are all keen to grab a slice of an industry that the financial analysts Datamonitor predicts will be worth more than \u00a32bn by the end of 2002. </p> <p>It is not just the nature of betting that's changing: the punters are different too. Internet betting sites are attracting a new breed of punter light years away from the flat cap and whippet-owning image of the betting shop gambler. One betting company reported that in its shops only 1% of bets were placed on sports traditionally popular with ABC1s such as cricket, golf and Formula One. These are the sports that are proving very popular with the online punters. The web site <a href=\"http://www.bluesq.com\">www.bluesq.com</a> is eager to target these new punters. It is very simple to use and largely free of the jargon that pervades traditional sites such as <a href=\"http://www.totalbet.com\">www.totalbet.com </a>.</p> <p> \"Betting should be fun,\" argues Ed Pownall of Bluesq \"and our site is all about the average person having a little flutter.\" To prove his point, Pownall mentions the site's special bets section. Punters can place bets on Coronation Street storylines, political events and the lives of celebrities. Pownall says that the site has very attractive odds on David Ginola copying David Beckham's skinhead hairstyle by the end of the year. Also targeting the new punters is <a href=\"http://www.firststake.com\">www.firststake.com</a> whose June launch will coincide with the start of football's Euro 2000 tournament. </p> <p>Firststake.com director Simon Grieve says the site will target \"sports fans - the kind of people who only make the occasional bet and very rarely make it to the bookies\". He adds that \"if those people start placing bets on a regular basis we'll see a massive growth in the industry\". </p> <p>The site's unique approach is that it will have a very high level of sporting content. Users will be able to check out the latest sporting news before placing their bets. Firststake is also hoping its no-nonsense approach will appeal to the growing number of women who are interested in sport. Both firms are confident that one of the ways that the new breed of punters will check out their websites is through their TVs. </p> <p>By the end of this year consumers will be bombarded with boxes enabling internet access via their home set. However, the technology that is really exciting the betting companies is interactive TV. </p> <p> Over the next few years the companies are hoping to muscle in on live sporting broadcasts and offer interactive betting. This may mean their odds for the result of a Premiership football match flashing up on screen in the run-up to a big televised game. Eventually punters may be offered instant odds on events within the game itself - like a Beckham free-kick hitting the back of the net. </p> <p>The clear leader in the field is Ladbrokes which has ties with two cable TV companies CWC and Telewest and interactive TV specialist, Two Way TV. It has also signed a deal to provide a betting service for Sky Digital's Open service. </p> <p>\"The key when dealing with TV viewers is to make the bets easy to understand,\" explains Ladbrokes' head of e-commerce John O'Reilly. \"There's no point in using betting jargon. You need to say press this button and we'll give you \u00a35 for your \u00a31 bet if United win 2-0. It has to be that simple\". </p> <p>Betting companies aren't only banking on interactive TV. Almost all the major websites see internet mobile phone betting as pivotal to their business plans. </p> <p>\"Wap [wireless application protocol] phones will enable users to study the form and place bets wherever they are - even on the bus\" says David Annat, MD of PA Sporting Life, part owners of <a href=\"http://www.totalbet.com\">www.totalbet.com</a> He adds that the site will be the first to provide a Wap service next month. </p> <p>Internet betting ought to be a dead cert, but there are a few major hurdles that the websites will have to clear before they start making big money. One of the main reasons on-line betting has become so popular is the websites' tax policy. Typically, UK residents pay out a whopping 9% tax on their winnings on bets made via shops. </p> <p>However, most of the betting sites are swallowing that extra 9% and offering punters tax-free betting. It is a move that they argue has been forced upon them by offshore betting companies that don't have to pay tax to the British government. </p> <p>In order to compete, many leading UK based betting companies now run two sites in tandem - the official UK based site and a dot.com site targeted at European and Far Eastern punters. The dot.com has a permanent commitment to tax-free betting and is located outside the UK. British residents can place bets with either site. </p> <p>Betting companies have been lobbying the government for over a year to reduce the amount of tax it takes, and several have threatened to depart for an offshore tax haven if the government does not comply. In last month's budget, instead of the much hoped for reduction in betting tax, Gordon Brown merely offered consultation. </p> <p>The betting companies are split as to what is likely to happen next. Graham Sharpe of William Hill says he would \"rather offer tips on the 2.30 at Kempton than try and guess what the government is going to do\". </p> <p>However, David Annat of Totalbet has a more pessimistic view: \"I think the government will do nothing and keep the tax at its present rate. They know that if companies go offshore they will sacrifice access to UK advertising and they won't be able to participate in interactive TV betting. </p> <p>\"I think it's a shame because inevitably the co.uk wesbites will have to levy tax and this will make them uncompetitive compared with offshore sites. The irony is that as the Americans are virtually legally prevented from betting online, this is one sphere where the UK could lead the world.\" </p> <p>The first big hurdle for many of the companies was last weekend and what several had called the first e-National. </p> <p>By Monday almost all the major websites were saying that on Saturday they were simply not able to cope with the demand. By 1pm placing an online bet was virtually impossible. Annat of <a href=\"http://www.totalbet.com\">www.totalbet.com</a> admitted that the site had struggled to cope with the two million page views it had experienced across three days.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Burbidge is the kind of man betting companies adore. He loves gambling and spends up to \u00a350 a week spicing up his enjoyment of horse racing and football. He's also a solicitor with an income much higher than many of his fellow punters. Ironically, the main reason betting companies are so fond of Stephen is that he hasn't been near a betting shop in ages. He places all his bets online. Over the next 10 years the betting companies believe that people like Stephen will revolutionise the way the industry is perceived in this country. They predict that a combination of the internet, mobile phones and interactive TV will deliver a golden age where placing a bet will seem as harmless and every day as doing the Lottery. The main vehicle for this revolution - the internet - is perfect for betting. Just like the hugely successful online share transactions, it relies solely on the delivery of time-critical information thereby avoiding the dreaded \"white van man syndrome\" of hanging about waiting for goods to be delivered. It is also quick and easy and, most important, bypasses the betting shop - a place where many online punters wouldn't be seen dead . Today there is a host of sites all eagerly pitching for punters' money. They are all keen to grab a slice of an industry that the financial analysts Datamonitor predicts will be worth more than \u00a32bn by the end of 2002. It is not just the nature of betting that's changing: the punters are different too. Internet betting sites are attracting a new breed of punter light years away from the flat cap and whippet-owning image of the betting shop gambler. One betting company reported that in its shops only 1% of bets were placed on sports traditionally popular with ABC1s such as cricket, golf and Formula One. These are the sports that are proving very popular with the online punters. The web site www.bluesq.com is eager to target these new punters. It is very simple to use and largely free of the jargon that pervades traditional sites such as www.totalbet.com . \"Betting should be fun,\" argues Ed Pownall of Bluesq \"and our site is all about the average person having a little flutter.\" To prove his point, Pownall mentions the site's special bets section. Punters can place bets on Coronation Street storylines, political events and the lives of celebrities. Pownall says that the site has very attractive odds on David Ginola copying David Beckham's skinhead hairstyle by the end of the year. Also targeting the new punters is www.firststake.com whose June launch will coincide with the start of football's Euro 2000 tournament. Firststake.com director Simon Grieve says the site will target \"sports fans - the kind of people who only make the occasional bet and very rarely make it to the bookies\". He adds that \"if those people start placing bets on a regular basis we'll see a massive growth in the industry\". The site's unique approach is that it will have a very high level of sporting content. Users will be able to check out the latest sporting news before placing their bets. Firststake is also hoping its no-nonsense approach will appeal to the growing number of women who are interested in sport. Both firms are confident that one of the ways that the new breed of punters will check out their websites is through their TVs. By the end of this year consumers will be bombarded with boxes enabling internet access via their home set. However, the technology that is really exciting the betting companies is interactive TV. Over the next few years the companies are hoping to muscle in on live sporting broadcasts and offer interactive betting. This may mean their odds for the result of a Premiership football match flashing up on screen in the run-up to a big televised game. Eventually punters may be offered instant odds on events within the game itself - like a Beckham free-kick hitting the back of the net. The clear leader in the field is Ladbrokes which has ties with two cable TV companies CWC and Telewest and interactive TV specialist, Two Way TV. It has also signed a deal to provide a betting service for Sky Digital's Open service. \"The key when dealing with TV viewers is to make the bets easy to understand,\" explains Ladbrokes' head of e-commerce John O'Reilly. \"There's no point in using betting jargon. You need to say press this button and we'll give you \u00a35 for your \u00a31 bet if United win 2-0. It has to be that simple\". Betting companies aren't only banking on interactive TV. Almost all the major websites see internet mobile phone betting as pivotal to their business plans. \"Wap [wireless application protocol] phones will enable users to study the form and place bets wherever they are - even on the bus\" says David Annat, MD of PA Sporting Life, part owners of www.totalbet.com He adds that the site will be the first to provide a Wap service next month. Internet betting ought to be a dead cert, but there are a few major hurdles that the websites will have to clear before they start making big money. One of the main reasons on-line betting has become so popular is the websites' tax policy. Typically, UK residents pay out a whopping 9% tax on their winnings on bets made via shops. However, most of the betting sites are swallowing that extra 9% and offering punters tax-free betting. It is a move that they argue has been forced upon them by offshore betting companies that don't have to pay tax to the British government. In order to compete, many leading UK based betting companies now run two sites in tandem - the official UK based site and a dot.com site targeted at European and Far Eastern punters. The dot.com has a permanent commitment to tax-free betting and is located outside the UK. British residents can place bets with either site. Betting companies have been lobbying the government for over a year to reduce the amount of tax it takes, and several have threatened to depart for an offshore tax haven if the government does not comply. In last month's budget, instead of the much hoped for reduction in betting tax, Gordon Brown merely offered consultation. The betting companies are split as to what is likely to happen next. Graham Sharpe of William Hill says he would \"rather offer tips on the 2.30 at Kempton than try and guess what the government is going to do\". However, David Annat of Totalbet has a more pessimistic view: \"I think the government will do nothing and keep the tax at its present rate. They know that if companies go offshore they will sacrifice access to UK advertising and they won't be able to participate in interactive TV betting. \"I think it's a shame because inevitably the co.uk wesbites will have to levy tax and this will make them uncompetitive compared with offshore sites. The irony is that as the Americans are virtually legally prevented from betting online, this is one sphere where the UK could lead the world.\" The first big hurdle for many of the companies was last weekend and what several had called the first e-National. By Monday almost all the major websites were saying that on Saturday they were simply not able to cope with the demand. By 1pm placing an online bet was virtually impossible. Annat of www.totalbet.com admitted that the site had struggled to cope with the two million page views it had experienced across three days. Other sites such as www.bluesq.com, which staged a large advertising campaign in the days before the race, also conceded that bets had been lost. It claimed 45,000 bets in the run up to the race and registered 7,000 new punters. Yet in spite of those missing bets and annoying punters such as Burbidge who had snapped up Papillon at its optimum price of 33-1, it had been a good day. \"It is not about money taken,\" claims Graham Sharpe of William Hill. \"It's about increasing awareness of online betting and registering new customers.\" In that case Papillon wasn't the only winner last Saturday. The real loser in this online gold rush could be our flat-cap wearing, whippet-owning stereotype betting shop gambler. Still, with www.bluesq.com offering 500-1 that all betting shops will be closed within the next 10 years, he could always hedge his bets.",

There are \"invisible\" effects - even on period pieces such as The End of The Affair: grading, retouching, colouring, and removal of undesirables, such as lighting rigs. Then there are special effects - the wild excesses of the mega-budget blockbusters. \"Most of the work is in the detail, which is laborious,\" Thum reveals. \"So you might get the shots looking good quickly but to finish it might take a couple of weeks.\" </p> <p>One of his favourite effects was on Eyes Wide Shut. To get the film past American censors, it was necessary to cover up certain unsavoury body parts with less graphic computer generated bodies. This caused a lot of difficulties for CFC: \"When they shot the scenes, they didn't know they would do anything digital to them, so there was no tracking data or anything like that. There were huge camera moves through lots of different rooms and they had very grainy footage as well. So it was a learning process working out what makes something look human.

CFC created this missing cliff section digitally, using a composite of several different 35mm rock stills. In all, CFC completed 150 shots; some were large scale, \"obvious\" effects, others \"invisible\" effects, such as removing rigs or creating weather effects. </p> <p><strong> Sleepy Hollow </strong><br> CFC completed 120 effects shots on Sleepy Hollow, even removing the head of the film's central character, the Headless Horseman. An actor played the horseman wearing a blue hood, which was digitally removed. The actor's head and neck movements distorted some of the collar and coat. CFC painstakingly created a 3D collar for him. To make this collar move exactly with the horseman's body CFC designed a skeleton which, when animated, would move the collar in the right way.</p>",

The Irish have kind of got it, as have the Americans... over here we just haven't. Are you excited by new developments like Wap? I work with a big European broadband player and the web is just another platform - albeit the biggest at the moment. When you start looking at doing stuff on TV and Wap platforms you realise how radical this internet business actually is. I wouldn't like to guess a time-scale but there will come a day where there will be many devices and many platforms with content pushed to each as appropriate. Any favourite places on the net? I don't do newsgroups anymore. I think Up My Street is fantastic - the guys who created that must be pretty amazing. I love Need To Know. On the e-commerce side I love EasyJet. The way you can find stuff so quickly is a model for other sites. Less well-known is Haddock which has four or five links everyday to weird and wonderful things. \u0095 Stand can be found at www.stand.org.uk",

The same question could prompt different responses at different times: it all depends on the scriptwriter, and the programming. </p> <p>\"Smart toys\" are believed to have about 5% of a global toy market worth $65bn in 1998, including computer and video games. The potential market for toys with speech recognition is much larger than the $3.25bn that implies. Speech recognition could be added to a wide range of dolls, soft toys and action figures, as well as toy telephones, juke boxes, clocks, voice-controlled video game controllers and other devices. </p> <p>Many toy sales are driven by characters ranging from Mickey Mouse to South Park, and Lee says that HI Worldwide has signed a \"memorandum of understanding with a major US motion picture and TV company\" to co-develop toys. The company is also developing \"talking Fifa World Cup mascots\" for the event in Korea and Japan in 2002. </p> <p>HI will not make or sell toys. Its strategy is to license characters and use them to develop toys for manufacturers such as Hasbro and Mattel. Examples could include Stuart Little, the talking mouse from Sony's hit movie of the same name, and Nintendo's Pikachu from Pok\u00e9mon. </p> <p>\"All the characters have their own movies and their own TV series and their own characters and voices, so we'd want Stuart Little or Pikachu or Big Bird to respond in their own voices,\" says Lee. </p> <p>The first toys will hold about 60 minutes of voice output. This will increase as flash memory chips get bigger and cheaper. </p> <p>HI is using speech recognition technology from a Belgian company, Lernout &amp; Hauspie, and was set up in December when it signed an exclusive license to use L&amp;H's technology in toys. It hasn't produced anything yet, but it is developing a speech recognition and voice output system. </p> <p>This will be implemented using a digital signal processing (DSP) chip, will fit on a 6cm x 4cm circuit board, and should be ready in June. Later the system will be shrunk to a quarter of the size by using a custom Asic (application specific integrated circuit) chip. </p> <p>Early next year, HI plans to have prototypes using L&amp;H's ASR1800 software to recognise 500 phrases. This version will also support Wap, (wireless application protocol) to access a cutdown version of the web. Smart toys would then be able to work with the internet. </p> <p>\"In principle, you could talk to the toy and the toy could retrieve data wirelessly from the internet and tell it to you,\" says Lee. \"That way you're not dependent on what's in the memory. A child could ask the toy 'Who's the president of the United States?', the toy could find out using real-time internet access and say 'Bill Clinton, didn't you know that?' The toy can help educate them.\" </p> <p>The first systems will use English. HI will also offer French, German, Japanese and Korean. Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin), Spanish and Portuguese will follow. </p> <p>The speech circuitry is still too big for many toys, but Lee proposes putting it in accessories. \"If we can't put it in a Barbie doll we can certainly put it in Barbie's Corvette or Ken's horse, or GI Joe's back-pack or whatever.\" </p> <p>HI's modules will be relatively expensive - around $20-$40, depending on volume - but Lee isn't worried about that. Smart toys could sell for five times as much as dumb ones, so the character owners, toy manufacturers and retailers will all benefit. \"They have nothing to lose by promoting us: we're giving them the opportunity to make more money,\" says Lee. </p> <p>But it may be bad news for parents.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain has a very healthy computer games sector: as Jack Schofield recently pointed out, exports of leisure software exceed those of television programmes or films. Now there may be a number of different reasons why Britain has more game development studios than the rest of Europe put together, but the best one that I've heard is that it's down to the legacy of the Sinclair Spectrum. </p> <p>In the early 1980s, American teenagers were taking delivery of Apples and IBM PCs, stuffed full of memory, with colour monitors and full-sized keyboards attached. I can well remember the excitement of buying a hard disk drive for my Apple IIe in California back in the mid-1980s. </p> <p>Meanwhile, their counterparts on this side of the Atlantic were just getting their hands on the Sinclair spectrum. It had a keyboard that you could hardly type on, cassette tapes for storage, a limited display (it was your TV) and a little memory. Not the best possible environment for games development, you might think. </p> <p>The machine, however, tapped into an incredible dynamic. By giving hundreds of thousands of inquisitive teenagers a machine that they could finally program themselves, no matter how difficult and how frustrating that programming was, the Spectrum unleashed a wave of creativity. </p> <p>The limited computing environment meant that creativity and ingenuity were channelled into the games themselves and not solely into the presentation. The result was an entire generation skilled at executing novel and creative concepts in resource constrained environments. The beginning of a whole new creative industry was a device with a keyboard that it's difficult to type on, little memory, limited processing power and a display you wouldn't want to look at for any length of time: sounds like a Wap phone to me. </p> <p>To read the press recently, you'd think that Wap (the wireless application protocol) was a cure for cancer. It's going to transform our lives in incredible ways: we'll be able read the CNN news headlines while waiting for a train at Waterloo, for example. </p> <p>Wap is certainly an important technology. Gartner Group predicts that 95% of all phones sold in 2004 will be Wap-enabled. Forrester forecasts that at the end of 2003, when European mobile phone penetration will be around 59% overall, internet-enabled mobile phones (which may or may not be Wap phones) will have a 45% penetration. Yet the current Wap frenzy suggests that some organisations are allowing their marketing departments to float free from their technological moorings. </p> <p> As I heard someone comment a short while ago, marketing departments are crazy about Wap because they don't understand it. It's the first step on the road to a mobile future: it doesn't pretend to be the \"internet on your mobile phone\". The technology platform of both the handsets and the networks isn't really capable of supporting the functionality required to meet that goal. </p> <p>Even though (in time) the arrival of high bandwidth networks (eg, GPRS) will alleviate some of the problems, the form factor (and use of) handsets makes the idea of web browsing walking down the street with a Wap phone pretty unattractive. </p> <p>It might be heretical to say so, but Wap has its limitations. Yet it must be a key element of organisational strategies towards mobile communications, not because it is the end game but because it provides an immediate entry to the world of mobile partnerships, business models, regulation and so on. </p> <p>The real significance of Wap, however, may be that it will tap into the same dynamic as the Spectrum. Given that just one of the UK mobile operators (BT Cellnet) is planning to put some half a million handsets into the market over the summer, the user pool is set to grow quickly. We will soon be in a situation where a large number of innovative people (with time their hands), who think differently and bring a new approach, will move into an environment that had previously been closed to them. </p> <p>It may not be as open as the computer games environment was, but there are clear opportunities. </p> <p>If the Spectrum analogy has anything to it, it means that a new value chain will rapidly come into existence. Wap development studios will be springing up all over the place and vying for the attention of a small number of major \"publishers\" that dominate the delivery channels (ie, the mobile operators and major Wap portals such as, perhaps, banks). </p> <p>Who knows? Perhaps a decade from now Britain will have a third of the world market for software development for mobile services and there will be a couple of hundred mobile software development shops up and down the country. They will be staffed by people who can still remember the day when they got their first pre-paid Wap phone, connected to some boring news feed site, then hung up and thought to themselves: \"I can do better than that.\"</p>",

Forrester forecasts that at the end of 2003, when European mobile phone penetration will be around 59% overall, internet-enabled mobile phones (which may or may not be Wap phones) will have a 45% penetration. Yet the current Wap frenzy suggests that some organisations are allowing their marketing departments to float free from their technological moorings. As I heard someone comment a short while ago, marketing departments are crazy about Wap because they don't understand it. It's the first step on the road to a mobile future: it doesn't pretend to be the \"internet on your mobile phone\". The technology platform of both the handsets and the networks isn't really capable of supporting the functionality required to meet that goal. Even though (in time) the arrival of high bandwidth networks (eg, GPRS) will alleviate some of the problems, the form factor (and use of) handsets makes the idea of web browsing walking down the street with a Wap phone pretty unattractive. It might be heretical to say so, but Wap has its limitations. Yet it must be a key element of organisational strategies towards mobile communications, not because it is the end game but because it provides an immediate entry to the world of mobile partnerships, business models, regulation and so on. The real significance of Wap, however, may be that it will tap into the same dynamic as the Spectrum. Given that just one of the UK mobile operators (BT Cellnet) is planning to put some half a million handsets into the market over the summer, the user pool is set to grow quickly. We will soon be in a situation where a large number of innovative people (with time their hands), who think differently and bring a new approach, will move into an environment that had previously been closed to them. It may not be as open as the computer games environment was, but there are clear opportunities. If the Spectrum analogy has anything to it, it means that a new value chain will rapidly come into existence. Wap development studios will be springing up all over the place and vying for the attention of a small number of major \"publishers\" that dominate the delivery channels (ie, the mobile operators and major Wap portals such as, perhaps, banks). Who knows? Perhaps a decade from now Britain will have a third of the world market for software development for mobile services and there will be a couple of hundred mobile software development shops up and down the country. They will be staffed by people who can still remember the day when they got their first pre-paid Wap phone, connected to some boring news feed site, then hung up and thought to themselves: \"I can do better than that.\"",

He was always on the lookout for intelligent, socially aware employers to handle a difficult situation with tact and common sense.

He remained chairman until 1970. During the war years, when the Bedford company was wholly absorbed in naval and aircraft work, Kenneth Allen's drive and caring attitude won him enormous respect from the firm's 1,200 workforce.

      "bodyText": "The governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, claimed yesterday that illegal immigrants had turned part of Japan's capital into a crime-ridden foreign country that even yakuza gangsters were afraid to enter. The comments are likely to add fresh fuel to a blazing row over racism, which has long been seen in Japan as a problem suffered only by other, less homogeneous countries. \"Crimes by illegal immigrants are rising rapidly,\" said the governor, who is famed for his outspoken nationalist views. \"Japanese people can no longer walk the streets of the Ikebukuro and Shinjuku districts at night. Those places are like other countries. Even the yakuza don't dare to go in.\" Mr Ishihara was defending a controversial speech he made last weekend when he warned Japanese troops to prepare for an uprising by foreigners in the aftermath of a major earthquake. For the hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Korean residents, the speech was a frightening throwback to the attitudes of a bloody past. In the wake of Tokyo's last big earthquake in 1923, Japanese troops and police massacred 6,000 Koreans after an unfounded rumour that they were poisoning well water. Yesterday, the governor expressed pity for those victims and said he would protect all of the city's residents in a future calamity. \"I would never give an order to kill foreigners,\" he told the Guardian. But he insisted that illegal immigrants and racial minorities were the main source of danger. \"After the Los Angeles quake, it was ethnic minorities, including blacks and Hispanics, who went looting. The same thing would happen here,\" he said. \"Although some Japanese might take part in riots, the strongest fear is about areas with high levels of illegal immigrants.\" The governor's remarks have sparked a furious backlash by China, North Korea and foreigners' groups inside Japan. \"It is a criminal statement that incites xenophobia and discrimination against all foreign residents,\" said a spokesman for one group of migrant workers. The group joined a gathering of celebrities and protesters outside the metropolitan government building to demand the resignation of Mr Ishihara. Government ministers from the conservative Liberal Democratic party (LDP) were more circumspect in their criticism. The new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, said only that the governor's expression was \"inappropriate\". This caution may reflect a feeling in the LDP that the views of Mr Ishihara - a populist who has risen to power by tapping public frustration at Japan's prolonged economic stagnation - are widely held. More than a hundred people have already telephoned the Tokyo government to express their support for the governor. Fewer than 1.5% of Japan's 126m citizens are not indigenous, but this is expected to change dramatically in the years ahead. According to a recent UN study, Japan will need 600,000 immigrant workers by 2050 to make up for low fertility rates and the world's fastest ageing population. The need for more gaijin (literally, outside people) is disconcerting to many Japanese, who fear a rising wave of crime that is commonly blamed on foreigners, especially illegal immigrants. Although the government has recognised the need for more foreign workers, debate has not even started on making the necessary social adjustments. There are no laws banning racism. Estate agents openly refuse to rent property to foreigners and several bath houses have banned gaijin . The problem is barely ever discussed, but inadvertently Mr Ishihara - who insists he is not a racist - has changed all that.",

While Bill Clinton urges the US senate to agree to \u00a31bn in mostly military aid for Colombia, Mr Pastrana is looking to Europe, Canada and Japan for another \u00a3600m towards social development projects in the remote southern regions which produce most of the world's cocaine. \"Plan Colombia\" has won enthusiastic support from US officials, but analysts say that other countries may be less willing to back a strategy which could end up fuelling an increasingly savage war. Mr Pastrana is to meet Tony Blair today - the day before United Nations' Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson releases a damning report on Colombia's human rights record. The annual report, obtained in advance by the Guardian, pins much of the blame for the current humanitarian crisis on the Pastrana government's failure to take effective action against human rights abusers. According to the UN, 402 massacres occurred in Colombia last year, the majority committed by the far-right paramilitaries. The report follows equally critical studies from the US state department and the New York-based Human Rights Watch, which accused the Colombian military of tolerating - and sometimes cooperating with - the militias. Colombian officials and their US supporters say that Plan Colombia will bring peace by rooting out the conditions which breed violence. As well as a counter-drugs strategy, the plan embraces a peace process with leftwing rebels, economic recovery, judicial and political reforms, human rights protection and social investment. But rebel leaders describe the plan as an excuse to step up counter-insurgency actions. \"Plan Colombia, as we understand it, is no more than a way for hawks in the United States to become more deeply involved in our internal affairs.

And, they say, few governments will be willing to climb aboard what is perceived as an American project to clean out its backyard. \"Nobody wants to be seen at the tag end of a US plan - particularly when some countries don't agree with the military element,\" said one diplomat. The US aid focuses on equipment and training for elite anti-drugs troops who will spearhead a campaign in southern Colombia, the source of over 70% of Colombia's cocaine and a traditional rebel stronghold. Human rights monitors say that even if coupled to social investment programmes, increased military aid will increase the violence and worsen the plight of Colombia's rural poor. Last year 288,000 people were driven from their homes by the war, and in private US officials say that as many as 150,00 more could be forced to flee by an anti-drugs offensive in the south.",

Police yesterday arrested the son of the leader of a nearby Sunni Muslim mosque, run by the militant Sipah-i-Sahabah organisation, which has been blamed for the deaths of scores of Shias. The killings in the village of Malowali, 90 miles northwest of Islamabad, on Tuesday night threaten to reignite sectarian tensions which have claimed hundreds of lives in Pakistan in the past 10 years. The gunmen cut the telephone lines leading to the remote village before bursting into the mosque, throwing hand grenades and spraying the congregation with bullets. A police officer was among the dead and more than 20 people were injured. Prayers were being held as part of the Shia holy month of Muharram, which marks the death of the grandson of the prophet Mohammed and culminates in a day of mourning and processions this weekend. As police searched the damaged mosque blankets soaked in blood still lay on the broken stone floor, where the victims had been kneeling in prayer. Last week a leading Shia, Waqar Hussain Naqvi, was shot dead in Karachi. His father, Sajid Naqvi, was born in Malowali village, the scene of yesterday's attack, and runs the Tehrik-e-Jaffria movement, which wants Shia Islamic law implemented in Pakistan, even though Shias make up only 20% of the population. Security had been tightened across Pakistan in advance of the Shia holy month,which has sparked religious tension in the past. \"People will feel insecure attending religious gathering until the killers are arrested,\" said Sayed Mazhar Gailani, a leader of Tehrik-e-Jaffria.

      "bodyText": "Indonesian boat people drown As many as 220 suspected illegal immigrants whose boat went missing on the way to Australia from Indonesia almost three weeks ago are presumed to have drowned, an Australian immigration official said yesterday. The immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, said the boat went missing after it left Java on either March 24 or 25 bound for Christmas Island, an Australian territory 220 miles south of Java, and probably experienced bad weather. Australia has been targeted by a growing tide of illegal immigrants in recent months. Reuters, Sydney Man tied to tree for two days Security forces yesterday freed a Norwegian businessman who had been kidnapped and spent two days tied to a tree in a forest outside Moscow, a police spokesman said. Two kidnappers dressed as police snatched the man in central Moscow on April 9, the spokesman said. The foreign ministry in Oslo identified him as 43-year-old Hassan Jadullahvad. Police arrested the kidnappers while delivering a $200,000 (\u00a3126,000) ransom yesterday. AP, Moscow",

      "body": "<p>During the massive demonstrations that prevented the opening ceremony of the World Trade Organisation's Seattle meeting last November, one of the protest's main organisers, Mike Dolan, spotted the veteran campaigner and Californian senator Tom Hayden on the streets.</p> <p>How does this compare, he asked Mr Hayden, with the big anti-Vietnam war demonstrations and the famous disruption of the Democrats' Chicago convention in 1968?</p> <p>\"The difference is,\" Mr Hayden told him, \"you're winning.\"</p> <p>With similar protests planned for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank summits in Washington this weekend and the Democratic and Republican conventions in Los Angeles and Philadelphia this summer, the signs are that the US left in its diverse forms is mobilising in ways that have not been seen since the early 70s. Some of them certainly believe they are winning, and that a \"big bang\" of activism is under way.</p> <p>Two \"shadow conventions\" are being planned for LA and Philadelphia to which activists and campaigners are being invited. They will deal with four main topics: poverty, the drugs war and its social effects, campaign financing and the environment. Already the authorities in Philadelphia are moving to prevent any hint of disruption of the convention by stopping organisers from booking halls.</p> <p>The moves come as students occupy 12 campuses throughout the country in protest at college investment in sweatshop labour, and as the lowest-paid US workers - the janitors who clean offices - take to the streets in strikes that are winning support across the political spectrum.</p> <p>Mr Dolan, 44, is the deputy director of Global Trade Watch, which was set up to campaign against unfettered free trade. He is a former field director of the California Democratic party who learned his organising skills with the United Farm Workers' Union and was generally accepted to have played the key role of coordinator in Seattle.</p> <p>He recounted his encounter with Mr Hayden at a small party last weekend in honour of him and Hillary McQuie, of the Direct Action Network, at the LA home of Arianna Huffington, formerly a conservative Republican but now a supporter of radical action, as espoused in her new book, Overthrow the Government.</p> <p>Mr Dolan, a famously witty speaker whose staff have likened him to a cross between Woody Allen and Lenin, believes that the success of Seattle has created a momentum for radical causes. \"There is a vacuum there,\" he said. \"We have to fill it.\"</p> <p>The test of how strong the disillusionment with conventional politics is will come at the weekend when thousands are due on the streets of Washington. They will be protesting at the effects of free trade on poorer countries and against the admission of China to the WTO, because of its human rights record and its treatment of Tibet. The slogan is \"fair trade, not free trade.\"</p> <p>But there is also a recognition that the two party conventions in the summer, which will effectively be coronations for Al Gore and George W Bush, present an opportunity to make use of the thousands of media people who will be present. Mr Dolan envisages a massive non-violent protest in Los Angeles that could close the convention.</p> <p>While many of the unions were involved in Seattle, there is uncertainty as to how they will want to play the Democrat convention. Mr Gore already has the endorsement of the AFl-CIO, and senior union officials are anxious that the protests should not benefit the Republicans at the expense of the Democrats. At the same time, the AFL-CIO has run television ads against China's admission to the WTO.</p> <p>Ms Huffington said at the weekend that John McCain, the unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate, and Antonio Villaraigosa, the Democratic speaker of the California assembly who is tipped to be LA's next mayor, had agreed to address the shadow conventions. Homeless people and relatives of those serving lengthy drug sentences are also due to speak.</p> <p>Marc Cooper, the co-host of last weekend's gathering, a radical journalist and former translator of the late Chilean president Salvador Allende, with whom he worked, described Seattle as \"the big bang of activism, spinning off hundreds of individual activists who returned home energised, cranked-up and ready to rumble some more.\"</p> <p>Mr Cooper believes the new movement is very different from previous ones. \"To the eyes of an old 60s veteran,\" he said, the organising meetings were \"almost painfully democratic and politely orderly.\"</p> <p>The political sea-change is reflected in the growing numbers of student bodies which are becoming politically involved. At the last election, only 22% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 voted, but the indications are that many of those are now seeking to take part in campaigns against the growing disparity between rich and poor, in the US and abroad.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of cynicism and hopelessness about when I was at school,\" said Mia Green-Dove, of Hampshire college, one of the thousands of students heading for Washington this weekend.

      "bodyText": "During the massive demonstrations that prevented the opening ceremony of the World Trade Organisation's Seattle meeting last November, one of the protest's main organisers, Mike Dolan, spotted the veteran campaigner and Californian senator Tom Hayden on the streets. How does this compare, he asked Mr Hayden, with the big anti-Vietnam war demonstrations and the famous disruption of the Democrats' Chicago convention in 1968? \"The difference is,\" Mr Hayden told him, \"you're winning.\" With similar protests planned for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank summits in Washington this weekend and the Democratic and Republican conventions in Los Angeles and Philadelphia this summer, the signs are that the US left in its diverse forms is mobilising in ways that have not been seen since the early 70s. Some of them certainly believe they are winning, and that a \"big bang\" of activism is under way. Two \"shadow conventions\" are being planned for LA and Philadelphia to which activists and campaigners are being invited. They will deal with four main topics: poverty, the drugs war and its social effects, campaign financing and the environment. Already the authorities in Philadelphia are moving to prevent any hint of disruption of the convention by stopping organisers from booking halls. The moves come as students occupy 12 campuses throughout the country in protest at college investment in sweatshop labour, and as the lowest-paid US workers - the janitors who clean offices - take to the streets in strikes that are winning support across the political spectrum. Mr Dolan, 44, is the deputy director of Global Trade Watch, which was set up to campaign against unfettered free trade. He is a former field director of the California Democratic party who learned his organising skills with the United Farm Workers' Union and was generally accepted to have played the key role of coordinator in Seattle. He recounted his encounter with Mr Hayden at a small party last weekend in honour of him and Hillary McQuie, of the Direct Action Network, at the LA home of Arianna Huffington, formerly a conservative Republican but now a supporter of radical action, as espoused in her new book, Overthrow the Government. Mr Dolan, a famously witty speaker whose staff have likened him to a cross between Woody Allen and Lenin, believes that the success of Seattle has created a momentum for radical causes. \"There is a vacuum there,\" he said. \"We have to fill it.\" The test of how strong the disillusionment with conventional politics is will come at the weekend when thousands are due on the streets of Washington. They will be protesting at the effects of free trade on poorer countries and against the admission of China to the WTO, because of its human rights record and its treatment of Tibet. The slogan is \"fair trade, not free trade.\" But there is also a recognition that the two party conventions in the summer, which will effectively be coronations for Al Gore and George W Bush, present an opportunity to make use of the thousands of media people who will be present. Mr Dolan envisages a massive non-violent protest in Los Angeles that could close the convention. While many of the unions were involved in Seattle, there is uncertainty as to how they will want to play the Democrat convention. Mr Gore already has the endorsement of the AFl-CIO, and senior union officials are anxious that the protests should not benefit the Republicans at the expense of the Democrats. At the same time, the AFL-CIO has run television ads against China's admission to the WTO. Ms Huffington said at the weekend that John McCain, the unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate, and Antonio Villaraigosa, the Democratic speaker of the California assembly who is tipped to be LA's next mayor, had agreed to address the shadow conventions. Homeless people and relatives of those serving lengthy drug sentences are also due to speak. Marc Cooper, the co-host of last weekend's gathering, a radical journalist and former translator of the late Chilean president Salvador Allende, with whom he worked, described Seattle as \"the big bang of activism, spinning off hundreds of individual activists who returned home energised, cranked-up and ready to rumble some more.\" Mr Cooper believes the new movement is very different from previous ones. \"To the eyes of an old 60s veteran,\" he said, the organising meetings were \"almost painfully democratic and politely orderly.\" The political sea-change is reflected in the growing numbers of student bodies which are becoming politically involved. At the last election, only 22% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 voted, but the indications are that many of those are now seeking to take part in campaigns against the growing disparity between rich and poor, in the US and abroad. \"There was a lot of cynicism and hopelessness about when I was at school,\" said Mia Green-Dove, of Hampshire college, one of the thousands of students heading for Washington this weekend. Last year, she was among nearly 10,000 who demonstrated at the School of the Americas in Georgia against its training for soldiers who later committed atrocities in central America. \"There used to be a feeling of, 'Oh, there's nothing we can do about it',\" she said. \"Now there is a real feeling that we can help to change things.\" Useful links Corporate Watch protest page Environment News Service Peacenet protest page Independent Media Center protest page",

      "body": "<p>A year ago, on Saturday April 4 1999 - Easter weekend - I was woken by my flatmate at 2.30am. \"Clare's on the phone,\" he said. In my semi-asleep state I was completely confused. I had had a punishing week at work in my job as a trainee solicitor. I imagined Clare to be a custody sergeant calling from a police station for a suspect who needed representation.</p> <p>But this Clare was my father's partner and my very close friend: \"Matt, are you awake?\" she said. \"It's Paul. He's had a heart attack. He's gone to hospital. It's very serious. Can you come round? I'm really scared.\"</p> <p>In shock, I dressed and made the five-minute drive to Clare's and my father's house in Stamford Hill. My five-year-old sister Kate was asleep in bed, so we decided that I should go to the hospital to be with Paul and keep contact with Clare on the office mobile.</p> <p>I was not really able to cope with the frightening concept of arriving to find my father dead. Driving to the hospital, I was only able to concentrate by blasting out a tape of my flatmate's band, shouting the words. I was shown into the resuscitation unit in the emergency ward. Dad was awake. \"Hi Matt,\" he said, raising his arm. \"You shouldn't have come.\"</p> <p>It was clear that something was seriously wrong. One of the two doctors standing nearby told me they had given Paul a drug to thin his blood because they thought a clot had caused a heart attack. Now they were not sure. Paul was in serious pain and was getting weaker by the minute. I tried to reassure him, but he seemed to be dying.</p> <p>I called Clare and we decided that she should come to the hospital, then I drove to her and my father's home and waited for my sister to wake up. At seven o'clock she came downstairs and asked: \"Where's mum?\" I explained that Dad was not well and had been taken to hospital. She lay with me on the sofa and dozed off to sleep. As I lay there I felt absolutely shattered for this little girl who could lose her father at such a young age.</p> <p>Clare phoned later that morning: an X-ray had shown that Paul had not suffered a heart attack, but that his aorta was leaking and could burst at any moment. If the aorta ruptured he would die instantly. Paul's only chance was emergency surgery, but we should all prepare ourselves for the worst. He would probably not survive the journey from the Homerton in Hackney to the London Chest Hospital in Bethnal Green, and in any case the blood-thinning drug would make an already risky operation even more dangerous.</p> <p>I rang my brothers, Tom and John. Tom, only 19, arranged to come and pick me up. My other brother lives in Milan. I woke him up and he booked a flight straight away.</p> <p>We all made our way to the London Chest Hospital and met Clare in the family waiting room. They had begun operating at 10am. The longer it went on the better, we were told. Five hours later, Mr Wright, the surgeon, appeared. Paul had survived an extraordinary operation, he said. His aorta had ruptured as they opened him up, yet they had managed to complete the procedure. It was obvious that they couldn't believe he had made it.</p> <p>Mr Wright explained the remaining hurdles and warned that the next 72 hours were critical. First, Paul had to stop bleeding. Mr Wright thought this might take an hour. Second, when - if - Paul regained consciousness, his heart rate and blood pressure would soar and could tear apart the graft to his aorta. Third, they did not know how much damage his brain had sustained from being deprived of oxygen. If all went well, he could live for another 10 years.</p> <p>After a few hours we went in to see him. It was a shocking sight. He was asleep, with tubes coming out of everywhere, including a horrible thick one from his neck. There were at least three machines attached to him.</p> <p>It took a torturous 15 hours for the bleeding to stop. The hospital staff thought they would need to operate again, but said that Paul probably would not make it through another bout of surgery. Eventually, after a second sleepless night for us all, it did stop.</p> <p>The unexpected crises were somehow harder to cope with. First, Paul's kidneys failed. Then he got pneumonia. His legs and left arm appeared to be paralysed. He kept getting fevers, and he still had not regained consciousness.</p> <p>All the time, the nurses would tweak and tune the various valves attached to the tubes coming out of different parts of Paul's body. The nurses also kept us going. Immediately after the operation, there was a period when Clare could not face seeing Paul. Carl, a nurse who spent days looking after Paul, came out of the hospital and led Clare by the hand from the lawn and into Paul's room.</p> <p>The lowest point came some two weeks after the operation. We were summoned by the head of the intensive care unit, who told us they believed that Paul was brain damaged and was probably in a persistent vegetative state. My brother John, who until then had been the optimist, the person who kept us going, broke down. We gave up. We wanted to pull the wires out of his body.</p> <p>Each member of the family coped with this period in a different way. We had been joined in our appalling wait by Paul's sister Sarah, brother-in-law Tim and brother Oliver. My brothers socialised. I drew upon ex-girl friends - we hoped Paul would get better before I ran out of them. We developed a rather sick humour. Meanwhile, bundles of cards were arriving from the strangest assortment of people - women peace campaigners, Tory MPs, trade unionists (including a huge card from the Fire Brigades Union conference delegates), the entire Daily Express City office, socialists, even a government minister.</p> <p>We spent a lot of time in the waiting room with other families going through similar crises. At times of severe illness, religion appears to take great hold. We had to fight to stop people praying next to Paul's bed - it seemed to make no difference when we told them that he was a committed atheist and that the shock and anger he would feel if he did suddenly wake up to find someone praying over him would probably finish him off.</p> <p>It took Paul five weeks to regain consciousness, to blink for the first time on request.</p> <p>No one could tell us how much he would recover. We were sent off to the London Hospital to see Mr Swash, who was to give us the results of various scans. The only doubt seemed to be whether he was paralysed from the chest down or from the waist. We were not surprised or distressed by this news. It was Paul we wanted back, not his legs.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, he was put in a general ward at the Homerton. For three weeks we waited for an assessment by Dr Greenwood, the neurologist who heads the hospital's rehabilitation unit. Paul drifted in and out of reality. Strange, rambling descriptions of where he had spent the day flowed out of him. Mostly they were parts of the world he had never visited.</p> <p>One day we wheeled him over to the rehab unit for an assessment, and he suddenly seemed to rejoin us. He knew who we were.</p> <p>During the tests, Paul showed a phenomenal ability to remember telephone numbers, but he had no idea when he was born or where he was. Then came the physical tests. We were dreading the moment when he would realise his legs could not move. Then Dr Greenwood asked him to wiggle his toes and, to our utter amazement, his right toe moved a millimetre.</p> <p>Slowly, Paul started to speak and eat and drink. One day, a speech therapist asked him if he could say a couple of sentences and Paul recited the whole of the prologue to Henry V. We were treated to hours of in-depth discussion of his bowel movements.</p> <p>In July, Paul was moved into the rehab unit and began the slow process of recovery. Freedom came on October 1, when he went home. A few weeks later I took him with his great-uncle Michael to Devon for the funeral of his uncle John. By long tradition we stopped off at a second-hand bookshop at Ashburton. The trip from the car to the bookshop took an inordinate time as the two men competed in a Monty Python ministry of funny walks contest. I think it resulted in a draw.</p> <p>It is difficult having a well-known dad who is ill. Everyone wants to talk about it and often you do not. Everyone shares their opinion, which often does not match your own. Even now there are times when it drives me mad to hear how \"great\" his recovery has been. Sometimes I just want my old dad back.</p> <p>That said, it is a miracle how far Paul has come, and there are two reasons for it.</p> <p>Firstly, there is the NHS. The expertise and care shown in the ICU at the London Chest Hospital and the rehabilitation unit at the Homerton were second to none. The commitment of the underpaid, overworked staff is incredible and is abused by this government. We will never forget Carl, Joy, Karen, Collette, Mary, Jim and all the other nurses in Homerton's Howard ward.</p> <p>Secondly, there is my father. His public school and army background makes him determined to beat the odds. He continually berates his legs for not working properly, but the anger he feels is coupled with a feeling of optimism. He has a lot to live for: Clare; his hopeless ambition to play golf again; his half-completed book; his columns for the Guardian and Private Eye; his socialism - he is standing as a candidate for the London Socialist Alliance for the Greater London Assembly; and for our sister, Kate, who we hope will have many more years of fun with her dad.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Osama El Khouli's shop in south-west Cairo is almost deserted. Its sole customer is not shopping but talking into a telephone. A little girl pops in to buy some ice cream; two men buy cigarettes. \"This is the beginning of the end for small supermarkets like us,\" says Khouli from behind the till. \"They are experts in management and in marketing, which are new policies for the Egyptian market. We don't have their expertise or studies. It's very difficult to compete.\"</p> <p>Khouli's problem lies 10 minutes' walk away down the Pyramids Road. Sainsbury's opened its first Egyptian branch there a year ago, the first step in an aggressive expansion programme into the Middle East. There are seven Sainsbury's stores in Egypt now, and the company has an 80% holding in a local chain, Edge, whose 100 stores across the country may also eventually be turned into Sainsbury's supermarkets. Its investment in Egypt is estimated to total \u00a392m so far, with another \u00a3325m on the way.</p> <p>It is the success of the company's Egyptian experiment that has led to what is now known as the Sainsbury's fatwa: a religious edict from the imams in the Pyramids Road mosques that has equated shopping at the supermarket with adultery, stealing and drug trafficking.</p> <p>In fact, the edict is not strictly a fatwa. The declaration of a fatwa in Egypt is the privilege of the country's spiritual guide, or mufti, and not for local imams. Even so, it gives an indication of the depth of the antipathy to Sainsbury's.</p> <p>\"I argued with some of these roaming preachers about their firm belief that Sainsbury's is nothing but the devil's son,\" says M Ali Ibrahim, the editor of the Egyptian Mail. \"Most of them bit my head off, claiming that their campaign against the British-owned stores is part of their holy jihad against infidels.\"</p> <p>According to Ibrahim, beleaguered shopkeepers who ran businesses near the Sainsbury's branch on the Pyramids Road asked local preachers to help them. The imams obliged. Worshippers were told that if they bought from the store they would \"suffer on the day of judgment\".</p> <p>One preacher told Ibrahim: \"Those unbelievers plan to send hundreds of our Muslim retailers to bankruptcy. They aim to force retailers to lay off their employees and close their stores.\"</p> <p>Sainsbury's, meanwhile, claims that the \"freelance fatwa\" has not hurt its booming Egyptian business. \"We've heard of the fatwa through the press,\" says the supermarket chain's spokesperson, Gillian Bridger. \"We've not received anything - no death threats, nothing directly to us about this. The stores are trading well and have exceeded our expectations. The fatwa has had no adverse reaction on shopping. We're extremely popular with shoppers. They call us the consumer champion.\"</p> <p>The Sainsbury's in Pyramids Road is full of the old familiars - the orange and white logo, Red Label tea and trolleys with toddler seats.

      "bodyText": "Osama El Khouli's shop in south-west Cairo is almost deserted. Its sole customer is not shopping but talking into a telephone. A little girl pops in to buy some ice cream; two men buy cigarettes. \"This is the beginning of the end for small supermarkets like us,\" says Khouli from behind the till. \"They are experts in management and in marketing, which are new policies for the Egyptian market. We don't have their expertise or studies. It's very difficult to compete.\" Khouli's problem lies 10 minutes' walk away down the Pyramids Road. Sainsbury's opened its first Egyptian branch there a year ago, the first step in an aggressive expansion programme into the Middle East. There are seven Sainsbury's stores in Egypt now, and the company has an 80% holding in a local chain, Edge, whose 100 stores across the country may also eventually be turned into Sainsbury's supermarkets. Its investment in Egypt is estimated to total \u00a392m so far, with another \u00a3325m on the way. It is the success of the company's Egyptian experiment that has led to what is now known as the Sainsbury's fatwa: a religious edict from the imams in the Pyramids Road mosques that has equated shopping at the supermarket with adultery, stealing and drug trafficking. In fact, the edict is not strictly a fatwa. The declaration of a fatwa in Egypt is the privilege of the country's spiritual guide, or mufti, and not for local imams. Even so, it gives an indication of the depth of the antipathy to Sainsbury's. \"I argued with some of these roaming preachers about their firm belief that Sainsbury's is nothing but the devil's son,\" says M Ali Ibrahim, the editor of the Egyptian Mail. \"Most of them bit my head off, claiming that their campaign against the British-owned stores is part of their holy jihad against infidels.\" According to Ibrahim, beleaguered shopkeepers who ran businesses near the Sainsbury's branch on the Pyramids Road asked local preachers to help them. The imams obliged. Worshippers were told that if they bought from the store they would \"suffer on the day of judgment\". One preacher told Ibrahim: \"Those unbelievers plan to send hundreds of our Muslim retailers to bankruptcy. They aim to force retailers to lay off their employees and close their stores.\" Sainsbury's, meanwhile, claims that the \"freelance fatwa\" has not hurt its booming Egyptian business. \"We've heard of the fatwa through the press,\" says the supermarket chain's spokesperson, Gillian Bridger. \"We've not received anything - no death threats, nothing directly to us about this. The stores are trading well and have exceeded our expectations. The fatwa has had no adverse reaction on shopping. We're extremely popular with shoppers. They call us the consumer champion.\" The Sainsbury's in Pyramids Road is full of the old familiars - the orange and white logo, Red Label tea and trolleys with toddler seats. Dozens of Sainsbury's employees in their bright orange shirts stand behind tills, packing and carrying goods for customers. Huge posters announce special offers; leaflets are spread around the store explaining Sainsbury's policies and history.

Member states aim to ensure that all cash transactions can be made in euros within a fortnight of January 1, 2002, and ideally want dual circulation of national currencies and euro notes and coins to last between four weeks and two months.",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown yesterday delivered a robust defence of the world's financial system against attacks from anti-globalisation protesters amassing in Washington for a Seattle-style rally. The chancellor suggested they are misguided enemies of the poor. In an interview with the Guardian on the eve of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, the chancellor said the two institutions, which some protesters want dismantled, were an essential part of the battle against global poverty. \"I think people should recognise that the way forward is to make the international institutions work better rather than launch a campaign simply against their existence,\" Mr Brown said. The chancellor, who chairs the IMF's policy-making committee, said the 54-year-old institution had a crucial role to play in policing the global financial system, ensuring instability did not disrupt growth in developing countries - an essential element of poverty reduction. The challenge was to create a \"virtuous circle\" of debt relief for the poorest countries, poverty reduction and economic growth. With all G7 countries now in favour of 100% relief on their bilateral debts from the world's poorest countries, Mr Brown said one of the main issues of the spring meetings was how to maintain the momentum of the highly indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC). His recent proposal for a joint IMF/World Bank committee to drive HIPC forward had now been agreed and 10 countries would soon receive debt relief. Revealing that the treasury has \"quietly\" given the IMF an extra $43m in recent weeks, he said the funding needed for relieving the debt owed to multilateral institutions was falling into place.

      "body": "<p>As dean of Liverpool at a crucial period in the city's history, Derrick Walters, who has died aged 68, had the vision to see how the great Anglican cathedral and the position of its dean could be deployed for the good of the whole community. </p> <p>Born in Swansea, the son of a shop steward - from whom he derived his concern for social justice - Walters was educated at Gowerton boys' grammar school and the London School of Economics. After briefly considering a stage career, in 1957 he entered ordination training at Ripon Hall, Oxford. Then came a curacy in Swansea, and in 1962 Walters migrated to England, where two incumbencies in industrial areas were followed by his appointment in 1974 as diocesan missioner in the Salisbury diocese. The rural composition of Wiltshire and Dorset contrasted with the settings in which he had hitherto worked, but for nine years he threw himself into the promotion of the Church's mission in country parishes. His sharp mind and incisive insights were welcomed at the meetings of the bishop's staff; and he developed a penchant for information technology. </p> <p>In 1983, he was summoned to Liverpool, to succeed Edward Patey as dean. A lesser spirit might well have been daunted both by the vastness of Giles Gilbert Scott's cathedral and by the condition of Liverpool at the time. But Walters, supported by his superb wife Joan, whose radical convictions matched his own, had a clear vision of what could be brought about both within the cathedral and beyond its walls. He blew into the cathedral like a rushing, mighty wind. He enhanced the worship and the music and developed its facilities, giving it a refectory and a shop and making it attractive as a conference venue. He was concerned deeply with its spiritual dimension. He did not pursue his wider projects to the detriment of his primary responsibility. </p> <p>But Walters could not be confined by the cathedral walls. His theology was based on the kingdom of God, and that drove his commitment to the city of Liverpool as a whole and the conditions of its citizens' lives. He was fortunate to have in David Sheppard a bishop who shared his priorities. When Walters came to the cathedral, there was an expanse of derelict land adjacent to it. He saw his chance and embarked upon what were to become major schemes of development.

      "bodyText": "As dean of Liverpool at a crucial period in the city's history, Derrick Walters, who has died aged 68, had the vision to see how the great Anglican cathedral and the position of its dean could be deployed for the good of the whole community. Born in Swansea, the son of a shop steward - from whom he derived his concern for social justice - Walters was educated at Gowerton boys' grammar school and the London School of Economics. After briefly considering a stage career, in 1957 he entered ordination training at Ripon Hall, Oxford. Then came a curacy in Swansea, and in 1962 Walters migrated to England, where two incumbencies in industrial areas were followed by his appointment in 1974 as diocesan missioner in the Salisbury diocese. The rural composition of Wiltshire and Dorset contrasted with the settings in which he had hitherto worked, but for nine years he threw himself into the promotion of the Church's mission in country parishes. His sharp mind and incisive insights were welcomed at the meetings of the bishop's staff; and he developed a penchant for information technology. In 1983, he was summoned to Liverpool, to succeed Edward Patey as dean. A lesser spirit might well have been daunted both by the vastness of Giles Gilbert Scott's cathedral and by the condition of Liverpool at the time. But Walters, supported by his superb wife Joan, whose radical convictions matched his own, had a clear vision of what could be brought about both within the cathedral and beyond its walls. He blew into the cathedral like a rushing, mighty wind. He enhanced the worship and the music and developed its facilities, giving it a refectory and a shop and making it attractive as a conference venue. He was concerned deeply with its spiritual dimension. He did not pursue his wider projects to the detriment of his primary responsibility. But Walters could not be confined by the cathedral walls. His theology was based on the kingdom of God, and that drove his commitment to the city of Liverpool as a whole and the conditions of its citizens' lives. He was fortunate to have in David Sheppard a bishop who shared his priorities. When Walters came to the cathedral, there was an expanse of derelict land adjacent to it. He saw his chance and embarked upon what were to become major schemes of development. The waste land was transformed, with the building of Queen's Walk and the John Moores University media studies block, which was named the Dean Walters Building in his honour. There was also the creation of housing for students, for cathedral clergy and staff and, most important of all, public housing. This last was his contribution to the effort to reinstate inner-city living in Liverpool. It was calculated that Walters was associated with developments worth, in total, some \u00a3230m. By any standards, it was an enormous achievement. How did he do it? He saw that the prominence of the cathedral gave its dean some real power. He had great charm and great powers of persuasion, and so was able to draw others to follow his vision and to cooperate in a creative way for the common good. While some saw him as an ecclesiastical entrepreneur, those who worked closely with him soon became aware that his promotion of development sprang from deep theological convictions and that God was at the centre for him. Beyond any doubt, he left his mark upon many areas of the life of both cathedral and city, which was recognised by the award of an OBE in 1994. His final years were beset by a prolonged struggle against cancer. By a great exertion of will, and with the aid of two sticks, he managed to install James Jones as Bishop of Liverpool in 1999, his last act in the cathedral. His final days were marked by great serenity and by much gentleness and kindness to those around him. He will long be remembered and honoured in Liverpool and in the hearts of his many friends. He is survived by his wife and two sons. \u2022 Rhys Derrick Chamberlain Walters, priest, born 10 March 1932; died 5 April 2000 \u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2011, when the name and date details were added at the end.",

      "body": "<p>There's romantic squalor, the nostalgie de la boue kind of squalor: Soutine and Modigliani in their shitpile in Montmartre in the first world war, pawning their clothes for rotgut wine and ether and opium; Francis Bacon shuffling around among the rag-piles in his mews studio in south Kensington, living like a poor man with lots of money. There's picturesque squalor. Champagne and mousetraps. And then there's squalor that transcends the merely squalid. </p> <p>Brixton Breakers fitted into the last category. Oh, it was brutal. It was a breakers yard in London SW9 that did exactly what it said it did on the board by the gate: it broke things; bent and totally totalled them. Mostly these were cars connected to some insurance fiddle, stripped and crushed and cubed. They also did re-spray jobs on stolen cars (\"hot motors\"). And that wasn't the half of it. </p> <p>They dealt drugs in the Breakers at night, hooded figures in the dark; and some nights had all-night, yard-style parties. Booma-booma-booma. Gerry, the guy who ran it, was a biker, and other bikers from his gang or chapter or whatever would zoom over and hang out. Gerry's clothes were black with sump oil; they were slick and ebonised. His nails were black, and his eyelids and scalp. The artists speculated on whether the chairs in his house were also like that, and his cups, and his children. </p> <p>Gerry had a sidekick called Chico. Chico wore a greasy mac and bred puppies and was dubbed by the tabloids The Most Evil Man in Britain. He ran a puppy farm in Brixton Breakers, right in among the totalled Toyotas and hot motors. Feral dogs. Now and again, he'd throw them a bootful of raw chicken. Oh, man. Sometimes the feral dogs would escape from their compound and set about people - chase and bare their teeth at the artists. </p> <p>People using the alley down the right side of the yard were particularly susceptible. This was the way to the studios. It was a rat-run, pitted and cratered. The craters were full of oil and ooze. The rats came to feed on the heaps of crap dumped at the top of the alley by the fly-tippers. Heels of bread and stiletto shoes and burst mattresses. Rats the size of cats. It was bleak and cold and weird. With all this going for it, naturally it was going to attract some of the best artists and finest sensibilities of their generation. </p> <p>Damien Hirst made all his formaldehyde pieces at Minet Road: the cows, the lamb, the bulls' heads, the pig. He did the spots there and the giant spin paintings with the mad Minet Road titles: \"Beautiful, cheap, shitty, too easy, anyone can do one, big, motor-driven, roto-heaven, corrupt, trashy, bad art, shite, motivating, captivating, over the sofa, celebrating painting.\" Marcus Harvey made one of the most powerful and notorious paintings of the 90s there - his billboard-size portrait of Myra Hindley daubed in childrens' hands. </p> <p>And after the artists came the collectors, dragging their Lobb and Gucci through the mire, braving the verbals. \"Oy, where'd you get your driving licence, on a milk carton?\" It became a compulsory stop-over on the international collectors' circuit. People came with chauffeurs. David Bowie came to fling paint on a spin painting with Damien. You wouldn't leave your car to go round the corner for a coffee. There were muggings. A woman artist was mugged twice, both times in the morning. It was scary. </p> <p>Daniel Coombs spent six weeks clearing car parts out of a space behind Brixton Breakers with Richard Clegg, another former student from the painting school at the Royal College in London. Clegg had always been a bit iconoclastic. He'd been the singer with an anarcho-punk band called Monkey Island and had wrecked the floor of the gallery at the college with a degree show piece made from 2,500 bars of Sunshine soap and cataracts of sump-oil. So he fitted right in. </p> <p>Coombs, though, had stuck to conventional painting. In 1994, the year before he moved into Minet Road, he'd sold a group of surreal Bauhaus-meets-Butthead canvases to Charles Saatchi. In 1996, Coombs was in Young British Artists 6 at the Saatchi Gallery and then saw his work being shoehorned into the new art movement Saatchi tried to launch just last year: New Neurotic Realism. </p> <p>But the very particular circumstances at Minet Road soon got to him. It was a wart of land and a jumble of old clapped-out buildings in the middle of a modern council estate; the last remaining trace of a life that had once been lived there. He stopped making paintings and started making assemblages from the rubbish heaped outside the studio door instead. </p> <p>\"It felt like a quite alien environment, in a way,\" he says. \"I felt alien and isolated, and didn't quite know what was happening at first. I found it hard to use a brush and do sensitive paintings. But the strangeness of the place drew us together more. It made us all take quite a hard attitude to our work. It made us want to do something quite brutal. Everybody who produced beautiful work there was influenced by the surroundings. Marcus [Harvey] definitely. He was just starting the Myra piece when I moved in, and I remember being impressed by this giant canvas laid out on scaffolding. It was exciting to think of Damien Hirst making his stuff there. If somebody produces something really outstanding, it gives you an impetus to compete with them.\" </p> <p>In his book, The Conditions of Success, the former director of the Tate, Sir Alan Bowness, puts forward the view that most truly original new work is the result of group activity: \"I do not believe that any great art has been produced in a non-competitive situation: on the contrary it is the fiercely competitive environment in which the young artist finds himself that drives him to excel... Pollock, Rothko, Newman, Still and de Kooning were all linked together in friendship and rivalry. A post-expressionist generation of distinction - Johns, Lichtenstein, Rauschenberg, Warhol - was to follow them. Artists who emerge from such a situation do not have a consistency of style... but there is a consistency of purpose. They want to get to the top.\" </p> <p>Daniel Coombs, Richard Clegg and their contemporaries from the Royal College who followed them to Brixton - Ian Dawson, Martin Westwood, Chantal Joffe - were the second tribe to colonise Minet Road. The first settlers came from Goldsmith's College, and included Damien Hirst, Marcus Harvey and Hugh Allan. In fact, these three were the core of a tribe within a tribe: the Leeds lot. </p> <p> Hugh Allan, who now runs Damien Hirst's studio and is his business partner in Science, had grown up next door to Marcus Harvey in Leeds and they remained best friends. Hirst, who was a few years younger, had been a friend of Allan's brother. They all went to the Jacob Kramer college of art in Leeds, and then, at different times, to Goldsmith's in London. </p> <p>Harvey was the trailblazer, and once he was settled Damien came to check it out. \"I'd led the way in terms of a career - of going to college and becoming an artist. I showed Damien what to do, in terms of it being possible to do this. I think without me being there, he might not have chosen the same path. I really do think that. But he came down, tapped into the actual mechanics of the art world by getting a job in a gallery [dogs-bodying at D'Offay], and then just took off in the inside lane. When I had these very kind of religious ideas about how you proceed in the art world - you sweated and suffered, and if you were lucky, when you were old and wispy, you might sell a picture - he just did not do shit like that. He just got on with life, you know; making life comfortable. </p> <p>\"He's the most guilt-free man I ever, ever experienced. That's what the contrast between the two of us is. He just went for it. And he didn't have a plan before, or a model. Damien's his own model. Fearless. He found out that, if you are your own person, you've nothing to fear in life. Especially in this [art] world. Being, you know, a genius of a geezer, and such a great personality and sense of humour, sense of adventure in life and death and everything, he just knew, 'I can't go wrong. There are so many fucking tossers. Whingeing neurots. I'm like a rock in a stormy sea.' And then suddenly he blazed away. He ripped the air out of everyone's lungs.\" </p> <p>By the time he discovered Brixton Breakers and Minet Road in the early 90s, Hirst was already in the thick of the kind of celebrity that hadn't been seen in the British art world since the days of David Hockney. He needed somewhere rough and ready because he was about to extend the Natural History series of sculptures that had started with The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living - Saatchi's 14ft tiger shark. </p> <p>To all the other noxious odours at Brixton Breakers was added the stench of formaldehyde. In a scenario that recalled the heyday of la vie boh\u00e8me in Paris, when the stink of a side of beef that Chaim Soutine was painting had his neighbours running for cover, the people in the flats on the nearby Loughborough estate complained that formaldehyde fumes were seeping in their windows. Looking down from the balconies they could see figures in dry-suits and face masks pumping formaldehyde solution into bits of animal carcass using 24-inch syringes. </p> <p>Over time, the bleakness of the surroundings - the damp and coldness and lack of even basic amenities (black fungus would creep up over the surface of a picture very quickly), and the operatic scale of the squalor - seemed to encourage an unorthodox approach to methods and materials. It was as if the toxic nature of the landscape in which they were working gave them permission to do things a politer set-up would have withheld. </p> <p>Among the younger group of artists - the second wave - Richard Clegg started working with stainless steel sink units and then, in The Unknown Collaboratives, with a hard-setting polyurethane, while Daniel Coombs went on piling up his detritus. At the RCA, Ian Dawson had worked fairly conventionally with wood and metal. In Brixton, he built everyday household objects into heaps - dog bowls, bins, baby baths, picnic chairs - then took up an oxyacetylene burner to fondue the plastic into free-standing Jackson Pollocks. Saatchi took three. Even Martin Westwood, whose work has a marvellous Jasper Johns stillness to it, a steely cerebral quality, started mutilating his canvases and winding the painted strips into spheres, which were then mounted, fungus-like, on the wall. Only Chantal Joffe kept more or less obdurately to the path she had been travelling before she arrived at Minet Road. </p> <p>The only change was that, perhaps as a reaction to all the gigantism and physicality going on around her, her already small paintings of children and adult pornography got even smaller. \"They're quite a macho group of people,\" she says, \"and those studios were really open. They made each other more ambitious: 'Oh I did an all-nighter.' They were going for that kind of mythical bonding. Which they could laugh at as well. The music went with that. Loud and hard. You know: 'We're here because we're hard.' I like to work silently. But even I was aware of making work that would stand up in that space.\" </p> <p>At the beginning, they split into two camps: the Leeds lot and the Rest. \"It wasn't easy to move into the Amish,\" Hugh Allan says. The division was acted out in the arena of The Hero of Switzerland, the nearest pub: if you were Leeds, you turned left into the poolroom; if Royal College, you turned right into the lounge. But then, largely through Richard Clegg and Marcus Harvey, the demarcations disappeared. Hirst had already taken his dangerously anarchic sense of mischief to the West End by then, and was cavorting with a new group of friends at the Groucho Club. </p> <p>By chance, Ian Dawson was taken on as a construction worker at Pharmacy, Hirst's restaurant project in Notting Hill. He'd put in an eight-hour shift, then do a few hours down at Brixton Breakers. It was sheer economics, he says, that drove people there. \"It was the cheapest studio space in town, by a mile. But there was a grimness to it. I'm fucking glad that place is over. We were all just waiting to get out of there at the end.\" </p> <p>The end, when it came last summer, came quickly. A fire spread through the breakers yard, and a week later, Gerry, the gaffer, was found dead in the alley among the rubble. The forklift he had been using to shift the burned-out cars had flipped over and crushed him. As a spectacle in a place that had seen the production of so much (museum quality) art whose theme was catastrophilia, it must have seemed grotesquely appropriate (catastrophilia: the longing for something terrible, for something that is terribly high, sad, or far, terribly mean, dangerous or lovely, as long as it's terrible). </p> <p>\"It was all very odd and very tragic,\" Dan Coombs says. \"It was just like the last... it was like the finally horrific thing that could have happened.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Daniel Coombs is showing new work at the Zwemmer Gallery, Litchfield St, London, until May 13. Richard Clegg's The Unknown Collaboratives will be the inaugural show at the Henry Peacock Gallery, Foley Street, from May 13. Martin Westwood is with the Approach Gallery.</p>",

His nails were black, and his eyelids and scalp. The artists speculated on whether the chairs in his house were also like that, and his cups, and his children. Gerry had a sidekick called Chico. Chico wore a greasy mac and bred puppies and was dubbed by the tabloids The Most Evil Man in Britain. He ran a puppy farm in Brixton Breakers, right in among the totalled Toyotas and hot motors. Feral dogs. Now and again, he'd throw them a bootful of raw chicken. Oh, man. Sometimes the feral dogs would escape from their compound and set about people - chase and bare their teeth at the artists. People using the alley down the right side of the yard were particularly susceptible. This was the way to the studios. It was a rat-run, pitted and cratered. The craters were full of oil and ooze. The rats came to feed on the heaps of crap dumped at the top of the alley by the fly-tippers. Heels of bread and stiletto shoes and burst mattresses. Rats the size of cats. It was bleak and cold and weird. With all this going for it, naturally it was going to attract some of the best artists and finest sensibilities of their generation. Damien Hirst made all his formaldehyde pieces at Minet Road: the cows, the lamb, the bulls' heads, the pig. He did the spots there and the giant spin paintings with the mad Minet Road titles: \"Beautiful, cheap, shitty, too easy, anyone can do one, big, motor-driven, roto-heaven, corrupt, trashy, bad art, shite, motivating, captivating, over the sofa, celebrating painting.\" Marcus Harvey made one of the most powerful and notorious paintings of the 90s there - his billboard-size portrait of Myra Hindley daubed in childrens' hands. And after the artists came the collectors, dragging their Lobb and Gucci through the mire, braving the verbals. \"Oy, where'd you get your driving licence, on a milk carton?\" It became a compulsory stop-over on the international collectors' circuit. People came with chauffeurs. David Bowie came to fling paint on a spin painting with Damien. You wouldn't leave your car to go round the corner for a coffee. There were muggings. A woman artist was mugged twice, both times in the morning. It was scary. Daniel Coombs spent six weeks clearing car parts out of a space behind Brixton Breakers with Richard Clegg, another former student from the painting school at the Royal College in London. Clegg had always been a bit iconoclastic. He'd been the singer with an anarcho-punk band called Monkey Island and had wrecked the floor of the gallery at the college with a degree show piece made from 2,500 bars of Sunshine soap and cataracts of sump-oil. So he fitted right in. Coombs, though, had stuck to conventional painting. In 1994, the year before he moved into Minet Road, he'd sold a group of surreal Bauhaus-meets-Butthead canvases to Charles Saatchi. In 1996, Coombs was in Young British Artists 6 at the Saatchi Gallery and then saw his work being shoehorned into the new art movement Saatchi tried to launch just last year: New Neurotic Realism. But the very particular circumstances at Minet Road soon got to him. It was a wart of land and a jumble of old clapped-out buildings in the middle of a modern council estate; the last remaining trace of a life that had once been lived there. He stopped making paintings and started making assemblages from the rubbish heaped outside the studio door instead. \"It felt like a quite alien environment, in a way,\" he says. \"I felt alien and isolated, and didn't quite know what was happening at first. I found it hard to use a brush and do sensitive paintings. But the strangeness of the place drew us together more. It made us all take quite a hard attitude to our work. It made us want to do something quite brutal. Everybody who produced beautiful work there was influenced by the surroundings. Marcus [Harvey] definitely. He was just starting the Myra piece when I moved in, and I remember being impressed by this giant canvas laid out on scaffolding. It was exciting to think of Damien Hirst making his stuff there. If somebody produces something really outstanding, it gives you an impetus to compete with them.\" In his book, The Conditions of Success, the former director of the Tate, Sir Alan Bowness, puts forward the view that most truly original new work is the result of group activity: \"I do not believe that any great art has been produced in a non-competitive situation: on the contrary it is the fiercely competitive environment in which the young artist finds himself that drives him to excel... Pollock, Rothko, Newman, Still and de Kooning were all linked together in friendship and rivalry. A post-expressionist generation of distinction - Johns, Lichtenstein, Rauschenberg, Warhol - was to follow them. Artists who emerge from such a situation do not have a consistency of style... but there is a consistency of purpose. They want to get to the top.\" Daniel Coombs, Richard Clegg and their contemporaries from the Royal College who followed them to Brixton - Ian Dawson, Martin Westwood, Chantal Joffe - were the second tribe to colonise Minet Road. The first settlers came from Goldsmith's College, and included Damien Hirst, Marcus Harvey and Hugh Allan. In fact, these three were the core of a tribe within a tribe: the Leeds lot. Hugh Allan, who now runs Damien Hirst's studio and is his business partner in Science, had grown up next door to Marcus Harvey in Leeds and they remained best friends. Hirst, who was a few years younger, had been a friend of Allan's brother. They all went to the Jacob Kramer college of art in Leeds, and then, at different times, to Goldsmith's in London. Harvey was the trailblazer, and once he was settled Damien came to check it out. \"I'd led the way in terms of a career - of going to college and becoming an artist. I showed Damien what to do, in terms of it being possible to do this. I think without me being there, he might not have chosen the same path. I really do think that. But he came down, tapped into the actual mechanics of the art world by getting a job in a gallery [dogs-bodying at D'Offay], and then just took off in the inside lane. When I had these very kind of religious ideas about how you proceed in the art world - you sweated and suffered, and if you were lucky, when you were old and wispy, you might sell a picture - he just did not do shit like that. He just got on with life, you know; making life comfortable. \"He's the most guilt-free man I ever, ever experienced. That's what the contrast between the two of us is. He just went for it. And he didn't have a plan before, or a model. Damien's his own model. Fearless. He found out that, if you are your own person, you've nothing to fear in life. Especially in this [art] world. Being, you know, a genius of a geezer, and such a great personality and sense of humour, sense of adventure in life and death and everything, he just knew, 'I can't go wrong. There are so many fucking tossers. Whingeing neurots. I'm like a rock in a stormy sea.' And then suddenly he blazed away. He ripped the air out of everyone's lungs.\" By the time he discovered Brixton Breakers and Minet Road in the early 90s, Hirst was already in the thick of the kind of celebrity that hadn't been seen in the British art world since the days of David Hockney. He needed somewhere rough and ready because he was about to extend the Natural History series of sculptures that had started with The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living - Saatchi's 14ft tiger shark. To all the other noxious odours at Brixton Breakers was added the stench of formaldehyde. In a scenario that recalled the heyday of la vie boh\u00e8me in Paris, when the stink of a side of beef that Chaim Soutine was painting had his neighbours running for cover, the people in the flats on the nearby Loughborough estate complained that formaldehyde fumes were seeping in their windows. Looking down from the balconies they could see figures in dry-suits and face masks pumping formaldehyde solution into bits of animal carcass using 24-inch syringes. Over time, the bleakness of the surroundings - the damp and coldness and lack of even basic amenities (black fungus would creep up over the surface of a picture very quickly), and the operatic scale of the squalor - seemed to encourage an unorthodox approach to methods and materials. It was as if the toxic nature of the landscape in which they were working gave them permission to do things a politer set-up would have withheld. Among the younger group of artists - the second wave - Richard Clegg started working with stainless steel sink units and then, in The Unknown Collaboratives, with a hard-setting polyurethane, while Daniel Coombs went on piling up his detritus. At the RCA, Ian Dawson had worked fairly conventionally with wood and metal. In Brixton, he built everyday household objects into heaps - dog bowls, bins, baby baths, picnic chairs - then took up an oxyacetylene burner to fondue the plastic into free-standing Jackson Pollocks. Saatchi took three. Even Martin Westwood, whose work has a marvellous Jasper Johns stillness to it, a steely cerebral quality, started mutilating his canvases and winding the painted strips into spheres, which were then mounted, fungus-like, on the wall. Only Chantal Joffe kept more or less obdurately to the path she had been travelling before she arrived at Minet Road. The only change was that, perhaps as a reaction to all the gigantism and physicality going on around her, her already small paintings of children and adult pornography got even smaller. \"They're quite a macho group of people,\" she says, \"and those studios were really open. They made each other more ambitious: 'Oh I did an all-nighter.' They were going for that kind of mythical bonding. Which they could laugh at as well. The music went with that. Loud and hard. You know: 'We're here because we're hard.' I like to work silently. But even I was aware of making work that would stand up in that space.\" At the beginning, they split into two camps: the Leeds lot and the Rest. \"It wasn't easy to move into the Amish,\" Hugh Allan says. The division was acted out in the arena of The Hero of Switzerland, the nearest pub: if you were Leeds, you turned left into the poolroom; if Royal College, you turned right into the lounge. But then, largely through Richard Clegg and Marcus Harvey, the demarcations disappeared. Hirst had already taken his dangerously anarchic sense of mischief to the West End by then, and was cavorting with a new group of friends at the Groucho Club. By chance, Ian Dawson was taken on as a construction worker at Pharmacy, Hirst's restaurant project in Notting Hill. He'd put in an eight-hour shift, then do a few hours down at Brixton Breakers. It was sheer economics, he says, that drove people there. \"It was the cheapest studio space in town, by a mile. But there was a grimness to it. I'm fucking glad that place is over. We were all just waiting to get out of there at the end.\" The end, when it came last summer, came quickly. A fire spread through the breakers yard, and a week later, Gerry, the gaffer, was found dead in the alley among the rubble. The forklift he had been using to shift the burned-out cars had flipped over and crushed him. As a spectacle in a place that had seen the production of so much (museum quality) art whose theme was catastrophilia, it must have seemed grotesquely appropriate (catastrophilia: the longing for something terrible, for something that is terribly high, sad, or far, terribly mean, dangerous or lovely, as long as it's terrible). \"It was all very odd and very tragic,\" Dan Coombs says. \"It was just like the last... it was like the finally horrific thing that could have happened.\" \u0095 Daniel Coombs is showing new work at the Zwemmer Gallery, Litchfield St, London, until May 13. Richard Clegg's The Unknown Collaboratives will be the inaugural show at the Henry Peacock Gallery, Foley Street, from May 13. Martin Westwood is with the Approach Gallery.",
