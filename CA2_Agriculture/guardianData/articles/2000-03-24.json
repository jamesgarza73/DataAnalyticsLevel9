He has had business dealings in the past with the club's president Sir John Hall, and City analysts viewed his appointment as a sign that the Hall family was taking a firmer grip on the club. </p> <p>\"I think what is most interesting is that the club has taken on someone like David Stonehouse from Sunderland, a club who have said they put their ordinary supporters first,\" said Duffy. \"I do believe that there will be a feeling of great relief amongst the Newcastle supporters.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that Fletcher's decision to back a scheme which drove a wedge between the club and its fans cost him the job, which paid him over \u00a3200,000 last year. </p> <p>Duffy and five other fans lost their legal battle after they claimed that the \u00a3500 bonds they bought as season ticket-holders in 1994 should have guaranteed them the same seats for 10 years. Six years into the bond the six fans, with 4,000 others, were asked to move to the newly built upper tier of St James' Park to make way for the construction of corporate hospitality facilities. </p> <p>Frank Gilmour, the Newcastle United Independent Supporters' Club chairman, said few fans would shed tears over Fletcher's departure. </p> <p>\"I'm glad he's gone,\" he said. \"It's not just because of the court case but the way he has handled matters with the fans in recent years. He also stood up for Douglas Hall and Freddy Shepherd after they had made derogatory remarks about Newcastle fans.\" </p> <p>Fletcher yesterday conceded that his club had mishandled the relocation of the bond-holders. \"I accept that a lot of the anger with regard to the seats problem was directed at me,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think the decision the club took - and it was a unanimous board decision - was the right decision. [But] I think we handled it badly.\"</p>",

He has had business dealings in the past with the club's president Sir John Hall, and City analysts viewed his appointment as a sign that the Hall family was taking a firmer grip on the club. \"I think what is most interesting is that the club has taken on someone like David Stonehouse from Sunderland, a club who have said they put their ordinary supporters first,\" said Duffy. \"I do believe that there will be a feeling of great relief amongst the Newcastle supporters.\" There is no doubt that Fletcher's decision to back a scheme which drove a wedge between the club and its fans cost him the job, which paid him over \u00a3200,000 last year. Duffy and five other fans lost their legal battle after they claimed that the \u00a3500 bonds they bought as season ticket-holders in 1994 should have guaranteed them the same seats for 10 years. Six years into the bond the six fans, with 4,000 others, were asked to move to the newly built upper tier of St James' Park to make way for the construction of corporate hospitality facilities. Frank Gilmour, the Newcastle United Independent Supporters' Club chairman, said few fans would shed tears over Fletcher's departure. \"I'm glad he's gone,\" he said. \"It's not just because of the court case but the way he has handled matters with the fans in recent years. He also stood up for Douglas Hall and Freddy Shepherd after they had made derogatory remarks about Newcastle fans.\" Fletcher yesterday conceded that his club had mishandled the relocation of the bond-holders. \"I accept that a lot of the anger with regard to the seats problem was directed at me,\" he said. \"I think the decision the club took - and it was a unanimous board decision - was the right decision. [But] I think we handled it badly.\"",

His doctor's black.\" </p> <p>Midgley's father lay motionless in bed, the ghostly pallor of his arms and body contrasting with the ruddiness of his face as the regular blips of the heart monitor punctuated the silence. </p> <p>\"I'm sorry, Dad.\" </p> <p>Midgley waited as a man made a series of lengthy phone calls. \"Could I make just one call,\" he said eventually. </p> <p>\"Won't it wait?

      "bodyText": "\"The hospital's just rung to say Mr Midgley's father has been taken ill,\" said Miss Tunstall to Mr Horsfall, explaining her interruption. Denis Midgley, who had been having a tricky conversation about Mr Horsfall's son's hopelessness at English, realised he had just heard at second-hand his father was dying. \"You want to pray it's not his hip,\" said Miss Tunstall, as Midgley tried to negotiate the hospital switchboard. \"He's not at all well,\" said a reproachful voice. \"We think he's had a stroke. It's touch and go.\" \"Been on the phone again, Midgley,\" said the headmaster. \"I'll have to explain it to the finance committee.\" \"His father's ill. Apparently it's touch and go,\" mediated Miss Tunstall. \"Of course you must go,\" the headmaster muttered. \"One's father. It's awkward, though.\" Death reshuffled everything. Even the timetable. \"I just never expected it,\" said Mr Midgley, as his wife made him some sandwiches before he left for the hospital. \"I expected it,\" she said, \"Last time I went over, he came to the door to wave me off. He'd never done that before. It was a farewell.\" \"I'm not going to let him down. I want to be there when he goes - He loved me.\" \"I can't think why,\" countered Mrs Midgley. \"It's not as if you take after him.\" \"I thought you'd have been here before now,\" said Aunt Kitty, when Midgley arrived at the bedside. \"I don't dislike the oatmeal colour of the room. His doctor's black.\" Midgley's father lay motionless in bed, the ghostly pallor of his arms and body contrasting with the ruddiness of his face as the regular blips of the heart monitor punctuated the silence. \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" Midgley waited as a man made a series of lengthy phone calls. \"Could I make just one call,\" he said eventually. \"Won't it wait? I'm a father.\" \"I'm a son. My father's dying.\" \"Slack tonight,\" said Nurse Lightfoot, the night nurse, as Midgley sat by his father's bedside through the night. \"Still it just needs one drunken driver.\" \"What do you do all day?\" Midgley asked nurse Lightfoot the following evening as his father continued to hang on. \"Sleep.\" \"Maybe we could have a coffee if he's unchanged.\" \"OK.\" \"What would you say if I asked you to go to bed?\" Midgley asked, as they sat on a divan in the nurse's quarters. \"I'm on an early turn.\" \"Tomorrow then?\" \"That would be better.\" The phone rang the next evening as Midgley slid his hand up Nurse Lightfoot's thigh. \"I think he's smiling,\" said Mrs Midgley, looking down at her father-in-law. \"Of course he's smiling,\" replied Midgley. \"He's won.

Regional selective assistance is a discretionary grant available in UK-assisted areas towards capital investment projects that create or safeguard jobs. Officials pointed out that in order to qualify for such aid projects had to be viable, provide a net benefit to the UK economy and demonstrate a need for assistance.

Rev Martin Smyth, the MP for South Belfast, ended weeks of speculation about a \"stalking horse\" leadership candidate when he declared that he would attempt to topple Mr Trimble, after the UUP leader indicated that he was prepared to re-establish Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive. Hardline unionists were angered when Mr Trimble suggested during a visit to Washington last week that he would be prepared to sit down in government with Sinn Fein again - ahead of IRA disarmament - provided the republicans offered cast-iron guarantees about decommissioning their weapons. Mr Smyth, an opponent of the Good Friday agreement, made it clear that he would abandon the peace process when he said yesterday that he would offer a \"more vigorous promotion of Ulster Unionist policy\". A close ally of the former UUP leader Jim Molyneaux, Mr Smyth is unlikely to unseat Mr Trimble at tomorrow's meeting in Belfast of the 858-strong Ulster Unionist council. But a strong vote for the former grand master of the Orange Order could severely weaken Mr Trimble, paving the way for a heavyweight challenger, such as the party's deputy leader, John Taylor, or the dissident MP Jeffrey Donaldson.

Mr Trimble will seek to reaffirm his position by reminding the council that he honoured his pledge to abandon the executive if the IRA failed to disarm. He yesterday received the support of the chairman of his party, Lord Rogan, his Westminster colleague Ken Maginnis and the former Stormont minister Michael McGimpsey, who said he was \"astonished\" by Mr Smyth's challenge. Hardlinerwith a folksy appeal For diehard Ulster Unionists who long for a return to the days when Sinn Fein was excluded from the political process, the Rev Martin Smyth is a comforting figure. A Presbyterian minister who served as grand master of the Orange Order for 25 years, Mr Smyth made his greatest contribution to Northern Ireland during the annual Orange parades in July.

It was only with the election in 1995 of David Trimble, who punched at the same intellectual weight as British and Irish ministers, that Unionism was able to influence the peace process. Mr Smyth's leadership challenge will probably be remembered as his most remarkable achievement in an 18-year career as an MP.

This Sunday, however, assistants at Gucci and next door at Prada will be at work at the crack of dawn, steaming creases out of dresses that have been sent over from Milan, ready to be driven to exclusive addresses around town. Just a few yards away at Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, reinforced security vehicles will be waiting to courier millions of dollars worth of jewellery to the chosen few. At the upmarket beauty salons in the surrounding bijou streets, some of Hollywood's biggest names will be being waxed and buffed, while those not important enough to bag the coveted 2pm slot with the make-up artists and hairdressers will be having their foundation applied and preparing to sit around fully made-up all day. </p> <p>Ridiculous? No. The Oscars draws the second largest TV audience of any event in the US (only the Superbowl is more popular). Last year, a cool one billion people worldwide watched the ceremony. For an actor or actress, that means more people might see you on Sunday night than saw your last film. When 30-second ad slots are snapped up for $1m, it's clear the perfect dress could get you a lottery win-worth of publicity for nothing. Equally, one unflattering hemline and your going rate will plummet. </p> <p>This is not about wanting to look nice for a night out: it's about having to look perfect. Inevitably, the pressure is far higher for women than for men: while Tom Cruise told Entertainment Tonight he planned to \"pull something out of the closet and dust it off\", one actress asked to present an award last year almost cancelled when she discovered that her make-up artist and hairstylist were double-booked. </p> <p>Jeannine Lobel, who did Julianne Moore's make-up last year, says the Oscars are \"just too scary. You're such a target for criticism.\" And it's not even as simple as looking beautiful: you must also look appropriate. The Versace number Jennifer Lopez wore to the Grammies no doubt won her more admirers (the image was downloaded from the Grammy website 642,917 times in the next 24 hours) but too much overt sexiness is frowned upon by the Academy. </p> <p>Similarly, patriotism can win you support: darling of the British press Kate Winslet wore Alexander McQueen to her night of Titanic triumph, while this year's Brit nominee, Janet McTeer, is tipped to be dressed by Vivienne Westwood. Gwyneth Paltrow was lauded last year for a dress that, arguably, was one of her less flattering, less stylish outfits, but as a proper pink party dress it scored on the glamour-for-all-the-family rating - and it was by Ralph Lauren, an American designer. </p> <p>Philip Bloch, celebrity stylist and contributing fashion editor on InStyle magazine, says: \"It's a chance for actresses to show different sides of their personality.\" Hence Hilary Swank, Best Actress nominee for her role as a transsexual in Boys Don't Cry, is widely tipped to be \"doing sexy\" at the Oscars (she wore tight black Versace to the Golden Globes), while Bloch predicts Paltrow might cause raised eyebrows. \"She is getting a little bored of the whole good girl Gwyneth thing. Look at the see-through dress she wore to meet the president.\" </p> <p>Of course, the fashion frenzy benefits the designers as much as the actresses. Dressing women for the Oscars is a holy grail for many: after all, as Bloch says: \"No designers grew up thinking: I want to dress Mrs Hoffermeyer for her daughter's wedding. They grew up thinking: I want to dress Catherine Deneuve for the Oscars.\" Even more important is what it can do for business: a movie star looking fabulous in one of your creations not only garners unlimited publicity but stamps your label with the kind of fairytale prestige money can't buy. You've got to spend serious money to be in the running, though, which is why Oscar night is dominated by giants such as Giorgio Armani (the wealthiest designer in the world) and Versace, who last year scored with Madonna and Catherine Zeta Jones. </p> <p>Greg Link runs StyleFile, an LA-based company that liaises between designers and celebrities. On previous Oscar nights, he has worked his magic for Versace and Alberta Ferretti. \"When the nominees are announced, we pick who we think is right for the designer's image and send out look books [books of images from the catwalk shows], flowers and gifts. Then we have their stylists come in and look at the clothes, and if they like something, we'll have it altered for them.\" Rumours abound of designers offering trips on Concorde, 50% discounts for life and other extravagant gifts. The most anyone will admit to is flowers, but actresses do get to keep what they wear - except Chanel, who allegedly demand everything back. </p> <p>As publicist for LA company People's Revolution, Ted Byrne is experienced in trying to get the right people to wear a designer's clothes. \"It's hard work,\" he says, \"because there aren't that many girls to go after.\" </p> <p> Byrne thinks the hottest tickets to dress this year are Hilary Swank (\"There's a buzz about her\"), Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett (\"She's got the body\"), Gwyneth Paltrow, Selma Hayek, Charlize Theron and Jennifer Lopez. Bloch adds Heather Graham to the list (\"She's so sexy and so pretty and wears clothes so well\") and Lucy Lui, who will be presenting (and is tipped to be wearing Versace). According to Bloch, actresses who go out on a limb in their image are less in demand. \"Cameron [Diaz] has worn so many odd outfits recently that designers don't look to her so much now. And Drewy [Barrymore], she does her own thing.\" Similarly Chloe Sevigny, with her penchant for vintage YSL and brand-new St Martins graduates, is considered a wild card. </p> <p>Film and fashion have always fed off each other. Back in 1934, sales of men's vests plummeted when Clark Gable wore a shirt over bare skin in It Happened One Night. Uma Thurman single-handedly caused a trend for dark nail varnish when she wore Chanel Rouge Noir in Pulp Fiction. But the fashion machine that now exists around the Oscars did not come into being until the late 80s, when Giorgio Armani set up an office in LA to network with Hollywood, with the wife of one of the producers of The Godfather as his publicist. </p> <p>In the past five years, another important influence has been added to that of the designers: the high-profile stylist. Robert Triefus, head of communications for Giorgio Armani, insists: \"Armani still has personal and meaningful relationships with personalities like Jodie Foster and Annette Bening. But there's no doubt that celebrities are increasingly surrounded by influential stylists, make-up artists and publicists.\" </p> <p>Stylists such as Jessica Paster, who \"does\"Jennifer Aniston and Minnie Driver, wield huge power and Ted Byrne predicts that, because of this, the Oscars of the future will look less like a ballroom and more like a catwalk. \"For instance, people are starting to accept that wearing pants can be chic - like the Chloe outfit Gwyneth wore to the Golden Globes. There are a lot of very sophisticated stylists working in LA these days.\" There may still be a few plot twists to come in the story of Hollywood's love affair with fashion.</p>",

But the fashion machine that now exists around the Oscars did not come into being until the late 80s, when Giorgio Armani set up an office in LA to network with Hollywood, with the wife of one of the producers of The Godfather as his publicist. In the past five years, another important influence has been added to that of the designers: the high-profile stylist. Robert Triefus, head of communications for Giorgio Armani, insists: \"Armani still has personal and meaningful relationships with personalities like Jodie Foster and Annette Bening. But there's no doubt that celebrities are increasingly surrounded by influential stylists, make-up artists and publicists.\" Stylists such as Jessica Paster, who \"does\"Jennifer Aniston and Minnie Driver, wield huge power and Ted Byrne predicts that, because of this, the Oscars of the future will look less like a ballroom and more like a catwalk. \"For instance, people are starting to accept that wearing pants can be chic - like the Chloe outfit Gwyneth wore to the Golden Globes. There are a lot of very sophisticated stylists working in LA these days.\" There may still be a few plot twists to come in the story of Hollywood's love affair with fashion.",

Cotter's stabbing is the latest and most serious in a string of racist threats and attacks against high-profile mixed-race couples in Britain. Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies and her former husband, runner Derek Redmond, were sent obscene and abusive letters, including some from the far-right group Combat 18, after their marriage in 1994. In 1997, a letter bomb concealed in a video cassette was sent to their house but it was intercepted and defused. Retired heavyweight boxer Frank Bruno, former hurdler Kriss Akabusi and soccer star Paul Ince have all been warned by police they could be targets because of their mixed-race marriages or relationships.",

Egos were rampant, opinions were heated and animal welfare was a distant concern as the fasherati battled for the ethically dubious award for most creative use of fur. There was Nija, the black Native American designer, personal furrier to Puff Daddy, telling me that furs were \"a black thang. Let me tell you, all those top designers, they watch me, oh, yes, they watch me and then they copy. Oh, yes, baby, they copy me.\" </p> <p>Fur is a very Italian thang, too. As the centre of the fur market since Byzantium, Italy takes seriously its role as promoter of fur in fashion. Furs a go-go was the brainchild of Franca Sozzani, editor-in-chief of Italian Vogue. Her aim: to host a party, in conjunction with Saga Furs of Scandinavia, to show \"fur as funky\" and promote it as a versatile fabric that can be used right across the design spectrum. </p> <p>Furs a go-go was a very Milanese occasion: held at 10 Corso Como, the chic shop-cum-gallery-cum-restaurant owned by Franca's sister, Carla Sozzani, it was the sort of event that would outrage PETA - and your average British animal lover. This year's award went to Fendi, the Italian label whose monogrammed baguette bag is a favourite with It girls the world over. Under the creative direction of Karl Lagerfeld, Fendi has reinvented itself as label of choice for those who love glamour, opulence and wearing dead animals with pride. Leopardskin? Lynx? Fox? Mink? Fendi use them all. </p> <p>Paola Fendi, small, immaculately groomed, dressed in grey knitwear to match her hair, was delighted with her award. \"Of course, fur has never been out of fashion. In Italy, never.\" </p> <p>\"I don't know what Milan would do without the Sozzani sisters,\" says Sara Kapp, PR and former model. \"Without them... this would be just like that party in Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" Perhaps, although Holly Golightly might have balked at some of the decorations on offer at this particular soiree. In a kaleidoscope of fuchsias, oranges, purples, pinks and greens were furnishings in every permutation of fur imaginable: rugs made from skunks, foxes and rabbits, wall hangings styled \u00e0 la Rothko in shaved lamb, a patchwork counterpane in fox, mink poufs and curtains, fox cushions and an antelope bedside rug. Models were dressed in Fendi, one an exotic bird of paradise in a coat with multicoloured tufts of sprouting mink, others in the coats of the same creature sheared down to a fine felt nap that felt like cashmere. </p> <p>African American designer Lawrence Steele was smitten by all the fur on display. \"Fabulous. I've never seen it used in so many ways. It's an education.\" </p> <p>It is certainly an education to see how inventive Saga has been in promoting the use of fur within the fashion industry. Thanks to their initiatives, we can expect fur to be everywhere this autumn - like it or not. Saga produces the majority of the world's farmed fox and mink. Their marketing campaign has managed to entice many of the world's leading designers - Brits like John Galliano and Alexander McQueen among them - into using fur in their collections. </p> <p>The big push has been going on since 1994, when US marketing mastermind Steve Gold first invited designers to \"try out\" Saga's full range of fur at their Design Centre in Copenhagen - for free, of course. Saga has been at the frontier of fur innovation, working traditional pelts into all sorts of modern, tactile permutations. A recent project in Copenhagen has produced mink and fox woven with chenille, for example. </p> <p> Saga spokesperson Tom Christensen explains: \"We want to see fur used in a more technically advanced fashion, with designers using it in new ways that are more linked to the rest of their collections. Jean Paul Gaultier is doing very interesting stuff and Tom Ford is styling fur in a completely modern way. So, of course, is Fendi.\" </p> <p>By reworking fur into such obscure permutations, of course, Saga is also cleverly disguising its origins: making the final effect as far removed as possible from the basic fact that it's the pelt of a dead animal. </p> <p>Saga is also canny enough to push fur at college level, just when impoverished students are most vulnerable to the offer of free fabric, whatever it's made out of. Saga works with students at Central Saint Martins and the Royal College of Art: last year, the RCA's Jose Rodriguez was sponsored by Saga and designed a Russian ratskin (sic) coat. It is currently in talks with a variety of colleges, specifically to promote the use of fur as a fibre with textile students, and it has recently worked with Bella Freud, Jeremy Scott, Michael Kors and Julien Macdonald, although Macdonald dropped Saga as a sponsor hours before his autumn/winter show at the Dome last month, after receiving threats from animal rights protesters. </p> <p>This winter, Lawrence Steele has designed fox and mink coats with the skin side covered in 24 carat gold leaf. \"I love the quality of luxury about fur,\" he says. Naomi Campbell (who once famously declared that she would rather go naked than wear fur), Oprah Winfrey and Julia Roberts are all rumoured to be clients of Steele's. </p> <p>Saga might be fighting to invest fur with a new, radical chic, but in Europe and America, the battle for fur acceptance was won years ago. In societies such as the US and Milan, where money defines class, fur is inextricably linked with anxieties over status. It defines who you are. </p> <p>Lisa Strathdee of cutting-edge London design consultancy L.I.T.E. shrugs at the idea that Milan could ever give up fur. \"It wears too well with gold,\" she says simply. </p> <p>At the Furs a go-go party, nobody was sitting on the fence. \"It's very important for fur to be valued. It has always dressed kings and queens, and is a precious and beautiful thing,\" said fashion consultant Sonja Baras. Distasteful as such opinions may be to animal lovers, the reality is that fur use is on the up in the fashion industry and nothing can stop its progress. Now that it comes in ever more imaginative guises, the message for autumn is: make sure you know what you are buying.</p>",

      "byline": "Andrew Clements",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For those of us who have thought of Pierre Boulez as a fixed star in our concert-going firmaments for as long as we can remember, it's hard to accept that he will reach his 75th birthday on Sunday.</p> <p>London, quite rightly, is doing the anniversary proud; the London Symphony Orchestra has already put on the four concerts of Boulez 2000, in which he conducted new works as well as 20th-century staples from his repertory, and this weekend the South Bank is hosting two days of celebrations, which will include a recital by Pierre-Laurent Aimard, two concerts by the London Sinfonietta, and the premiere of 12 specially commissioned birthday tributes. It will end with Boulez conducting the Ensemble Intercontemporain in his masterpiece Pli Selon Pli. </p> <p>It's a worthy salute to the musician who has worked harder than anyone else to broaden the musical perspectives of audiences on two continents over the last half-century. When I first heard him conduct live, at the Festival Hall in 1972, he was already in full flight in his attempts to shake up the musical culture of London; he was chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and just about to take on the New York Philharmonic as well.</p> <p>With both orchestras his mission was the same - to persuade concert-goers that the music of the 20th century was their music, that the barrier between them and much of what had been written since 1900 was imaginary and not real. Only if we got to grips with the music of yesterday, Boulez reasoned, could we fully appreciate the music of today. </p> <p>There was also artistic self-interest in that crusade, of course. Though there have been periods in his life - especially during the late 60s and the early 70s - when the opposite seemed true, Boulez was and remains a composer first and a conductor second (he began his second career by taking charge of his own early scores), and he belongs to a generation of composers (also including Berio, Stockhausen, and Nono) who in the 50s took forward the implications of modernism in a ruthlessly rigorous fashion.</p> <p>His revolutionary approach took few prisoners in those days - even the patron saint of serialism was castigated in Boulez's infamous 1951 article \"Schoenberg is Dead\" for failing to carry through the implications of his radicalism. The tag of \"intolerant propagandist\" that is still sometimes hung around Boulez's neck (as recently as this week in the pages of the Daily Telegraph) dates back to that time, when his dismissals of composers like Britten, Shostakovich and Henze as hopelessly conservative carried real venom. </p> <p>He's mellowed a lot since then, even if not quite enough to conduct any of those composers, any more than he has come round to accepting the artistic worth of Verdi and Puccini or embraced the wonderful world of minimalism. But he commands a far wider range of repertoire now than he did even 30 years ago.</p> <p>It would been hard then, for instance, to imagine Boulez recording Bruckner's Eighth Symphony, or Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, both of which are due to appear this year, and in old age he now uses charm to achieve what he wants rather than the razor-sharp polemics of old. And what he wants is much the same as what he wanted when he first conducted a symphony orchestra in London 35 years ago - for the music of our time to be heard in the best possible performances with the best possible acoustics, before an audience that has been given the maximum amount of help in getting to grips with it.</p> <p>In his native France, where he has had a tempestuous relationship with the successive governments, his persistence has brought into being not only IRCAM, the research centre beneath the Pompidou Centre in Paris, but more recently the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique on the outskirts of the capital, which is its complement. Where IRCAM was meant for composers, offering them state-of-the-art facilities to explore the ways in which new technology could extend their aesthetic possibilities, the function of the Cit\u00e9 is primarily educational. </p> <p>In London, of course, Boulez was unable to wield the same financial clout or to effect such a sea change in the government's sponsorship of the arts. But what he did achieve here, both through the experiments in concert-giving that he tried out during his years at the BBC and in the revelatory performances that he continues to conduct, has left an indelible mark. The masterpieces of modernism at least - works by the Second Viennese School, Stravinsky, and Bart\u00f3k - are established in the London repertory largely thanks to his exemplary interpretations, while even the music of his own contemporaries no longer guarantees certain box-office death. </p> <p>At the moment it is much harder to place Boulez's own works in the same certain perspective. It is hard to decide, for example, whether his intense activity as a conductor has prevented him from composing as much as he might have done, or whether the apparent diversion into the concert hall was in fact a necessary change of emphasis. It's possible that in the 60s, when his conducting career really took off, that Boulez already knew he was facing a creative impasse in his work, that the line of development he had been following so unswervingly for 20 years was beginning to peter out. He would need a fresh impulse to start again. </p> <p>IRCAM eventually provided that, but meanwhile conducting offered him an alternative creative role that he could fill magnificently, while he subjected his own past efforts to continual revision. \"Work in progress\" became an ever more frequent description of his pieces; as if he were attempting to recreate on his terms the concept of his hero Mallarm\u00e9, whose famous notional Livre had an indeterminate number of pages ordered in an infinite number of ways. For Boulez the idea of the finished, circumscribed artwork suddenly lost its meaning, and the technical processes he applied to his pieces seemed as if they could go on generating new material and new versions ad infinitum. </p> <p>In 50 years, when Boulez will have long finished his revisions, and his whole output will be fixed forever, it might be easier to appreciate his achievement as an integrated whole. His music will survive, I've no doubt of that - works like Pli Selon Pli, Le Marteau Sans Ma\u00eetre, Le Soleil Des Eaux, Eclats/Multiples and ...explosante-fixe... have a clarity of organisation and a beauty of sound that will keep them fresh.

      "bodyText": "For those of us who have thought of Pierre Boulez as a fixed star in our concert-going firmaments for as long as we can remember, it's hard to accept that he will reach his 75th birthday on Sunday. London, quite rightly, is doing the anniversary proud; the London Symphony Orchestra has already put on the four concerts of Boulez 2000, in which he conducted new works as well as 20th-century staples from his repertory, and this weekend the South Bank is hosting two days of celebrations, which will include a recital by Pierre-Laurent Aimard, two concerts by the London Sinfonietta, and the premiere of 12 specially commissioned birthday tributes. It will end with Boulez conducting the Ensemble Intercontemporain in his masterpiece Pli Selon Pli. It's a worthy salute to the musician who has worked harder than anyone else to broaden the musical perspectives of audiences on two continents over the last half-century. When I first heard him conduct live, at the Festival Hall in 1972, he was already in full flight in his attempts to shake up the musical culture of London; he was chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and just about to take on the New York Philharmonic as well. With both orchestras his mission was the same - to persuade concert-goers that the music of the 20th century was their music, that the barrier between them and much of what had been written since 1900 was imaginary and not real. Only if we got to grips with the music of yesterday, Boulez reasoned, could we fully appreciate the music of today. There was also artistic self-interest in that crusade, of course. Though there have been periods in his life - especially during the late 60s and the early 70s - when the opposite seemed true, Boulez was and remains a composer first and a conductor second (he began his second career by taking charge of his own early scores), and he belongs to a generation of composers (also including Berio, Stockhausen, and Nono) who in the 50s took forward the implications of modernism in a ruthlessly rigorous fashion. His revolutionary approach took few prisoners in those days - even the patron saint of serialism was castigated in Boulez's infamous 1951 article \"Schoenberg is Dead\" for failing to carry through the implications of his radicalism. The tag of \"intolerant propagandist\" that is still sometimes hung around Boulez's neck (as recently as this week in the pages of the Daily Telegraph) dates back to that time, when his dismissals of composers like Britten, Shostakovich and Henze as hopelessly conservative carried real venom. He's mellowed a lot since then, even if not quite enough to conduct any of those composers, any more than he has come round to accepting the artistic worth of Verdi and Puccini or embraced the wonderful world of minimalism. But he commands a far wider range of repertoire now than he did even 30 years ago. It would been hard then, for instance, to imagine Boulez recording Bruckner's Eighth Symphony, or Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, both of which are due to appear this year, and in old age he now uses charm to achieve what he wants rather than the razor-sharp polemics of old. And what he wants is much the same as what he wanted when he first conducted a symphony orchestra in London 35 years ago - for the music of our time to be heard in the best possible performances with the best possible acoustics, before an audience that has been given the maximum amount of help in getting to grips with it. In his native France, where he has had a tempestuous relationship with the successive governments, his persistence has brought into being not only IRCAM, the research centre beneath the Pompidou Centre in Paris, but more recently the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique on the outskirts of the capital, which is its complement.

      "body": "<p>In his most resonant gesture yet of reconciliation, Pope John Paul II yesterday visited Israel's Holocaust memorial, walking in semi-darkness over stone slabs engraved with the names of the Nazis' killing places, and bowing his head in prayer.</p> <p>For many Israelis and Jews around the world, the symbolic importance of the visit to Yad Vashem far outweighs the Pope's earlier condemnations of anti-semitism, representing a turning point after two millennia of recrimination.</p> <p>However, some will doubtless be disappointed by his failure to offer a full apology for the Catholic church's conduct during the Nazi era.</p> <p>\"In this place of memories the mind and heart and soul feel an extreme need for silence. Silence in which to try to make some sense of the memories, which come flooding back. Silence because there are no words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy of the Shoah [Holocaust],\" the Pope said.</p> <p>All six of the Nazi extermination camps - as opposed to 16 other sites remembered at Yad Vashem where Jews were rounded up or worked to death as slave labourers - were on Polish soil, and the Pope was born and raised about 15 miles from Auschwitz.</p> <p>The Pope said he had come to Yad Vashem, on the south-western edge of Jerusalem, to remember Jewish neighbours and friends from his home town of Wadowice, who were killed during the Holocaust, and to pay homage to the millions who died.</p> <p>Several of the assembled dignitaries dabbed at their eyes during the ceremony.</p> <p>For Israel, the visit to Yad Vashem was the pinnacle of a day in which the Vatican was forced to affirm the Jewish state. A session between the Pope and chief rabbis was followed by a meeting with Israel's president, Ezer Weizmann, which ended warmly.</p> <p>\"I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic Church... is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of anti-semitism directed against the Jews by Christians at any time and in any place,\" the Pope said.</p> <p>But Israel's chief rabbi, Israel Meir Lau, said, after attending the ceremony: \"This apology was quite fine... but I wait for chapter number two.\"</p> <p>After the raucous reception the Pope had been given by the Palestinians in Bethlehem, yesterday was Israel's turn to seek the Vatican's blessing, and to try to extract maximum political advantage from the visit.</p> <p>But it was an entirely official affair. The city was largely deserted - an evident surprise for the authorities, which had put up crowd control barriers at points along the Pope's route.</p> <p>It was a telling indicator of Israeli attitudes towards Christianity which are unlikely to be helped by the Pope's failure to apologise for earlier Catholic teachings - since repudiated - which vilified Jews, and for his contention that the Nazi ideology never fed off Christianity.</p> <p>There are 300,000 survivors of the Nazi Holocaust in Israel, and many were watching for John Paul II to condemn the silence of his own church and its wartime shepherd, Pius XII, while the Jews were being slaughtered. Religious experts knew that was an impossibility because of the doctrine of papal infallibility.</p> <p>For some, nothing the Pope could say could erase the horrors of the past. \"He is recognising the Holocaust more than 50 years later. It is a little late, isn't it?\" said Claude Belassen, who is Jewish and from Paris. <br><b>Useful links</b><br><br><a href=\"http://www.yad-vashem.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/anti-semitism/pius.html\" target=\"_new\">Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/\" target=\"_new\">The Vatican</a></p>",

For many Israelis and Jews around the world, the symbolic importance of the visit to Yad Vashem far outweighs the Pope's earlier condemnations of anti-semitism, representing a turning point after two millennia of recrimination. However, some will doubtless be disappointed by his failure to offer a full apology for the Catholic church's conduct during the Nazi era. \"In this place of memories the mind and heart and soul feel an extreme need for silence. Silence in which to try to make some sense of the memories, which come flooding back. Silence because there are no words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy of the Shoah [Holocaust],\" the Pope said. All six of the Nazi extermination camps - as opposed to 16 other sites remembered at Yad Vashem where Jews were rounded up or worked to death as slave labourers - were on Polish soil, and the Pope was born and raised about 15 miles from Auschwitz. The Pope said he had come to Yad Vashem, on the south-western edge of Jerusalem, to remember Jewish neighbours and friends from his home town of Wadowice, who were killed during the Holocaust, and to pay homage to the millions who died. Several of the assembled dignitaries dabbed at their eyes during the ceremony. For Israel, the visit to Yad Vashem was the pinnacle of a day in which the Vatican was forced to affirm the Jewish state. A session between the Pope and chief rabbis was followed by a meeting with Israel's president, Ezer Weizmann, which ended warmly. \"I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic Church... is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of anti-semitism directed against the Jews by Christians at any time and in any place,\" the Pope said. But Israel's chief rabbi, Israel Meir Lau, said, after attending the ceremony: \"This apology was quite fine... but I wait for chapter number two.\" After the raucous reception the Pope had been given by the Palestinians in Bethlehem, yesterday was Israel's turn to seek the Vatican's blessing, and to try to extract maximum political advantage from the visit. But it was an entirely official affair. The city was largely deserted - an evident surprise for the authorities, which had put up crowd control barriers at points along the Pope's route. It was a telling indicator of Israeli attitudes towards Christianity which are unlikely to be helped by the Pope's failure to apologise for earlier Catholic teachings - since repudiated - which vilified Jews, and for his contention that the Nazi ideology never fed off Christianity. There are 300,000 survivors of the Nazi Holocaust in Israel, and many were watching for John Paul II to condemn the silence of his own church and its wartime shepherd, Pius XII, while the Jews were being slaughtered. Religious experts knew that was an impossibility because of the doctrine of papal infallibility. For some, nothing the Pope could say could erase the horrors of the past. \"He is recognising the Holocaust more than 50 years later. It is a little late, isn't it?\" said Claude Belassen, who is Jewish and from Paris. Useful links Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust The Vatican",

      "body": "<p>This is the age at which reading starts to get interesting, both for you and them. Around now most children will be reading fluently on their own and will start to develop their own distinct taste in books, although, like aliens, yo-yos and skipping, particular writers go in and out of fashion in the playground.</p> <p>It would, however, be a pity if you and your children stopped reading together at this point. You will both miss the closeness, and you will also miss some really good stories. This is the moment when your childhood reading and that of your own children's meet and meld as you introduce them to E. Nesbit and Phillipa Pearce and they take you on flights of the imagination with Philip Ridley and JK Rowling. As every parent with children in this age range knows, a thorough grounding in the rules of quidditch is essential if you are to have any meaningful conversation with your children.</p> <p>A word of warning. Take care when trying to introduce the books you loved or think you loved as a child to your own. Often your memory will be hazy as to exactly what age you were when you read it - you were almost certainly older than you think. There is sometimes a density to the writing of many of the older classics, which can be very satisfying, but which can also be a turn-off to a generation raised on the Oxford Reading Tree and Ginn. They will probably be appreciated in time, but read them The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in the cradle and they'll firmly slam the door shut on you. Every child is different in their reading ability and their interests, and parents need to take their cue from the child.</p> <p>Remember, a book which sports the label \"classic\" isn't intrinsically better for your children than one which does not. Books are not medicine to be forced down; they should be fun, exciting doorways into other worlds and different feelings and points of view. The best books for this age group do not inform children about the world, but present it to them as a transformation. Best books. What does that mean? Between 8-11 there is no such thing as a bad book, it is the habit of reading that counts. Don't get prissy and ban Enid Blyton. The child who thrills to the adventure of The Secret of Killimoon is only a step away from the excitement of Philip Ridley's Kasper in the Glitter.</p> <p>For some children this is also the age when books become friends, the same one consumed over and over in the same way that a teenager will play the same track on a new CD over and over. Assume, if this is the case, that the child is getting something crucial from it in the same way that the child who demands cheese three times a day for a week is probably unconsciously seeking some essential nutrient. At this age, books can be the most satisfying food in the world.</p> <h2>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Walker, \u00a314.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719733\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/alice2.gif\" alt=\"Alice in Wonderland 2\" width=\"128\" height=\"160\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A very modern \"Alice\" for the modern child that dusts off the Victorian fustiness of the book. Some adults will regret this approach and the passing of the dark Tenniel drawings but this is a perfect introduction to the story for younger readers and while Oxenbury's fresh as a daisy illustrations make the story completely accessible they certainly don't Disneyfy it in any way.</p> <h2>Rumpelstiltskin and Other Grimm Tales by Carol Ann Duffy, illustrated by Marketa Prachaticka (Faber, \u00a38.99)</h2> <p>These are familiar stories such as Snow White, Ashputtel and Little Redcap told with a poet's voice. They are bare, spare, and stripped down to the bone so that the story itself stands out like a skeleton. It was Duffy's versions of the tales that were used by the Young Vic for its outstanding Grimm Tales. Reading the stories makes you aware how much the theatrical style sprung from Duffy's gleaming, hard words.</p> <h2>The Indian in the Cupboard by Lynne Reid Banks (Collins Modern Classics, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>On his ninth birthday, Omri receives many gifts including a much-wanted skateboard. Less desired are the old cupboard given to him by his brother and the three-inch tall plastic Indian given to him by his friend Patrick. But it is the latter two gifts that prove best of all for when the Indian is put in the cupboard and the key is turned he comes to life. Little Bull turns out to be everything you could wish from an Indian - proud, fearless and defiant. But as Omri soon discovers being responsible for another person isn't easy, particularly when they don't always behave as you might expect or wish. This is a wonderful, very readable book in which our responsibilities to each other are explored through an entertaining story.</p> <h2>The Children of Green Knowe by Lucy Boston (Faber, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Tolly's great grandmother's house is full of a very special kind of magic. There are other children living there, children who were happy there many centuries before. Boston's novel really does conjure up all the magic of childhood for a new generation in this smart reissue of the 1961 Carnegie winner.</p> <h2>Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by TS Eliot, illustrated by Edward Gorey (Faber, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Essential for reading out loud as a family, TS Eliot's felines are a wonderfully mysterious capricious and amusing group of must-have moggies. Cult American artist Edward Gorey adds more mischief with his illustrations.</p> <h2>Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Just when you're feeling down, the homework is piling up and life seems a grind and not fun, you need a dose of Pippi Longstocking, the irrepressible little girl who doesn't live by the rules and creates a wonderful fantasy world for herself and her friends. This is a marvellous, stimulating book that is brilliant for children who've had the individuality bashed out of them by school.</p> <h2>The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Abridged - and all the better for it - version of the classic Victorian tale of chimney sweeps featuring Mrs Do As You Would Be Done By and other morality figures. Of course it is stiff and old-fashioned, but there is also a kind of enchantment about it that survives changes in life and attitudes.</p> <h2>Please Mrs Butler by Allan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719734\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/mrsbutler.gif\" alt=\"Mrs Butler 2\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A child's school day told in verse through from going to school to bedtime. That doesn't make it sound all that interesting, but Ahlberg's easy-to-read poems are funny, sad and absolutely accurate when it comes to emotion. From the title poem about a teacher at the end of her tether, through the pinickety parent complaining about her son's lost possessions to the quietly devastating Small Quarrel, this is a brilliant collection that not only makes children love poetry but gets them writing their own.</p> <h2>The Haunting by Margaret Mahy (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Carnegie award-winning novel about Barney who one \"ordinary Wednesday\" finds that \"the world tilted and ran downhill in all directions.\" Barney is being haunted but who is making the insistent ghostly footsteps in his mind? And why do his sisters' attempts to unravel the mystery lead to a crisis that almost topples the entire family? Mahy's attractively simple storytelling style will attract even the most reluctant readers and creates a convincing portrait of a family tipped out of kilter by the keeping of secrets.</p> <h2>Thunder and Lightnings by Jan Mark (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Victor was the oddest boy Andrew had ever met. How could he be so dim in school, and yet know so much about aeroplanes? But then, as Andrew starts to slowly appreciate, appearances can be very deceptive indeed and we all have our own strategies for survival. Smartly written, very enjoyable story about friendship and the differences between us all. Particularly good for boys.</p> <h2>The Snow Spider by Jenny Nimmo (Mammoth, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Gwyn's granny gives him five strange birthday gifts including a twisted metal brooch. Gywn gives the brooch to the wind and in return is sent the snow spider who weaves a silken web. Inside the web sits a girl who Gwyn knows but cannot place. Nimmo's book deftly mixes magic and mourning, the ordinary and the other-worldly in this story of a lost sister, a battle of good against evil and the value of knowing the place where you belong.</p> <h2>The House of Rats by Stephen Elboz (OUP, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Elboz is one of the best writers around at the moment, crafting his stories with amazing depth and using words with wit and brilliance. This 1992 Smarties Award winner tells of four children who suddenly find their safe life disappearing as the mysterious house where they are living is taken over and wolves howl outside. Only when they meet one of the \"Rats\" do they find a way to escape.</p> <h2>The Wreck of the Zanzibar by Michael Morpurgo (Mammoth, \u00a34.50)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719735\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/zanzibar.gif\" alt=\"Zanzibar\" width=\"128\" height=\"206\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is 1907, life on the Scilly Isles is bleak and difficult and it seems likely that Laura and her father will be forced to retreat to the mainland. Even the cow stops milking. Morpurgo's book is written with his customary quiet authority as it charts the battle between man and nature and the cruelties and beauties of the sea and its creatures.</p> <h2>A Dog So Small by Phillipa Pearce (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>The longing, the sadness, the sense of otherness and the exhilaration of childhood are brought vividly to life in this story of Ben, a boy who so much wants a dog he conjures one up out of his imagination.</p> <h2>The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (Faber, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Russell Hoban's book is a brilliant modern fairytale about a father and son toy mouse who dance under a Christmas tree until they break the ancient clockwork rules and are themselves broken. Discarded, they are rescued from a dustbin and repaired by a tramp before setting out on a dangerous quest to find a home of their own. A crackling read, full of Hoban's sly humour and his belief in the importance of having a place of your own and being happy.</p> <h2>The Finders by Nigel Hinton (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Walking across the park one morning, Rosie encounters a frail old man who asks her to post a package for him. Little does our heroine know that it contains the Djinn star whose evil magic threatens to take her over. Only the Finders can help her. Hinton's book, a pacy, well-plotted novel is a really good introduction to more adult reading for nine year olds and above.</p> <h2>The Illustrated Mum by Jacqueline Wilson (Corgi, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Wilson's best book to date is a no-holds bar account of the mental breakdown of Marigold, mother to Star and Dolphin and covered from head to toe in tattoos. For years the girls have persuaded themselves that life with mum is a gas (except when she goes weird) but now they are growing up and looking at the world and mum with new eyes. This is a wonderful, perceptive and disturbing book about mental illness, irresponsible parenthood and the falling out of love of children with their parents. Wilson holds true to the very end, offering no happy-ever-afters but plenty of possibilities instead.</p> <h2>King of the Shadows by Susan Cooper (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Shakespeare's London is brought vividly to life in cleverly written novel that sees young actor Nat Field slipping back 400 years in time to find himself playing Puck at the Globe Theatre in 1599. Playing opposite him is the King of the Shadows himself, William Shakespeare. Worth a hundred history lessons, Cooper's novel combines thriller-like suspense with a story of theatrical and personal transformations.</p> <h2>Haroun and the Sea of Stories by Salman Rushdie (Granta, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719736\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/haroun2.gif\" alt=\"Haroun 2\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Think the Arabian Nights. Think Alice in Wonderland. Think Star Wars. You can think a lot about Rushdie's story about a boy's quest to restore the gift of storytelling to his father, but you'll probably be too busy enjoying it. This is a dense, fantastical book, in which the comic rubs shoulders with evil and the savage with the lyrical. Lovely.</p> <h2>The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>The first book in Le Guin's deep, dense and utterly brilliant Earthsea series, a fantasy sequence that is to Terry Prachett what double cream is to skim milk. Le Guin writes with a calm authority, almost a stillness, as she charts the story of the young wizard Sparrowhawk who misuses magic and unleashes an evil shadow-beast who threatens his land. Only Sparrowhawk can destroy it, but the journey is long and difficult and takes him to the farthest corner of Earthsea.</p> <h2>The Rinaldi Ring by Jenny Nimmo (Mammoth \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Eliot is finding it hard to come to terms with his mother's death. But then he finds a ghost in his bedroom who has her own grief to deal with. Nimmo's beautifully written and understated novel is about the way the past makes its imprint upon the present and the subtle interconnections of both history and family relationships.</p> <h2>A Voyage of Discovery 1: From the Land of the Amazons to the Indigo Isles by Francois Place (Pavillion, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Francois Place is an artist, an author, a dreamer and the inventor of strange, fantastical countries and legends that he realises through fly-away prose and exquisite pen pictures. It is like being taken on an amazing off-beat adventure by a 19th century explorer. This is a must-have book for the dreamer in every child, a book to awaken curiosity and the imagination.</p> <h2>The Ghost Drum by Susan Price (Faber \u00a33.50)</h2> <p>Imagine a country where night lasted an entire winter and where in the darkness danger stalks. Price conjures a world of magic and danger to tell this modern, mythic fairytale about a boy imprisoned in a tower whose cries for help are heard by the witch-girl, Chingis. If they like this try the equally enthralling Ghost Dance and Ghost Song.</p> <h2>Walkabout by James Vance Marshall (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719737\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/walkabout.gif\" alt=\"Walkabout\" width=\"128\" height=\"211\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A culture clash of epic proportions ensues in this classic novel that sees two privileged English kids abandoned in the Australian outback and forced to fend for themselves.</p> <h2>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl (Puffin Modern Classic, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Truly scrumptious tale of a boy called Charlie Bucket who wins a golden ticket, entitling him to a day out at Willy Wonka's miraculous chocolate factory. The real question about this book is how long you'll be able to hold off before reading it to your kids. Dahl's wonderfully evil sense of humour makes what could simply be a modern version of the cautionary tale into something exceptional. The writing sizzles, foams, spits and bubbles over. Wild and wonderful. Read it to them from six; read it alone from eight. Follow with Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, James and the Giant Peach and the BFG (all Puffin \u00a35.99)</p> <h2>The Earth Giant by Melvin Burgess (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>As a great storm rages around their house, Amy and Peter hear a terrible noise like a dying giant. Amy knows that the sound is an ancient oak tree half a mile away being ripped from the ground. Trapped among its roots is a secret that only she can uncover. Beautifully wrought story about the way secrets bring you together and tear you apart, and about the competitive relationship between a brother and sister from a fine writer best known for his brilliant books for teenagers.</p> <h2>Woof! By Allan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Highly entertaining book about Eric, a perfectly ordinary boy, who feels his nose becoming cold and wet and his ears becoming floppy as he is transformed into a dog. In its own schoolboyish way Eric's transformation is just as interesting and surreal as that of poor Gregor Samsa into a beetle.</p> <h2>Matilda by Roald Dahl (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>The Roald Dahl must-read for this age-group; they'll find it impossible to resist even if they are hooked on the Danny Devito film version. In fact, seeing the film leads naturally into wanting to read the story of the remarkable Matilda, ignored and derided by her parents and bullied by the odious teacher Miss Trunchbull, who not only has a brilliant mind but strange kinetic powers. A brilliant, empowering book that shows children that they don't have to be helpless even in the face of the most bullying of adults.</p> <h2>The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett (Puffin, \u00a32.99)</h2> <p>Wonderful story about the disagreeable Mary Lennox who, after her parents die, is brought back from India to live in her uncle's great lonely house on the moors. Hodgson Burnett captures the fury of being a helpless, lonely child that makes both Mary and the invalid Colin behave badly. But neither it nor Hodgson Burnett's other classic A Little Princess (Puffin, \u00a32.99) are particularly easy reads. Eight-year-olds are likely to get frustrated by the sentence construction. Either read it to them or wait a couple of years.</p> <h2>Stig of the Dump by Clive King (Puffin, \u00a35.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719741\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/site_furniture/2000/04/14/stig.gif\" alt=\"Stig of the Dump\" width=\"128\" height=\"213\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Modern environmentally and health-conscious youngsters might eye the fox hunting and smoking with horror. But this story of Barney, a small boy who makes friends with a strange, Stone Age type boy he finds living in the local quarry, is enormously appealing. A really rollicking straightforward read that celebrates a strange friendship and the way two are better than one when it comes to taking on the bullies. Stig's puzzlement at the modern way of life makes the reader look at the world from a slightly different perspective.</p> <h2>Ballet Shoes by Noel Streatfield (Puffin Modern Classics, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Adopted as babies by Great Uncle Matthew, Pauline, Petrova and Posy lead a sheltered life until Great Uncle's disappearance leads to money troubles. The girls are enrolled in stage school so they will be able to earn a living. It all seems slightly quaint now, but Streatfield's characterisations are wonderfully vivid, the writing straightforward and honest and the narrative a page-turner. Quite delightful and infinitely more real than all those titles currently being churned out for ballet-mad little girls.</p> <h2>Mary Poppins by PL Travers (Collins, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>No spoonfuls of sugar are necessary to help this classic tale slip down. Jane and Michael's new nanny turns out to be the intimidating Mary Poppins, who brings a little magic into the lives of children in the Edwardian middle classes' equivalent of \"care\"</p> <h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by JK Rowling (Bloomsbury, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Yes, the Harry Potter books are derivative and hierarchical, but Rowling's a genuinely witty writer with a terrific gift for naming things: one of the great pleasures of these books is the way they present the wizarding world as a parallel universe to that of us poor muggles. What's more, they are real page-turners and appeal to boys and girls equally. The second in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is the weakest; the third, The Prisoner of Azkaban the best, not least because the Dementors are so truly terrifying. But these kinds of arguments are academic: I've yet to meet a child who is resistant and plenty of adults find them just as spellbinding. Eight upward, but younger brothers and sisters are liable to get in on the act earlier, particularly if you read it to them. There is also a really good unabridged audiocassette version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Cover to Cover, \u00a319.99) read by Stephen Fry. It runs to 8hours and 23minutes, which sure beats nine hours of I Spy.</p> <h2>Lizzie Dripping by Helen Cresswell (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Written in 1973, Cresswell's stories about life in a small Welsh village where Lizzie wanders the streets with her head in the clouds seem almost to come from another century. But while village life has changed out of all recognition, the emotions of Lizzie, who wants something exciting to happen in her life, who loves her soft dad and rather severe mum but keeps getting into scrapes and who meets a witch in the way other people run into the milkman, remain as fresh as a daisy.</p> <h2>The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goodge (OUP, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>A touch of romance and a shiver of fear are to be found in this 1946 Carnegie Medal-winning fantasy, set in the beautiful valley of Moonacre where the moon princess once ruled. Old-fashioned, but there is toughness beneath the whimsy. More for the girls than the boys.</p> <h2>The Borrowers by Mary Norton (Puffin Modern Classics, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>A classic that doesn't reduce the world - on the contrary, it opens it up - but which does view it from a child-sized perspective. It tells the story of a family of little people who live beneath the floorboards and borrow from \"human beans\" who don't even know they exist - until the young Arietty makes friends with \"the boy upstairs\". There is nothing in the slightest bit twee about it. Norton writes brilliantly, viewing the world as if through the eyes of her little people with a sense of wonder and terror. Even children who are addicts of the excellent but bastardised film version and the superb BBC serial version will gobble this up on the printed page.</p> <h2>Stonestruck by Helen Cresswell (Puffin \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Jessica loses her house in the blitz and is evacuated before the rest of her school to a huge Welsh castle with only the gardener and housekeeper for company. But she is not alone; the castle grounds are full of other mysterious presences including a ghostly boy, a sinister green lady, a screeching peacock and chains of desperate \"stonestruck\" children, engaged in a deadly game of tag with Jessica as the quarry. Cresswell writes with a spare, dense poetry about the desolation of separation, the isolating effect of unhappiness and the need to take care about what you wish. A really spellbinding piece of grown-up writing for children that makes the Goosebumps series pale into insignificance. Children who enjoy this will also devour Cresswell's Moondial (Puffin, \u00a34.99). It can be read alone at 10 upward, but both are very satisfying for adults to read to the 8-upward age range. In a different vein, but just as good, is Cresswell's Snatchers - the story of a girl whose guardian angel appears in the local park to protect her from the Land of the Starless Night. Liable to engender plenty of hilarious discussion about whether angels have belly buttons.</p> <h2>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Collins, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Yes, yes, we know. Ridiculously middle-class and old-fashioned and full of Christian imagery, the triumph of good over evil and being a jolly good sort. But really it is magic, provided you take care not to force it down your children's throats too early. Some of the sentence structure is quite difficult and you really need to be eight upward and a confident reader not to be put off. But it's like getting into the wardrobe in the first place: a bit tricky, but once you've made it through the door, utterly transforming. Of course this isn't actually the first in the series - The Magician's Nephew is - but this is where you should begin.</p> <h2>The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (Red Fox, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719738\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/site_furniture/2000/04/14/wolves.gif\" alt=\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\" width=\"128\" height=\"214\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Joan Aiken's classic adventure story is set during the imaginary reign of James III in the early part of the 19th century when the recently completed channel tunnel has allowed wolves to overrun large parts of Britain. A really rollicking story, with plenty of wild flights of the imagination, it has the essential ingredients of lost parents, an evil governess and two feisty cousins, Bonnie and Sylvia, determined to evade the clutches of the evil Miss Slighcarp. The good news for those with keen readers is that there are more than a dozen books in the Willoughby Chase sequence. The bad news is that although featuring the memorably stroppy heroine Dido Twite, some of the subsequent novels are off-puttingly obscure.</p> <h2>The Boggart by Susan Cooper (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Funny and tender storytelling from the excellent Susan Cooper. This one is about a boggart that is accidentally transported from his remote Scottish island to the bright lights of Toronto, and doesn't like it one bit. Bad-tempered things, boggarts.</p> <h2>The Peppermint Pig by Nina Bawden (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Life seemed grim when father lost his job and the family had to move to their aunt's home. But with the arrival of Johnnie the pig, things begin to improve. Really enjoyable story from a fine writer whose other books include the excellent Carrie's War (Puffin, \u00a34.99), about wartime evacuees, and Granny the Pag (Puffin, \u00a34.99), an enjoyable read about an unconventional Gran and her strong-minded granddaughter.</p> <h2>Five Children and It by E Nesbit (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Childhood is somehow golden in E Nesbit's stories about a family of children who discover a Psammead or sand fairy, a grumpy and very ancient creature that can give them wishes. The difficulty is of thinking of really good wishes and not getting things that they really don't want at all, and even the simplest of wishes seem to get them into great difficulties. This book is such fun that children want to gobble it down in one sitting and are absolutely amazed when you tell them it was written almost a century ago. It seems so fresh because it gets to the very heart of being a child - the wonderful sense that anything can happen to you and probably will. The adventures continue with The Story of the Amulet and The Phoenix and the Carpet (both Puffin, \u00a33.99).</p> <h2>Double Act by Jacqueline Wilson (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>To the average nine-year-old girl, Jacqueline Wilson's books are as desirable as a trip to Claire's Accessories and a pair of the latest fringed jeans. This story of ten-year-old identical twins Ruby and Garnet, who lose their mother and have to come to terms not only with their dad's new love but also with growing up and growing apart, is a model of Wilson's exuberant and confessional storytelling style, in which Ruby and Garnet take it in turns to tell the story. Wilson's books can be too obviously issue-driven to be really satisfying, but they are a stepping-stone into a real world where real kids face tough emotional problems. Plenty to choose from: we'd also recommend The Bed and Breakfast Star, The Story of Tracy Beaker and The Lottie Project (all Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99).</p> <h2>Watership Down by Richard Adams (Puffin, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Join Hazel and his brave band of rabbits as they set out in search of a new home. Richard Adams's modern classic is not fluffy or cute at all. In fact, it's so good that you completely forget after a while that we're talking rabbits, not humans.</p> <h2>The Runaways by Ruth Thomas (Red Fox, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>It is two children against the rest of the world in Thomas's riveting tale about Julia and Nathan, who win popularity at school when they find a stash of money in a deserted house, but soon decide to flee when teachers and parents want to know where it came from. Thomas writes from a child's point of view about what it feels like not to have a special friend and never to be picked when teams are being sorted. The unlikely friendship between Julia and Nathan is drawn with a delicacy that never ignores its difficulties and the final triumphant realisation that love is worth having is exhilarating.</p> <h2>Clockwork by Philip Pullman (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Macabre is the only word for Pullman's wonderfully creepy tale that, needless to say, runs like clockwork. In a way it is a parable about the power of storytelling itself. But it is also part fairytale, part ghost story and part science fiction; Pullman writes with a deceptive simplicity that makes the whole thing feel both ancient and very modern at the same time. There are some wonderfully witty picture asides, but is the narrative that really winds you up: a creepy tale in which a lazy apprentice clockmaker gets his comeuppance and a story being told on a dark winter's night suddenly takes on a sinister life of its own. If families still did that kind of thing, this would be the perfect novel to be read out loud around the fire. While roasting chestnuts, of course. Short enough to tempt even reluctant readers in the 9 upward age range, although those of a nervous disposition should probably wait a year or so or try Pullman's superb feminist adventure story, The Firework-Maker's Daughter (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99).</p> <h2>A Pack of Lies by Geraldine McCaughton (OUP, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719739\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/site_furniture/2000/04/14/packlies.gif\" alt=\"A Pack of Lies\" width=\"128\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Cleverly structured and wittily told series of stories that combine to make one satisfying whole as they tell of Ailsa, who sees the truth behind the yarns spun by the mysterious man who helps out in her mum's antique shop.</p> <h2>Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>I still can't pass a grandfather clock without thinking of this book, so strong an impression did this haunting story make on me as a child. Pearce's writing sends a shiver of both excitement and fear up the spine in this clever double time-framed story about Tom who, when the clock strikes 13, can see his aunt's house just as it was 50 years ago. Slightly younger readers will enjoy Pearce's A Dog So Small (Puffin \u00a34.99), about a boy who so longs for a dog that he conjures one up from his imagination.</p> <h2>What Katy Did by Susan Coolidge (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>North American classic about the irrepressible Katy who courts disaster and only starts to really grow up after she is paralysed in a fall from a swing.</p> <h2>The Silver Sword by Ian Serraillier (Puffin, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Based on a true story, Serraillier's book doesn't flinch in recounting the adventures of four children as they struggle to stay alive in Nazi-occupied Europe and their desperate, epic journey from Poland to Switzerland in search of their parents.</p> <h2>Skellig by David Almond (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>\"A story of love and faith, written with exquisite, heart-fluttering tenderness. It is an extraordinarily profound book, no matter what the age of the reader,\" was the verdict of the Whitbread judges who gave this the Children's Book of the Year Award. You can't disagree. An instant modern classic.</p> <h2>The Guardians by John Christopher (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-365719740\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/site_furniture/2000/04/14/guardians.gif\" alt=\"The Guardians\" width=\"128\" height=\"216\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Engrossing Guardian Award-winner from the early 1970s and set in the near future, which is nearer now than it was then. It is an atmospheric tale about Rob, on the run after the mysterious death of his dad, who crosses The Barrier and finds himself in a countryside that initially seems idyllic. So why is rebellion in the air?</p> <h2>The Tulip Touch by Ann Fine (Puffin \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Friendship proves dangerous in Fine's uncomfortable and genuinely powerful novel that carries with it echoes of the Jamie Bulger case. Natalie is attracted to the difficult, disturbed Tulip, perhaps because she seems so dangerous. But soon she is out of her depth as Tulip's games get increasingly out of control. Plenty of control, though, in Fine's delicate exploration of friendship, betrayal and guilt.</p> <h2>Wolf by Gillian Cross (OUP, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>At night Cassie dreams of wolves. They are coming to get her. But how can she be kept safe? When Cassie is sent without warning from her nan's to live with her feckless, beautiful mother she becomes easy prey until she finds a way of protecting herself. A really haunting novel from Gillian Cross, whose books The Demon Headmaster (Puffin, \u00a34.99) and The Great Elephant Chase (Puffin, \u00a34.99) will give equal pleasure.</p> <h2>Two Weeks With the Queen by Morris Gleitzmann (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>How many books for children deal with dying? How many deal with Aids? Morris Gleitzmann's does, and this hard-hitting Australian writer handles the subject with a surprising off-the-wall humour which ensures the book is moving and not at all mawkish. Colin refuses to believe that his younger brother is dying of cancer and decides to take things into his own hands. Then he meets a young man whose partner is dying of Aids, who helps him come to terms with living and losing.</p> <h2>Goggle-Eyes by Anne Fine (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Kitty Killin is not only a good storyteller but also the World's Greatest Expert when it comes to mums having new and unwanted boyfriends, particularly when there is a danger they may turn into new and unwanted stepfathers. Oddly touching story about Goggle-Eyes, the most unwanted boyfriend of them all, written in a knock-kneed prose that is funny and affecting.</p> <h2>Smith by Leon Garfield (Puffin Modern Classics, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Garfield's magnificent book was written in the 1960s, but has a Dickensian richness as it follows the adventures of Smith, a 12-year-old pickpocket living in the slums around St Paul's, who witnesses a murder and escapes with a document belonging to the victim. Hounded through London, befriended and betrayed, Smith eventually discovers that he has something of real value. Not an easy read if you are under eleven, but an enormously satisfying one. The vividness of Garfield's writing puts the blandness of many modern writers' prose in the shade.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is the age at which reading starts to get interesting, both for you and them. Around now most children will be reading fluently on their own and will start to develop their own distinct taste in books, although, like aliens, yo-yos and skipping, particular writers go in and out of fashion in the playground. It would, however, be a pity if you and your children stopped reading together at this point. You will both miss the closeness, and you will also miss some really good stories. This is the moment when your childhood reading and that of your own children's meet and meld as you introduce them to E. Nesbit and Phillipa Pearce and they take you on flights of the imagination with Philip Ridley and JK Rowling. As every parent with children in this age range knows, a thorough grounding in the rules of quidditch is essential if you are to have any meaningful conversation with your children. A word of warning. Take care when trying to introduce the books you loved or think you loved as a child to your own. Often your memory will be hazy as to exactly what age you were when you read it - you were almost certainly older than you think. There is sometimes a density to the writing of many of the older classics, which can be very satisfying, but which can also be a turn-off to a generation raised on the Oxford Reading Tree and Ginn. They will probably be appreciated in time, but read them The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in the cradle and they'll firmly slam the door shut on you. Every child is different in their reading ability and their interests, and parents need to take their cue from the child. Remember, a book which sports the label \"classic\" isn't intrinsically better for your children than one which does not. Books are not medicine to be forced down; they should be fun, exciting doorways into other worlds and different feelings and points of view. The best books for this age group do not inform children about the world, but present it to them as a transformation. Best books. What does that mean? Between 8-11 there is no such thing as a bad book, it is the habit of reading that counts. Don't get prissy and ban Enid Blyton. The child who thrills to the adventure of The Secret of Killimoon is only a step away from the excitement of Philip Ridley's Kasper in the Glitter. For some children this is also the age when books become friends, the same one consumed over and over in the same way that a teenager will play the same track on a new CD over and over. Assume, if this is the case, that the child is getting something crucial from it in the same way that the child who demands cheese three times a day for a week is probably unconsciously seeking some essential nutrient. At this age, books can be the most satisfying food in the world. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Walker, \u00a314.99) A very modern \"Alice\" for the modern child that dusts off the Victorian fustiness of the book. Some adults will regret this approach and the passing of the dark Tenniel drawings but this is a perfect introduction to the story for younger readers and while Oxenbury's fresh as a daisy illustrations make the story completely accessible they certainly don't Disneyfy it in any way. Rumpelstiltskin and Other Grimm Tales by Carol Ann Duffy, illustrated by Marketa Prachaticka (Faber, \u00a38.99) These are familiar stories such as Snow White, Ashputtel and Little Redcap told with a poet's voice. They are bare, spare, and stripped down to the bone so that the story itself stands out like a skeleton. It was Duffy's versions of the tales that were used by the Young Vic for its outstanding Grimm Tales. Reading the stories makes you aware how much the theatrical style sprung from Duffy's gleaming, hard words. The Indian in the Cupboard by Lynne Reid Banks (Collins Modern Classics, \u00a35.99) On his ninth birthday, Omri receives many gifts including a much-wanted skateboard. Less desired are the old cupboard given to him by his brother and the three-inch tall plastic Indian given to him by his friend Patrick. But it is the latter two gifts that prove best of all for when the Indian is put in the cupboard and the key is turned he comes to life. Little Bull turns out to be everything you could wish from an Indian - proud, fearless and defiant. But as Omri soon discovers being responsible for another person isn't easy, particularly when they don't always behave as you might expect or wish. This is a wonderful, very readable book in which our responsibilities to each other are explored through an entertaining story. The Children of Green Knowe by Lucy Boston (Faber, \u00a34.99) Tolly's great grandmother's house is full of a very special kind of magic. There are other children living there, children who were happy there many centuries before. Boston's novel really does conjure up all the magic of childhood for a new generation in this smart reissue of the 1961 Carnegie winner. Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by TS Eliot, illustrated by Edward Gorey (Faber, \u00a39.99) Essential for reading out loud as a family, TS Eliot's felines are a wonderfully mysterious capricious and amusing group of must-have moggies. Cult American artist Edward Gorey adds more mischief with his illustrations. Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Just when you're feeling down, the homework is piling up and life seems a grind and not fun, you need a dose of Pippi Longstocking, the irrepressible little girl who doesn't live by the rules and creates a wonderful fantasy world for herself and her friends. This is a marvellous, stimulating book that is brilliant for children who've had the individuality bashed out of them by school. The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley (Puffin, \u00a33.99) Abridged - and all the better for it - version of the classic Victorian tale of chimney sweeps featuring Mrs Do As You Would Be Done By and other morality figures. Of course it is stiff and old-fashioned, but there is also a kind of enchantment about it that survives changes in life and attitudes. Please Mrs Butler by Allan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a33.99) A child's school day told in verse through from going to school to bedtime. That doesn't make it sound all that interesting, but Ahlberg's easy-to-read poems are funny, sad and absolutely accurate when it comes to emotion. From the title poem about a teacher at the end of her tether, through the pinickety parent complaining about her son's lost possessions to the quietly devastating Small Quarrel, this is a brilliant collection that not only makes children love poetry but gets them writing their own. The Haunting by Margaret Mahy (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Carnegie award-winning novel about Barney who one \"ordinary Wednesday\" finds that \"the world tilted and ran downhill in all directions.\" Barney is being haunted but who is making the insistent ghostly footsteps in his mind? And why do his sisters' attempts to unravel the mystery lead to a crisis that almost topples the entire family? Mahy's attractively simple storytelling style will attract even the most reluctant readers and creates a convincing portrait of a family tipped out of kilter by the keeping of secrets. Thunder and Lightnings by Jan Mark (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Victor was the oddest boy Andrew had ever met. How could he be so dim in school, and yet know so much about aeroplanes? But then, as Andrew starts to slowly appreciate, appearances can be very deceptive indeed and we all have our own strategies for survival. Smartly written, very enjoyable story about friendship and the differences between us all. Particularly good for boys. The Snow Spider by Jenny Nimmo (Mammoth, \u00a34.99) Gwyn's granny gives him five strange birthday gifts including a twisted metal brooch. Gywn gives the brooch to the wind and in return is sent the snow spider who weaves a silken web. Inside the web sits a girl who Gwyn knows but cannot place. Nimmo's book deftly mixes magic and mourning, the ordinary and the other-worldly in this story of a lost sister, a battle of good against evil and the value of knowing the place where you belong. The House of Rats by Stephen Elboz (OUP, \u00a33.99) Elboz is one of the best writers around at the moment, crafting his stories with amazing depth and using words with wit and brilliance. This 1992 Smarties Award winner tells of four children who suddenly find their safe life disappearing as the mysterious house where they are living is taken over and wolves howl outside. Only when they meet one of the \"Rats\" do they find a way to escape. The Wreck of the Zanzibar by Michael Morpurgo (Mammoth, \u00a34.50) It is 1907, life on the Scilly Isles is bleak and difficult and it seems likely that Laura and her father will be forced to retreat to the mainland. Even the cow stops milking. Morpurgo's book is written with his customary quiet authority as it charts the battle between man and nature and the cruelties and beauties of the sea and its creatures. A Dog So Small by Phillipa Pearce (Puffin, \u00a34.99) The longing, the sadness, the sense of otherness and the exhilaration of childhood are brought vividly to life in this story of Ben, a boy who so much wants a dog he conjures one up out of his imagination. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (Faber, \u00a34.99) Russell Hoban's book is a brilliant modern fairytale about a father and son toy mouse who dance under a Christmas tree until they break the ancient clockwork rules and are themselves broken. Discarded, they are rescued from a dustbin and repaired by a tramp before setting out on a dangerous quest to find a home of their own. A crackling read, full of Hoban's sly humour and his belief in the importance of having a place of your own and being happy. The Finders by Nigel Hinton (Puffin, \u00a33.99) Walking across the park one morning, Rosie encounters a frail old man who asks her to post a package for him. Little does our heroine know that it contains the Djinn star whose evil magic threatens to take her over. Only the Finders can help her. Hinton's book, a pacy, well-plotted novel is a really good introduction to more adult reading for nine year olds and above. The Illustrated Mum by Jacqueline Wilson (Corgi, \u00a33.99) Wilson's best book to date is a no-holds bar account of the mental breakdown of Marigold, mother to Star and Dolphin and covered from head to toe in tattoos. For years the girls have persuaded themselves that life with mum is a gas (except when she goes weird) but now they are growing up and looking at the world and mum with new eyes. This is a wonderful, perceptive and disturbing book about mental illness, irresponsible parenthood and the falling out of love of children with their parents. Wilson holds true to the very end, offering no happy-ever-afters but plenty of possibilities instead. King of the Shadows by Susan Cooper (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Shakespeare's London is brought vividly to life in cleverly written novel that sees young actor Nat Field slipping back 400 years in time to find himself playing Puck at the Globe Theatre in 1599. Playing opposite him is the King of the Shadows himself, William Shakespeare. Worth a hundred history lessons, Cooper's novel combines thriller-like suspense with a story of theatrical and personal transformations. Haroun and the Sea of Stories by Salman Rushdie (Granta, \u00a36.99) Think the Arabian Nights. Think Alice in Wonderland. Think Star Wars. You can think a lot about Rushdie's story about a boy's quest to restore the gift of storytelling to his father, but you'll probably be too busy enjoying it. This is a dense, fantastical book, in which the comic rubs shoulders with evil and the savage with the lyrical. Lovely. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (Puffin, \u00a34.99) The first book in Le Guin's deep, dense and utterly brilliant Earthsea series, a fantasy sequence that is to Terry Prachett what double cream is to skim milk. Le Guin writes with a calm authority, almost a stillness, as she charts the story of the young wizard Sparrowhawk who misuses magic and unleashes an evil shadow-beast who threatens his land. Only Sparrowhawk can destroy it, but the journey is long and difficult and takes him to the farthest corner of Earthsea. The Rinaldi Ring by Jenny Nimmo (Mammoth \u00a34.99) Eliot is finding it hard to come to terms with his mother's death. But then he finds a ghost in his bedroom who has her own grief to deal with. Nimmo's beautifully written and understated novel is about the way the past makes its imprint upon the present and the subtle interconnections of both history and family relationships. A Voyage of Discovery 1: From the Land of the Amazons to the Indigo Isles by Francois Place (Pavillion, \u00a312.99) Francois Place is an artist, an author, a dreamer and the inventor of strange, fantastical countries and legends that he realises through fly-away prose and exquisite pen pictures. It is like being taken on an amazing off-beat adventure by a 19th century explorer. This is a must-have book for the dreamer in every child, a book to awaken curiosity and the imagination. The Ghost Drum by Susan Price (Faber \u00a33.50) Imagine a country where night lasted an entire winter and where in the darkness danger stalks. Price conjures a world of magic and danger to tell this modern, mythic fairytale about a boy imprisoned in a tower whose cries for help are heard by the witch-girl, Chingis. If they like this try the equally enthralling Ghost Dance and Ghost Song. Walkabout by James Vance Marshall (Puffin, \u00a33.99) A culture clash of epic proportions ensues in this classic novel that sees two privileged English kids abandoned in the Australian outback and forced to fend for themselves. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl (Puffin Modern Classic, \u00a35.99) Truly scrumptious tale of a boy called Charlie Bucket who wins a golden ticket, entitling him to a day out at Willy Wonka's miraculous chocolate factory. The real question about this book is how long you'll be able to hold off before reading it to your kids. Dahl's wonderfully evil sense of humour makes what could simply be a modern version of the cautionary tale into something exceptional. The writing sizzles, foams, spits and bubbles over. Wild and wonderful. Read it to them from six; read it alone from eight. Follow with Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, James and the Giant Peach and the BFG (all Puffin \u00a35.99) The Earth Giant by Melvin Burgess (Puffin, \u00a33.99) As a great storm rages around their house, Amy and Peter hear a terrible noise like a dying giant. Amy knows that the sound is an ancient oak tree half a mile away being ripped from the ground. Trapped among its roots is a secret that only she can uncover. Beautifully wrought story about the way secrets bring you together and tear you apart, and about the competitive relationship between a brother and sister from a fine writer best known for his brilliant books for teenagers. Woof! By Allan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Highly entertaining book about Eric, a perfectly ordinary boy, who feels his nose becoming cold and wet and his ears becoming floppy as he is transformed into a dog. In its own schoolboyish way Eric's transformation is just as interesting and surreal as that of poor Gregor Samsa into a beetle. Matilda by Roald Dahl (Puffin, \u00a34.99) The Roald Dahl must-read for this age-group; they'll find it impossible to resist even if they are hooked on the Danny Devito film version. In fact, seeing the film leads naturally into wanting to read the story of the remarkable Matilda, ignored and derided by her parents and bullied by the odious teacher Miss Trunchbull, who not only has a brilliant mind but strange kinetic powers. A brilliant, empowering book that shows children that they don't have to be helpless even in the face of the most bullying of adults. The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett (Puffin, \u00a32.99) Wonderful story about the disagreeable Mary Lennox who, after her parents die, is brought back from India to live in her uncle's great lonely house on the moors. Hodgson Burnett captures the fury of being a helpless, lonely child that makes both Mary and the invalid Colin behave badly. But neither it nor Hodgson Burnett's other classic A Little Princess (Puffin, \u00a32.99) are particularly easy reads. Eight-year-olds are likely to get frustrated by the sentence construction. Either read it to them or wait a couple of years. Stig of the Dump by Clive King (Puffin, \u00a35.99) Modern environmentally and health-conscious youngsters might eye the fox hunting and smoking with horror. But this story of Barney, a small boy who makes friends with a strange, Stone Age type boy he finds living in the local quarry, is enormously appealing. A really rollicking straightforward read that celebrates a strange friendship and the way two are better than one when it comes to taking on the bullies. Stig's puzzlement at the modern way of life makes the reader look at the world from a slightly different perspective. Ballet Shoes by Noel Streatfield (Puffin Modern Classics, \u00a35.99) Adopted as babies by Great Uncle Matthew, Pauline, Petrova and Posy lead a sheltered life until Great Uncle's disappearance leads to money troubles. The girls are enrolled in stage school so they will be able to earn a living. It all seems slightly quaint now, but Streatfield's characterisations are wonderfully vivid, the writing straightforward and honest and the narrative a page-turner. Quite delightful and infinitely more real than all those titles currently being churned out for ballet-mad little girls. Mary Poppins by PL Travers (Collins, \u00a35.99) No spoonfuls of sugar are necessary to help this classic tale slip down. Jane and Michael's new nanny turns out to be the intimidating Mary Poppins, who brings a little magic into the lives of children in the Edwardian middle classes' equivalent of \"care\" Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by JK Rowling (Bloomsbury, \u00a34.99) Yes, the Harry Potter books are derivative and hierarchical, but Rowling's a genuinely witty writer with a terrific gift for naming things: one of the great pleasures of these books is the way they present the wizarding world as a parallel universe to that of us poor muggles. What's more, they are real page-turners and appeal to boys and girls equally. The second in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is the weakest; the third, The Prisoner of Azkaban the best, not least because the Dementors are so truly terrifying. But these kinds of arguments are academic: I've yet to meet a child who is resistant and plenty of adults find them just as spellbinding. Eight upward, but younger brothers and sisters are liable to get in on the act earlier, particularly if you read it to them. There is also a really good unabridged audiocassette version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Cover to Cover, \u00a319.99) read by Stephen Fry. It runs to 8hours and 23minutes, which sure beats nine hours of I Spy. Lizzie Dripping by Helen Cresswell (Puffin, \u00a33.99) Written in 1973, Cresswell's stories about life in a small Welsh village where Lizzie wanders the streets with her head in the clouds seem almost to come from another century. But while village life has changed out of all recognition, the emotions of Lizzie, who wants something exciting to happen in her life, who loves her soft dad and rather severe mum but keeps getting into scrapes and who meets a witch in the way other people run into the milkman, remain as fresh as a daisy. The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goodge (OUP, \u00a34.99) A touch of romance and a shiver of fear are to be found in this 1946 Carnegie Medal-winning fantasy, set in the beautiful valley of Moonacre where the moon princess once ruled. Old-fashioned, but there is toughness beneath the whimsy. More for the girls than the boys. The Borrowers by Mary Norton (Puffin Modern Classics, \u00a35.99) A classic that doesn't reduce the world - on the contrary, it opens it up - but which does view it from a child-sized perspective. It tells the story of a family of little people who live beneath the floorboards and borrow from \"human beans\" who don't even know they exist - until the young Arietty makes friends with \"the boy upstairs\". There is nothing in the slightest bit twee about it. Norton writes brilliantly, viewing the world as if through the eyes of her little people with a sense of wonder and terror. Even children who are addicts of the excellent but bastardised film version and the superb BBC serial version will gobble this up on the printed page. Stonestruck by Helen Cresswell (Puffin \u00a34.99) Jessica loses her house in the blitz and is evacuated before the rest of her school to a huge Welsh castle with only the gardener and housekeeper for company. But she is not alone; the castle grounds are full of other mysterious presences including a ghostly boy, a sinister green lady, a screeching peacock and chains of desperate \"stonestruck\" children, engaged in a deadly game of tag with Jessica as the quarry. Cresswell writes with a spare, dense poetry about the desolation of separation, the isolating effect of unhappiness and the need to take care about what you wish. A really spellbinding piece of grown-up writing for children that makes the Goosebumps series pale into insignificance. Children who enjoy this will also devour Cresswell's Moondial (Puffin, \u00a34.99). It can be read alone at 10 upward, but both are very satisfying for adults to read to the 8-upward age range. In a different vein, but just as good, is Cresswell's Snatchers - the story of a girl whose guardian angel appears in the local park to protect her from the Land of the Starless Night. Liable to engender plenty of hilarious discussion about whether angels have belly buttons. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Collins, \u00a33.99) Yes, yes, we know. Ridiculously middle-class and old-fashioned and full of Christian imagery, the triumph of good over evil and being a jolly good sort. But really it is magic, provided you take care not to force it down your children's throats too early. Some of the sentence structure is quite difficult and you really need to be eight upward and a confident reader not to be put off. But it's like getting into the wardrobe in the first place: a bit tricky, but once you've made it through the door, utterly transforming. Of course this isn't actually the first in the series - The Magician's Nephew is - but this is where you should begin. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (Red Fox, \u00a33.99) Joan Aiken's classic adventure story is set during the imaginary reign of James III in the early part of the 19th century when the recently completed channel tunnel has allowed wolves to overrun large parts of Britain. A really rollicking story, with plenty of wild flights of the imagination, it has the essential ingredients of lost parents, an evil governess and two feisty cousins, Bonnie and Sylvia, determined to evade the clutches of the evil Miss Slighcarp. The good news for those with keen readers is that there are more than a dozen books in the Willoughby Chase sequence. The bad news is that although featuring the memorably stroppy heroine Dido Twite, some of the subsequent novels are off-puttingly obscure. The Boggart by Susan Cooper (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Funny and tender storytelling from the excellent Susan Cooper. This one is about a boggart that is accidentally transported from his remote Scottish island to the bright lights of Toronto, and doesn't like it one bit. Bad-tempered things, boggarts. The Peppermint Pig by Nina Bawden (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Life seemed grim when father lost his job and the family had to move to their aunt's home. But with the arrival of Johnnie the pig, things begin to improve. Really enjoyable story from a fine writer whose other books include the excellent Carrie's War (Puffin, \u00a34.99), about wartime evacuees, and Granny the Pag (Puffin, \u00a34.99), an enjoyable read about an unconventional Gran and her strong-minded granddaughter. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (Puffin, \u00a33.99) Childhood is somehow golden in E Nesbit's stories about a family of children who discover a Psammead or sand fairy, a grumpy and very ancient creature that can give them wishes. The difficulty is of thinking of really good wishes and not getting things that they really don't want at all, and even the simplest of wishes seem to get them into great difficulties. This book is such fun that children want to gobble it down in one sitting and are absolutely amazed when you tell them it was written almost a century ago. It seems so fresh because it gets to the very heart of being a child - the wonderful sense that anything can happen to you and probably will. The adventures continue with The Story of the Amulet and The Phoenix and the Carpet (both Puffin, \u00a33.99). Double Act by Jacqueline Wilson (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99) To the average nine-year-old girl, Jacqueline Wilson's books are as desirable as a trip to Claire's Accessories and a pair of the latest fringed jeans. This story of ten-year-old identical twins Ruby and Garnet, who lose their mother and have to come to terms not only with their dad's new love but also with growing up and growing apart, is a model of Wilson's exuberant and confessional storytelling style, in which Ruby and Garnet take it in turns to tell the story. Wilson's books can be too obviously issue-driven to be really satisfying, but they are a stepping-stone into a real world where real kids face tough emotional problems. Plenty to choose from: we'd also recommend The Bed and Breakfast Star, The Story of Tracy Beaker and The Lottie Project (all Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99). Watership Down by Richard Adams (Puffin, \u00a35.99) Join Hazel and his brave band of rabbits as they set out in search of a new home. Richard Adams's modern classic is not fluffy or cute at all. In fact, it's so good that you completely forget after a while that we're talking rabbits, not humans. The Runaways by Ruth Thomas (Red Fox, \u00a33.99) It is two children against the rest of the world in Thomas's riveting tale about Julia and Nathan, who win popularity at school when they find a stash of money in a deserted house, but soon decide to flee when teachers and parents want to know where it came from. Thomas writes from a child's point of view about what it feels like not to have a special friend and never to be picked when teams are being sorted. The unlikely friendship between Julia and Nathan is drawn with a delicacy that never ignores its difficulties and the final triumphant realisation that love is worth having is exhilarating. Clockwork by Philip Pullman (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99) Macabre is the only word for Pullman's wonderfully creepy tale that, needless to say, runs like clockwork. In a way it is a parable about the power of storytelling itself. But it is also part fairytale, part ghost story and part science fiction; Pullman writes with a deceptive simplicity that makes the whole thing feel both ancient and very modern at the same time. There are some wonderfully witty picture asides, but is the narrative that really winds you up: a creepy tale in which a lazy apprentice clockmaker gets his comeuppance and a story being told on a dark winter's night suddenly takes on a sinister life of its own. If families still did that kind of thing, this would be the perfect novel to be read out loud around the fire. While roasting chestnuts, of course. Short enough to tempt even reluctant readers in the 9 upward age range, although those of a nervous disposition should probably wait a year or so or try Pullman's superb feminist adventure story, The Firework-Maker's Daughter (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99). A Pack of Lies by Geraldine McCaughton (OUP, \u00a33.99) Cleverly structured and wittily told series of stories that combine to make one satisfying whole as they tell of Ailsa, who sees the truth behind the yarns spun by the mysterious man who helps out in her mum's antique shop. Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (Puffin, \u00a34.99) I still can't pass a grandfather clock without thinking of this book, so strong an impression did this haunting story make on me as a child. Pearce's writing sends a shiver of both excitement and fear up the spine in this clever double time-framed story about Tom who, when the clock strikes 13, can see his aunt's house just as it was 50 years ago. Slightly younger readers will enjoy Pearce's A Dog So Small (Puffin \u00a34.99), about a boy who so longs for a dog that he conjures one up from his imagination. What Katy Did by Susan Coolidge (Puffin, \u00a33.99) North American classic about the irrepressible Katy who courts disaster and only starts to really grow up after she is paralysed in a fall from a swing. The Silver Sword by Ian Serraillier (Puffin, \u00a35.99) Based on a true story, Serraillier's book doesn't flinch in recounting the adventures of four children as they struggle to stay alive in Nazi-occupied Europe and their desperate, epic journey from Poland to Switzerland in search of their parents. Skellig by David Almond (Hodder, \u00a34.99) \"A story of love and faith, written with exquisite, heart-fluttering tenderness. It is an extraordinarily profound book, no matter what the age of the reader,\" was the verdict of the Whitbread judges who gave this the Children's Book of the Year Award. You can't disagree. An instant modern classic. The Guardians by John Christopher (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Engrossing Guardian Award-winner from the early 1970s and set in the near future, which is nearer now than it was then. It is an atmospheric tale about Rob, on the run after the mysterious death of his dad, who crosses The Barrier and finds himself in a countryside that initially seems idyllic. So why is rebellion in the air? The Tulip Touch by Ann Fine (Puffin \u00a34.99) Friendship proves dangerous in Fine's uncomfortable and genuinely powerful novel that carries with it echoes of the Jamie Bulger case. Natalie is attracted to the difficult, disturbed Tulip, perhaps because she seems so dangerous. But soon she is out of her depth as Tulip's games get increasingly out of control. Plenty of control, though, in Fine's delicate exploration of friendship, betrayal and guilt. Wolf by Gillian Cross (OUP, \u00a35.99) At night Cassie dreams of wolves. They are coming to get her. But how can she be kept safe? When Cassie is sent without warning from her nan's to live with her feckless, beautiful mother she becomes easy prey until she finds a way of protecting herself. A really haunting novel from Gillian Cross, whose books The Demon Headmaster (Puffin, \u00a34.99) and The Great Elephant Chase (Puffin, \u00a34.99) will give equal pleasure. Two Weeks With the Queen by Morris Gleitzmann (Puffin, \u00a33.99) How many books for children deal with dying? How many deal with Aids? Morris Gleitzmann's does, and this hard-hitting Australian writer handles the subject with a surprising off-the-wall humour which ensures the book is moving and not at all mawkish. Colin refuses to believe that his younger brother is dying of cancer and decides to take things into his own hands. Then he meets a young man whose partner is dying of Aids, who helps him come to terms with living and losing. Goggle-Eyes by Anne Fine (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Kitty Killin is not only a good storyteller but also the World's Greatest Expert when it comes to mums having new and unwanted boyfriends, particularly when there is a danger they may turn into new and unwanted stepfathers. Oddly touching story about Goggle-Eyes, the most unwanted boyfriend of them all, written in a knock-kneed prose that is funny and affecting. Smith by Leon Garfield (Puffin Modern Classics, \u00a35.99) Garfield's magnificent book was written in the 1960s, but has a Dickensian richness as it follows the adventures of Smith, a 12-year-old pickpocket living in the slums around St Paul's, who witnesses a murder and escapes with a document belonging to the victim. Hounded through London, befriended and betrayed, Smith eventually discovers that he has something of real value. Not an easy read if you are under eleven, but an enormously satisfying one. The vividness of Garfield's writing puts the blandness of many modern writers' prose in the shade.",

When they left the restaurant this poor girl not only slipped up in a pile of dog poo, but also fell back in it, smearing it all over her new frock. You can imagine the devastating effect this awful occurrence caused to their plans of continuing to enjoy their evening together. Some of it was on her hair. Please, dog owners, pick it up, put it in a bin, because one of you ruined a beautiful relationship by being thoughtless. Victor House The Bath Chronicle",

The director's latest movie, Erin Brockovich, is wowing audiences all over America, and meanwhile Soderbergh is firming up plans for his next project, Traffic. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the indie auteur admitted that he considered casting Julia Roberts - who stars in Erin Brockovich - in his upcoming drug trade saga, Traffic, but he found he just couldn't do it. \"I [told her] 'It would require you to extinguish everything that I find compelling about you,'\" Soderbergh says. \"It's unimaginable to me to cast her [in a somber] role, when her gift is her life force and that really makes you want to watch.\" Soderbergh's also been talking to Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News about his future plans. Knowles is eager to confirm casting rumours that surround the remake of Ocean's Eleven, another Soderbergh project. The word, straight from the horse's mouth, is that George Clooney is definitely committed, and Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Michael Douglas and Don Cheadle are \"looking hopeful\". Bill Murray is considering an offer, as is Mark Wahlberg, who might consider it a bonus to work with Clooney again.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On Tuesday the Daily Mail - the newspaper refugees love to read - carried a story that was inaccurate in almost every detail. Under the headline \"Beryl's latest fiction\", reporter Lucie Morris revealed that Beryl Bainbridge had upset the erudite audience at the King's Lynn literary festival by choosing the masterpiece As Flies to Wanton Boys by Rhoda L Cornstock as her favourite novel. Far from being upset, the people in the auditorium laughed immoderately as Beryl, Michael Holroyd and I discussed the peculiar merits of Rhoda F Comstock, to give her back her proper name, in rapturous terms. Michael spoke glowingly of Rhoda's handwriting, and was particularly appreciative of her \"exquisite margins\". Beryl, who can be squeamish about sexual matters, asked me to explain the plot. As Flies, I said, is a \"subtle study of rural incest\". In Morris's hands \"rural\" became \"royal\" - a ploy, perhaps, to enrage the easily enraged flag-waving Mail readers, for whom the Windsors are sacrosanct. The sad truth is that the twins in Rhoda's book are about as rural, or rustic, as you can get. Rhoda is a lifelong devotee of Thomas Hardy, which is why Corin and Chloe are as doomed as Jude or Tess, if not more. </p> <p>Does Rhoda exist? Ten years ago, Beryl and I would have answered the question which no one had asked with a decisive \"Of course not\". Today we are no longer confident that Rhoda is the earnest novelist I dreamed up one afternoon in a moment of silliness. She first wrote to Beryl in about 1980, via me, anxious for advice on how to cure her \"blockage\". The novel she was writing, When I Do Count the Clock, had stopped in mid-sentence on page 520 and was refusing to move. What, Rhoda wondered, could Beryl suggest? Beryl's reply was compassionate, but to the point: \"Press onwards if you can, and if you can't, don't.\" Rhoda abandoned her \"Proustian miscarriage\" and embarked on Throw Physic to the Dogs, a Joycean day-in-the-life saga of a harassed vet practising in Rhoda's native East Clyst in Devon. This, too, was abandoned, though Beryl was quick to praise the scene in which Jake calms a deranged greyhound with a smile and a biscuit. </p> <p>I made Rhoda a resident of East Clyst after reading an untitled novel which had been sent to my then publisher, Jonathan Cape. The author called himself or herself S Tipping. The opening chapter had several women taking tea at the vicarage. It reminded me of Barbara Pym, but without her wonderful beadiness of perception. All thoughts of Pym vanished with the arrival of the vicar, who dropped his trousers and said: \"Don't all start at once\" or something similar. The story became muckier and muckier, and the rather tatty typescript was returned to S Tipping at an address in East Clyst. Within weeks, I had made S Tipping and Rhoda the stars of the East Clyst literary and debating society, with Rhoda outshining her rival by attracting the attention of Beryl Bainbridge. </p> <p>Beryl introduced other East Clystians into our correspondence. The unfrocked clergyman, Reg, was like a character from her early novels. He had a milk round before he was drummed out of Devon. Rhoda bore him a daughter, who is called Dot Comstock. In spite of the domestic problems she had to endure, Rhoda persevered with her uncompromising fiction. Sweet Fortune's Minion, set in a merchant bank in the 80s, won Beryl's admiration for its \"thrusting satire\", while It Is My Only Suit, about a waif left to fend for himself in an unnamed city \"somewhere in Europe\", moved her to \"uncontrollable depths of primitive emotion\".

It was with some trepidation (a typical Rhoda phrase) that she opened the door to the postman the following Wednesday. \"It weighs a bloody ton, Miss Bainbridge,\" he said, as he handed her the manuscript of Rhoda's novel. \"I'm out of breath and no mistake, and I'll take a medicinal whisky if you can spare it.\" She could spare it, and the postman went on his way in a happier mood. </p> <p>The address on the title page of As Flies to Wanton Boys turned out to be bogus, too. Yet the book is undeniably there, even as it's collecting dust in Beryl's attic. I think I understand why she mentioned Rhoda at King's Lynn. I think she wants Rhoda to declare herself, to come forward and say: \"I am the Rhoda F Comstock who wrote, with every fibre of her being, As Flies to Wanton Boys.\" I can only aid Beryl in a search that, we hope, will not be fruitless. If Rhoda is a Guardian reader, will she please respond? What started as a harmless tease by a writer who loves daft invented titles - like Profiles in String by X Trapnel and I Stopped at a Chemist by Ada Leintwardine, in Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time - is now becoming a surreal nightmare. </p> <p>The piece by Lucie Morris, in which a \"54-year-old man who refused to be named\" accused Beryl, Michael and me of patronising the audience and making them \"feel stupid\", could have been instigated by a vengeful Rhoda.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday the Daily Mail - the newspaper refugees love to read - carried a story that was inaccurate in almost every detail. Under the headline \"Beryl's latest fiction\", reporter Lucie Morris revealed that Beryl Bainbridge had upset the erudite audience at the King's Lynn literary festival by choosing the masterpiece As Flies to Wanton Boys by Rhoda L Cornstock as her favourite novel. Far from being upset, the people in the auditorium laughed immoderately as Beryl, Michael Holroyd and I discussed the peculiar merits of Rhoda F Comstock, to give her back her proper name, in rapturous terms. Michael spoke glowingly of Rhoda's handwriting, and was particularly appreciative of her \"exquisite margins\". Beryl, who can be squeamish about sexual matters, asked me to explain the plot. As Flies, I said, is a \"subtle study of rural incest\". In Morris's hands \"rural\" became \"royal\" - a ploy, perhaps, to enrage the easily enraged flag-waving Mail readers, for whom the Windsors are sacrosanct. The sad truth is that the twins in Rhoda's book are about as rural, or rustic, as you can get. Rhoda is a lifelong devotee of Thomas Hardy, which is why Corin and Chloe are as doomed as Jude or Tess, if not more. Does Rhoda exist? Ten years ago, Beryl and I would have answered the question which no one had asked with a decisive \"Of course not\". Today we are no longer confident that Rhoda is the earnest novelist I dreamed up one afternoon in a moment of silliness. She first wrote to Beryl in about 1980, via me, anxious for advice on how to cure her \"blockage\". The novel she was writing, When I Do Count the Clock, had stopped in mid-sentence on page 520 and was refusing to move. What, Rhoda wondered, could Beryl suggest? Beryl's reply was compassionate, but to the point: \"Press onwards if you can, and if you can't, don't.\" Rhoda abandoned her \"Proustian miscarriage\" and embarked on Throw Physic to the Dogs, a Joycean day-in-the-life saga of a harassed vet practising in Rhoda's native East Clyst in Devon. This, too, was abandoned, though Beryl was quick to praise the scene in which Jake calms a deranged greyhound with a smile and a biscuit. I made Rhoda a resident of East Clyst after reading an untitled novel which had been sent to my then publisher, Jonathan Cape. The author called himself or herself S Tipping. The opening chapter had several women taking tea at the vicarage. It reminded me of Barbara Pym, but without her wonderful beadiness of perception. All thoughts of Pym vanished with the arrival of the vicar, who dropped his trousers and said: \"Don't all start at once\" or something similar. The story became muckier and muckier, and the rather tatty typescript was returned to S Tipping at an address in East Clyst. Within weeks, I had made S Tipping and Rhoda the stars of the East Clyst literary and debating society, with Rhoda outshining her rival by attracting the attention of Beryl Bainbridge. Beryl introduced other East Clystians into our correspondence. The unfrocked clergyman, Reg, was like a character from her early novels. He had a milk round before he was drummed out of Devon. Rhoda bore him a daughter, who is called Dot Comstock. In spite of the domestic problems she had to endure, Rhoda persevered with her uncompromising fiction. Sweet Fortune's Minion, set in a merchant bank in the 80s, won Beryl's admiration for its \"thrusting satire\", while It Is My Only Suit, about a waif left to fend for himself in an unnamed city \"somewhere in Europe\", moved her to \"uncontrollable depths of primitive emotion\". Rhoda was \"getting there, by degrees\". It was then that the real Rhoda, if there is such a person, intervened. Beryl had a weekly column in the Evening Standard at the time, and she often referred to her friends Se\u00f1or Bailey and Miss Rubens (Bernice of that ilk). In an article devoted to the verifiable fact that I had been mugged by an aggressive nun at Rome airport, she disclosed that I was helping an unpublished writer, Rhoda F Comstock, to get into print.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>While he is rarely given to self-doubt, one scene in his impending second feature, Bleeder, troubles Nicolas Winding Refn. It goes like this: a guy walks into a Copenhagen video store in search of porn. Until, that is, he finds himself waylaid by the blank-faced guy behind the counter, impassively namechecking the shop's contents. </p> <p>\"Fritz Lang,\" announces the clerk, scanning shelf on shelf of grubby boxes. </p> <p>\"Sergio Leone, Scorsese, Sergio Corbucci. George Romero, Lucio Fulci, Sam Peckinpah, Jean Rollin. John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Jack Hill, Richard Fleischer. Argento, Herzog, Paul Morrissey, Ed Wood...\" He pauses for breath. \"John Waters, Seijun Suzuki, Stanley Kubrick, Fellini. Hitchcock, Tod Browning, Don Siegel, David Lynch...\" </p> <p>And on it goes, an epic, encyclopaedic dash through John Woo and Russ Meyer, Jess Franco and Akira Kurosawa; a two-minute litany of the directorial great, good and just plain cult. Except that there is one person missing. </p> <p>\"You know what I should have done?\" the garrulous Dane mutters. \"I should have included myself. I should have put my own name in there.\" </p> <p>He bangs the table in irritation. </p> <p>\"I should have, I really should have. You know, Roger Corman, James Whale, Tobe Hooper, Nicolas Winding Refn. It would have been great. So great. Aw... fuck!\" </p> <p>Despite such a glaring omission, Bleeder's auteurist roll call remains a stroke of chutzpah every bit as fearless as the ensemble singalong of Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, or Spike Jonze's massed ranks of Malkovi in Being John Malkovich. These are not idle comparisons. At a time when young Hollywood is ablaze with plaudits and innovation, the fierce poise of Bleeder - wherein a twentysomething couple unravel into tragedy after conceiving a child - probably represents Europe's brightest hope. The same could also be said of the gangling 29-year-old behind it: gifted and cocksure in equal measure, he could be Europe's very own movie brat. </p> <p>As such, it takes a certain droll self-awareness to locate your celluloid mission statement in the video shop, the Mecca of film geeks ever since Tarantino banged out the script to True Romance between reminders to rewind. Indeed, Refn happily admits he's obsession incarnate: \"I have to confess,\" he says, \"every one of those directors is a close personal favourite of mine\". </p> <p>Sitting back, fingers drumming, he glances round the room as he recalls the source of his fixation: a childhood move to New York with his film-maker father Anders (latterly editor to the quixotic Lars Von Trier). Haunting the fleapits of Times Square in its squalid early-80s heyday, exploitation double-bills were the spine of his pubescent existence. Formal education came later. Eventually obliged to attend high school, he learned to read at age 13. </p> <p>\"Sure, I can identify with that kind of manic film enthusiasm,\" Refn says. \"For a long time it was really all I cared about. I mean, I grew up on Godzilla and Kung Fu. It was only later that I learned to appreciate other artforms and more\" - he raises one eyebrow - \"correct movies.\" </p> <p>By 21, he was back in Denmark, his accent flecked with the same East Coast drawl that colours his speech today. It wasn't his only keepsake: rejected by the London Film School (\"Say hello from me\"), he set up shop in his native Copenhagen with enough money to make a five minute short from a script first written in the US. Revolving around the last hours of a Faustian smack dealer, it was called Pusher; by 1996, with a $1m production deal in the bag, both title and premise were recycled for his debut proper. A cold-eyed morality tale with more than a touch of Mean Streets in its narrative swagger, it briefly made him the toast of the international arthouse circuit. </p> <p>And then, nothing. Three years of silence broken finally by the release of Bleeder, a film that, fortunately, proves more than worth the wait. The storytelling muscle of Pusher remains, but there's a new subtlety, a craftsmanship beyond mere flash. Gone is the raw machismo of Pusher's ill-fated anti-hero Frank; instead, in the breadth of its central characters struggling through relationship trouble and thinly veiled psychosis, Bleeder displays something akin to (whisper it) maturity. </p> <p>Refn seems embarrassed by such language. \"Well, I've grown up since Pusher,\" he smirks. \"It's been three years. I guess everyone grows up over three years. Plus it would have been easy for me to make Pusher 2, and that would have killed me artistically. So this time I wanted something different. No gangsters. No drugs. I mean, now people ask me, 'So what is Bleeder about?' \" He gives a theatrical shrug. \"To which I can only say I don't know. I mean, of course, you can say there's this guy, and then this happens, and then this happens, but that's not what it's about. Because it's about... everything. It's about life.\" </p> <p>Which also means it is about the absence of black and white. Where Pusher at times seemed too enamoured of its aura of violence, too attached to its desperate men in bad company, now, even when his characters cause your jaw to drop with their ferocity, Refn empathises. What he does not do is lionise. </p> <p>\"Right, and that's important,\" he affirms, \"because the world is not black and white. This isn't villains and good guys. It's like we were saying, if Bleeder is about anything, it's about consequences. How every day, everything is consequences - you come out of your front door, you either walk this way or that way, and your decision has consequences. And I think the biggest fear in the West is confronting that idea. But that's what's beautiful about art, because you have the power to make people face up to it. </p> <p>\"I mean, I'm aware how corny this sounds, but I believe in the mind. Because the mind is the most powerful muscle in the body. A gun isn't powerful. The mind is. And with art you can deal with the mind, so the obligation of the artist is to think of yourself as a soldier, and use your talent as a weapon.\" </p> <p>It all sounds so simple. Except that Bleeder - perhaps unsurprisingly, given its relentless sting of intensity - was hardly a cakewalk in the making. For a start there was the \"lack of any real money to play with\". Then came the death of the acquaintance whose apartment played host to much of the filming. To cap it all, a series of debilitating run-ins with leading man and former \"best friend\" Kim Bodnia, of whom Refn now cautiously remarks: \"Mr Bodnia had certain things in his life which made him hard to work with. There were demons battled on both sides. He had his problems, I had mine.\" </p> <p> Not least, you suspect, the incessant hostility to both Refn and his films in his home country. Vocal in his contempt for both the Danish film-making old school and their avant-garde counterparts, Refn remains at war with the traditionalists (one veteran producer bluntly describes him as a \"silly kid\") but equally distanced from the mischief-makers of Dogme 95. When the subject of Von Trier's merry pranksters comes up, he turns terse, defensive: \"I saw Festen, which was great, but that's the only Dogme film I've ever seen. They do what they do, and I do what I do. It's not my bag.\" </p> <p>A nerve, it seems, has been touched, and the director's thoughts on Dogme segue into a broader critique of the country which spawned it. \"It's weird,\" he reflects, \"because I don't really consider myself a Dane.

And because my parents' generation have been in power for so long, there's this idea of\" - his voice grows shrill - \" 'oooh, don't mention that, don't talk bad about people.' And yet within the idyll something is rotten...\" </p> <p>We both know what's coming next: he can't resist it. \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\" </p> <p>Hence his imminent departure, geographically and spiritually, for an English language thriller, co-written with beat novelist Hubert Selby Jr and starring the ever-iconoclastic Vincent Gallo. As yet untitled, the project will be shot in Rio de Janeiro - about as far from Copenhagen as it is possible to get. He allows himself a wry smile at the thought of further antagonising the folks back home. </p> <p>\"Yes, I'm looking forward to that. Although things are already easier for me in Denmark, because now all these people come up to me saying how great Bleeder is, and how much I've accomplished with it.

And it's like yeah, OK...\" His accent slides into purest downtown Manhattan. \"Whatever...\" </p> <p>It is that satisfaction, you feel, that told-you-so insolence which drives him on.

      "bodyText": "While he is rarely given to self-doubt, one scene in his impending second feature, Bleeder, troubles Nicolas Winding Refn. It goes like this: a guy walks into a Copenhagen video store in search of porn. Until, that is, he finds himself waylaid by the blank-faced guy behind the counter, impassively namechecking the shop's contents. \"Fritz Lang,\" announces the clerk, scanning shelf on shelf of grubby boxes. \"Sergio Leone, Scorsese, Sergio Corbucci. George Romero, Lucio Fulci, Sam Peckinpah, Jean Rollin. John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Jack Hill, Richard Fleischer. Argento, Herzog, Paul Morrissey, Ed Wood...\" He pauses for breath. \"John Waters, Seijun Suzuki, Stanley Kubrick, Fellini. Hitchcock, Tod Browning, Don Siegel, David Lynch...\" And on it goes, an epic, encyclopaedic dash through John Woo and Russ Meyer, Jess Franco and Akira Kurosawa; a two-minute litany of the directorial great, good and just plain cult. Except that there is one person missing. \"You know what I should have done?\" the garrulous Dane mutters. \"I should have included myself. I should have put my own name in there.\" He bangs the table in irritation. \"I should have, I really should have. You know, Roger Corman, James Whale, Tobe Hooper, Nicolas Winding Refn. It would have been great. So great. Aw... fuck!\" Despite such a glaring omission, Bleeder's auteurist roll call remains a stroke of chutzpah every bit as fearless as the ensemble singalong of Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, or Spike Jonze's massed ranks of Malkovi in Being John Malkovich. These are not idle comparisons. At a time when young Hollywood is ablaze with plaudits and innovation, the fierce poise of Bleeder - wherein a twentysomething couple unravel into tragedy after conceiving a child - probably represents Europe's brightest hope. The same could also be said of the gangling 29-year-old behind it: gifted and cocksure in equal measure, he could be Europe's very own movie brat. As such, it takes a certain droll self-awareness to locate your celluloid mission statement in the video shop, the Mecca of film geeks ever since Tarantino banged out the script to True Romance between reminders to rewind. Indeed, Refn happily admits he's obsession incarnate: \"I have to confess,\" he says, \"every one of those directors is a close personal favourite of mine\". Sitting back, fingers drumming, he glances round the room as he recalls the source of his fixation: a childhood move to New York with his film-maker father Anders (latterly editor to the quixotic Lars Von Trier). Haunting the fleapits of Times Square in its squalid early-80s heyday, exploitation double-bills were the spine of his pubescent existence. Formal education came later. Eventually obliged to attend high school, he learned to read at age 13. \"Sure, I can identify with that kind of manic film enthusiasm,\" Refn says. \"For a long time it was really all I cared about. I mean, I grew up on Godzilla and Kung Fu. It was only later that I learned to appreciate other artforms and more\" - he raises one eyebrow - \"correct movies.\" By 21, he was back in Denmark, his accent flecked with the same East Coast drawl that colours his speech today. It wasn't his only keepsake: rejected by the London Film School (\"Say hello from me\"), he set up shop in his native Copenhagen with enough money to make a five minute short from a script first written in the US. Revolving around the last hours of a Faustian smack dealer, it was called Pusher; by 1996, with a $1m production deal in the bag, both title and premise were recycled for his debut proper. A cold-eyed morality tale with more than a touch of Mean Streets in its narrative swagger, it briefly made him the toast of the international arthouse circuit. And then, nothing. Three years of silence broken finally by the release of Bleeder, a film that, fortunately, proves more than worth the wait. The storytelling muscle of Pusher remains, but there's a new subtlety, a craftsmanship beyond mere flash. Gone is the raw machismo of Pusher's ill-fated anti-hero Frank; instead, in the breadth of its central characters struggling through relationship trouble and thinly veiled psychosis, Bleeder displays something akin to (whisper it) maturity. Refn seems embarrassed by such language. \"Well, I've grown up since Pusher,\" he smirks. \"It's been three years. I guess everyone grows up over three years. Plus it would have been easy for me to make Pusher 2, and that would have killed me artistically. So this time I wanted something different. No gangsters. No drugs. I mean, now people ask me, 'So what is Bleeder about?' \" He gives a theatrical shrug. \"To which I can only say I don't know. I mean, of course, you can say there's this guy, and then this happens, and then this happens, but that's not what it's about. Because it's about... everything. It's about life.\" Which also means it is about the absence of black and white. Where Pusher at times seemed too enamoured of its aura of violence, too attached to its desperate men in bad company, now, even when his characters cause your jaw to drop with their ferocity, Refn empathises. What he does not do is lionise. \"Right, and that's important,\" he affirms, \"because the world is not black and white. This isn't villains and good guys. It's like we were saying, if Bleeder is about anything, it's about consequences. How every day, everything is consequences - you come out of your front door, you either walk this way or that way, and your decision has consequences. And I think the biggest fear in the West is confronting that idea. But that's what's beautiful about art, because you have the power to make people face up to it. \"I mean, I'm aware how corny this sounds, but I believe in the mind.

Now he has started, he should keep digging. </p> <p><strong> Treasury logic </strong><br> </p> <p> Like all previous occupants of Number 11, Gordon Brown is keen to take steps to secure the tax base. On top of this, it is safe to assume that he believes firms and individuals have a moral duty to pay the right amount of tax. Multinationals, egged on by the big accountancy firms, are nevertheless up in arms over the chancellor's plans to tighten tax rules for UK-based companies with overseas subsidiaries. It is claimed that a measure that the Treasury reckons will cost businesses based in Britain \u00a3300m will actually produce a whopping \u00a310bn bill. The claims have, of course, been accompanied by all the regular scare-mongering about big firms fleeing Britain, putting thousands out of work, and so on. </p> <p>To Mr Brown, using subsidiaries outside Britain to re-route dividend and interest income from overseas operations in order to minimise tax liabilities here is a morally just target. </p> <p>But there is also a certain logic to the Treasury's move. The world's major economies are shaping up for a serious scrap with the world's most successful offshore financial centres. Developments such as offshore betting which the internet has brought us are seen, potentially, as just the tip of a colossal iceberg. </p> <p>An important OECD ministerial meeting on the subject is slated for June, at which Mr Brown will be looking to lead a united fight against tax-dodging. The loophole for multinationals which was quietly tackled in the Budget does not exist, for example, in the United States. In short, the Treasury had to get Britain's own house in order before Mr Brown can chivvy others into action under the OECD umbrella. </p> <p>Leaving aside for now issues such as enforcement, the draft OECD plan is to publish a black list of offshore financial centres which set artificially low tax rates to attract capital. In the first instance, it is hoping to embarrass them into opening up their highly secretive banking systems and co-operating with other tax jurisdictions - yes, naming and shaming. But if they do not change their ways, the OECD is threatening an array of sanctions which could ultimately lead to a ban on banking transactions between institutions in countries belonging to the OECD and banks in problematic locations. </p> <p>Far from undermining the government's case, claims that the loophole now being closed affects \u00a310bn of profits underlines how routine complex tax avoidance measures have become within multinationals. </p> <p>It is clear that in the same way the internet threatens to destroy traditional business models across so many sectors, so new technology is threatening to turn governments' systems for raising money on their head. As far off as it might sound, concerted international action to tie down corporate profits so they can be taxed would appear to be the only course of action.</p>",

Multinationals, egged on by the big accountancy firms, are nevertheless up in arms over the chancellor's plans to tighten tax rules for UK-based companies with overseas subsidiaries. It is claimed that a measure that the Treasury reckons will cost businesses based in Britain \u00a3300m will actually produce a whopping \u00a310bn bill. The claims have, of course, been accompanied by all the regular scare-mongering about big firms fleeing Britain, putting thousands out of work, and so on. To Mr Brown, using subsidiaries outside Britain to re-route dividend and interest income from overseas operations in order to minimise tax liabilities here is a morally just target. But there is also a certain logic to the Treasury's move. The world's major economies are shaping up for a serious scrap with the world's most successful offshore financial centres. Developments such as offshore betting which the internet has brought us are seen, potentially, as just the tip of a colossal iceberg. An important OECD ministerial meeting on the subject is slated for June, at which Mr Brown will be looking to lead a united fight against tax-dodging. The loophole for multinationals which was quietly tackled in the Budget does not exist, for example, in the United States. In short, the Treasury had to get Britain's own house in order before Mr Brown can chivvy others into action under the OECD umbrella. Leaving aside for now issues such as enforcement, the draft OECD plan is to publish a black list of offshore financial centres which set artificially low tax rates to attract capital. In the first instance, it is hoping to embarrass them into opening up their highly secretive banking systems and co-operating with other tax jurisdictions - yes, naming and shaming. But if they do not change their ways, the OECD is threatening an array of sanctions which could ultimately lead to a ban on banking transactions between institutions in countries belonging to the OECD and banks in problematic locations. Far from undermining the government's case, claims that the loophole now being closed affects \u00a310bn of profits underlines how routine complex tax avoidance measures have become within multinationals. It is clear that in the same way the internet threatens to destroy traditional business models across so many sectors, so new technology is threatening to turn governments' systems for raising money on their head. As far off as it might sound, concerted international action to tie down corporate profits so they can be taxed would appear to be the only course of action.",

      "bodyText": "Europe should strive for full employment in a new economy which adopts internet and e-commerce skills to compete with the United States, Tony Blair urged the EU's \"dot.com\" summit yesterday. Speaking on the first day of the Lisbon gathering, the prime minister declared that the event marked \"the most significant point of economic change and reform\" in Europe for many years.' Mr Blair had to suffer a few embarrassing moments as he stood awkwardly during a carefully-choreographed photocall next to the Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel - shunned because of his controversial coalition with the far right. He solved the problem by chatting to the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, conspicuously ignoring Mr Schussel's repeated attempts to make small talk. Intensive behind-the-scenes diplomacy was necessary to avoid a symbolic boycott by the leaders of France and Germany, unwilling to appear in a traditional EU 'family photograph\" with the Austrian leader. In the end, the group was expanded to include the Mexican president, in Lisbon to sign a free trade agreement with the EU, as well as assorted foreign ministers to \"dilute\" the Austrian presence. But Mr Blair insisted that the other 14 members of the EU were right to have imposed bilateral sanctions against Vienna while ensuring that the union carried on with business as usual. Later, Mr Blair argued passionately that reforming Europe's economy would help combat anti-EU feeling in Britain, and, by extension, improve the prospects for entry into the single currency. Leaders are expected today to agree ambitious measures designed to bring the union into the internet age. But clear differences emerged over how far to go on social reform, trade liberalisation and employment targets. \"It's a very strong body of action going along with the words,\" the prime minister said. \"This summit is not just about the internet and electronic commerce. It's about completing the internal market, structural reform and welfare reform. \"There's a totally different type of economy today where new technology is revolutionising the workplace and industry. We have got to make changes in education and skills.\" But Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, among others, all opposed fixing an EU-wide unemployment target of 4% by 2010 - down from 10% today. The US, with a booming economy based largely on deregulation, innovation and advanced electronics, currently has a 4% jobless rate. Portugal's prime minister, Antonio Guterres, the summit's host, said that EU governments need \"a common strategy\" to reform social welfare systems and make labour cheaper and more adaptable. But there were signs that France was opposing moves to speed further liberalisation of Europe's energy and rail markets and that it would not back too drastic a line on telecoms liberalisation - a high priority for Britain. \"As far as transport and energy are concerned they have no direct link with the new economy and should be discussed in a more general framework of the evolution of public services in Europe,\" said the French premier, Lionel Jospin. Mr Blair said however that French objections were largely over timing and that there was broad agreement on \"bench marking\" to ensure that agreed goals were met across the union. Proposals by the European Commission, which had been expected to form the basis of today's summit conclusions, had called on leaders to agree to cut internet access charges by opening up access to telephone lines into people's homes \"by the end of 2000\" and by adopting all pending e-commerce and telecoms legislation during next year. In London, the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, challenged the prime minister to use the Lisbon summit to \"turn rhetoric into reality\", focusing particularly on the European Commission's working time directive, which places a statutory restriction on the working week. \"I trust you will rise to the challenge, or have the courage to admit that Labour, on Europe as on so many issues, is all talk and no delivery,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "J\u00f6rg Haider, the de facto leader of the far-right Freedom party in Austria, has been \"outed\" by German and Austrian newspapers who claim he is a homosexual. A report in the leftwing Berlin Tageszeitung, or Taz, headlined \"J\u00f6rg simply wants a cuddle\", and repeated in the Austrian daily Der Standard yesterday, says that the gay community in Austria has had evidence that Mr Haider is gay for some time. But, say the newspapers, it has been reluctant to release the evidence, fearing an outburst of hate towards the gay community \"that would overtake the hatred towards foreigners\", according to the owner of one of Vienna's well-known gay bars. Mr Haider threw Europe into turmoil after the Freedom party entered government with the conservative People's party under the leadership of Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel almost two months ago. Political analysts have largely viewed his resignation as head of the party last month as a tactical move, but some now claim he wanted to withdraw from the limelight, fearing that his outing was imminent. According to Taz, many members of Vienna's gay scene are ready to confirm the reports. They claim he regularly has sex with young men below the age of consent - 18 for homosexuals. As a result, says Taz: \"These days he prefers to meet with boys from nearby Slovakia\" (where the age of consent is 15). The paper also refers to Mr Haider's alleged cocaine habit. Following yesterday's reports, the Freedom party's parliamentary leader, Peter Westenthaler, said: \"I refuse to comment on such absurdities and sleaze-mongering.\" Mr Haider has made no comment, though it is expected that he will now be forced to break his longstanding silence on the issue. According to Taz, Haider's current partner is a youthful member of the Freedom party who has worked as his private secretary. Hosi, or Homosexual Initiative, the biggest gay pressure group in Austria, said: \"We've known about Haider's homosexuality for about 10 years. On the one hand we think it's positive that the rumours are no longer capable of ruining a political career, on the other hand an earlier outing of Haider would have been justified.\"",

      "body": "<p>A new noun has crept into the English lexicon. Partly a puppet, partly a front man, a \"put-in\" is someone installed, imposed, or enthroned in power in a country by undemocratic but completely legal and constitutional methods. No need for a palace coup, an army putsch, or a revolution in the streets. The appointment of Russia's new president shows that to be a \"put-in\" you only require influential friends in the right place.</p> <p>A pseudo-democratic seal of approval will be stamped on the lucky man on Sunday, when those Russian voters strong enough to resist the crushing hands of apathy and disgust troop off to the polling booths. But the real election took place last August when a handful of men behind closed doors in the Kremlin chose a hard-nosed apparatchik, Vladimir Putin, to take over from Boris Yeltsin.</p> <p>Known as the \"Yeltsin family\", this bunch of asset-strippers who seized Russia's energy and raw material monopolies when state ownership ended, were well aware that anyone they picked would have little chance of losing what pass for elections in Russia.

      "bodyText": "A new noun has crept into the English lexicon. Partly a puppet, partly a front man, a \"put-in\" is someone installed, imposed, or enthroned in power in a country by undemocratic but completely legal and constitutional methods. No need for a palace coup, an army putsch, or a revolution in the streets. The appointment of Russia's new president shows that to be a \"put-in\" you only require influential friends in the right place. A pseudo-democratic seal of approval will be stamped on the lucky man on Sunday, when those Russian voters strong enough to resist the crushing hands of apathy and disgust troop off to the polling booths. But the real election took place last August when a handful of men behind closed doors in the Kremlin chose a hard-nosed apparatchik, Vladimir Putin, to take over from Boris Yeltsin. Known as the \"Yeltsin family\", this bunch of asset-strippers who seized Russia's energy and raw material monopolies when state ownership ended, were well aware that anyone they picked would have little chance of losing what pass for elections in Russia. Incumbency and control of television are the keys.

Central to both is far more information for families about what will happen before they sign a consent form. The forms will no longer contain the catch-all phrase permitting tissue retention if doctors think fit. Pathologists will be authorised to take small tissue samples in any postmortem, but must seek the explicit consent of the family to retain a specified whole organ. </p> <p>Representatives of more than 200 families whose children's organs were taken and stored by pathologists without their knowledge cautiously welcomed the college guidelines, but called for them to be given the force of law. </p> <p>Ian Cohen, the solicitor representing the families' support group Pity II, set up in the wake of the Alder Hey scandal, said: \"These are only guidelines, and the reality is that they, together with the inquiry recommendations later this year, must result in a change in the law. Otherwise, there is no way of checking how hospitals are operating.\" </p> <p>The president of the college, John Lilleyman, acknowledged that pathologists had not kept pace with the changing times in their assumption that the family would not want to be told what was to happen but denied deliberate deception. He said discussing the details of a postmortem with a family was an uncomfortable thing to do and added to distress so the issue had probably been ducked. </p> <p>Health minister Lord Hunt yesterday announced the appointment of Judith Greensmith, from Liverpool health authority, as chairwoman of the Alder Hey hospital trust. </p> <p>He published the report on the case of Stephen White, a 10 day-old baby whose organs were retained by Alder Hey. In October 1999 his parents got confirmation from the hospitals that it had his organs, but by the time they had arranged a funeral, staff had disposed of them. The incident led to the peremptory dismissal of Frank Taylor, the trust's previous chairman, last week. </p> <p>The report found that staff were told to dispose of some fragments in the container, but misinterpreted the instruction and disposed of all the organs - heart, brain and lung - as well. </p> <p>Lord Hunt has asked James Underwood, vice president of the Royal College of Pathologists and chairman of the working party that produced its guidelines, to audit management systems inside the pathology laboratory at Alder Hey and advise on changes. </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rcpath.org/news\">www.rcpath.org/news</a> Royal College of Pathologists<br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/postmortem.htm\">www.doh.gov.uk/postmortem.htm</a> Department of Health guidance on postmortem examination<br> <a href=\"http://www.alderhey.com/homepage.\">www.alderhey.com/homepage.</a> html Alder Hey children's hospital</p>",

Pathologists will be authorised to take small tissue samples in any postmortem, but must seek the explicit consent of the family to retain a specified whole organ. Representatives of more than 200 families whose children's organs were taken and stored by pathologists without their knowledge cautiously welcomed the college guidelines, but called for them to be given the force of law. Ian Cohen, the solicitor representing the families' support group Pity II, set up in the wake of the Alder Hey scandal, said: \"These are only guidelines, and the reality is that they, together with the inquiry recommendations later this year, must result in a change in the law. Otherwise, there is no way of checking how hospitals are operating.\" The president of the college, John Lilleyman, acknowledged that pathologists had not kept pace with the changing times in their assumption that the family would not want to be told what was to happen but denied deliberate deception. He said discussing the details of a postmortem with a family was an uncomfortable thing to do and added to distress so the issue had probably been ducked. Health minister Lord Hunt yesterday announced the appointment of Judith Greensmith, from Liverpool health authority, as chairwoman of the Alder Hey hospital trust. He published the report on the case of Stephen White, a 10 day-old baby whose organs were retained by Alder Hey. In October 1999 his parents got confirmation from the hospitals that it had his organs, but by the time they had arranged a funeral, staff had disposed of them. The incident led to the peremptory dismissal of Frank Taylor, the trust's previous chairman, last week. The report found that staff were told to dispose of some fragments in the container, but misinterpreted the instruction and disposed of all the organs - heart, brain and lung - as well. Lord Hunt has asked James Underwood, vice president of the Royal College of Pathologists and chairman of the working party that produced its guidelines, to audit management systems inside the pathology laboratory at Alder Hey and advise on changes.

Bevan moaned that every time a bedpan dropped it echoed down Whitehall, but Tory leaders never succeeded in ducking the flying bedpans either.

The head of Unison is there too, plus patients' organisations. No one who might piss in from outside, as Lyndon Johnson coarsely put it, has been left out.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, yesterday made his first clear commitment to a return to democracy, announcing local elections starting at the end of the year and promising general elections to follow. Gen Musharraf's pledge came five months after he seized power in a military coup and two days before he holds talks in Islamabad with the US president, Bill Clinton. District-level elections will be held in stages from December to July next year. Candidates will have to run independently of any political parties and the voting age will be lowered from 21 to 18. \"An unprecedented transfer of power will take place from the elites to the vast majority. From here we will move upwards, step by step, to the provincial and national levels, in due course of time,\" the general said, at only his second press conference since he ousted the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, on October 12. When he seized power, Gen Musharraf condemned the corruption at the heart of politics and resisted international pressure for a quick return to democracy. \"At a second and third stage the provincial assemblies will be elected to be followed by the election of a national assembly and the senate,\" he said yesterday, Pakistan's national day. Gen Musharraf blamed the delay in holding the vote on the need to rewrite and computerise the country's woeful electoral register, which has allowed corruption, nepotism and political patronage to dominate local politics. He gave no date for national elections and insisted he was not concerned about pressure from President Clinton or other foreign governments. \"I am doing everything in the national interest. I do not need approval from anyone. Nobody will dictate anything to us,\" he said. As Gen Musharraf unveiled his local election timetable, senior Indian officials yesterday claimed they had received warning of Monday's massacre in which 35 Sikhs were gunned down. They said intelligence reports obtained up to 10 days before the attack revealed that militant groups operating in Kashmir were planning a \"spectacular\" to coincide with President Clinton's India visit. \"They were asking their controllers in Pakistan: 'What do we do with these bearded people (Sikhs)?.' The answer from the controllers was: 'Finish them off',\" one senior Indian official said. Although security in the region was increased, the intelligence intercepts failed to identify the \"exact village\" where the massacre would take place, he added. Pakistan accuses Indian security forces seeking to discredit Kashmir's separatist movement for the killings. One senior minister of Jammu and Kashmir state insisted yesterday that the state was given no warning of an impending attack. During their brief talks tomorrow, President Clinton is expected to put Gen Musharraf under pressure to give a timetable for full restoration of democracy and to curb Islamic militancy. In an interview televised earlier this week, President Clinton said he believed \"elements\" within the Pakistani government have supported violence in Kashmir, where Muslim militant groups are fighting a decade-long separatist campaign. Pakistan denies giving military or financial backing to the groups but admits giving moral and diplomatic support. \"No part of the government is ever involved in any violence,\" Gen Musharraf said. He said he would ask the US president to help resolve the dispute over Kashmir which has already sparked two wars between Pakistan and India since independence in 1947. India has rejected the involvement of a third country to mediate in the row. \"I do not think that President Clinton will go away from the region having endorsed India's point of view in the dispute. I am confident we will moderate his viewpoint,\" Gen Musharraf said.",

Reconciliation between the Vatican and the Jews involves a reinterpretation of the church's past, and an admission of its sins, medieval and modern. But it also has immediate political benefits for Israel, because the Pope can confer on the Israeli state an extra degree of legitimacy which no one else has in his gift.</p> <p>A pope who has done so much to improve relations between Christians and Jews has been ready and indeed eager to bestow that legitimacy. But the first leader of the Catholic church to embrace full reconciliation with the Jews is also a leader who sees with bitter clarity how compelling are the claims of the Palestinian people. Only a few weeks before his Israeli visit, the Vatican signed an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation which affirmed the \"inalienable national legitimate rights\" of Palestinians. That led to hostile comment in Israel, because it implies a Vatican watching brief over what remains of the peace process.</p> <p>But what else could be expected from a Polish priest of the Pope's generation and mentality? Poland, after all, suffered from the creation of \"facts on the ground\" aimed at truncating and even destroying its national existence, which began many years before Israel started planting out its setttlements in the Holy Land and which were only finally defeated in the Pope's lifetime. Poland survived and reversed some, though not all, of those once so solid \"facts\" that Russian and German power had seemed to set on such firm foundations. John Paul II went to pray at Auschwitz in the first year of his papacy. He has condemned the Holocaust as an \"indelible stain\", endorsed a series of apologies, and established diplomatic relations with Israel. He repeated these apologies yesterday in Yad Vashem. For this Pope, the Jews are \"elder brothers\", but they are not brothers who are beyond criticism, above all in their treatment of the Palestinians.</p> <p>In a way, Shlomo Ben Ami, the highly intelligent public security minister responsible for ensuring that the papal visit goes smoothly, is right to see nothing new in the Pope's speeches. The Israeli government knew the Pope's position on these issues, and knew also that he would restate that position during the trip. Yet it is one thing to say something or sign a piece of paper in Rome and another to repeat it before a crowd who a few hours before marched through their refugee camp carrying the keys to the homes in what is now Israel that they, their parents, or their grandparents lost a half century ago. What the Pope has achieved is to recall to the world the enormity of what has been done in 50 years of Israeli occupation and expansion, to remind people that not one inch was ever sanctified by international law, and to suggest quite simply that merely because something has been done, that does not make it irreversible. Certainly it does not make it right.</p> <p>As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators this week in Washington resume talks, tackling for the first time what are called \"final status\" issues, this is salutary. It will not be seen as useful by the Barak government and in spite of Yasser Arafat's obvious satisfaction at the Pope's support, it may not be wholly welcome among the Palestinian leadership. The Pope threatens to revive causes, like the right of return, which Arafat and his colleagues may regard as lost. He also puts down a marker for the future, particularly on Jerusalem.</p> <p>The Vatican, like other Christian churches, obviously has a special regard for that city. It also has to pursue its own politics among the broad constituency of Christians in the Middle East. They want to see an end to the shrinkage of the Christian community, a demographic shift in the Middle East as dramatic and historic in its way as the emergence of Israel itself. The Pope's warning to Israel that unilateral decisions are not acceptable may thus be taken as applying especially to the future of Jerusalem.</p> <p>Professor Walid Khalidi spoke in a recent lecture in London of what he called Israel's \"almost atavistic disposition to assert dominion\" in the Holy City. The difficulty which the Barak government has in dealing with Jerusalem was shown by the fact that, in the latest territorial handover, Palestinian requests for Abu Dis and a couple of other villages on the eastern edge of the city, but not in it, were rejected. The reason presumably was that this would \"strengthen\" Palestinian claims to a foothold in East Jerusalem proper. Barak's difficulties should not be underestimated: handing over Abu Dis might have collapsed his coalition. Yet it is nevertheless pathetic that even this small gesture seems beyond the bounds of what is politically possible for Israelis at this late stage in the peace process. One can see why Khalidi counsels Arafat, in the likely event of a lack of progress on Jerusalem, to \"pull out your secret weapon - the word 'No'\".</p> <p>It is a matter of hoping against hope, but, if the Pope has added to the pressure to avoid a peace settlement so one-sided as to be inherently unstable, then his visit to Israel will have been historic indeed.</p> <p><b>Useful links: </b> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.net/\" target=\"new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/\" target=\"new\">The Vatican</a><br></p>",

Poland, after all, suffered from the creation of \"facts on the ground\" aimed at truncating and even destroying its national existence, which began many years before Israel started planting out its setttlements in the Holy Land and which were only finally defeated in the Pope's lifetime. Poland survived and reversed some, though not all, of those once so solid \"facts\" that Russian and German power had seemed to set on such firm foundations. John Paul II went to pray at Auschwitz in the first year of his papacy. He has condemned the Holocaust as an \"indelible stain\", endorsed a series of apologies, and established diplomatic relations with Israel. He repeated these apologies yesterday in Yad Vashem. For this Pope, the Jews are \"elder brothers\", but they are not brothers who are beyond criticism, above all in their treatment of the Palestinians. In a way, Shlomo Ben Ami, the highly intelligent public security minister responsible for ensuring that the papal visit goes smoothly, is right to see nothing new in the Pope's speeches. The Israeli government knew the Pope's position on these issues, and knew also that he would restate that position during the trip. Yet it is one thing to say something or sign a piece of paper in Rome and another to repeat it before a crowd who a few hours before marched through their refugee camp carrying the keys to the homes in what is now Israel that they, their parents, or their grandparents lost a half century ago. What the Pope has achieved is to recall to the world the enormity of what has been done in 50 years of Israeli occupation and expansion, to remind people that not one inch was ever sanctified by international law, and to suggest quite simply that merely because something has been done, that does not make it irreversible. Certainly it does not make it right. As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators this week in Washington resume talks, tackling for the first time what are called \"final status\" issues, this is salutary. It will not be seen as useful by the Barak government and in spite of Yasser Arafat's obvious satisfaction at the Pope's support, it may not be wholly welcome among the Palestinian leadership. The Pope threatens to revive causes, like the right of return, which Arafat and his colleagues may regard as lost. He also puts down a marker for the future, particularly on Jerusalem. The Vatican, like other Christian churches, obviously has a special regard for that city. It also has to pursue its own politics among the broad constituency of Christians in the Middle East. They want to see an end to the shrinkage of the Christian community, a demographic shift in the Middle East as dramatic and historic in its way as the emergence of Israel itself. The Pope's warning to Israel that unilateral decisions are not acceptable may thus be taken as applying especially to the future of Jerusalem. Professor Walid Khalidi spoke in a recent lecture in London of what he called Israel's \"almost atavistic disposition to assert dominion\" in the Holy City. The difficulty which the Barak government has in dealing with Jerusalem was shown by the fact that, in the latest territorial handover, Palestinian requests for Abu Dis and a couple of other villages on the eastern edge of the city, but not in it, were rejected. The reason presumably was that this would \"strengthen\" Palestinian claims to a foothold in East Jerusalem proper. Barak's difficulties should not be underestimated: handing over Abu Dis might have collapsed his coalition. Yet it is nevertheless pathetic that even this small gesture seems beyond the bounds of what is politically possible for Israelis at this late stage in the peace process. One can see why Khalidi counsels Arafat, in the likely event of a lack of progress on Jerusalem, to \"pull out your secret weapon - the word 'No'\". It is a matter of hoping against hope, but, if the Pope has added to the pressure to avoid a peace settlement so one-sided as to be inherently unstable, then his visit to Israel will have been historic indeed.

      "body": "<p>On Monday, the Sun announced \"victory\" for the 52,876 readers who supported its \"Britain Has Had Enough\" campaign to rid the nation of Gypsy beggars. (\"Labour research,\" the article claims, \"shows begging refugees is voters' third-most important issue after health and education.\") Though the violence of the outcry has been striking, particularly in a boom economy, it isn't very surprising that Gypsies are exciting hatred in the press. Gypsies have always excited hatred in the press. For hundreds of years they have played a small but lively part in the European imagination, and these days, when so much of public discourse is deadened by euphemism, Gypsies are perhaps the last group up for grabs. (Is the beggar named as Maria Nistor going to complain when a reporter - the Sun again - claims that she has named her baby \"Lucifer\"?) These familiar strangers are regarded monolithically; their given name is a synonym for thieves and cheats. As beggars and as Gypsies they are now also emblematic of all asylum seekers: beggars and presumed cheats at the gate of the west.</p> <p>But it is readers who are being \"gypped\". For in page after page of pious press coverage, myth has displaced history and opinion has displaced fact - facts either about their circumstances or about immigration policy. I haven't seen any accounts of the trauma of the trip over: about the terror of being dumped, or sexually assaulted, by the paid trafficker; about the constant fear of rejection and attack which is compounded immeasurably where there are children involved. For all the fresh outrage, the story is not new. In 1992, I met a group of Romanian Gypsies as they prepared to wade across a river into Germany. By the time I caught up with them, this family of four adults, five children and two babies had crossed three borders and more than a thousand miles, in slippers. What I saw in their faces does not tally with the touted image of Romanian Gypsies arriving by the lorryload, happy as Heidis on a hayride.</p> <p>And where are the reports about the situation in Romania now? Or are we supposed to imagine that there are people prepared to uproot themselves and their small ones, with maximum uncertainty and danger, on a whim? Nor is there any talk of how dramatically immigration policy has shifted in Britain and throughout the European Union: of how, since the 1980s, important distinctions between asylum seekers and other kinds of deserving migrants have been eroded, so that, for the first time in our modern history (and in pitiful contrast to the benevolent policies of the post-war period), the low immigration targets set by governments have taken priority and influenced the assessment of would-be immigrants from the poorer world. In other words, the question of \"need\" is no longer about them and theirs, it's about us and ours.</p> <p>The barbaric feel of many recent reports has much to do with ignorance - both genuine and wilful: the easiest way to dehumanise people is to strip them of any context, of any history. And, with very little in the way of a written history of their own, with no book, no anthem, no flag or popular story about the founding of their nation; with no state or power of any kind except in numbers, the Gypsies are particularly vulnerable to such mythologising.</p> <p>The centre-piece of the current story, and its proud centerpiece, is the assertion that Gypsies despise their own children - the flipside of the old favourite that they steal other people's babies - and cynically use them as \"props\". Here is what I know about Gypsies and their babies, gleaned from many years of study, predominantly in eastern and central Europe. First, being a mother is regarded as a woman's single-most important task; indeed, failure to bear children often leads to shame and even exclusion from the group. Second, Gypsy women, whatever the earnings of their husbands, are ultimately charged with supporting and feeding their children. Third, the women - for whom begging is not generally felt to be shameful (as it would be for the men) - are deeply resistant to being separated from their children under any circumstances. They, in turn, are reliably scandalised by the way non-Gypsy women willingly arrange for their children to be cared for by non-family members.</p> <p>Gypsies are profoundly mistrustful of outside influences: understandable, when you consider the draconian drives, at least in eastern and central Europe, to assimilate them. Since the 18th century such measures have included the removal of Gypsy children into Christian institutions and homes (a practice continued in Switzerland until 1973), and, under the communists, the compulsory changing of Gypsy names. All in all, in any interaction with non-Gypsies, at home or abroad, they live in tense anticipation of ill-will, bad faith, rejection and harm. If children are toughened by what they see, their parents may feel that this is appropriate training for an expected lifetime of hate directed at them.</p> <p>It is worth reminding ourselves of their extraordinary past, not as \"some sopping-wet liberal excuse\", but as the only meaningful basis for intelligent discussion about their future, in Britain and elsewhere. And such a discussion must be of interest to us all, not just because they are Europeans too, but because they are Europe's largest and fastest growing minority.</p> <p>The lives of Gypsies, since they left India at the beginning of the last millennium, has consisted of deportation and nomadism, homelessness and statelessness, interwoven with episodes of forced assimilation as well as incarceration and massacre. In Romania, where most of these recent arrivals come from, Gypsies were slaves for 400 years, until 1864 when slavery was abolished in Romania.</p> <p>Under the Nazis, at least half a million were murdered. They were the only group apart from the Jews slated for annihilation on racial grounds. Gypsies have only recently begun to commemorate their Holocaust dead, but they remain without a homeland. Perhaps uniquely they are also without any apparent desire for one. Instead, these periods of extreme persecution are reasonably regarded by them as forming part of the great continuum of persecution. It would not be far-fetched to wonder whether, in the case of the Gypsies, \"nomad\" is perhaps nothing more than a travel agent's kind of term for \"deportee\".</p> <p>And what of the situation of Gypsies today? A brief look at a recent week in the life of Gypsies around Europe shows that there is rather more to the story than the nursery frighteners and prejudices of our grandparents that are emotionally invoked in place of investigation.</p> <p>On March 2, in Tirgu-Mures, Romania, four policemen reportedly punched a drunk Gypsy to the ground and then kicked him as a crowd of Gypsies looked on. Approximately 25 further police were called in to disperse the crowd, beating them, yelling racial epithets and spraying children with teargas. The European Roma Rights Centre, a Budapest-based public-interest law group and monitoring organisation, reports 19 cases of police brutality in Romania between 1996 and 1998, none of them resulting in the conviction, or even the prosecution, of an officer involved.</p> <p>On March 3, on the outskirts of Rome, some 400 carabinieri reporting to the ministry of defence, swooped in the early hours on a \"camp for nomads\". They detained and checked all residents for the required permits, issued by local police. The 112 \"nomads\" who did not have permits were taken in two police buses to Fiumicino airport, whence at least 56 of them, including a couple of under-age girls without their parents, were that afternoon deported to Bosnia. A similar operation took place the next day at a different camp in Rome. The collective expulsion of aliens in Italy is - like the treatment of Gypsies in most other states - in clear contravention of a number of conventions to which the host country is a signatory.</p> <p>In Slovakia the persecution is mainly by skinheads. Last year in the Czech Republic the northern Bohemian city of Usti Nad Labem erected a high wall around its Gypsy ghetto, creating a Gypsy enclosure. Another report from the ERRC, called A Special Remedy, details, over 137 pages, the routine placement of Gypsy children (some 62%) in schools for the mentally handicapped, often on the basis of tests lasting half an hour, or without any test at all. These Gypsy placements, made in vastly disproportionate numbers to the Czech population (of which Gypsies account for less than 3%), are most often effected without the full comprehension of their parents. They are not given to understand, for example, that once in the \"special\" schools their children will have almost no chance of further education or decent employment. Here is the genuine scandal about Gypsy children - one which has not yet attracted the attention of the press.</p> <p>You begin to see why defiance may be the characteristic most necessary to their survival, but also the one most annoying to others. As visitors, they would be much more popular if their desperation was not so demanding. It has seemed particularly to irritate people that they don't even bother to try to arouse our pity. And it's true, they don't ask for it and they don't want it. Meanwhile, across eastern Europe, it would be hard to overstate the reflexive hatred people feel for them, even among otherwise nice, rational people. And yet, that non-engagement, their eternal separateness, has been the price of their survival.</p> <p>The unpleasant aggressiveness of these incomparably weak people is a godsend to politicians. As is the press campaign against the beggars. Just as Gypsies have consistently kept people at bay by frightening them, the government must be hoping that the rumour of a \"hard\" Britain will discourage new immigrants. If so, they dangerously underestimate the need and ambitions of many people from the east and the south.</p> <p>In 1993, I went to a castle in eastern Germany to join politicians, academics and a handful of Gypsy leaders - including Romania's only Gypsy MP - in search of alternative solutions to the already dismal pattern of asylum seeking and rejection for the huge numbers of new post-cold war migrants, and to explore any possible benefit from the Gypsy migration in particular. Over a few days, contributors shared experiences and outlined various survival strategies for migrants. At the end, as the different working groups met to report on their \"findings\", it was apparent that most of the Gypsy delegation was absent. They were outside in the castle parking lot, larking about in a pair of toy-like two-door cars, the twin Trabants they had just picked up for $45 (\u00a328) and $90 (\u00a356) respectively. The Gypsies, including our lone MP, looked like boy teenagers anywhere, poking under the hoods of their new wheels. They were jubilant - after all, this was what most Gypsy migrants were coming to Germany for: to buy cars for resale in the east, at no cost to the German social or welfare system. No, these were not people who needed to be schooled in survival strategies.</p> <p>The 1951 Convention, the central international instrument designed to protect refugees, guarantees asylum for those with a \"well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\" It doesn't actually specify state-sponsored persecution, as it is sometimes interpreted to mean. Many of the Gypsies from the former eastern bloc seem solid candidates. But for reasons of pride and of income, they, like their Romanian MP, would rather come over for short visits, as businessmen.</p> <p>The car-dealing parliamentarian was, in many ways, an average sort of Gypsy (and an ideal modern European). He had several professions and spoke many languages; he preferred and intended to live in the country of his birth but also, periodically, even seasonally, he needed to travel for work. Like nearly all Gypsies I have met, he had no cause to expect a hand-out and no desire for one. His behaviour in eastern Germany did not undermine the project of the conference. On the contrary, it showed how very naturally such solutions can work. Most Gypsies, like most people with the wrong address, would like to be given the chance to earn and to contribute, but asylum seekers have neither. And, since the quiet abandonment of other legal options, \"asylum\" is the only game in town - a battle of wits we can't win. Expecting deportation, they have nothing to lose. The sooner we admit it the better: our topsy-turvy restrictions make beggars of us all.</p>",

Now the MP for South Belfast, Martin Smyth, has taken Mr Trimble at his word, launching a leadership bid in time for tomorrow's meeting of the party's ruling council. Disingenuously he told BBC Northern Ireland yesterday that his campaign \"will not be pro- or anti-agreement,\" referring to the landmark accord of Good Friday 1998.

Rarely does Mr Trimble tell Northern Ireland of the future he glimpses beyond the horizon.</p> <p>These are weaknesses, but they are not grounds to remove David Trimble as leader of the Ulster Unionist party or as the designated first minister of the province.

For that reason, anyone who supports the effort to bring quiet and normality to Northern Ireland can only hope for one outcome from tomorrow's clash: that Mr Trimble wins and wins handsomely.</p> <p>Before casting their votes, the 860-odd council members should ponder Mr Trimble's record so far. Under his leadership, unionism has won a string of extraordinary victories. It has persuaded its mortal enemy, republicanism, to accept the partition of the island of Ireland as a political fact. The fact that Sinn Fein has elected members sitting in both an assembly and executive for the province (both now suspended) is a historic achievement for unionism: few of Mr Trimble's predecessors could have imagined persuading Sinn Fein to endorse such partitionist institutions. Also on his watch, the Republic of Ireland has removed the two articles of its constitution which staked a claim on the north and which served as a constant offence to unionism. Thanks in part to Mr Trimble's efforts during the Good Friday talks, that claim has been rescinded. Above all, republicanism has accepted that there can be no move toward its dream of a united Ireland unless the people of the province, including its unionist majority, want it. All told, it is a remarkable record - judged in unionism's own terms. The fact that Mr Trimble has done so little to brag about his own accomplishments - allowing his internal enemies to focus on what has not been achieved - is one of the failings to which we referred earlier. All the same, that is David Trimble's record. Do the 860 activists of the UUP as they ponder their decision genuinely believe that a Smyth-led party could have done as well?</p> <p>But tomorrow's voters need not dwell only on the past. They should also pay heed to the current attempts to thaw the peace process, which has been in the deep freeze since the executive was suspended last month. Mr Trimble has taken two positive steps. First, he has refused to be bullied into the doomed demand that there should be no revival of the executive unless the Royal Ulster Constabulary is allowed to keep its name. A motion to that effect will be debated tomorrow and Mr Trimble has wisely steered well clear of it (Mr Smyth plans to vote for it). Such a move would only make progress even more elusive than it is already, limiting the room for manoeuvre of all parties. Second, Mr Trimble has dared say that he is prepared to re-enter government alongside Sinn Fein even without \"guns up front\". He imagines a \"fresh sequence\" in which decommissioning does not happen first but \"follow[s] swiftly.\" This is a much more moderate stance than the Smyth-ite demand for guns first, progress later.</p> <p>The Trimble approach has a chance of success. It fits with the noises coming from both Dublin and London, which have sought to shift the focus away from decommissioning and toward a commitment from the IRA that the guns remain silent and that the threat of violence is gone for good. Others are speaking about pressing the IRA to explain what sequence of events might lead it to disarm and then working backwards from that. All this thinking is fruitful, but it requires the flexibility of progressive unionism if it is to have a chance of success. The representative of that approach today is David Trimble. He may not be the most eloquent advocate of his cause. He may have frustrated his fellow peacemakers over and over again. But he is their best hope.

It's a national disgrace that women still have on average 10-15 hours a week less leisure time than men, mostly due to the work they are expected to do around the house, and it's about time we had a bit more equality in this respect. Caroline Woodley London \u0095 Mary Kenny says that \"everywhere, men have shorter lives than women\", thus perpetuating a myth about longevity. The difference is not primarily to do with biological differences between the sexes. In countries where it has been studied, overall differences in non-violent mortality are shown to be almost entirely due to differences in tobacco consumption. In the UK and other countries where women have closed the smoking gap, the sex difference in mortality will narrow as the years proceed.

The existence of the male menopause is much disputed among clinicians. The BMJ is running one article supporting the thesis and one against. But both agree that many middle-aged men would like to explain their increasing exhaustion and poor concentration on something as easily rectified as a hormone imbalance. Duncan Gould and colleagues of the WellMan Clinic in London think some of these men might benefit from a male version of hormone replacement therapy in the shape of testosterone doses. They said any man who had the symptoms in late middle age should be investigated. They took issue with the phrase \"male menopause\" because it suggested a sudden and inevitable drop in hormones of the sort that women experience. \"It is not an inevitability but may occur mainly in middle-aged and elderly men when testosterone production and plasma concentrations fall,\" they said. In the middle of the last century, the phenomenon was known as \"male climacteric\", from the Greek klimakter (rung of a ladder) - which was more appropriate as it suggested a decline and not a sudden drop in hormone levels. \"Ageing is usually associated with a decline in sexual interest and potency,\" they said, which suggested that the changes might be linked to declining testosterone, but did not prove it. Studies had shown that low testosterone could be a factor in depressed mood; others that testosterone could ease symptoms of depression, anger, irritability, sadness and nervousness, and help to restore friendliness, sense of wellbeing and energy levels. Declining levels of sex hormones might even be a factor in middle-age spread. But Howard Jacobs, emeritus professor of endocrinology at the Royal Free and University College school of medicine in London, is not convinced that testosterone is the answer to men's middle-age woes. HRT might stave off brittle bones in women, but studies had not proved that hormone doses could do the same in men, even though it might improve their muscle tone, he said. And as for libido and sexual performance, elderly men who had problems getting an erection already had a proven treatment available to them: Viagra.",

The master of the rolls, Lord Woolf, convened the unprecedented panel to consider a recommendation by a law commission report that awards should rise by between 50 and 100% in the most severe cases.</p> <p>Tom Jones, of the law firm Thompsons, who represented the claimant in one of the eight test cases reviewed by the judges, said: \"It beggars belief.

It ... has put the interests of profit before justice.\"</p> <p>He would be seeking permission to take the issue to the House of Lords.</p> <p>John Pickering, head of personal injury at the solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said: \"While our cases represent the upper end of the general damages scale and have received increases of around 35%, the overall decision is disappointing.\"</p> <p>The judgment does not affect the \u00a31m-plus awards paid in the biggest cases for the costs of lifetime care and future loss of earnings.</p> <p>It covers only the element of damages for pain, loss of bodily functions, inability to enjoy leisure activities and the psychological effects of sufferers' awareness of their plight.</p> <p>The eight test cases involved personal injury awards ranging from a medical negligence claim against an NHS trust involving \u00a3135,000 to a \u00a33,000 award for a road accident whiplash injury.</p>",

The ruling, by a special panel of five judges, means that the most disabled victims will get \u00a3200,000 instead of \u00a3150,000 for their suffering. The decision will be welcomed by the NHS, which would have had to find an extra \u00a3133m a year if awards had been doubled. But claimants' lawyers criticised the ruling that there should be a tapered increase up to a maximum rise of one third for those at the highest level, but no increase for awards below \u00a310,000. The master of the rolls, Lord Woolf, convened the unprecedented panel to consider a recommendation by a law commission report that awards should rise by between 50 and 100% in the most severe cases. Tom Jones, of the law firm Thompsons, who represented the claimant in one of the eight test cases reviewed by the judges, said: \"It beggars belief. What world are these judges living in to make these kinds of awards? \"Accident victims throughout England and Wales have been short-changed by a shortsighted court of appeal.\" Lord Woolf said in the judgment that the court had taken into account \"the impact of the level of damages on the level of insurance premiums and on the resources of the NHS\". Yesterday's ruling will have a greater impact on the NHS, where awards are higher because injuries are more severe, than on the insurance industry, which covers road and work accidents. Mr Jones added: \"The court of appeal has sided with the insurance industry ... It should hang its head in shame. It ... has put the interests of profit before justice.\" He would be seeking permission to take the issue to the House of Lords. John Pickering, head of personal injury at the solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said: \"While our cases represent the upper end of the general damages scale and have received increases of around 35%, the overall decision is disappointing.\" The judgment does not affect the \u00a31m-plus awards paid in the biggest cases for the costs of lifetime care and future loss of earnings. It covers only the element of damages for pain, loss of bodily functions, inability to enjoy leisure activities and the psychological effects of sufferers' awareness of their plight. The eight test cases involved personal injury awards ranging from a medical negligence claim against an NHS trust involving \u00a3135,000 to a \u00a33,000 award for a road accident whiplash injury.",

The judges ruled that the DPP, David Calvert-Smith, and crown prosecution service had behaved \"irrationally\" and failed \"properly to address the relevant law\" when they decided there was no realistic prospect of conviction. He ordered them to reconsider. The judgment is the first successful judicial review of a decision not to prosecute for manslaughter over a workplace death and was hailed as a breakthrough in the campaign to hold companies and their directors to account for avoidable injuries at work. The case centred on the death of Simon Jones, a 24-year-old student whose head was crushed and partly severed by a crane within two hours of his starting work for a Dutch-owned firm, Euromin, at Shoreham, West Sussex, on April 24 1998. Mr Jones was killed while hooking bags of cobbles from the hold of a Polish ship on to chains which had been wrongly welded to the inside of the crane's grab jaws to save time and money. The grab was brought too low over the hold and accidentally closed on the student's head. Yesterday's action was brought by the dead man's brother, Tim Jones, who has accused both Euromin and its general manager, James Martell, of \"sacrificing safety for profit\" and, along with other family and supporters, wants both to stand trial for manslaughter. The CPS has twice refused to bring a manslaughter prosecution, despite a police recommendation to do so, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to convince a jury that Mr Martell had been guilty of gross negligence. But Lord Justice Buxton, sitting with Mr Justice Moses, found that the most recent explanation of the CPS's reasoning by senior official Stephen O'Doherty had been insufficient and irrational, had included \"unanswered questions\" and had relied on an unsubstantiated \"general view\".

It is not good enough in such circumstances to rely on a blanket reference to a general view.\" He ordered that the DPP's decision should be reconsidered \"with dispatch\". Instead of asking the Jones family's barrister to set out his case, the two judges had earlier taken the unusual step of calling on the DPP's QC, James Turner - who last year told an earlier hearing that the family's case was \"doomed to failure\" - to justify the decision not to prosecute. Yesterday Mr Turner conceded that Mr Martell had been negligent and blameworthy for failing to have a safe system of work in place, but was repeatedly interrupted by the two judges, who said the CPS's positions had been \"baffling\" and \"beggared belief\".

      "bodyText": "The death of a local councillor from samurai sword wounds may have been the result of a bizarre accident involving Nigel Jones, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham, a lawyer claimed yesterday. Andrew Pennington, a Liberal Democrat activist and aide to Mr Jones, died after an attack on the MP's constituency office by a man wielding a sword about one metre (40in) long. He had 11 stab wounds to his stomach, chest and back. But at Cheltenham magistrates yesterday on the second day of the committal hearing of Robert Ashman, 49, a civil engineer charged with Mr Pennington's murder, Roger Everest, defending, claimed that there was no proof of a murder and that the MP could be implicated in the death. Mr Jones had told the court of his struggle with the swordsman on January 28 which left him requiring about 60 stitches to his hands and specialist surgery. Yesterday Mr Everest claimed that the struggle may have accidentally led to the death of Mr Pennington. He also claimed that Mr Jones had fled the scene \"like a robber\". The murder charge should be dropped as no one saw his client attacking Mr Pennington, Mr Everest said. \"Initially this case is about Nigel Jones's accusation that the defendant attempted to murder him. He does not allege that the defendant killed, let alone murdered, Andrew Pennington. \"Why is it that the MP flees from the scene like a robber? Why is it that the defendant goes quietly? A man has died, a respected man within the community, a man loved by his family. It does no honour to his memory to charge another man, also kindly regarded by his family, if the evidence does not sustain him. \"It is better for everyone concerned - the deceased's family, the defendant and the MP - for this court to dismiss the charge of murder and focus on the attempted murder of Nigel Jones.\" Mr Everest added: \"There is no evidence to show the defendant killed, let alone murdered, the deceased. Does the evidence preclude an horrendous, inadvertent accident as Nigel Jones and the defendant fought with the sword? No it does not.\" Were Mr Pennington's multiple stab wounds \"inflicted before Nigel Jones left the surgery?\" It took magistrates 15 minutes to decide there was a case to answer. Mr Ashman was committed for trial at Bristol crown court for the murder of Mr Pennington and the attempted murder of Mr Jones.",

Roger Khanna, highways advisor to the London councils, said: \"The problem is that the utility firms are incredibly powerful, and once they have a licence they have no financial incentive to complete the work quickly, or at a time convenient to road users. \"It is one of the great myths that local councils have any powers to co-ordinate the bulk of the utility work. They [the utilities] inform us overnight what they are planning to do, often claiming it is an emergency or a commercial necessity. We are powerless to stop most of them.\" Many contractors for utility companies start work at the agreed time, but do not continue the work for many days thereafter. Ministers concede the increase in traffic jams has been caused by the the utility industries and the cable companies. The number of utility firms with licences to rip up roads has risen to 80. More than 30 have licences in London. Ten years ago only 10 firms had licences in London. In the capital alone roads are ripped up more than 350,000 times a year. Lord Whitty, the transport minister, said the government already had powers under New Roads and Works Streets Act to give councils the right to charge for overstay by contractors. The reform would require a simple vote in parliament. In London, the fine for over-stay is likely to be \u00a32,000 a day. Mr Khanna questioned the wisdom of fines based on over-stay since it would be difficult to agree a reasonable period to complete works. \"It is a struggle to keep up with the utility firms' work. We would be chasing ghosts.\"",

The row is certain to heap further embarrassment on the beleaguered society, which faces threats by the government to take away its powers to regulate the profession after a huge pile-up of complaints against solicitors. Solicitors, too, are increasingly disenchanted with the society following a series of disasters, which began when a previous presidential candidate resigned amid sexual harassment claims, and continued with fiascos over the society's computer system and a serious shortfall in its indemnity fund, which had to call for top-ups from the profession after seriously misjudging a shortfall in its finances.

Other relevant data: The director, Rob Sanders, used real US actors and copied the film techniques of American 50s sitcoms, with locked-off angles, no zooms or pans.",

It cost him $10 in a New York store. Today, Hirschhorn, an avid poster collector, estimates its selling price at nearly $1000. </p> <p>Once the sole preserve of obsessive film buffs, collecting vintage film posters is now big business. Competition is cut-throat and thousands of pounds can change hands for a prized original of classics such as The Maltese Falcon and Gone With The Wind, while a 1932 poster of horror classic, The Mummy, recently sold for a record-breaking $495,000. </p> <p>On Monday, Christie's will put 400 lots of original film artwork under the hammer, ranging from a 1918 illustration for the DW Griffith film The Greatest Thing In Life, to a 1976 one-sheet depicting a youthful de Niro in Taxi Driver. A series of stark black and white 70s spreads for Magnum Force, featuring Clint Eastwood glowering menacingly over his gun, are expected to command especially high prices. Other desirables include an extremely rare French cafe poster for one of the first public screenings of Cinematographe De Salon \"KOK\", circa 1899, as well as a range of moody 40s film noir works featuring Rita Hayworth, Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis. But the undoubted highlight is the chance to bid for rare original Casablanca posters, including Pierre Pigeot's steamily exotic 1942 design which was used to promote the film in France and is expected to sell for \u00a310,000-\u00a315,000. </p> <p>Sarah Hodgson, of Christie's, says she has seen the market expand massively over the last 10 years. Christie's held a small auction in 1995, which proved so popular that the following year the auction house made the sales bi-annual. These events attract serious collectors from around the world, especially America and Japan, as well as big-time collectors who come to stockpile posters for investment, but the biggest group of poster punters are still the film fans who get their kicks from having a slice of cinema history on their living room walls. Jeremy Theobald, star of last year's indie hit, Following, enthuses wildly over the 1965 Ipcress File poster that was given to him as a birthday present. \"It's a masterpiece of design, but also represents the iconography of the film,\" he says of the montage depicting a stony-faced Michael Caine in the reflection of a car's side mirror. </p> <p>Bruce Marchant, co-owner of The Reel Poster Gallery in west London which specialises in hard-to-find film posters, believes the appeal lies in the special place that cinema holds in the public's consciousness. \"It's something everyone can relate to.\" </p> <p>\"Some of these posters are works of modern art,\" says Kevin MacDonald, a documentary-maker and regular at Marchant's shop, who regards his cherished Polish poster for The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner as a seminal design. \"Of the original stone lithographs from a film such as the 1946 classic, Gilda, only a few might have survived; poster collectors see these in the same way an art buff might regard an original Toulouse Lautrec print, or even Picasso,\" says Marchant. </p> <p>The posters often generate particular emotional associations, or memories. Kids who saw the first episode of Star Wars at the cinema are now adults who can afford to put the original poster on their walls. \"The typical customer here is a 20-30-something bloke, who wants something to liven up the walls of his bachelor pad,\" says Neil Palmer at Covent Garden's Cinema Store, which sells newer artwork. Hard-edged 60s films such as Get Carter or 70s Scorsese flicks that combine a touch of \"culture\" with Loaded-style kudos are best-sellers. </p> <p>At Christie's, what is Hodgson's favourite at next week's auction? Rita Hayworth in a 50s gown, cigarette in hand, pouting on the poster for Gilda. It's expected to sell for \u00a39,000. Hold on to that Toy Story spread - it could still make you a millionaire. </p> <p><strong>The posters you should be buying</strong></p> <p>* Any 50s sci-fi or horror films: lesser-known titles such as <strong> Devil Girl From Mars</strong> go for under \u00a3500. <strong> The Creature From The Black Lagoon</strong> (1954) or <strong> The Fly</strong> (1958) are \u00a3500-\u00a3700. </p> <p>* 40s film noir is very highly prized. <strong> Double Indemnity</strong> (1944), <strong> Deadline At Dawn</strong> (1946) can be found for under \u00a3500. </p> <p>* Hitchcock is highly collectible - posters for <strong> Rear Window</strong> (1958), Vertigo (1958), or <strong> North By Northwest </strong> (1959) go for between \u00a3200 and \u00a3500. </p> <p>* Any James Bond. <strong> On Her Majesty's Secret Service</strong> (1969) and <strong> Moonraker</strong> (1979) go for around \u00a3300, then prices climb to over \u00a31000 for <strong> From Russia With Love</strong> (1963). </p> <p>* Any of the early <strong> Star Wars</strong>, especially the first and second films. They sell for around \u00a3100. </p> <p>* Any <strong> 2001: A Space Odyssey</strong> (1968). They cost around \u00a3300-400 now and prices are expected to soar. </p> <p>* Recent cult hits: <strong> Trainspotting</strong> (1995), <strong> Reservoir Dogs</strong> (1991), <strong> Pulp Fiction</strong> (1994) sell from around \u00a380. </p> <p>* Any early Disney.

This is the eighth major defeat inflicted on the government in the Lords since the hereditary peers were thrown out late last year. Mr Blair next week will appoint 19 new Labour peers, nine Liberal Democrats and four Conservatives. Peers supported by 190 to 175, majority of 15, a Tory amendment to the learning and skills bill requiring schools to promote marriage as the key building block of society. The education minister, Lady Blackstone, said the move had \"demolished\" carefully constructed government proposals for new sex education guidance which would stress the importance both of marriage and \"stable relationships\". That compromise, intended to defuse the row over plans to repeal section 28, would be reintroduced when the bill returned to the Commons, she said, and the Tory amendment - tabled by the former cabinet minister Lady Young - would be removed. Lady Blackstone said teachers had to take account of \"the real world\" and the fact that people lived in stable, loving relationships as well as married ones. Debate had been \"confused and disconnected from the truth\", and since the amendment had been tabled there had been a lot of comment in the press, much of it \"factually incorrect\", she said. The guidance, backed by the Bishop of Blackburn, the Rt Rev Alan Chesters, says teachers should tell children about the \"significance of marriage and stable relationships as the key building blocks of community and society\". Lady Blackstone said teachers would be clear about what they could tell children \"rather than what they cannot\". She told peers: \"We represent a wide range of society.\" Teachers would underline the importance of marriage and family and \"the need to respect diversity\". Lady Young said the guidance to teachers could in \"no way\" be regarded as a substitute for section 28, and insisted the clause should stay. She urged peers to back her call for teaching guidance that stressed the importance of marriage. Saying she had received 4,000 letters begging her to \"stand firm\", she claimed that majority of people were opposed to repeal. Parents had a difficult job raising children and did not want them subjected to the promotion of homosexuality and some of the \"appalling\" literature published by health authorities. The bishop, an architect of the latest proposals, urged peers to accept them. Though church leaders had not got everything they wanted, the government's amendment went \"a significant way to achieving what is required\". The compromise had the backing of George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, he added. \"He and I are both pleased with the focus on marriage in the context of family life and the desire to protect children from inappropriate teaching and materials.\" The Liberal Democrat Lord Russell said the government amendment was a \"fudge\" he could live with.

The case has many similarities with the recent protracted, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to extradite from Britain to Spain the former Chilean president, Augusto Pinochet, to face charges of involvement in crimes against humanity. The Indonesian attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said the decision was taken after studying the report of an independent medical team which had examined the ailing Mr Suharto for several hours 10 days ago. \"We're satisfied that we're able to conclude from the report that it's possible to continue with the investigation,\" he said. \"We will then be issuing a new summons to Mr Suharto to appear at the attorney general's office.\" The summons is expected to be delivered at the start of next week. Medical reports submitted by Mr Suharto's doctors were not taken into consideration, Mr Darusman said. \"We only looked at the findings of the independent team.\" Assegaff, one of Mr Suharto's lawyers, said Mr Suharto's family and doctors were disappointed by the decision. \"This is a decision by the attorney general and we have to respect it,\" he said, adding that the team would discuss the matter more fully today. For the past three months Mr Suharto's doctors, lawyers and children have repeatedly said he is too ill to be questioned. Mr Suharto was taken to hospital twice last year, once for a mild stroke and then with intestinal bleeding. His speech is now slurred and he finds it hard to walk more than very short distances. Sources close to Mr Suharto say that, as with Mr Pinochet, the former dictator's mental health is more problematic and that he might escape trial on psychiatric grounds. However, doctors linked to the independent team say Mr Suharto's recent check-up included psychiatric tests, and that the results were normal. Mr Suharto, 78, ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 32 years until May 1998, when he was forced to resign amid widespread social unrest and massive economic turmoil. His appointed successor, BJ Habibie, opened a half-hearted investigation into allegations that Mr Suharto amassed a multi-billion pound fortune, but then closed it, claiming there was insufficient evidence. The new president, Abdurrahman Wahid, reopened the investigation last December after investigators uncovered new evidence. Mr Suharto was named as a suspect last month, but he refused to answer two summonses that followed - one from the attorney general's office and the other from parliament. The latter wanted to question Mr Suharto about hundreds of millions of pounds of soft loans from the central bank to various troubled banks controlled by the former president's cronies in early 1997. Legislators who went to Mr Suharto's home were turned away by his daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, who, like all the Suharto children, is alleged to have made an enormous personal fortune through the corrupt, nepotistic practices of her father's regime. Mr Darusman refused to divulge any details of the independent medical report. \"I can't do that,\" he said. \"It would be violating the limits of the [patient's] confidence.\" He also denied suggestions that Mr Suharto's doctors had exaggerated the extent of the former president's illness. \"We're not accusing anybody of lying.

The cost of curing people with MDR TB is very high - up to \u00a3100,000 for each person; the NHS's annual bill has reached \u00a35m.</p> <p>The WHO conference, which is being attended by ministers from 20 countries, aims to triple access to TB treatment in the developing world, to try to prevent MDR TB from spreading further.</p> <p>New York and Russia have already suffered epidemics of the drug-resistant strain that cost hundreds of lives and more than $1bn to treat.</p> <p>\"For the first time, we have evidence the drug-resistant TB outbreaks that have shaken New York and Russia are increasing elsewhere,\" said Gro Harlem Brundtland, the WHO's director general. The WHO has already declared TB a global emergency.</p> <p>The disease, which affects the poorest and most vulnerable people - 98% of deaths are in the developing world - kills 1.5m a year. A further 400,000 die of combined HIV and TB infection. And it is easily spread, with evidence that people have contracted it from strangers on long haul aircraft.</p> <p>In affluent European countries such as Germany, Denmark and the UK, the multi-drug resistant strains of the disease are developing in immigrants whose TB has not been properly treated abroad.</p> <p>\"Improved screening of immigrants will not solve this problem,\" said Arata Kochi, the director of WHO's Stop TB initiative. \"The only safeguard for wealthy countries is to help countries with poorly functioning TB control programmes to fix the problem immediately.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A deadly new form of tuberculosis, resistant to the drugs normally used to treat it, is on the rise in the industrialised world and threatens complacent European countries which thought the TB epidemic would be restricted to the developing world. In Denmark and Germany, resistance to at least one TB drug has increased by 50%, according to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report, published at a ministerial conference in Amsterdam yesterday. The UK is also not immune; one new case of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB) - strains resistant to the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin - is being found every week, half of them in London. The cost of curing people with MDR TB is very high - up to \u00a3100,000 for each person; the NHS's annual bill has reached \u00a35m. The WHO conference, which is being attended by ministers from 20 countries, aims to triple access to TB treatment in the developing world, to try to prevent MDR TB from spreading further. New York and Russia have already suffered epidemics of the drug-resistant strain that cost hundreds of lives and more than $1bn to treat. \"For the first time, we have evidence the drug-resistant TB outbreaks that have shaken New York and Russia are increasing elsewhere,\" said Gro Harlem Brundtland, the WHO's director general. The WHO has already declared TB a global emergency. The disease, which affects the poorest and most vulnerable people - 98% of deaths are in the developing world - kills 1.5m a year. A further 400,000 die of combined HIV and TB infection. And it is easily spread, with evidence that people have contracted it from strangers on long haul aircraft. In affluent European countries such as Germany, Denmark and the UK, the multi-drug resistant strains of the disease are developing in immigrants whose TB has not been properly treated abroad. \"Improved screening of immigrants will not solve this problem,\" said Arata Kochi, the director of WHO's Stop TB initiative. \"The only safeguard for wealthy countries is to help countries with poorly functioning TB control programmes to fix the problem immediately.\"",

      "bodyText": "A second Texas church in six months has found itself at the centre of a US shooting outrage. The latest incident came in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, where a man who was said to be angry about being spurned by a woman walked into a small, crowded church on Wednesday night and shot her and three other people before killing himself. Last September a man shouting anti-Baptist insults entered a church in Fort Worth before shooting seven worshippers dead. Larry Ashbrook then sat down in a pew and turned the weapon on himself. In the latest Houston incident, the gunman, named by local television stations as Oscar Castillo, 32, walked into the Iglesia Cristiana Esposa del Cordero Pentecostal church at around 9pm local time armed with a semi-automatic pistol and shot an 18-year-old woman, Leslie Contreras. Ms Contreras, who had earlier refused to be his girlfriend, was shot in the neck and then held overnight in hospital, although her injury was not though to be life threatening. The most seriously injured of the victims were Ms Contreras's mother, Angela, 38, and the church pastor, Carlos Matamores, 49. Both were flown to a local hospital suffering from life-threatening wounds. The fourth victim suffered only a minor injury. The gunman then left the church and went out to the car park, where he shot himself dead. Elsewhere, New Yorkers were also shaken by a shooting yesterday in Dix Hills, on Long Island, where John Fenrich, 36, fatally shot himself during a stand-off with police after killing his stepson, dismembering the body and scrawling racist and anti-gay slurs on the remains. And in Ohio, a primary schoolboy pulled a gun in the classroom yesterday morning, but a teacher at the primary school in Lisbon, about 100 miles south-east of Cleveland, persuaded him to drop the weapon. No one was hurt and the boy, whose name was not released, was taken into custody. A seemingly endless succession of shooting incidents such as these during recent months has prompted the formation of a gun-control initiative and movement, organised by American women. The organisers of the Million Mom March aim to convene the largest crowd in Washington since the protests of the 1960s. The march is scheduled to take place on Mother's Day, May 14, and will be coordinated with supporting rallies in 20 US cities. Its mandate is to promote \"sensible legislation\" on an issue that the generally pro-gun US Congress is increasingly at odds with generally pro-reform US public opinion. \"This will be the largest demonstration for gun control in American history,\" says a spokeswoman. Hillary Clinton, who is running for election to the US senate from New York state, is among the prominent mothers who have agreed to take part in the march. But no politicians will be allowed to address the rally, unless they have suffered personally from gun violence. American women have always been much stronger supporters of gun control legislation than American men, opinion polls show. The demonstration has been timed to coincide with the US election campaign season, during which the Democrats see the gun issue as one of their strongest platforms in their bid to wrest control of the Congress from the pro-gun Republican majority. The march's organisers say that they have tried to hone their demands in favour of \"sensible\" rather than \"strong\" gun controls, in order not to alienate groups such as women hunters, maximising support for the march. The group's six main demands are: longer cooling-off periods and more background checks before a gun purchaser can take possession of a weapon; licensing of all handgun owners and registration of all handguns; a requirement for safety locks to be fitted to all handguns; a limit on handgun purchases to a maximum of one item a month; greater attention to the enforcement of existing gun control laws; and a campaign to enlist support from shops and businesses, with the threat of boycotts against companies that refuse.",

      "body": "<p>My husband and I married last year and have an excellent relationship. But now that we are considering having a child, I have a serious worry which he won't discuss with me. His sister is moderately retarded and I am concerned that there might be a genetic cause. This is a taboo subject in his family; he won't discuss it with me and his parents have simply said that she was deprived of oxygen at birth. This might be the case, but the wall my husband and his family put up against discussion makes me suspect there is more to it. In fairness to me and our children, how can I find out more in case we need genetic testing?</p> <p><b> Don't let fear stop you</b><br></p> <p>How fortunate that you have an excellent relationship with your husband. Long may that state of affairs continue. However, the issue of his sister seems to be taboo in your partnership.</p> <p>You are being extremely sensitive to his feelings. Now apply that same sensitivity to your own - and to any children you may have in the future. We have a son, now 40, who was \"deprived of oxygen\" at birth, and we went for genetic counselling when our daughter was pregnant. We hadn't realised how anxious she'd been as an adolescent about the possibility of there being something inherently wrong with us and with herself, even though the topic was, in our situation, the subject of easy and frequent discussion.</p> <p>Here, though, I must admit that the process of genetic investigation we underwent 13 years ago was pretty haphazard. Possibly this process has improved since.</p> <p>If your fears force you to decide against giving birth, whatever the possible outcome would have been, you could be missing out on a wonderful experience. We wouldn't be without our son. <br> <b> Margaret Vann </b><br>Bristol</p> <p><b> Look at your own feelings</b><br></p> <p>While it is important to have an open discussion with your husband about the possibility of a disabled child, you may need first to evaluate your own feelings and attitudes to disability.</p> <p>There are many possible explanations for your husband's reluctance to talk about his sister, although a secret chromosome disorder is not the most likely.

      "bodyText": "My husband and I married last year and have an excellent relationship. But now that we are considering having a child, I have a serious worry which he won't discuss with me. His sister is moderately retarded and I am concerned that there might be a genetic cause. This is a taboo subject in his family; he won't discuss it with me and his parents have simply said that she was deprived of oxygen at birth. This might be the case, but the wall my husband and his family put up against discussion makes me suspect there is more to it. In fairness to me and our children, how can I find out more in case we need genetic testing? Don't let fear stop you How fortunate that you have an excellent relationship with your husband. Long may that state of affairs continue. However, the issue of his sister seems to be taboo in your partnership. You are being extremely sensitive to his feelings. Now apply that same sensitivity to your own - and to any children you may have in the future. We have a son, now 40, who was \"deprived of oxygen\" at birth, and we went for genetic counselling when our daughter was pregnant. We hadn't realised how anxious she'd been as an adolescent about the possibility of there being something inherently wrong with us and with herself, even though the topic was, in our situation, the subject of easy and frequent discussion. Here, though, I must admit that the process of genetic investigation we underwent 13 years ago was pretty haphazard. Possibly this process has improved since. If your fears force you to decide against giving birth, whatever the possible outcome would have been, you could be missing out on a wonderful experience. We wouldn't be without our son. Margaret Vann Bristol Look at your own feelings While it is important to have an open discussion with your husband about the possibility of a disabled child, you may need first to evaluate your own feelings and attitudes to disability. There are many possible explanations for your husband's reluctance to talk about his sister, although a secret chromosome disorder is not the most likely. The family may feel negative about the sister, in the form of guilt or \"shame\" or fear for her. They may react defensively to what they see as your own negative approach. Your questioning may stir up complex feelings or conflicts which have not been addressed. The fact that you are so worried and your use of the outmoded, unhelpful word \"retarded\" suggest that you do see learning disability as negative and to be avoided at all costs in a child. I have a learning-disabled son of four with a chromosome disorder. Unlike many parents we were not devastated but relieved that he was healthy and happy. Certainly, it challenges you to deal with the many obstacles society puts in your child's way. As our son grows up, however, his first impact on people is as a beautiful, charming and charismatic person. It is highly unlikely that you will have a learning-disabled child and less likely still that they would share any chromosome disorder that your sister-in-law may have. Genetic testing will not offer you any conclusive indications and nor will tests during pregnancy. The main question is whether you as parents would have the readiness and capacity to bring up a disabled child. This will become clear as you talk with your partner. Talking may be easier if you seem positive and open about his sister and disability. How is your relationship with her? Try to find opportunities to get to know her and other learning-disabled people if you can. This may help discussion and will certainly clarify your own feelings. If both of you are fearful or negative about disability, you may not make great parents to a disabled child and should take the limited precautions available.

      "body": "<p>Two daddies of the independent film movement had new movies out this week. Steven Soderbergh, whose sex, lies, and videotape kick-started the indie boom of the 90s, has come so far since then that his new movie, the legal thriller Erin Brockovich, not only stars Julia Roberts, Ms Box-Office Catnip herself, it also leapt straight to the top of the box office charts without breaking sweat.</p> <p>Meanwhile Jim Jarmusch, the New York-based film-maker who has stayed almost fanatically true to his indie/No Wave roots since his 1984 debut Stranger Than Paradise, released his latest work, a rap-samurai-mobster movie called Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai. It didn't even make the chart.</p> <p> On paper at least, Soderbergh - a director-for-hire in this instance - has the star, the budget, the studio and the godawful modern genre (the courtroom drama), while Jarmusch is defiantly knocking out another low-budget slice of his own parallel universe of comic books, art movies and trash culture. But there are similarities here all the same.</p> <p>Soderbergh and Jarmusch may now be working in different idioms - the studio picture, the personal project - but the values that underpin independent cinema (more an abstract concept than a movement, I've always thought) are detectable in both pictures.</p> <p> That might seem a risible thing to say about the new Julia Roberts film, but to see how good Erin Brockovich is you only have to compare it with outwardly similar legal-eagle movies like A Civil Action (worthy and tedious) and The Rainmaker (worthless and tedious), in which underdog lawyers bring powerful corporations to their well-tailored knees.</p> <p>Roberts has a good feel for the minefield between comedy and tragedy; it's just that she's demonstrated it in so many excremental movies (Conspiracy Theory and Stepmom are just the first two that leap into my recoiling cranium) that you feel you never want to endure it again.</p> <p> This time however her character is so well written and acted that mere Julia-phobia is not a workable excuse for skipping the movie. Soderbergh hasn't pulled any of the tricks with tenses, motivation and memory that preoccupied him in Out of Sight or its appendix project The Limey. Instead he's gone for a no-frills look that suits the modest origins and economic station of his heroine, and his adjustments have more to do with narrative compression and speed than with formal experiment, of which there's almost none.</p> <p>One can detect his current interest in middleground 70s filmmakers like Don Siegel, Richard Fleischer and Martin Ritt (whose Norma Rae is an obvious point of reference). If there is a homage of any kind in Erin Brockovich, it is to their exciting, stripped-down, clear-eyed narratives.</p> <p>I can't be sure, but I don't think Soderbergh uses any technical innovation in Brockovich that wasn't available to directors back in 1976. That's an admirably independent-minded way of just saying \"No\" and we should acclaim him for it. Any neophyte fresh out of the Sundance directors' workshop would be itching to get their hands on helicopters and steadicams, but Soderbergh tackles his material head-on - no fancy stuff.</p> <p>And just to prove his instincts for doing it fast and cheap haven't deserted him, Soderbergh brought the film in four days before schedule and $1m under budget, which are indie virtues the majors really do respect.</p> <p> If Jarmusch has ever lusted after a Brockovich-sized budget, then he's kept pretty quiet about it. I think the origins of his debut, Stranger Then Paradise, have more watertight indie credentials than any film I can think of. It started with a Raul Ruiz movie being filmed on the coast of Portugal in 1980. When the money fell through, first Jon Jost and then Wim Wenders suggested finding backing for an entirely new movie and just transplanting the original cast and crew.</p> <p>Wenders prevailed and made The State of Things, his masterpiece about (well, fancy that) a cast and crew stranded on a bankrupt movie set in Portugal. It was loosely based on his horrible experiences making Hammett for Francis Coppola's doomed Zoetrope outfit. At one point the film-within-the-film's director asks the cameraman (Sam Fuller) if they have any \"short ends\" - the unexposed lengths of film at the end of a magazine. \"We've been shooting on the short ends all week,\" says Fuller. (The State of Things, said the writer Jonathan Rosenbaum, \"contains an in-built prediction of its own fate at the box-office.\") But Stranger Than Paradise was filmed on the short ends from The State of Things. That's the real Poverty Row.</p> <p> I confess I lost interest in Jarmusch after Down by Law, until he made a mighty comeback a couple of years ago with Dead Man. I never imagined a heliophobic Manhattan pale face like Jarmusch could adapt himself to the way-out west, but that misses the point: Jarmusch adapted it to himself, and rustled up the best western of the past 20 years, a violent, mystical, deadpan comedy, icily conveyed by Robby Muller's cinematography, which resembled silvery, living daguerreotypes.</p> <p> Muller and Jarmusch are together again for Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai, starring Forest Whitaker as a black urban samurai who works for the Italian mob. The fact that this urban crime movie arrives on the heels of Dead Man suggests Jarmusch may be doing his own version of Robert Altman's genre-tweaking trilogy of the 70s, McCabe and Mrs Miller, The Long Goodbye and Thieves Like Us.</p> <p>If he made a western that was spacious enough to include a transvestite Iggy Pop and Lance Henriksen as a cannibal bounty hunter, then surely he can remake Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samourai with a hip-hop found-sound soundtrack by the RZA?</p> <p> Oh, yes he can. The result is disarmingly sweet-natured, though tempered with moments of extreme (and often extremely funny) violence. Jarmusch has always liked to hang out and just look around, and Ghost Dog is rich in the sort of triple-layered, slow-burning jokes he loves. Typical of these is Whitaker - who once played Charlie Parker - shopping for pigeon feed at a store named \"Birdland\", or a middle-aged mobster proclaiming his devotion to Flavor Flav's rhymes.</p> <p>If Stranger Than Paradise was, in Jarmusch's words, \"a neo-realistic black comedy in the style of an imaginary east European director obsessed with Ozu and The Honeymooners\", then Ghost Dog is something equally weird and wonderful. How far he and Soderbergh have travelled - all the way round the block, without sacrificing a fragment of their essential selves.</p>",

Bette Davis in Now, Voyager. \"Oh Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars.\" Which actor would you most like to be? Who needs to be Robert De Niro when you could be David Attenborough? When he departs this life he'll leave an extraordinary legacy. Which actress? Gena Rowlands: she's awesome. But there are many actresses, such as Kathy Bates, whose performances tear you apart emotionally and strip away the veil. They also have their heads firmly on their shoulders. Which film character? Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in The French Connection. He's explosive, anarchic and always in pursuit of the truth - similar to my character, Detective Sergeant Michael Walker in Trial and Retribution. How different is Ordinary Decent Criminal from The General, both of which are based on the life of Martin Cahill? It's a more lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek version, loosely based on some stories in his life. It's not a biopic but a romp aimed at a Hollywood audience. Which do you enjoy most, acting or directing? I joke that the acting is a day job. As a director you are responsible for so much more. It's the whole picture, the greater level of achievement, and of course being able to choose who you work with. \u0095 David Hayman is in Ordinary Decent Criminal, on general release.

In the late 70s, for example, when the last Labour government was threatening to nationalise the construction industry, the John Laing moved to split the group in two - John Laing Construction and Laing Properties - to protect the family's assets. </p> <p>Now holders of the A stock will see their stake converted into ordinaries and, while holders of the voting stock will get a bonus issue on a one-for-20 basis as compensation, the family's overall stake will still fall from 52% to 37%. </p> <p>Insiders insist the company wanted to do this for years but has been constrained by the fact that whenever it has been minded to act some part of the group has been playing up - in trading terms. Yesterday it issued a stunning set of final figures showing profits up from \u00a320m to \u00a352.7m and total dividend up 14% at 12.25p. That and the enfranchisement move were good for a 21% rise in the share price of the \"As\" to 214p. </p> <p>There are few remaining companies where the founding family retains full control by keeping voting stock in trusted hands while insisting outsiders only have real access to non-voting paper. The City tends to eventually pick such structures apart, most famously in the case of Forte. </p> <p>This must be a worry for Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which owns Associated Newspapers and is now a member of the FTSE 100. Its antiquated share structure outrages most institutions. Many fund managers would prefer not invest in the company but find are forced to do so because of its presence in the premier index.

      "bodyText": "After nearly 50 years on the market, construction and housing group John Laing has finally got round to modernising its share structure, moving to do away with the ludicrous non-voting/voting split between A and ordinary shares which has ensured this is a family-controlled company. The City hates such structures because shareholders are expected to carry risks without the voting rights that are supposed to come with ownership. It was always assumed that the Laing family would have to be forced to give up control. In the late 70s, for example, when the last Labour government was threatening to nationalise the construction industry, the John Laing moved to split the group in two - John Laing Construction and Laing Properties - to protect the family's assets. Now holders of the A stock will see their stake converted into ordinaries and, while holders of the voting stock will get a bonus issue on a one-for-20 basis as compensation, the family's overall stake will still fall from 52% to 37%. Insiders insist the company wanted to do this for years but has been constrained by the fact that whenever it has been minded to act some part of the group has been playing up - in trading terms. Yesterday it issued a stunning set of final figures showing profits up from \u00a320m to \u00a352.7m and total dividend up 14% at 12.25p. That and the enfranchisement move were good for a 21% rise in the share price of the \"As\" to 214p. There are few remaining companies where the founding family retains full control by keeping voting stock in trusted hands while insisting outsiders only have real access to non-voting paper. The City tends to eventually pick such structures apart, most famously in the case of Forte. This must be a worry for Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which owns Associated Newspapers and is now a member of the FTSE 100. Its antiquated share structure outrages most institutions. Many fund managers would prefer not invest in the company but find are forced to do so because of its presence in the premier index. Yesterday, in line with the market as a whole, Daily Mail A shares slipped from \u00a312.54 to \u00a312.40.",

      "body": "<p>\"Leo, Leo, Leo.\" The name dripped longingly off the lips of teenage girls in 1997, following the unmatched success of Titanic. But adolescents weren't the only ones lusting after him. Studios everywhere were clamouring to seduce the golden boy into signing up for their next project, and, though their prospects were modest, the starry-eyed producers of American Psycho were no different. On a lark, Lion's Gate, the company that owned the project, sent a copy of the script and a $20m offer to Leonardo DiCaprio. To everyone's surprise, the actor was interested. </p> <p>This, of course, was unbeknown to American Psycho director Mary Harron. The creator of I Shot Andy Warhol - and a rock critic at the Guardian in the early 80s - had been working for months on this black comedy about an 80s Wall Street serial killer - scripting a number of drafts with writing partner Guinevere Turner (Go Fish) and deciding, after an exhaustive search, to place British actor Christian Bale (Velvet Goldmine) in the lead role. </p> <p>\"When I offered him the part,\" the 46-year-old Harron recalls, \"he said he had all these messages on his answering machine telling him this was career suicide. And that just made him more excited. That's sort of how I reacted, too.\" Lion's Gate, on the other hand, was less keen. Bent on reaping a healthy international profit, they wanted a bigger Hollywood name, someone like Edward Norton. \"We had a huge battle over it,\" Harron says. \"They would've taken almost anybody over Christian.\" </p> <p>Lion's Gate announced DiCaprio's involvement at Cannes in May 1998. Bale was stunned; Harron aghast. \"When you're trying to get your film financed, you're up against a bunch of people who don't care anything about that.\" She takes a deep breath. \"Most of the time they don't care if the cast is appropriate or not, and movies have sunk like that. Like Demi Moore in The Scarlet Letter? Ridiculous.\" </p> <p>Despite the urgings of the project's producer Ed Pressman, Harron, allied with Bale, refused to meet with the film's new star. \"Leonardo wasn't remotely right [for the part]. There's something very boyish about him. He's not credible as one of these tough Wall Street guys.\" Besides, she adds, \"he brought way too much baggage with him - I did not want to deal with someone who had a 13-year-old fan base. They shouldn't see the movie. It could've gotten us in a lot of trouble.\" </p> <p>DiCaprio's fans were barely old enough to read in 1991, when writer Bret Easton Ellis shocked the literary world with American Psycho. His stomach-churning tale of a yuppie madman with a tendency to mutilate his dates was also was a clever, comically exaggerated satire of 80s materialism and conformity. Feminists and critics, however, were not amused. When original publishers Simon &amp; Schuster dropped the novel after company employees objected furiously it akmost destroyed Ellis's career. Vintage eventually picked it up, but the furore remained. </p> <p>As such, prospects of a film looked bleak - until 1992, when Johnny Depp apparently expressed interest in it. A succession of scripts followed, and various directors and stars would ultimately flirt with the project. \"The years I spent on this property,\" sighs producer Ed Pressman (The Crow), \"the only person who actually ever conveyed a clear solution as to how to do it was Mary.\" </p> <p>But DiCaprio was not part of her plan. At the same time, the mere idea of one of Hollywood's highest paid actors starring in a would-be slasher film provoked a maelstrom of protest from activists, feminist icon Gloria Steinem prominent among them. It certainly didn't help Lion's Gate that their one strong female voice, the stalwart Harron, was unceremoniously bumped from the project.</p> <p>\"Basically, as soon as I said I didn't want to compromise my position, Lion's Gate wanted me out,\" she says. Soon after, DiCaprio had drafted a short list of directors, including Danny Boyle and Martin Scorsese, with whom he'd like to work. (DiCaprio would end up collaborating with both, starring in Boyle's The Beach and Scorsese's upcoming Gangs of New York.) While other names - David Cronenberg, Jonathan Demme, and even Stanley Kubrick - were also rumoured choices, no other female directors were considered. </p> <p>Then in came Oliver Stone. \"He was probably the single worst single person to do it,\" she says. \"I like Stone's stuff, but social satire is not his forte... and he's not known for his well-rounded, three-dimensional female characters.\" Stone began to chip away at Harron's script, preparing to rewrite it altogether. \"It was then an issue of how the script could be improved,\" says Pressman. \"Oliver's approach was more psychological. Mary's was satirical.\" </p> <p>The movie's progress then fell into the same slump that had plagued the project for years: DiCaprio and Stone couldn't agree on the film's direction. \"Leo was looking for solutions to things that weren't problems when he first started. So they had many meetings together trying to figure out if they could do it together,\" Pressman says. \"As time went on more and more questions came into Leo's mind - which might have been about the script or other factors.\" In the end, DiCaprio bolted off to make The Beach. </p> <p>Harron had remained conspicuously quiet during this whole upheaval, which also resulted in Stone's exit. \"I wanted the movie back,\" she says, explaining her silence. \"I never actually felt like Leo would make that movie, because it was such a crazy thing for him to do. The film was so controversial.\" During this period, she'd frequently commiserate on the phone with Bale, who passed on projects for nine months confident that DiCaprio would depart. \"Everyone thought we were crazy,\" she says. </p> <p>Lion's Gate eventually agreed to give her the project back - with Bale playing the lead - under the agreement that her budget would not exceed $10m and that she'd cast recognisable talent (Chloe Sevigny, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon, and Willem Dafoe among them) in the supporting roles. \"Lion's Gate wouldn't speak to me for four months,\" Harron says with a laugh. \"Now they're apologising.\" </p> <p>American Psycho eventually began shooting in March last year, in Toronto, Canada, against a backdrop of protest from an activist group called Concerned Canadians Against Violence in Entertainment. Apparently, local police had found a copy of American Psycho in the home of a convicted murderer called Paul Bernardo - though a recent article suggests it actually belonged to his wife. None of these protesters had read the script, much less seen the film, and Harron found herself again forced to live down the book's reputation. \"If people are objecting to a level of graphic violence,\" she says, \"then the attacks on American Psycho are very inaccurate.\" </p> <p>\"There are so many films that are much more violent,\" Harron continues. \"Seven and 8MM never attracted the same kind of out rage.\" Then again, both these pictures are moralistic tales with despicable killers, ones that are categorically responsible for their actions. Harron agrees. \"My film is upsetting, because it doesn't offer that kind of resolution. With Hollywood films, people want to be told that the good will win out. There is a very clear punishment at the end.\" Psycho, by contrast, throws that type of black and white morality into question, and is bold enough to do it with a sense of humour. </p> <p>\"The society is so obsessed with surface, that as long as Patrick obeys all these rules about wearing the right suit and going to the right restaurant and being seen with the right women, no one is going to look any further,\" Harron says. She spends a good portion of the movie detailing this type of narcissism, starting with the film's opening: a deadpan Bateman guiding us through his endless morning beauty routine, moisturiser by moisturiser.</p> <p>\"We were able to use French cosmetics,\" Harron says, referring to her uphill battle to get product approvals. \"European companies were much more open to us.\" Most of the film's clothing, for instance, came from Cerruti and Vivienne Westwood, because American designers like Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren \"didn't want to be associated with anything so horrible.\" In an ironic marketing strategy, Psycho's German distributor will use this image of a taut-bodied, well-groomed, and somewhat homoerotic Bale to sell the actor as a sex symbol. Go figure. </p> <p>From the moment he acquired the book's rights in 1992, Pressman was determined not to finance a film that was too offensive. The producer would ultimately reject a number of scripts, including one written by Ellis himself, that Pressman has described as being \"completely pornographic and ending with a musical number.\" Harron's kinder, gentler, and decidedly more cerebral film looks restrained by comparison. \"I felt that the only way to stop it from being really exploitative was [to affect] a kind of cool detachment,\" she says. \"If we're seeing the murders from the killer's point of view, you would get into it.\" </p> <p>But despite her many attempts at deflecting the hype about its violence, the buzz on the film was so intense that by the time it debuted at this year's Sundance film festival, tickets were being scalped for as much as $200. \"There is a whole debate about representation: should you reflect the violence in your society? Or should you present the world as you would like it to be?\" she says. \"It's about the kind of film you want to make. And I don't want to present the world as I would like it to be.\" Ironically, the American ratings board would initially threaten to slap the film with an adult-only certificate because of a sex scene. It seems the killer was having a little too much fun cavorting with a couple of prostitutes before terrorising them. </p> <p>\"They said it was the overall tone of the scene. It was disturbing, because it's deliberately unerotic,\" says Harron, who ultimately trimmed the offending images in order to gain an R rating. \"He's just looking at himself in the mirror, having his whole fantasy, and the girls look kind of bored. I thought this was realistic.\" She pauses and sighs. \"It always comes down to taking out a few seconds of pelvic grinding.\"</p> <p>\u0095 American Psycho is released on April 21.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p><strong> Peter Bradshaw:</strong> Rubin Carter's story is genuinely remarkable...But this movie feels dutiful and   earnest, and oddly without the fire and anxiety and rage of real life</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> The Hurricane is Norman Jewison's long, slow, and unimpeachably worthy tribute to the spirit of Rubin \"The Hurricane\" Carter, the middleweight boxing contender of the mid-60s, fitted up on a phoney murder charge by racist cops and falsely imprisoned for nearly 20 years, along with another innocent man, John Artis. </p> <p>Carter became a living legend once Bob Dylan wrote his 1975 song Hurricane about him. But what is extraordinary about his story - apart from the impenitent vindictiveness with which New Jersey state pursued its claim for years after Carter was finally released in 1985 - is the fact that his really was an American life with a second act. </p> <p>His jailhouse autobiography, published in 1974, was read by a young Brooklyn boy, Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who had been adopted by a commune-household of well-meaning white liberals in Toronto. Their remarkable joint efforts got Carter free, long after he'd given up. The film is based on Lesra's own book as well as Carter's, and Jewison's movie encourages us to think of them to some extent as parallel heroes, the film's senior and junior partner. </p> <p>Denzel Washington brings to the lead role his habitual intelligence, dignity and calm. The film develops on familiar, conventional lines. Dan Hedaya is typecast as the vicious white cop who has got it in for Carter from day one. Carter's early fights are shown in black-and-white, introducing the names of the contenders in a sans-serif legend at the bottom of the screen - a straight steal from Raging Bull. His post-boxing career as a political prisoner of race unfolds as his marriage breaks down and his legal campaign on the outside runs into the brick wall of bigotry, corruption and cover-up. With almost supernatural inner strength, Washington's Carter retreats into a defiant yet defensive shell of stoicism. </p> <p>But the movie's relative absence of radical anger is conspicuous when it is compared - as it inevitably must be - with Washington's prison experience in Spike Lee's Malcolm X. The Hurricane is not an overtly politicised movie in the same way, and there is an implicitly liberal, even paternalistic message in the fact that Carter's salvation comes because young Lesra has been adopted away from his black family by white Canadians - with nothing but happy results. (We learn later that Lesra's real parents have become alcoholics and his brother has done jail time, but these tricky subjects are not dramatised.) This outcome appears to betoken the possibility of happy, enlightened relations between the races - and why shouldn't it? - but no one discusses this out loud. And the film's implied belief that this state of affairs effectively supersedes 60s redneck racism looks naive. </p> <p>Where the film is lacking is in its kidglove treatment of Carter's famous supporters. The film has clips of Bob Dylan, Ellen Burstyn, Muhammad Ali, and Joe Frazier all doing their sincere bit. In fact, celeb support for Rubin was a more interesting phenomenon than the film implies. Rolling Stone in the 70s reported on a show put on in prison by Dylan and a cast of superstars for Rubin Carter and a mostly black audience of prisoners in Clinton, New Jersey. They loved Dylan, Roberta Flack and Allen Ginsberg, but Joni Mitchell's supercilious songs were booed and she shrilly lectured Carter and the rest of the inmates: \"We came here to give you love; if you can't handle it that's your problem.\" A more caustic film, less concerned with the lump-in-the-throat aesthetic, might have tried to show this. Not this film. </p> <p>Later, Carter's lawyers wryly allude to the celebs who do not stay the course. The implication that Dylan et al are just fairweather friends (even unquestioned heroes like Ali) is not one that Jewison cares to pursue - and sometimes the movie looks uncomfortably like an extension of precisely this sort of celebrity support. </p> <p>The film rolls on towards the conventional courtroom climax in which Rod Steiger, as a Solomon-like judge, rules definitively in Carter's favour and frees him. It certainly feels like a long and winding road. Rubin Carter's story is genuinely remarkable, as is the story of the ordinary, non-famous people whose persistent efforts got him out of prison. But this movie feels dutiful and earnest, and oddly without the fire and anxiety and rage of real life. The Hurricane is so concerned, finally, to construct a humane closure for the agonies of Rubin Carter, that it becomes disconnected from the burning sense of racial injustice that kick-started this extraordinary story in the first place.</p>",

But the movie's relative absence of radical anger is conspicuous when it is compared - as it inevitably must be - with Washington's prison experience in Spike Lee's Malcolm X. The Hurricane is not an overtly politicised movie in the same way, and there is an implicitly liberal, even paternalistic message in the fact that Carter's salvation comes because young Lesra has been adopted away from his black family by white Canadians - with nothing but happy results. (We learn later that Lesra's real parents have become alcoholics and his brother has done jail time, but these tricky subjects are not dramatised.) This outcome appears to betoken the possibility of happy, enlightened relations between the races - and why shouldn't it? - but no one discusses this out loud. And the film's implied belief that this state of affairs effectively supersedes 60s redneck racism looks naive. Where the film is lacking is in its kidglove treatment of Carter's famous supporters. The film has clips of Bob Dylan, Ellen Burstyn, Muhammad Ali, and Joe Frazier all doing their sincere bit. In fact, celeb support for Rubin was a more interesting phenomenon than the film implies. Rolling Stone in the 70s reported on a show put on in prison by Dylan and a cast of superstars for Rubin Carter and a mostly black audience of prisoners in Clinton, New Jersey. They loved Dylan, Roberta Flack and Allen Ginsberg, but Joni Mitchell's supercilious songs were booed and she shrilly lectured Carter and the rest of the inmates: \"We came here to give you love; if you can't handle it that's your problem.\" A more caustic film, less concerned with the lump-in-the-throat aesthetic, might have tried to show this. Not this film. Later, Carter's lawyers wryly allude to the celebs who do not stay the course. The implication that Dylan et al are just fairweather friends (even unquestioned heroes like Ali) is not one that Jewison cares to pursue - and sometimes the movie looks uncomfortably like an extension of precisely this sort of celebrity support. The film rolls on towards the conventional courtroom climax in which Rod Steiger, as a Solomon-like judge, rules definitively in Carter's favour and frees him. It certainly feels like a long and winding road. Rubin Carter's story is genuinely remarkable, as is the story of the ordinary, non-famous people whose persistent efforts got him out of prison. But this movie feels dutiful and earnest, and oddly without the fire and anxiety and rage of real life. The Hurricane is so concerned, finally, to construct a humane closure for the agonies of Rubin Carter, that it becomes disconnected from the burning sense of racial injustice that kick-started this extraordinary story in the first place.",

      "body": "<p>Next, the fashion chain, yesterday claimed to have become the country's number one online clothing retailer while at the same time questioning why rival store groups were pouring millions of pounds into e-tailing. </p> <p>The store chain said it would achieve \u00a312m in net sales this year and was attracting 700 new mail order customers a week via the web without pouring large amounts of cash into the online division. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Kingfisher, the group which embraces B&amp;Q and Woolworths, said it was investing \u00a360m to develop its e-commerce operations this year and Iceland announced it was spending \u00a38m to change its 700 store fascias to read Iceland.co.uk. </p> <p>David Jones, the chief executive of Next, said: \"We have spent \u00a3125,000 on our internet site and will do \u00a312m of sales. I can't understand what people are spending their money on. Sometimes I wonder if the world has gone quietly mad.\" </p> <p>Next's attitude towards e-commerce has left some analysts frustrated. They have accused the retailer of failing to communicate its e-strategy. But Mr Jones said he regarded the net as merely a new method of conducting \"mail order\" business. </p> <p>He said: \"The internet is just an extension of the telephone and the telephone was an extension of the envelope. In the 1960s mail order was conducted by envelope, then it moved to the telephone and now it is on the net.\" </p> <p>He said Next did not need to pour millions into e-commerce and marketing its service because it already had the brand name required and the ability to fulfil orders efficiently. </p> <p> \"And we can advertise it on our carrier bags, which doesn't cost us a penny\". </p> <p>Mr Joneslast year said he thought people who were prepared to spend hours trawling through pictures of clothing on computer screens were \"sad.\" </p> <p>He offered his latest thoughts on web trading as the retail chain announced an increase in annual profits from \u00a3166.9m to \u00a3194.7m. </p> <p>But the group's shares fell 12.5% - or 72.5p - to 504p as investors took fright at current trading figures, which showed like-for-like sales up only 3% on 1999 levels.

      "bodyText": "Next, the fashion chain, yesterday claimed to have become the country's number one online clothing retailer while at the same time questioning why rival store groups were pouring millions of pounds into e-tailing. The store chain said it would achieve \u00a312m in net sales this year and was attracting 700 new mail order customers a week via the web without pouring large amounts of cash into the online division. Earlier this week, Kingfisher, the group which embraces B&amp;Q and Woolworths, said it was investing \u00a360m to develop its e-commerce operations this year and Iceland announced it was spending \u00a38m to change its 700 store fascias to read Iceland.co.uk. David Jones, the chief executive of Next, said: \"We have spent \u00a3125,000 on our internet site and will do \u00a312m of sales. I can't understand what people are spending their money on. Sometimes I wonder if the world has gone quietly mad.\" Next's attitude towards e-commerce has left some analysts frustrated. They have accused the retailer of failing to communicate its e-strategy. But Mr Jones said he regarded the net as merely a new method of conducting \"mail order\" business. He said: \"The internet is just an extension of the telephone and the telephone was an extension of the envelope. In the 1960s mail order was conducted by envelope, then it moved to the telephone and now it is on the net.\" He said Next did not need to pour millions into e-commerce and marketing its service because it already had the brand name required and the ability to fulfil orders efficiently. \"And we can advertise it on our carrier bags, which doesn't cost us a penny\". Mr Joneslast year said he thought people who were prepared to spend hours trawling through pictures of clothing on computer screens were \"sad.\" He offered his latest thoughts on web trading as the retail chain announced an increase in annual profits from \u00a3166.9m to \u00a3194.7m. But the group's shares fell 12.5% - or 72.5p - to 504p as investors took fright at current trading figures, which showed like-for-like sales up only 3% on 1999 levels. They had been expecting nearer 5%. Mr Jones said he thought there was no cause for concern. \"We are in a low inflation economy and have negative selling price inflation. And we also have Easter three weeks later this year. \"I think 3% is a perfectly acceptable result. In fact I think to get any like-for-like growth is good\". The share price fall came despite Next also announcing plans to buy back up to 10% of the group's shares - a move normally applauded by investors - and a decision to sell its Clydesdale consumer credit operation. It will retain its Ventura customer services division and develop it to offer \"call centre-related activities\" to other on-line retailers. Next might also start deliveries for other e-tailers. Mr Jones dismissed analysts' criticisms that the chain was too narrowly focused. \"The market doesn't like the fact that we are concentrating on the home market. \"But I believe the best way to increase the profitability of Next is to increase out market share in the UK. And I am still not sure how much the so-called global retailers really make outside their home market\".",

We also received evidence that other unidentified members of staff had complained to their union, their line managers and to other office holders of their treatment by the vice-president. It was said that these other members of staff would not come forward as complainants under the dignity at work policy because they were frightened of the vice-president and fearful that they might lose their employment if identified, particularly if she became president.\"</p> <p><strong>Ms Q: agressive phone calls</strong></p> <p>Ms Q's complaint is set down in the report, and refers to one instance when she received a telephone call from Kamlesh Bahl over a draft on the accountability of the head of staff. </p> <p>\"[Ms Q] had gone to bed early and was woken at 10.15pm [she had advised Ms Bahl that she could be contacted at home that evening by phone] by a telephone call from Kamlesh Bahl.\" </p> <p>\"She says Kamlesh Bahl was very angry and spoke in a loud aggressive tone because she had not been given the details of precisely which bye-laws and regulations covered the functions and duties of the head of staff.\"</p> <p>\"[Ms Q] said it was not the fact that she was told that her draft was unacceptable; it was the way in which she was told and the tone of voice that upset her so much and she spent most of her night in tears.\"</p> <p>After interviewing Ms Q the report states, \"We [Lord Griffiths sitting with two members of the employment appeal tribunal as assessors] and accept [Ms Q's] account of the two conversations. This was an instance of Kamlesh Bahl dealing with a senior member of staff in an unwarrantedly aggressive manner, properly described as berating her. If it had stood as a single instance of such behaviour, we would have put it down to tiredness and bad temper: but it was not.\"</p> <p><strong>Ms M: bullied at work</strong></p> <p>Ms M made a general complaint about the way, she and her staff, were treated when they attended weekly communications meetings chaired by Kamlesh Bahl.</p> <p>The report states that, \"What is relevant in her evidence is that she would be criticised and reprimanded in front of her staff at the meetings.\" And this was done \"in a way that made it clear that Kamlesh Bahl did not think much of her ability and that members of her staff would be treated in a like manner.\"</p> <p>Ms M was reported as having a great sense of anxiety over these meetings, which often turned \"bad\". When questioned on Kamlesh Bahl's behaviour, she said, \"I would describe it as lecturing or hectoring . . . Sometimes it would be angry and cross and very impatient and moving onto another question before you had finished answering the first question. Other times would be more reasonable, but you never knew which way it was going to go.\"</p> <p>Ms M believes that Kamlesh Bahl abused her position of power, and said, \"I simply believe that the vice-president treated people in a way she should not have treated people, the way no person should treat another person in terms of discourtesy, rudeness, general hectoring, haranguing. But I believe she felt almost entitled because she was an office holder. I simply believe that is wrong.\"</p> <p>Ms M's statements are supported by Mr I, Ms N, Mr H, and Mr K who said that Kamlesh Bahl behaved very badly and unreasonably towards Ms M and her staff at the committee meetings. He said her attention was not focused on him: \"I recall wondering whether my turn would come.\"</p> <p>She concluded that working with Kamlesh Bahl: \"stands out as the most stressful and most horrible year of my working life. At times the pressure and stress was unbearable\". The report states the enquirers' univocal acceptance of Ms M and her staff's version of the events.</p> <p><strong>Mr K: humilated in meetings</strong></p> <p>The statement of Mr K, another complainant, supports Ms M - he says \"My early contact with Kamlesh Bahl in the autumn 1998 was at various committee meetings. Kamlesh behaved very badly and unreasonably towards Ms M, the head of department and her office staff at those meetings, but her attention was not focused on me. I recall wondering when my time would come.\"</p> <p>The report of the working party chaired by Kamlesh Bahl recommended a drastic reduction in the number of committees and [made] \" a crude estimate of the present direct cost of the committee system [of] \u00a31.8m per annum.\"</p> <p>Without reference to Kamlesh Bahl, or any member of the working party or the head of staff, Mr K, wrote to the chairman of the committees serviced by his directorate criticising the estimate of \u00a31.8m. When Kamlesh Bahl discovered what he had done she was furious [and] subjected him to a verbal onslaught of reprimand and recrimination for writing the letter. We have no doubt it was menacing in tone and went far beyond the terms of any reprimand that might have been warranted by his behaviour.</p> <p>The president said \"My abiding recollection of that meeting is of Mr K sitting there with an absolutely white shocked face looking as if he had been hit in the solar plexus.\" Mrs Bahl agrees that she was very angry and was critical but denies that she shouted or lost her temper or was aggressive. I asked her if she thought she was too severe with him, to which she replied: \"I do not know how to assess 'too severe'\". </p> <p>Another incident occurred at the meeting on March 29 1999 when Kamlesh Bahl asked Mr K why he had spoken to Paul Venton, a council member, about the task force on multi-disciplinary practices that he had been asked to chair by the IEC. Mr K explained that he happened to bump into Paul Venton and expressed the hope that he would be able to take on the task. This provoked a very angry response from Kamlesh Bahl.</p> <p>Mr Sayer was present at this meeting, the account in his written statement reads as follows: </p> <p>\"I was extremely embarrassed by the attack on Mr K. It was humiliating. I recall that Mr K finally gathered together his papers and began to walk out the room. Mrs Bahl then said to him: \"I haven't finished with you yet,\" to which Mr K replied, \"Well, I've finished\" and left the room. I was shocked and embarrassed, but said nothing at the time. Looks from the others present indicated they too were embarrassed and shocked. I cannot recall why I remained silent but I think it was because I simply did not know how to deal with it.\"</p> <p><strong>Ms P and Mr L: abused in Atlanta</strong></p> <p>Ms P was the staff member responsible for the day to day administration of the Law Society's involvement in the American Bar Association meetings in London. The formation of the planning group involved a great deal of extra work for Ms P over her normal work load. Looking back, she said the start of her bullying began at a group planning meeting on July 5, she put it like this in her written statement.</p> <p>\"On July 5 1999, at one of these internal ABA 2000 planning meetings Kamlesh Bahl asked me to carry out a specific piece of work. I explained that due to work pressures I had already planned to do this particular task, but had to prioritise other work before it. Kamlesh responded in a curt way, that I was not to do my work at my convenience. I felt humiliated in front of the others present in that meeting. Her curt reply allowed no room for discussion in a situation where I was over-loaded with work. Looking back with hindsight, I now feel that this meeting, together with the increased demands and workload she imposed, marked the beginning of bullying by Kamlesh Bahl.\"</p> <p>After they had looked into the ABA'a arrangements, Kamlesh Bahl and Robert Sayer became concerned that the bar was receiving much greater exposure than the solicitors, particularly in the social events. Robert Sayer, who was now president, and Kamlesh Bahl therefore decided that a letter should be written in his name to the chairwoman of the ABA, Roberta Ramo Cooper, outlining their concern about the social arrangements. The letter was sent on July 28. The reply was dated August 2. It was a firm but polite rebuff of the request to alter the arrangements and said that everything had been done with the agreement of the Law Society.</p> <p>They all traveled to Atlanta in the same plane but did not meet on the plane because Kamlesh Bahl was in business class and they were in economy. However, they all shared a taxi to their hotels Their time together was wholly amicable. Kamlesh Bahl's statement gives a wholly different version of events in the taxi which we quote:</p> <p>\"During the taxi ride from the airport, and as we were approaching my hotel, Mr L asked if I had seen the reply from Roberta Ramo Cooper to Robert's letter dated July 28. I said I had not They said Roberta's view was that the social events could not be changed and had already been agreed with the law society. I became extremely concerned on hearing this. It contradicted the strategy we had agreed in London. Clearly we had not utilised the long flight time in discussing the position of our strategy for dealing with it.\"</p> <p>We do not accept this evidence. We accept that the first Ms P and Mr L knew of the letter of August 2 was when Kamlesh Bahl telephoned them at their hotel on the morning of August 4 and read it over to them We also accept evidence their evidence that Kamlesh Bahl then launched into a menacing verbal onslaught upon them accusing Ms P of outrageous behaviour in fixing [a] meeting on August 7 without her permission. </p> <p>It was put to Ms P that the vice-president said that it was the content of Roberta's letter that was outrageous and that she might have got muddled to which she answered \"I definitely didn't get that muddled. I remember that conversation. I will probably remember it to the end of my life. It was very hurtful and she accused me - my behaviour of being outrageous; she said it a number of times. Kamlesh Bahl then demanded that Ms P prepare an audit trail of every meeting that had taken place with the ABA over the three and a half years of preparation for the London meeting. Ms P tried to protest that this was an impossible task as she did not have access to all her notes and files which were in her London office and her PA was not in the office She tried to discuss the contents of the letter, but to no avail: Kamlesh Bahl would not listen and insisted on the audit report which she said was not to be wooly.</p> <p>Mr L supports Ms P's account in every particular: \"We were assaulted over the phone in this way, being told that we had behaved outrageously in various ways. As I have said before, I do not believe that producing a written report at that time would have advanced anything whatsoever. All the issues which were raised could have been dealt with in a conversation around a table in five to ten minutes. But the whole afternoon was then spent - it was Ms P - who had the greater burden - a number of hours work in producing this brief at very short notice without proper backup We were all scared - I include myself - of Ms Bahl, of Kamlesh. There is no question of that. She was a menacing and threatening person.\"</p> <p>A further incident occurred in Atlanta involving Mr L. The arrangement for the ABA conference included a formal dinner to be held at Lincoln's Inn. Everyone involved in the planning meeting believed that at the last ABA conference in London 15 years earlier, the dinner had been hosted by the Law Society. However, at the planning meeting on August 6, in an old scrap book of the earlier meeting 15 years ago, was discovered an invitation which showed that in fact the Bar were hosts at that meeting. This made Kamlesh Bahl very angry.</p> <p>At the conclusion of a breakfast meeting on the following morning August 7, she spoke to Mr L about this matter. Their accounts are different. Mr L says she called him over and without any attempt at privacy in a room still crowded with ABA representatives she began to berate him publicly for his failure to brief her properly about the dinner and called him lazy and incompetent.</p> <p>Further evidence of Kamlesh Bahl's aggressive behaviour in Atlanta comes from the statement of Lady Otton, who writes \"Ms Bahl was clearly bent on reversing decisions which we had put together over the preceding two years. She did so in an aggressive and unnecessary unpleasant manner so much that Lord Goldsmith felt obliged at the close of the meeting to apologise on behalf of the UK.\" She ends her written statement by writing \"she had taken an inexplicable antagonistic stand against me personally.\"</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>She has a strong personality and was resistant to criticism when attempts were made to remonstrate with her treatment of staff. We believe that until she sat through this enquiry she was unaware of the full effect of her behaviour. But she knows now as appears from her last answer:</p> <p>\"I am deeply upset. Let me just expand that: I am deeply upset because, first, I do not know if I should have realised - and clearly there are things I should have realised in relation to that relationship - clearly there was a need for me to be much more sensitive and understanding in relation to the relationship. Not just with her [Ms P] but in relation to all staff.</p>",

He said her attention was not focused on him: \"I recall wondering whether my turn would come.\" She concluded that working with Kamlesh Bahl: \"stands out as the most stressful and most horrible year of my working life. At times the pressure and stress was unbearable\". The report states the enquirers' univocal acceptance of Ms M and her staff's version of the events. Mr K: humilated in meetings The statement of Mr K, another complainant, supports Ms M - he says \"My early contact with Kamlesh Bahl in the autumn 1998 was at various committee meetings. Kamlesh behaved very badly and unreasonably towards Ms M, the head of department and her office staff at those meetings, but her attention was not focused on me. I recall wondering when my time would come.\" The report of the working party chaired by Kamlesh Bahl recommended a drastic reduction in the number of committees and [made] \" a crude estimate of the present direct cost of the committee system [of] \u00a31.8m per annum.\" Without reference to Kamlesh Bahl, or any member of the working party or the head of staff, Mr K, wrote to the chairman of the committees serviced by his directorate criticising the estimate of \u00a31.8m. When Kamlesh Bahl discovered what he had done she was furious [and] subjected him to a verbal onslaught of reprimand and recrimination for writing the letter. We have no doubt it was menacing in tone and went far beyond the terms of any reprimand that might have been warranted by his behaviour. The president said \"My abiding recollection of that meeting is of Mr K sitting there with an absolutely white shocked face looking as if he had been hit in the solar plexus.\" Mrs Bahl agrees that she was very angry and was critical but denies that she shouted or lost her temper or was aggressive. I asked her if she thought she was too severe with him, to which she replied: \"I do not know how to assess 'too severe'\". Another incident occurred at the meeting on March 29 1999 when Kamlesh Bahl asked Mr K why he had spoken to Paul Venton, a council member, about the task force on multi-disciplinary practices that he had been asked to chair by the IEC. Mr K explained that he happened to bump into Paul Venton and expressed the hope that he would be able to take on the task. This provoked a very angry response from Kamlesh Bahl. Mr Sayer was present at this meeting, the account in his written statement reads as follows: \"I was extremely embarrassed by the attack on Mr K. It was humiliating. I recall that Mr K finally gathered together his papers and began to walk out the room. Mrs Bahl then said to him: \"I haven't finished with you yet,\" to which Mr K replied, \"Well, I've finished\" and left the room. I was shocked and embarrassed, but said nothing at the time. Looks from the others present indicated they too were embarrassed and shocked. I cannot recall why I remained silent but I think it was because I simply did not know how to deal with it.\" Ms P and Mr L: abused in Atlanta Ms P was the staff member responsible for the day to day administration of the Law Society's involvement in the American Bar Association meetings in London. The formation of the planning group involved a great deal of extra work for Ms P over her normal work load. Looking back, she said the start of her bullying began at a group planning meeting on July 5, she put it like this in her written statement. \"On July 5 1999, at one of these internal ABA 2000 planning meetings Kamlesh Bahl asked me to carry out a specific piece of work. I explained that due to work pressures I had already planned to do this particular task, but had to prioritise other work before it. Kamlesh responded in a curt way, that I was not to do my work at my convenience. I felt humiliated in front of the others present in that meeting. Her curt reply allowed no room for discussion in a situation where I was over-loaded with work. Looking back with hindsight, I now feel that this meeting, together with the increased demands and workload she imposed, marked the beginning of bullying by Kamlesh Bahl.\" After they had looked into the ABA'a arrangements, Kamlesh Bahl and Robert Sayer became concerned that the bar was receiving much greater exposure than the solicitors, particularly in the social events. Robert Sayer, who was now president, and Kamlesh Bahl therefore decided that a letter should be written in his name to the chairwoman of the ABA, Roberta Ramo Cooper, outlining their concern about the social arrangements. The letter was sent on July 28. The reply was dated August 2. It was a firm but polite rebuff of the request to alter the arrangements and said that everything had been done with the agreement of the Law Society. They all traveled to Atlanta in the same plane but did not meet on the plane because Kamlesh Bahl was in business class and they were in economy. However, they all shared a taxi to their hotels Their time together was wholly amicable. Kamlesh Bahl's statement gives a wholly different version of events in the taxi which we quote: \"During the taxi ride from the airport, and as we were approaching my hotel, Mr L asked if I had seen the reply from Roberta Ramo Cooper to Robert's letter dated July 28. I said I had not They said Roberta's view was that the social events could not be changed and had already been agreed with the law society. I became extremely concerned on hearing this. It contradicted the strategy we had agreed in London. Clearly we had not utilised the long flight time in discussing the position of our strategy for dealing with it.\" We do not accept this evidence. We accept that the first Ms P and Mr L knew of the letter of August 2 was when Kamlesh Bahl telephoned them at their hotel on the morning of August 4 and read it over to them We also accept evidence their evidence that Kamlesh Bahl then launched into a menacing verbal onslaught upon them accusing Ms P of outrageous behaviour in fixing [a] meeting on August 7 without her permission. It was put to Ms P that the vice-president said that it was the content of Roberta's letter that was outrageous and that she might have got muddled to which she answered \"I definitely didn't get that muddled. I remember that conversation. I will probably remember it to the end of my life. It was very hurtful and she accused me - my behaviour of being outrageous; she said it a number of times. Kamlesh Bahl then demanded that Ms P prepare an audit trail of every meeting that had taken place with the ABA over the three and a half years of preparation for the London meeting. Ms P tried to protest that this was an impossible task as she did not have access to all her notes and files which were in her London office and her PA was not in the office She tried to discuss the contents of the letter, but to no avail: Kamlesh Bahl would not listen and insisted on the audit report which she said was not to be wooly. Mr L supports Ms P's account in every particular: \"We were assaulted over the phone in this way, being told that we had behaved outrageously in various ways. As I have said before, I do not believe that producing a written report at that time would have advanced anything whatsoever. All the issues which were raised could have been dealt with in a conversation around a table in five to ten minutes. But the whole afternoon was then spent - it was Ms P - who had the greater burden - a number of hours work in producing this brief at very short notice without proper backup We were all scared - I include myself - of Ms Bahl, of Kamlesh. There is no question of that. She was a menacing and threatening person.\" A further incident occurred in Atlanta involving Mr L. The arrangement for the ABA conference included a formal dinner to be held at Lincoln's Inn. Everyone involved in the planning meeting believed that at the last ABA conference in London 15 years earlier, the dinner had been hosted by the Law Society. However, at the planning meeting on August 6, in an old scrap book of the earlier meeting 15 years ago, was discovered an invitation which showed that in fact the Bar were hosts at that meeting. This made Kamlesh Bahl very angry. At the conclusion of a breakfast meeting on the following morning August 7, she spoke to Mr L about this matter. Their accounts are different. Mr L says she called him over and without any attempt at privacy in a room still crowded with ABA representatives she began to berate him publicly for his failure to brief her properly about the dinner and called him lazy and incompetent. Further evidence of Kamlesh Bahl's aggressive behaviour in Atlanta comes from the statement of Lady Otton, who writes \"Ms Bahl was clearly bent on reversing decisions which we had put together over the preceding two years. She did so in an aggressive and unnecessary unpleasant manner so much that Lord Goldsmith felt obliged at the close of the meeting to apologise on behalf of the UK.\" She ends her written statement by writing \"she had taken an inexplicable antagonistic stand against me personally.\" Conclusion She has a strong personality and was resistant to criticism when attempts were made to remonstrate with her treatment of staff. We believe that until she sat through this enquiry she was unaware of the full effect of her behaviour. But she knows now as appears from her last answer: \"I am deeply upset. Let me just expand that: I am deeply upset because, first, I do not know if I should have realised - and clearly there are things I should have realised in relation to that relationship - clearly there was a need for me to be much more sensitive and understanding in relation to the relationship. Not just with her [Ms P] but in relation to all staff.",

Lastminute.com is not the only internet stock to have come down to earth with a bump. Lycos Europe began trading on Wednesday on the Neuer Markt and immediately slipped below its issue prices of euro 24, closing at euro 22.85. Previous fallers included the Dutch internet company World Online International, down more than 20% in its first three days on the market. A new paper by Chris Higson and John Briginshaw of London Business School offers a possible explanation. Published in the next issue of Business Strategy Review, it argues that while some of the high-priced internet stocks will survive and justify their valuations most will not. The reason is simple: they will never generate enough cash. Like most analysts, Higson and Briginshaw dismiss traditional stock evaluation methods. Because most internet companies are start-ups, it is pointless looking at price/revenue or price/earnings multiples because they do not have any revenues or earnings. The key issue is whether stock prices reflect reasonable expectations about the growth and profitability of internet businesses. The only way to test that is to model the company's ability to generate cash in the future. Predicting the market for internet businesses is difficult enough, given the range of alternatives. But expectations about the future competitive environment in which they operate are just as important. A common mistake is to assume the competitive environment will be the same as it has been in the past and that new economy companies will earn fat, old economy margins. In reality, Higson and Briginshaw argue, the internet will become much more competitive, making the new econ omy a difficult place in which to earn profits. \"In such a world, the market allows companies survival rations, no better,\" they say. To illustrate their point that most internet valuations are stretched, Higson and Briginshaw examine two high-profile internet companies - Amazon.com, which in February, had a market capitalisation of $1.6bn, and Freeserve, which was worth \u00a37bn. After studying a range of revenue growth patterns, structures of costs and attainable profit margins, they conclude that on only the most optimistic assumptions is Amazon's value justified. Even more aggressive assumptions for Freeserve's profit margins and sales growth are required to justify the stock's price. Higson and Briginshaw suggest that a lot of internet investors could lose their shirts. But it is not only individuals that stand to suffer. If the bub ble bursts, falling stock prices could hit economic growth. But even the bubble is doing damage to the real economy. \"In a bubble, companies which own successful internet operations may be tempted to spin them off to give shareholders the benefit of bubble valuations, at risk of compromising their ability to capture the synergies from a clicks and mortar strategy. \"On the other hand, high observed valuations may tempt corporate managers to build internet activities even though they possess no competency or advantage in this area.

      "body": "<p>The posters that lead the visitor out of Pimlico tube station put a brave face on what Tate Britain is about. See the original British \"new wave\", the posters rave, showing a festering sea under a burning sky. Then you notice people in the sea and the ship sailing away. It seems bizarre to borrow from America what is probably the best and most frightening British painting, Turner's Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying (1840), only to advertise it as an ancestor of Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers. </p> <p>Previews for Tate Britain have fished for connections between the British art of the past and today. British art has always been gritty, grotty, a bit cheeky, a bit common, goes the argument, from Hogarth to Hirst. How Gainsborough, Reynolds and Zoffany fit in is anyone's guess - perhaps Sam Taylor-Wood's photographs of people isolated in their spacious flats are descended from Zoffany's conversation pieces. But they are not, of course. Nor does Hirst have anything in common with Hogarth. </p> <p>The art \"re-presented\" in the opening displays of Tate Britain radiates a confident belief in a singular national identity. That identity was argued over, satirised, celebrated, even loathed in the art of the 18th, 19th and much of the 20th centuries - but always taken as a given. Constable's matted dungballs of colour convey a deep faith in England. Hogarth's self-portrait with his pug dog advertises him as a tough-minded British individualist. </p> <p>When you get to David Hockney's Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy (1970-71) speakers might as well blare out Elgar's cello concerto, so heartbreakingly does this painting capture a particular moment in British life. </p> <p>The curators claim to hold up the idea of a national art tradition for scrutiny. Yet you are stirred despite yourself. Here are the green fields, the red-coated soldiers, the millstreams, the fairy rings. Here is the courageous young Major Pierson, shot down by a French rascal just as his men took back the island of Jersey from French invaders in 1781. This heroic moment was recorded by the American painter John Singleton Copley in 1783 as crowds queued for hours to see the canvas and weep. </p> <p>There is almost too much historical texture here. I am not sure what people will gain from reading a letter, as the caption explains, \"From the painter Samuel John Lamorna Birch to Caroline, wife of the painter Thomas Gotch, sending a recipe for tallow soap\". Far more successful is the decision to show prints by Hogarth, Rowlandson and Gillray, restoring them to their rightful place in the history of art. </p> <p>Although Tate Britain wants to surf the wave of enthusiasm for new British art what it contains is something else entirely. New British art really is new, but I am not sure if it is very British. Hirst did not set out to be the new David Hockney but the new Andy Warhol. This reflected a violent transformation in British life. The factory years, the triumph of the market, the fading of post-war social beliefs - all this made Britain feel like a different place. Damien Hirst's shark and Rachel Whiteread's concrete house do not belong in the same country, let alone the same museum, as Constable's Flatford Mill. Hogarth had an image for it. In Beer Street and Gin Lane he contrasts two societies, one of healthy British quaffing beer, the other of dead drunk gin- sodden collective squalor. The art that dominates Tate Britain conveys the confidence of people who lived on Beer Street. But we live on Gin Lane. </p> <p>Tate Britain is a generous, fascinating museum, but despite its best efforts it cannot bridge the gap between these two worlds. There is young British art here, from Martin Creed's neon over the entrance to Mona Hatoum's solo show, but no real sense that contemporary art has a place in the whole.

      "bodyText": "The posters that lead the visitor out of Pimlico tube station put a brave face on what Tate Britain is about. See the original British \"new wave\", the posters rave, showing a festering sea under a burning sky. Then you notice people in the sea and the ship sailing away. It seems bizarre to borrow from America what is probably the best and most frightening British painting, Turner's Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying (1840), only to advertise it as an ancestor of Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers. Previews for Tate Britain have fished for connections between the British art of the past and today. British art has always been gritty, grotty, a bit cheeky, a bit common, goes the argument, from Hogarth to Hirst. How Gainsborough, Reynolds and Zoffany fit in is anyone's guess - perhaps Sam Taylor-Wood's photographs of people isolated in their spacious flats are descended from Zoffany's conversation pieces. But they are not, of course. Nor does Hirst have anything in common with Hogarth. The art \"re-presented\" in the opening displays of Tate Britain radiates a confident belief in a singular national identity. That identity was argued over, satirised, celebrated, even loathed in the art of the 18th, 19th and much of the 20th centuries - but always taken as a given. Constable's matted dungballs of colour convey a deep faith in England. Hogarth's self-portrait with his pug dog advertises him as a tough-minded British individualist. When you get to David Hockney's Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy (1970-71) speakers might as well blare out Elgar's cello concerto, so heartbreakingly does this painting capture a particular moment in British life. The curators claim to hold up the idea of a national art tradition for scrutiny. Yet you are stirred despite yourself. Here are the green fields, the red-coated soldiers, the millstreams, the fairy rings. Here is the courageous young Major Pierson, shot down by a French rascal just as his men took back the island of Jersey from French invaders in 1781. This heroic moment was recorded by the American painter John Singleton Copley in 1783 as crowds queued for hours to see the canvas and weep. There is almost too much historical texture here. I am not sure what people will gain from reading a letter, as the caption explains, \"From the painter Samuel John Lamorna Birch to Caroline, wife of the painter Thomas Gotch, sending a recipe for tallow soap\". Far more successful is the decision to show prints by Hogarth, Rowlandson and Gillray, restoring them to their rightful place in the history of art. Although Tate Britain wants to surf the wave of enthusiasm for new British art what it contains is something else entirely. New British art really is new, but I am not sure if it is very British. Hirst did not set out to be the new David Hockney but the new Andy Warhol. This reflected a violent transformation in British life. The factory years, the triumph of the market, the fading of post-war social beliefs - all this made Britain feel like a different place. Damien Hirst's shark and Rachel Whiteread's concrete house do not belong in the same country, let alone the same museum, as Constable's Flatford Mill. Hogarth had an image for it. In Beer Street and Gin Lane he contrasts two societies, one of healthy British quaffing beer, the other of dead drunk gin- sodden collective squalor. The art that dominates Tate Britain conveys the confidence of people who lived on Beer Street. But we live on Gin Lane. Tate Britain is a generous, fascinating museum, but despite its best efforts it cannot bridge the gap between these two worlds. There is young British art here, from Martin Creed's neon over the entrance to Mona Hatoum's solo show, but no real sense that contemporary art has a place in the whole. The only youngsters who look at home are the painters - Chris Ofili, Gary Hume, Fiona Rae. Later this year the first Tate triennial show of New British Art will be held here, and after that the Turner. But none of that stops you feeling this museum is dedicated to the art of another country.",
